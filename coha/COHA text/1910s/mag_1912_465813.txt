THEY were sitting on the veranda of the hotel in the summer afternoon , which was as cool and bright as they could have asked . The titular mountain of the Ponkwasset House lay blue in the middle distance , propped on some lower hills and pillowed against the range of peaks that paled into the horizon behind it . In the foreground stretched the different blue of the water which had been , for a Victorian generation , Lake Ponkwasset , but had now resumed its earlier name of Ponkwasset Pond . Over the face of the water scuttled many motor-boats , bearing groups of laughing and screaming young girls , and battering the air with their unmuffied exhausts , which echoed across the pond into the nearest uplands and clattered against the sides of the veranda . In a new-mown field a team of half-grown boys were shouting and cheering at a game of baseball ; from a tennis-court beside the hotel rose the self-mocking cries of elder youth of both sexes . In front of the hotel ran the ancient post-road , and over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stately five-thousanddollar touring - car of the rich to the rattle - bang second - hand delivery-runabouts of the natives bringing the hotel its supplies from the neighboring village . The house stood on a knoll between two valleys , and as each motor mounted from the hollows , the driver cut out his muffler for speed , and passed with guttering , shuddering , and gasping noises that shattered the air hanging full of the malodorous yellow dust which the landlord 's enterprise in oiling the track failed to hold down . His guests had come out from their endeavors to get naps after the midday dinner , and as they gathered one after another on the wide veranda , and were struck down by the smells and noises into their rocking-chairs , one of the gentler of the ladies timidly ventured to another , " Does n't it seem to you that it 's rather noisy here ' ? I mean for the mountains ? " " Yes , it does , " the other assented . " My husband came up here because he 's had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the surf and the bell-buoy and the fog-horn and the siren at the seaside , but ? " The lady in the rocking-chair beyond the first lady said : " Did you think the junction was quite so near ? We got rooms at the back because I thought my daughter would be quieter there , although I knew we should have the kitchen and pantry under us . But they seemed to be shifting the trains all night ; it was just as if we had the locomotives in the room . Her poor baby never got a wink . " They all lapsed into a hapless silence ; but presently that gentlest one of them noted : " The worst of it is that the people are noisier than they used to be . Their voices are louder and harsher ; they shriek and shout more . Just hear those baseballplayers ! If it were only the voices , " she went on , sadly , but the people in those autos , it seems as if their very looks were making a noise . " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently arrested in their own talk by their interest in hers . But at their stopping she shrank from saying more , and one of the men went on : " Yes , it seems to have produced a type , in wonderful abundance , as if by a sort of intensive culture . We used to have jokes about the bicycle face ; perhaps the automobile face is so awful we ca n't joke about it . " The two were leaning forward and studying the autos that whirred or scuttled by at five-minutely intervals . " It 's extraordinary , " the other said , " how almost instantly the motor habit vulgarizes . Some of those people must be ladies and gentlemen , but they have ceased to look it much sooner than the bicyclers and bicyclesses did , though their decline and fall was rapid enough . The bicycle itself declined and fell as swiftly as the refinement of its riders . The monkey-back and the reversed cap had scarcely come in before the wheel began to go out . You still find it in country-places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's with us in hideous survival as the motorcycle , but the bicycle , the dreadful ' bike ' of other days , whether for tandemriders or built for two ' abreast , is quite archaic now . " " And you do n't think the auto will pass , too ? " " No , the auto is more practicable , with infinitely less exertion ? with none at all , in fact . We Americans do n't like physical exertion . Just watch the people in those autos : male and female loafers in bare heads and poke hats and caps ; they have only to roll into and roll out of the luxurious seats , except when the car does the rolling and gets them under it and mashes them . " " They ca n't all deserve such a fate , " the milder of the talkers suggested . " I do n't say they do . But many of them are outlaws , or law-breakers . Last summer I was driving along the Maine coast , where there are a good many crooks and turns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those machines would dart over a rise of ground or out of a piece of woods and bear down on us without a note of warning . We are bitter on the chauffeurs , in the newspapers , when something happens , but those cars were driven by their owners , or the people who had hired them ; and they could n't have all been ex-convicts , though they ought to have been . Look at that ! " A dusty car came whizzing by , with its muffler open , and young girls and young men lolling at different slants in it ; pennants were fluttering from staffs in front , lettered with the names of the places it had passed through . " Pretty bad , " the milder man owned . " But was the old - fashioned Concord wagon with a cargo of college-yelling collegians any better ? " " It was n't so universal . It did n't infest the whole country . Few could afford it ; but anybody can afford an auto like that , though it costs so much more , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be . " " Yes , where does all the money come from that goes into automobiles ? " " Mostly out of people 's mortgaged houses , I believe . " " Oh , but come ! There are people of refinement who can afford to own cars and drive them . I have seen them , and so have you . We know them . " " I admit that there are exceptional instances . There are motorists who sometimes ask me to drive with them . Whenever I accept , I approve of motoring . But when I am outside of a car I see motoring in its true perspective . " The two men laughed together , and the milder urged , " Well , they are doing a good work in abolishing the horse , with his danger to health and morals . " " Oh , the horse is a beast , and he must go , and his friend the house-fly with him , I hope . The horse has been the cause of more lying and cheating in the human race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whole course of his evolution from the eohippus , been the cause of such wide-spread demoralization as the automobile in the few years of its invention . As to the financial embarrassments and the destruction of values , the race-horse himself ca n't be compared to the motor-car . The savings of a lifetime are wasted in its purchase , and its operation entails wretchedness upon the hapless people who live on the highroads it ravages and on the owners of the summer cottages which will not let within reach of its noise and dust . " The ladies who had been talking ceased , and were leaning in the direction of the speaker , spellbound by the interest of his alarming opinions . The milder man seemed to have some diffidence in suggesting : " I 'm afraid the motor , or auto , or whatever we call it , has come to stay , just like the high cost of living . What you want to do is to regulate it , just like the trusts ? " " Do you think , " the other interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trusts ? " The mild man laughed . " No . What I think is this . We complain of the noise and dust . Well , then , we 've got to have noise and dust reservations , and we 've got ? to prevent the autos from coming into those reservations or going through them by law . " " By law ! We 've laws forbidding a high rate of speed and requiring the use of signals . Are these laws obeyed ? " " This is an age of the world when people want to go fast . The way is to fix an area where they can go fast , and an area where they ca n't go at all . Live in that area and build in it , and your lives will be quiet and your sum-mer cottages will be let . But the auto has come to stay . We must accept the status quo . " " I see that you are a philosopher , " the other said . The ladies contrived the ap-pearance of listening to him rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy self-confidence in continuing : " Well , I agreed with you that the horse most cease to be , with his filth and the house-flies mainly bred of it , and the city dust which it is pulverized into . But the motor , as we have it , ought to go , too . We must have some sort of machine for the work and pleasure which we used to get out of the horse . We did begin in the right way , with electric motors , which were safe , clean , and so simple in use that anybody could manage them . But we went off into steam-motors. and then into these pestilently practicable petrol-motors which now infest the whole world . We must retrace our steps , our missteps ; we must fall up the preci-pice which we have fallen down . We must invoke the help of the Good Genius of the age , and prevail with the benef-icent Edison to invent an electric-motor , so cheap , so safe , so portable , so light and beautiful that when once launched upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phagocytes in our blood devour the germs of disease that lurk in it . " " You 'll never , " the philosopher defied him , " have an electric-motor that will begin to make the speed of the auto-mobiles now in reach of anybody who ? " Could n't afford to keep a horse and buggy in the old days ? Well , I think we do n't want the speed . It 's never safe , either for the people in or out of the motor . And it 's far more depraving than the horse at his worst . The auto does n't result in so much lying and cheating , but it 's far more homicidal . It tempts men if not women to take chances of maiming and killing people , for the sake of getting quickly over the ground , which no humane person will consciously take . " " Do you say that of the automobilists who philosopher invite asyouked. into their cars ? " the phil " Of all . Without knowing it , when the speed habit is once fixed in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed of taking . In the delirium of going-some , as the vulgarer of them phrase it , they become potentially homicidal and suicidal , though I do n't hold those who invite me into their cars so responsible as I do the joy-riders who take out their masters ' cars for a clandestine spin and kill themselves or others . One distinguishes , of course . " " The speed habit has come to stay , " the philosopher remarked . " It 's the spirit of the age . " " No , " the other said , " not every evil that conies , comes to stay , and I deny that the speed habit is the spirit of the age . There may be some excuse of business or duty in the speed of an express train ; but these people who tear through the land at from twenty to fifty miles an hour pretend to be doing it for pleasure in the scenery they ignore and insult . It 's the same as pretending to read a poem in fluttering the leaves of the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures as fast as you can . No , the motor habit is a madness , a disease , a scourge , like the gipsymoth or the brown-tail moth . We must get a parasite which will devour the mania for speed with all its attendant inhumanity . " " Perhaps , " the philosopher suggested , with a smile , " some inoculation of the tsetse-fly virus might do , just enough to induce repose , without going so far as the sleeping-sickness . " " Yes , the tsetse-fly might do , " the moralist allowed . " But it would be better to use some form of serum evolved from the electric-motor . I do n't object to mechanical locomotion . The horse must go , for the reasons we 've all agreed on , but that 's no reason why the speed habit must remain . The law is helpless against it . The process of its extinction must be educational . Some sort of university extension must teach that it is vicious , cruel , and stupid , and finally destructive of civilization . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the moralist. and . as if knowing him by his voice , laid his hand playfully on his shoulder . He looked up and called to the face smiling down into his , " Why , Doctor ! What in the world brings you here ? " The doctor 's smiling face clouded . " I 'm here with Alverly ? to get him away from himself . But I 'm afraid I 've come to the wrong place , " he said , glancing at the roadway where the autos were streaming to and fro . " I 've left him lying down in a room at the back of the house , where he ca n't see them , but as soon as he does we shall have to move on . But where to r The doctor spoke in a low tone , dividing his address between the two friends sitting together . " Do you mean he has n't got the better of it yet ? " the milder man asked . " Has got the worse of it , " the doctor answered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychic intimation and confronted a haggard face that showed itself at the door . Oh , come now , Alverly ! This is n't playing the game . " " Do you call it playing the game to bring me here for those ? " He pointed rigidly at the whirring and whizzing and guttering motors . " I hoped we should n't find so many of them at this elevation , " the doctor coaxed . " But now we must try the sealevel ; we must make a voyage ; we will go to Bermuda or Mount Desert , where these things are not allowed . Go in now , and I 'll get away with you by the next train . " Alverly did not reply ; he saw the two friends , and came out to give a hand to each . " Oh yes ; I know I 'm crazy . But whenever I see one of these infernal machines I see myself in it , and I see the face of that little child before it ; and I see his face change from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran him down and crushed his life out . " He put up his quivering hands to his eyes ; the sensation of his anguish imparted itself to the whole group . The moralist rose from his chair and laid a compassionate hand on Alverly 's arm . " But , my dear . Alverly- , you did everything that a man could do . You took the child up in your own arms and rushed him to the hospital at the highest speed of your car . You 've pensioned his mother , and provided for the schooling and employment of all his brothers and sisters . You 're morbid ! Why , the child died in your arms ! Besides , be had no right to be playing in the crowded street . " Alverly took down his hands and looked his consoler sternly in the face . " I murdered him . He had the right to play in the crowded street that every little one has to play somewhere , and he had no other place . But I bad no more right to drive my car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to drive the locomotive of an express train . Oh ! " He gave a wild cry and ran into the hotel . A magnificent touring-car of the latest type , and large as an old-time railroad coach , swept over the rise of ground south of the hotel , and , plunging into the hollow , swept up again and halted under the hotel porch and came to a noiseless stop . Seven or eight people , powdered to their eyebrows with yellow dust , dismounted and came up the steps , where the landlord bustled forward in welcome , as if he expected them . The party , in spite of their different disguises , revealed themselves ladies and gentlemen in voice and manner . The evident owner of the car took out his watch and showed it to the mild , spectacled old gentleman at his shoulder . " Well , what do you think of that , Dominic ? We made the last fifty miles in one hour and twelve minutes ! Will you ever preach against motoring after this ? " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party shared , " I 'm completely converted . " " And I , " a gentle old lady said , who seemed authorized to speak as the dominie 's wife , " and I never want to go slower after this . " The owner of the car threw back his head in the laugh that all shared again . " Well , landlord , what about that lunch ? " " All ready as soon as you are , sir , " and he named the name of a rich man whose charities cover perhaps a greater multitude of sins then the charities of any other rich man in the world .
