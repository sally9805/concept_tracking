txt I , SpeciaidMarjorie Hamilton , widely known in Chicago and elsewhere as " the beautiful calendar girl . " was exposed today by the post-office department as one of the authors of an obesity cure swindle . As a result of the disclosures Postmaster General ** issued a fraud order shutting off the delivery of letters to Marjorie Hamilton and the Marjorie Hamilton company . This action cuts off Marjorie and her associates from a large aggregation of suckers willing to pay from $1 to $15 for her alleged process of making fat folks thin . A scathing arraignment of Marjorie and of her husband . W. C. Cunningham , who directed the operations of the company , is contained in the report of Assistant Attorney General Lamar recommending the issuance of a fraud order . W. Knox Haines , a Chicago attorney who represented the company , sought to save Marjorie from being deprived of the use of the malls by promising the business would be discontinued , but , as Cunningham is an old offender , the appeal was denied . Shows How Victims Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lamar 's report , " advertises in newspapers and magazines , generally under the name Marjorie Hamilton , to the effect . hat Marjorie Hamilton is a famous photographer 's model who finding that she was taking on weight to such an extent as to render success in her line of work doubtful , set about studying and experimenting to reduce her weight and discovered a system by which she lost thirty-seven pounds in five weeks , and that a book explaining in detail how she accomplished this reduction may be obtained without cost by any one who writes for it . " The book furnished in response to requests so induced does not in fact give away this ' secret , ' but contains additional representations concerning the treatment and elaborates upon those set forth in the advertisements . Follow up letters solicit remittances of from $15 down to $1 for the system of treatment . Victims Demand Money Back . " In the course of the investigation of this business , correspondence was conducted with a number of persons who had used the treatment , and the tabulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows : Replies 1,405 Satisfied 232 Dissatisfied 1,173 " Of those who were dissatisfied 317 asked their money back in accordance with the guarantees made by this company to the effect that if the purchaser is not satisfied his or her money will be returned promptly upon demand . Of these 317 , 2Q2 failed to obtain a refund . Most of these persons asked for the return of their money three or four times and received no answer from the company . So far as the evidence shows the refunds which were made were all made after the Investigation began . " The booklets ' contain a number of alleged photographs of Marjorie Hamilton . several of which show her as she alleges she was before and after she used the treatment which she discovered . Finds Photos Were " Doctored . " " The evidence shows that these pictures are not in fact true likenesses , but were made from photographs altered by an expert ? In the one instance to make her look thinner than she really was and in the other to make her look stouter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific fat reducing treatment in the world ' is the father of W. C. Cunningham .. " As a part of the advertising matter used is a letter addressed to Marjorie Hamilton by ' Mabel Van Meter , ' in which the treatment is highly recommended , and the statement made that ' my abdomen was like a barrel and my hips enormous before taking the Marjorie Hamilton treatment . The investigation disclosed that the writer of this letter was Mrs. Mabel Goodman . the wife of Frank L. Goodman , an employe of the Marjorie Hamilton company . It appears that Mrs. Goodman did , in fact , reduce her weight several pounds , but whether by the use of this treatment or not is not ' clear . No such reduction as that indicated by her letter was accomplished . Marjorie Hardly a Scientist . The evidence shows that all of the representations and pretenses to the effect that Marjorie Hamilton studied and experimented until she found a system of treatment by which she reduced her weight thirty-seven pounds are false . " Not the least interesting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Cunningham 's former husband , in which he states she offered him $100 for an affidavit to the effect that during the time she lived with him her weight varied from a hundred and thirty to a hundred and sixty pounds , and that the last time he saw her she weighed more than a hundred and fifty pounds . Mr. Kerting states he did not accept the offer . " Thebureau pf chemiStiy of the department of agriculture reported that the fat reducing polider : : SOld by ' the ' company " would have no effect whatever in reducing fat , whether employed alone or in combination with the full treatment in question . Its effect would be.merely that of a cleansing wash . The idea " of the use of a bath preparation of thisitind is not new . Alkaline powders have long been used In this way . " Advertising So Confiding ! Excerpts from the advertising of the company follow : " Marjorie Hamilton , known throughout America as the famous calendar girl , is - now recognized as the greatest known expert In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; natural methods , In reducing double chin and excess fat . " Write her at once and learn the anguish she felt when her girlish beauty started to develop to abnormal proportions , Read of the terrors she felt when the monster fat made her realize she must give up her profession and fade into oblivion . I experimented on myself . More than once I was In despair . The task seemed hopeless . At last with patient effort I found what I sought , a method of treatment which took away all superfluous flesh . I used this method of treatment on my face  --  behold , my double chin disappeared as if by magic . I used on my body and reduced as much as I wanted to . I recommended it to my friends . They got astonishing results . " Pity Poor Deserted Wifel Another bit of advertising concerned the fate of " a beautiful girl friend of mine " who after marriage grew stout and then discovered her husband was spending-his evenings with actresses instead of with her , " Not because he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advertising , " but because he had looked for the beauty that had fled , and , failing to find it . he preferred the painted pottery of the streets to the faded bit of Dresden china In his home . " The report says Cunningham served a.term In jail for operating a previous swindle . " Hamilton , " says the report , " is the maiden name of Cunningham 's wife , Mrs. Marjorie Cunningham , and she is the person referred to in the advertising matter as Marjorie Hamilton . She ha:4 had practically no active part in the conduct of this enterprise , which is entirely an of ' mring of Bunning-ham 's fertile brain . All the advertising matter is prepared by him , liels in active charge of the business , and most of the money received by means of the scheme finds its way into his pockets .
