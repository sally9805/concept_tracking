 | TWENTY years ago I cast my vote in favor of the annexation of the Danish islands , and ever since I have been curious to see what it was I voted for . When McKinley was elected he received a cablegram of congratulation signed by sixteen prominent residents of St. Thomas and urging him to carry out the clause in the Republican platform providing for the purchase of the islands . But he was not able to do this nor was Roosevelt in 1902 , for the treaty he negotiated was lost thru the dilatoriness of our Senate . The Great War brought the question again to the front , for Germany is the country chiefly interested in the islands and Germany is preoccupied with more pressing matters at the moment . More than a year ago I heard from what seemed an authoritative source that the Danish West Indies were to be ceded to Great Britain or France in exchange for Schleswig , which was to be taken away from Germany . Our only chance to forestall this infringement of the Monroe Doctrine would be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity , pent for twenty years , could no longer be restrained , so in July , 1915 , I embarked with my son on the " Guiana " for St. Thomas . A few months later Mr. Roosevelt took the same boat . It is not often one has a chance to get ahead of Roosevelt . St. Thomas is next neighbor to our own Porto Rico , within sight of it , in fact . The Quebec line of steamships from New York heads straight for it and reaches it in about five days . By what I thought at first was a rare piece of luck , we happened to come on a holiday , July 14 . The pavilion on the hilltop was gay with flags and paper lanterns and there was a sound of revelry by night . Afterward I found that it would have been more remarkable if I had struck the place when it was not a holiday . For the natives of the Danish islands are excessively patriotic . Apparently they celebrate the national holidays of all countries with complete impartiality : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't adopt them ; the Fourteenth of July because it is celebrated in Martinique , and it would never do to let the French negroes get ahead of them ; the birthday of the King of Denmark because the islands belong to him ; the birthday of the King of England because the islands once belonged to him ; the birthday of the German Emperor in honor of the Hamburg-American line ; and the birthdays of all the royal families , I presume , as wei as many local and impromptu holidays of their own . They also are very scrupulous about observing the Sabbath , at least in its negative aspect . St. Thomas is noted for three things ; its bay , its rum and its bay rum . The bay rum flows hence into every barber shop of the world and there are as many only genuine original makers of it in Charlotte Amalia as there are Farinas in Cologne . The rum is distilled from molasses and consumed locally in large quantities . The bay is a beautiful one , large enough to hold more ships than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane blows in the wrong direction . The bay is almost entirely surrounded by hills close to the water 's edge and in the middle is the city of Charlotte Amalia , banked like Pisa on the tiers of a natural amphitheater , the houses mostly yellow stucco with red tile roofs , set in gardens of tropical trees . The flags of the various consulates were flying from the masts , and as soon as we caught sight of the stars and stripes , above the palms , we made straight for it . Here we found America represented by Mr. C. H. Payne , a colored man from West Virginia , whose efficiency is sufficiently shown by the fact that he has held the post for fifteen years in spite of changes of administration . When he found out what we most wanted to see , the new harbor works , he took us in a carriage around the bay and up a hill upon the further side where we could look down upon the docks which the Danish West India Company is constructing . A new basin has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shallow shores filled in , adding consider- ably to the scanty arable land of the island . The roof was being put on a long warehouse and two big tanks for fuel oil were finished but unfilled . Two traveling cranes ran along the docks , by which coal can be unloaded directly from the ships and stored in heaps . But coaling is still done in the old way , not by steampower but by woman-power . An endless chain of negro women stride up the gangplank each with an eighty pound basket of coal on her head . This is kept up all day long , some two hundred baskets at a penny a piece . " They say the natives are lazy , " remarked the consul drily , " but I do n't call that laziness , exactly . " But the Danish company has so far got nothing out of the million or more it has sunk in the harbor . The Quebec liner does not come up to the new dock but stands out in mid-harbor and sends its freight ashore in lighters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the the Standard Oil Company of America do not use the Danish storage tanks , and yet the Danish Government , anxious to maintain its monopoly , refuses them permission to erect their own . The Hamburg-American company has its own docks on the other side of the harbor from those of the Danish company . We can see two of their big boats , the " Wasgewald " and the " Calabria , " interned , or rather sheltered , like those in New York harbor , while the war shall last . In the afternoon we drove in the opposite direction , a mile or two beyond the town along the shore , until we came upon a man sitting on the grass under a mahogany tree and reading The Independent . That , I thought , was introduction enough ? I stopped the carriage and announced myself as the author of the article he was reading . Under certain circumstances this would have been dangerous , for many a reader has exprest a desire to have " the man that wrote it " within reach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader was not of the sort to take an unpleasant advantage of the unexpected opportunity . He was a kindly man and a Christian , in fact a Moravian missionary , the Rev. A. B. Romig . He displayed the cardinal virtue of hospitality by taking us down to the shore of Nisky Bay and feeding us on unfamiliar fruits . Now , to eat a mango gracefully requires more practise than I have had . Lady Brassey , of the " Sunbeam , " used to say that it had to be eaten in a bathtub . The skin of a mango is thick and seems to be soaked in turpentine . The inside does not taste so bad , something like raw pumpkin but more squashy . The milk of a green coconut is good to wash it down . The Reverend Romig can cut open a coconut with a sharp flint without using language unbecoming to the cloth . I would not have believed it possible but I saw him do it . Then he showed us his church , a big building finished in native mahogany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday . Here , the week before , had been held a service in honor of John Huss , burned at the stake five hundred years before . " The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church , " and never was there a more striking example than this , that here in a world of whose existence he did not dream , a race which he probably had never seen , should gather for worship in the church he founded . On the hill back of the church and manse are the graves of the Moravian missionaries who have lived and labored here . The dates on the cement tombs reach back into the seventeenth century and I read among the birthplaces inscribed upon them the names of Germany , Austria , Greenland , Denmark and Antigua , for these devoted men and women know no barriers of race or climate . St. Thomas is dry territory ? in the climatological not the temperance sense . The tourist who comes to the island expecting to see a jungle of tropical vegetation like the geography pictures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him more of Arizona . There is a fringe of coconut palms along the shore but on the hill slopes are the tree cactus , prickly pear , yucca and century plant common to arid America . There are no rivers for irrigation , or , in fact , any water supply except cisterns . It rains two or three times a day in the summer and it rains hard . The rain comes without warning and pours down savagely for ten minutes and then stops as suddenly as it came . Rainbows are endemic . But I must refer to Kingsley again for a description of a tropical shower : A window in heaven above was suddenly opened ; out of it , without the warning cry of " Gardyloo ! " ? well known in Edinburgh of old ? a bucket of warm water , happily clean , was emptied on each of our heads ; and the next moment it was bright again . The next of the Danish islands that you come to as you go down the Caribbean chain is St. Croix . You may pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croyks , for that is how the natives pronounce it and they ought to know . Or if you stick to the principle of priority of nomenclature you may call it by the name Columbus gave to it in 1493 , Santa Cruz . Columbus by that time realized that he was up against a harder proposition than any man since Adam , for giving names to all these islands was as bad as naming all the animals in creation . So he lumped the little ones all together and  | called them the " Virgin Islands . " There were eleven thousand of the virgin martyrs of Cologne , so he was sure that there would be saints enough to go around . But Santa Cruz he thought big enough to have a name of its own . It is more than . twice the size of St. Thomas , tho that is not saying much , since it is only nineteen miles long and five miles wide . There is no harbor on St. Croix to compare with that of Charlotte Amalia on St. Thomas , or Coral Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So when we wake up the next morning after leaving St. Thomas we find our steamer , the " Guiana , " anchored in the roadstead about a mile off Frederiksted . The cargo , largely kerosene and corn meal , is being taken ashore on lighters and dumped on the open dock in the sun . This lack of a safe harbor hurt the chances of the island for annexation in 1867 , for after the treaty had been ' negotiated Admiral Palmer and the Reverend Charles Hawley were sent on the American frigate " Monongahela " to inspect the islands and confer with the natives as to plans for improvement . But unluckily , at this psychological moment , there came the biggest earthquake that the islands have ever experienced and a tidal wave 60 feet high " landed " the American commission , ship and all , on the shore at Frederiksted . This gave to the opponents of the measures then pending for the purchase of the Danish islands and Alaska a chance to sneer at Secretary Seward for wasting good American dollars in buying " icebergs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been vindicated in both cases , for Alaska is now paying five hundred per cent annually on our investment , and the $7,500,000 which the Senate refused to pay for St. Thomas and St. John in 1867 was a small part of what these two good harbors would have been worth to us in 1898 when we were hunting for Cervera 's fleet without a Caribbean port to serve us as a naval base . St. Croix has the advantage over St. Thomas in possessing more arable and less arid land . From the ship we can see a sugar mill across a level stretch and as soon as we land we walk out to it thru a long avenue of beautiful ceiba trees , the trunks of which are flanked with flying buttresses to support the wide spread of the branches . The plowing is worth seeing . It seems that it takes eight oxen , three negroes and a white overseer on horseback to run one plow and they have to stop for rest in the middle of the furrow at that . The West Indies sugar business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ousted the cane sugar from the English market . But now with the German competition shut off and with the American tariff wall lowering they are prospering once more . Wages in St. Croix have doubled in the last few years . That is to say , workmen used to get fifteen cents a day and now get thirty . But the cost of living has gone up so that even with this munificent wage they are discontented and the young folks of both sexes are flocking to the United States and to Porto Rico and San Domingo since these have come under American control . Our senators may refuse to annex the soil of the Danish islands , but the people are annexing themselves at a rapid rate . Their places are being filled by negroes from the lower islands , largely Barbadians , so there is a constant flow up the chain of the Antilles . This seems to be in accordance with Gresham 's law , for the change of population is not for the better . The natives of the Danish islands are a friendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they talk better English than the natives of the British Islands ? I mean , of course , the British West India islands . The Danish Government has been trying to displace English by Danish as the language of the islands , but the effort has had little effect except to increase the dislike of Danish rule . The language of a people can not be changed by merely requiring the upper grades to study Danish for three hours a week . But many of the natives speak English , Danish and Spanish with a smattering of French , If the Americans take over the islands the first thing to be done will be the starting of some agricultural and trade schools like those in the Philippines and an agricultural experiment station . The Danish Plantation Company has spent large sums in St. Croix , particularly in trying to cultivate cotton , but much of the money was wasted for lack of scientific and practical direction . The Danish islands used to be the favorite resort of American pleasure seekers , but in recent years the Bermudas have taken their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bathing is the finest I have ever had , fine white sandy bottom and water agreeably warmed , better than the Lido on the bar outside Venice . In 1902 , when the purchase of the islands was under consideration , speculators bought up all the land they could get , but lost out on it when the upper house of the Rigsdag defeated the treaty by a tie vote . The renewal of the proposal to purchase has caused a similar boom . It is quite evident that " Barkis is willing . " Financial Minister Brandes at Copenhagen recently received a telegram signed by twenty-one planters of St. Croix saying : " All the planters are highly in favor of a conveyance to the United States . " The Governor of the Danish West Indies telegraphed to the home government that at two meetings called to consider the proposition , including men and women of both races , the vote was 4727 in favor of sale to the United States and only seven against . Since these mass meetings comprized about a sixth of the entire population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment . It will be a great day for the islanders when " Old Dannebrog " is hauled down and " Old Glory " hauled up . Yet they have no hard feelings against Denmark . She has been a well-meaning tho somewhat absent-minded ruler . But geographically , linguistically and economically the islands belong to the United States instead of Denmark . After having seen them I am sure I voted right in 1896.
