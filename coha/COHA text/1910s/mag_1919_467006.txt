DIFFICULTIES in pro nunciation appear very , early in recorded history . We need go less than a dozen chapters beyond the creation to discover that work on the first skyscraper was abruptly abandoned because of differences of pronunciation among the workers . It is some time later , in the period of the Judges , that real acrimony enters into the discussion ? that is , with the episode at the ford of the Jordan which stands as the archetype of all arguments on pronunciation ; which no writer on the subject in the intervening centuries has forborne to mention . Both the confusion and the acrimony of these earlier phases remain in the situation to-day . They remain the same in kind , but mightier in degree . If the master workman for the Tower of Babel could have given his subordinates two words in common , " More mud ! " he might have succeeded . That problem would seem easy to the modern contractor who must talk with Italians , Czechs , Basques , Swedes , Mag-yars Lithuanians , and Poles about donkey-engines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern advocate of a single standard of pronunciation the elemental appeal to the edge of the sword seems a simple but unattainable solution of a sorely complicated problem . The confusion has extended itself through both time and space as records of human speech accumulate and nations branch and part . Habits and manners of speech are here to-day and there to-morrow , and forgotten the day after , till to the baffled historian of language the tracing of them seems like charting the waves of the sea . Good usage of the eighteenth century is the dialect of the nineteenth , and an unknown language to the twentieth . Rhymes of the first quarter of the eighteenth century repreYoi . CXXXII ? No. 829. - 9senting the best usage in pronunciation of London society now smack strongly of the Major Costigans and Micky Frees of Thackeray 's day and Lever 's , so many words passed in that hundred years from the court of Queen Anne to the kitchen of Mary Ann . Of this there is no better illustration than the oftquoted lines of Pope : Where thou , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes tea , Doctor Watts , in the same period , rhymes sea consistently with way and pray ? so consistently that when once he rhymes it with eternity one suspects him of carelessness . He rhymes complete with abate , deceit with hate , seat with great , speak with take , blaspheme with shame and name ? and what more could one ask of Mr. Dooley himself ? He rhymes despair with near and sincere , declare with fear and hear , care with appear , there with severe ; Major Costigan or Peggy O'Dowd could do no less , and not much more . Peggy , for example , speaks of her husband as " the Meejor , " which is what Watts does if he makes despair sound like near . If he makes appear sound like care , so does Peggy speak of her watch as a " repayther . " In his use of another sound Pope is even more Hibernian to the modern ear than his pious contemporary . Pope 's rhymes arc very accurate , and when he writes : Straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band the number of the sacred nine , we know exactly how he pronounced join . But Watts rhymes rejoice , voice , noise , choice , joys , as accurately as a modern rhyming dictionary , and only once in more than two hundred pages of his hymns does one come upon the other sound of oi , joined rhyming with mind , and loin with design . Scott uses this rhyme in " Marmion " as late as 18o8 : Bulwark and bartizan and line , And bastion , tower , and vantage coign . It occurs in German in the same period ( 11hland , 18o9 ) : Das dringt in die Weite Wie Glockengelaute , and is nor unknown even to-day , as in coyote when sounded , kiote , and in cer-tain proper names such as Heublein . So , by the way , does the old pronunciation of sea survive in such proper names as Sayward . And if one tries to find out why Pope and Mr. Dooley , Doctor Watts and Peggy O'Dowd , have so many of the same . idiosyncrasies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne and Mary Ann have the right of it . Take the word tea , for i example ; its history is not simple , but the Oriental word probably sounded much like chay when it and the beverage first appeared in Europe . At the time the Irish were learning English , if they called it tay , they could have made themselves understood to the English , French , Dutch , Germans , Italians , or Spaniards . If they called it chay , it was perhaps what they might have got from Portuguese or Russians , if any ever came near them ? so they could hardly have gone wrong except by sounding it as we do to-day . Words , too , like blaspheme and deceit , that come to us from Latin through French , in which the vowels were respectively i and ei , would to-day sound more like their source words if we pronounced them as did Doctor Watts . Examples could be multiplied almost without number until the list included practically the whole dictionary . Even comparatively recent words have undergone changes within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the comic fabulist ( Guy Wetmore Carry ! ) wrote of the still new word appendicitis ; The fox was one of the Clite Who called it - site instead of - sect . Students in college to-day who were learning to talk not far from the time when these lines were written have never heard any other pronunciation of the word than the one which the fox considered to be the property of the favored few . " What nedeth it to sermon of it more ? " All these are but a few concrete examples of the fact that the language has changed so completely since it appeared in the island of Britain that the earlier stages of it are studied almost as if they were foreign tongues . Open the Oxford Dictionary at random and note how the changes in the appearance of words from age to age suggest the variations in their sounds . The word lodge , for instance , shows , as a substantive , such forms as loge , logge , loghe , luge , loigge , looge , lodge ; as a verb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , luge , louge , ledge , lodg , since the thirteenth century , when it seems to have come into the language ; an older word would show even greater variety . When to these variations we add those of locality , chaos and pandemonium seem insufficient terms for the state of the English language . The printingpresses , telephones , railroads , and automobiles of the twentieth century have dimmed butijnot obliterated the geographical divisions to which our tongues are still loyal . When a Freshman writes , " The organist then rendered the beautiful Starboard Martyr of Rossini , " or , " I ran forehead on the promenadedeck , " no one suspects him of coming from any farther west than an east wind can blow an Atlantic fog . The word girl in seven centuries of literary usage has assumed such forms as gurle , gerle , girle , guide , gierle , gyr11 , garle . We could easily match the list to-day if we attempted to represent what any traveler might hear in the United States ? gal , gal , gist , goil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all these on the tongues of the native-horn , and many others if we try to register the attempts of our unassimilated foreigners . And without adding further to a list of instances which might , by reference to the records of the Dialect Society , or even to the pages of our writers of fiction , be extended indefinitely , we may see in this word alone the confusion into which these divergencies of pronunciation in time and space may throw us . Propound the simplest possible question in pronunciation : " How shall we pronounce girl ? " " Why , " says one , " just as we always have pronounced it ! " Thereupon we open the dictionary and find the first list L cited above . Says another , " Just as everybody pronounces it , " which brings forward the second list . The sum of the two lists represents the sum of the confusion in so far as this particular word is concerned . If we turn to the " authorities " for help , we are likely to be disappointed . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to the practical problems ? Or are they all engaged on the larger strategy , and none detailed to lead the troops ? Indeed , their problem is one of infinite complication ; small wonder that they can not reach agreement . The sounds of language , English or any other , are as nearly infinite in their gradations as are the shades of colors . How shall we detect them ail ? How agree on them ? And how , above all , shall we write them ? Shall we carry out the gradations of vowel sounds to the nth decimal place , to the tenth , or only to the third ? Is there , for example , an intermediate sound of a between arm and at , or is the sound so often heard merely the despicable compromise of men who were horn in the Mississippi Valley and educated at Harvard ? Some " authorities " recognize this vowel and others do not ; of those who do , scarcely two agree on words in which it is to be found . If they agree on half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sample . Has r one sound , two , or none at all ? While laymen argue vigorously on this question , dictionaries ( American ones , at least ) remain conspicuously silent . Their disagreement on general principles is perhaps less confusing , but rather more acrimonious . Here the main argument is between the radicals who welcome change and conservatives who oppose it . The conservatives see in the shifting currents of our speech sure signs of degeneracy and decay . The radicals see in the same phenomena simply the working of natural processes comparable to various processes of change in the physical universe . " Change is bad , " say the conservatives ; " let us have none of it . " " Change is inevitable , " say the radicals ; " let us have as much as we can . " They believe that in language , as elsewhere , " all changes and naught abides " ; that the present state of thelanguage is merely a point in a line , a moment in an ever-moving process , not a halting-place , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Are we , then , to have no standards ? " Thus with one faction throwing bricks due north , and the other throwing them west by a point south , there is much cry and little wool . The advocates of standards say , " We must make laws and enforce them . " They would place themselves in the seats of the mighty and deliver judgments . " There is nothing , " they believe : so certain to make Our weak fellow-mortals their errors forsake As to tell them abruptly , with unchanging front , " You 'll he damned if you do , you 'll be damned if you do n't . " The process is less effective than they wish it were , for to the ears of the vulgar their decrees never come , and many of those within sound of their voices dispute their judgments or deny their authority . On the other hand , it is more effective than their opponents are willing to admit , for many of us mortals are weak enough to waver in every wind . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Teacher says you have to say , ongvelope , " Johnny reports to his parents , and if Teacher does n't know , who does ? We imitate almost unconsciously , and after listening to an-Englishman ( or perhaps a college professor ) , we catch ourselves , or are caught by our friends , in tricks of speech which to our normal habits would he rank affectation . We believe almost anything we see in print . If " the dictionary " says so and so , who will ask what dictionary , or who made it and how ? Even " the newspapers " or " the magazines " are unimpeachable authorities to many of their readers . Here , then , are standards , such as they are ; decrees that are effective , within limits . Can we not have sound standards , and make them broadly effective ? " No , " says the radical ; " pronunciation follows natural laws , and it is useless to try to tamper with them . " He points to Grimm 's Law , Verner 's Law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in Italian , that in French , the other in Spanish . He makes a beautiful tabular view of the seven classes of strong verbs in Gothic , AngloSaxon , and Middle English . The beginner gets the idea that language is a science , and is no more human than mathematics . Before long he finds his mistake . He gets befogged in exceptions , " foreign " words , dialect variations , among which his fixed lights of law and order seem for the time as elusive as the very will-o ' - the- wisp . It is an error to think of phonetic laws , in the scientific sense , as inevitable and inviolable . The law of falling bodies is a law in the sense that , so far as human records go , no falling body has ever succeeded in violating it . There is no law of language that can not be broken and has not been broken , times beyond number . The " laws " of language are merely generalizations that approach sometimes more and sometimes less nearly to universality , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly universal , nor is the study of language truly a science . What we have , then , is laws , such as they are , effective within limits , differing from those which the purists would make and enforce chiefly in that they are not man - made , but " just growed . " Such is the disposition of the forces , The radicals are busy pushing forward the advance ; the conservatives in organizing the positions already won . There is no necessary antagonism , but antagonism there is and will be so long as each party thinks the other is inactive or futilely busy . And while the leaders disagree the rank and file have no assurance that they are on their way , much less that anybody knows where they are going . How shall we decide j which party to join ? We can not follow the leaders unless we can tell which way they are headed , but we can follow their trails back to their last , and perhaps their first and only , point of agreement , and try to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress is necessary . Whether or not the conservatives are on the road of progress we may decide if we can determine whether we could get ahead by adopting and adhering to a standard of pronunciation . Toward an answer to this question theconservatives themselves help us only negatively . They say , " Without standards we dwell in chaos , " and , seemingly , do not ask where we should dwell if we had them . " Shall we , " they ask , " have no standards ? " To which we might answer : " Certainly . The more the better . " If they are before us , they lure us on . If they are behind us , they mark our progress . And sometimes it cheers us on our way to see in the rear a tin standard soldered to a gas-pipe pole fixed in a concrete base , with a group of faithful fossils beckoning us back to rally round it with them . A fixed standard is good only when it is fixed at a set distance in front of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should he at once as free and as fixed as the needle of a compass , and should be valued for its power to show us where we are going , but should not be used to set limit to the advance . Absolute uniformity is impossible so long as we have individuality ; it is undesirable if we wish to have individuality . A single standard in speech would be no more helpful than a single standard in clothes or a single ideal in architecture . Is there any qne type of building , however desirable or practical , which we should care to see supersede at once the pillared mansion of Virginia , the one-chimneyed New England farmhouse , and the Spanish country house ofCalifornia ? Orof speech that would compensate us for the loss of the soft , slow vowels of the South , the twang of New England , and all else that enables us to distinguish Indiana from Arkansas , or Iowa from Louisiana , more surely than does anything we read in the geography ? Shall we give up all the humors of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he demands is unchanging standards and universal conformity , we may be glad that he can not have what he wants . If our language is to be a living language , it must have room to grow . With rigid restrictions round it , it would be like the pine growing in the crevice , which either perishes or splits the rock . Doubtless the conservative would say that he desires nothing so rigid . " I said standards , " he protests , " not a standard . " But those we have already ; they wave at us from every point of the compass . If , then , he goes a step farther and defines his contention as merely for intelligent direction , a view of some goal not necessarily ultimate , and a determination of the road thereto , we may admit at once that he stands for the best sort of progress , and wonder as to the grounds of his quarrel with the radical . The radical leaves us in no sort of doubt as to the nature of his quarrel with the conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " almost everything 's rotten . " What the conservative calls " decay " in language to the radical means progress to something else , just as physical decay means change of form , and he ridicules those in whose nostrils change is offense . He would have us release the brakes and abandon the wheel ; take no thought for either the rate or direction of our motion ? no matter what happens , it is all " perfectly natural . " If it were done , the result would , of course , be the chaos that the conservative so dreads , a working machine reduced to incoherence . The radical sees only the bits , and professes not to care whether they are put together as a machine or scattered about . If there are no restraints and no standards , every man will pronounce as he pleases , and that , says the radical , in no essential differs from the present state . The fact is that some of us please to pronounce like educated men , and some please to pronounce otherwise . Not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like uneducated men . And right here lies at least one barrier between us and complete chaos , of which neither party to the controversy seems to take full account , the social penalty on eccentricity . Conventionality is the only law of pronunciation that has any teeth , and though its influence is , on the surface , reactionary , it does give us a sort of progress . Even conformity is an ideal of a sort , and just as social conformity is brought about by social ambition ? conduct is shaped according as things are or are not done " in the best society " ? so it is usually in matters of speech . A school-boy conforms to the best usage of his kind and talks slang , but he finds that if he wishes to pass into some higher circle he must talk something better than slang . The only law thatcompels him to change is that which gave him his ambition . The only law that compels us to pronounce as others do is that which compels us to take the consequences if we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion with which we regard any one who is not as nearly as possible like every one else . The solid barrier between us and chaos in pronunciation is the fact that the path of conformity is the path of i least resistance , but it is the path of progress only when it is conformity to something just beyond , and is a long way round compared with the short cuts made by vulgar pronunciation . " It is difference of opinion , " says Mark Twain 's profound philosopher ( Pudd'nhead Wilson ) , " that makes horse-races . " It is often differences of pronunciation that make languages , and we may be thankful for the vulgarities of speech that have relieved a continent or two of complete uniformity of language . We think of Latin as a " dead " language , but it is not dead except in the sense that we have a fixed and unalterable portrait of it in one stage of its existence ; it is no more dead than is the child you once were , whose portrait , unchangeable in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its rigid frame . " Vulgar " Latin , the colloquial or spoken Latin which differed from that of Cicero as the speech of our city streets or of our country roads differs from that of Daniel Webster 's orations , changed gradually century by century , till the accumulation of the changes of twenty centuries is the difference between Latin and modern Italian . It was carried into Gaul , where Gallic tongues turned it differently and made it ultimately into modern French ; into Iberia , where changes similar in process but different in direction and effect turned it at last into Spanish . Latin has changed greatly , but it has never died ; it is vigorous in itself and in its descendants . Modem Italian is just as clearly Latin as English is AngloSaxon ; the history is continuous from one to the other . And just as Italian and French come from Latin , so Latin comes from something earlier ; at the beginning of the process we can only guess . Similar is the course of the English language by branching roads that come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on another Saxon . Now in Pudd'nhead Wilson 's thought , we may assume , the value of horseraces was that they relieved the monotony of life , but many groups in modern society have decided that the train of attendant evils is too heavy a price to pay for the relief . Relief from monotony is not necessarily progress , in language or in any other department of life . Uniformity of language , for example , in the Romance countries of Europe , would have many practical advantages that might have made more rapid our progress in science , in commerce , in the arts . Is there any compensating advantage in the course language has followed ? Is the road of our own tongue from its early Germanic form to English the road of progress ? A Danish student ( and friend ) of English , Prof. Otto Jespersen , thinks that it is . In his Progress in Language he has shown to the satisfaction of most of his readers that the " decay " . of inflectional endings , such as has taken place between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it no loss of clearness that need make us regret the change . As one instance he takes up the example cited by some of his predecessors , the shrinkage of the Gothic habaictidema , which , by rolling for centuries on various more or less Germanic tongues , has been worn down to the English had . The tenor of his comment on the process is : The English form is preferable , on the ground that any one who has to choose between walking one mile or four miles will , other thins being equal , prefer the shorter cut . . . If had has suffered from wear and tear in the long course of time , this means that the wear and tear of people now using this form in their speech is less than if they were still cumbered with the old giant habaididema . Indeed , it is not only one Goliath , but fifteen , that this one little word , worn down by centuries in the stream of popular use , has displaced : Had corresponds not only to habaidedema , but unites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , habaidis , habaididu , habaid'iduts , habaididum , habaidi ; - duth , habaididun , habaididjau , habald'e ? deis , habaideldi , habaide'deiwa , habaidedeits , habaid'ideima , habaidedeith , habaidedeina ? separate forms for two or three persons in three numbers in two distinct moods ! Professor Jespersen points out further that our system of pronouns and auxiliaries which express the shades of meanings carried by the old cumbersome forms is much simpler than the old system of inflectional endings . The personal pronouns are the same for all tenses and moods , but the endings are not . Secondly , the possession of endings does not exempt the Goths from having separate personal pronouns ; and whenever these are used , the personal endings which indicate persons are superfluous . They are no Less superfluous in those extremely numerous cases in which the subject is separately expressed by a noun or is understood from the preceding proposition . So that , altogether , the numerous endings of the older languages must be considered uneconomical . The change means also , as he shows us , a gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the Roman , with the word cantaverarn , express the difference between " I had sung " and " I had sung " ? And if he wished to emphasize the I , he must add ego . " Note also the conciseness , " Professor Jespersen continues , " of such answers as , ' Who had sung ? ' I had . ' ' What have you done ? ' ' Sung ! " . It seems demon-strable that the simplification does not mean loss of power , any more than would the use of a small engine to do the work of fifteen yoke of oxen . Now , " mispronunciation " does not account for the whole of this change , nor do we , when we so name a part of it , understand the whole complicated interplay of tendencies and forces which make vulgar mispronunciation an effective power in the formation of language . But even the briefest historical perspective will show us that it is a force too important to be dismissed as mere " vulgarity , " too strong to be dammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who quotes the dictionary-maker as an authority seldom realizes that he has spent a lifetime solemnly studying the same sort of vulgarity in past ages that she is sternly repressing in the present . Phonetic " laws " work as well to-day as they ever did , and if the philologists of the thirtieth century find no traces of us but Emerson 's Essays and a Farmers ' Almanac , they will be able to tell as much about our English as we know about Gothic from Ulfilas 's translation of the Scriptures and a fragment of a Gothic calendar . Just as to-day we frown upon gon na and got ta for going to and got to , so doubtless did our forefathers frown on the slipshod speech that joined be and titan into butan , prefixed on and shortened it to abutan , then to abute ( three syllables ) , and at last to about . If got ta for must and gon na for going to prove useful auxiliaries , vulgar pronunciation will have shown us helpful short cuts in speech . But the question whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer . The temptation is to infer that a pronunciation must have survived because it was advantageous , even if it is not easy to see the advantage . Punkin is easier to say than pumpkin or even punikin ; sparrowgrass is perhaps easier than asparagus . If they oust the orthodox forms it will not be surprising . But why do we prefer cucumber to the earlier , now despised , cowcumber ? And why have we changed the sounds of most of our vowels in the last five centuries ? It might be possible to find a physiological reason , but no logical one is apparent . If this were the whole story , our course would be plain before us . We should acknowledge that the extreme radicals were right , that vulgar pronunciation makes automatically for progress , and we should have only to pronounce as vulgarly as possible in order to get ahead with all possible speed . But it is not the whole story . Popular tendencies in pronunciation are not the only forces at work ? to assume that the best progress could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like removing the escapement mechanism of a watch in order that the mainspring might do its work unhindered . And the mainspring and escapement are not all . Not only are there other agencies than the popular tongue for licking pronunciation into shape , but also other forces than pronunciation at work shaping language . There are doubtless forces and tendencies that we do not so much as know of ; of those we know , we understand some better than others . But we may for the moment , with the understanding that it is not the whole machine , look at the mainspring and escapement ( vulgar pronunciation and one of its restraints ) to see how they work together . What we see is individual and group variations in speech giving us ceaseless experiment in sound and form . These are firmly and persistently opposed by various social forces . Freest in their unconscious experimentation are the unlettered folk , who seek short cuts in speech regardless of consequences . Firmest in opposition are the educated , who consciously or unconsciously fear that the breaking down of established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have no fine shades of meaning to express , are willing to reduce their speech to very low terms . The man with the hoe has thoughts as dull as his implement ; a few blunt words suffice for them . As for his feelings , they may have subtle shades , but we should not expect him , if , for example , he were afflicted with melancholia , to care to tell us whether it were " a grief without a pang , void , dark , and drear , " or whether it were such that he would fain " lie down like a tired child , and weep away a life of care . " But to Coleridge and Shelley , doubtless to Edwin Markham , the English language is none too subtle for the delicate shades of thought and feeling they have to express . So we may imagine the poets and philosophers of the ages between Ulfilas and King Alfred opposing the gradual change from habaidZ'dema to had , or fighting step by step the whole attack of slovenly pronunciation on inflectional endings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure from those to whom simplification seems to impair efficiency . Their opposition should be vigorous and protracted , for it is perhaps our best assurance that the changes which become permanent mean progress . The fact that vulgar pronunciation has helped language does not mean that it is to be practised always and by all ; that its influence , if unrestrained , would be for good ; that it should even be encouraged . It does represent decay , and if left to itself would corrupt the whole . In combination with other influences it is helpful , for it decays the surface enough to make it workable by the constructive forces ; but these forces must not relax ; it must be met always by vigorous opposition . When we have gone so far as this , when we have found a position from which we can see at once two of the many sides of the problem , we wonder what can be done toward solving it . Grant Professor Jespersen 's theory of progress in language ; how far may it be a conscious process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first we might be inclined to give over in despair . The forces at work are so many and so complicated ? many must be hidden , how many we do not know ? that we feel we might as well try to direct the stars in their courses . But such a situation has never yet withheld the human mind from persistent attempt at solution of any problem it really wished to solve . One by one we learn the secrets of the physical world , and how far we can control it , and how far we must adapt ourselves to it . In language there must be far more of control than adaptation , if once we could see the problem steadily and see it whole . Unruly member though the tongue may be , we may imagine it to be easier to harness than the lightnings if we have the collective will to do it and set our science to work on the problem .

If we were to collect from the living tongues of our own people the data in regard to the language of today that philologists would give their eye-teeth for in regard to past stages , then we might be in a position to study the problem till we understand it .

Our hope is in the amount of this work that is under way in the hands of dictionary-makers , the American Dialect Society , and others , including many individual workers .

But we are at work on the problem , and some day we shall have it before us ; then we may be able to solve it ? if we care enough .
