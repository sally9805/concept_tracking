 |p491  I WAS keenly interested in silver fox farming , and when an invitation came to visit friends in Canada I was delighted , not only at the prospect of seeing our friends , but also at the prospect of seeing a silver fox farm . The history of silver fox farming reads like a bit of fiction . About fifty years ago some far-seeing Canadians determined to domesticate that shy wild thing known as the common red fox and to endeavor to breed from it a black or silver variety . They had some foundation upon which to build their hopes , and that was the fact that occasionally a litter of red pups contained a black or silver pup . They believed that if they succeeded in breeding a black or silver variety their fortunes would be made ; and , indeed , they were right , for black and silver fox skins were considered one of the most precious of furs , and brought fabulous prices in the market . For twenty years these plucky pioneer.fox farmers continued to experiment , never losing faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . It was a huge joke , this trying to raise foxes . The wild things would pine away and die if you even attempted to cage them . That was public opinion , and public opinion was wrong . The difficulty , however , was not in keeping the foxes alive in captivity but in rearing the young . Litter after litter of lively , robust pups were born ; but they always died . Why they died was a mystery . Finally the day came when the mystery was solved . It seems that the fox is monogamous by nature , and the pioneer fox farmer , ignorant of this fact , had housed more than one pair in a pen . The result was a tragedy . The pups did not die a natural death ; they were killed by their parents . Just as soon as the farmers recognized the monogamous nature of the animals , and separated the foxes , allowing each pair to occupy a pen by themselves , they had no trouble in rearing the pups . After they learned the secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years ago a live silver fox 1 in captivity was a thing unheard of ; yet the Canadians succeeded in getting one and mating it with a red fox . The result of this mating was a litter of red pups with clark markings , or patch foxes , as they are called . This seemed encouraging , so when the pups grew up they mated one of the patches with the silver fox , and the astonishing result of this mating was a litter containing fifty per cent pure red pups and fifty per cent pure silver pups . The next successful experiment was mating two silver foxes . This time the result was a crowning achievement ? all the pups were pure silver . Many times they tried mating silver foxes , and always the entire litter contained pure silver pups . There was no doubt about it , they had succeeded in breeding a silver variety . It was not until 1900 , when the Canadians sold for the sum of $1,800 a fine specimen of a silver fox pelt that had been  |p492  page deleted  |p493  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that fox farming was not only possible but well worth while . Men who had ridiculed or had been indifferent now became eager to have a hand in so lucrative a business . Many rushed headlong into it . some even mortgaging their homes for the price of a pair of foxes . The demand for silver breeders became so great that the market price . so the Canadian Government report states , jumped from $1,000 to $2,000 a pair ; then to 53.300 ; and finally above $20,000 . Such extravagant prices practically took fox farming out of the hands of individuals . Soon companies were organized . stock sold , and the new industry began to develop by leaps and bounds and continued to do so until the war broke out in Europe . We had been in Canada ten whole days and had not been able to get a peep inside of a fox farm . Fox farmers , it appears , do not desire visitors . They claim that the animals are of such a nervous temperament that they become easily alarmed , and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to feel anxious . We had only four more days in Canada , and , so far as I could judge , there was no chance of our seeing a real live silver fox . I had heard them described so many times that I wanted to see for myself if they were so beautiful , if the black hair was really a lustrous blue-black , and if the white hairs were really silver white and not just dull white . " I do n't believe we 're going to see any sliver foxes . after all , " I complained to my husband . Just then our friend appeared , radiant with good news . ' ? What do you say to a trip out to the big fox farm this morning ? " In a few moments we were off , actually on our way to the fox farm . In a few minutes more we were there . The car stopped before what seemed to be a grove of trees surrounded by a high board fence . A very forbidding-looking fence it was , so high that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compactly built that there were no cracks between the boards through which we might peep . " This is the place , " said our friend , as he announced our arrival by the loud honking of the horn . The manager , a courteous gentleman , welcomed us warmly , and volunteered to show us about the farm . As we entered the big door in the wooden fence we came face to face with another fence of galvanized wire . Through the wire mesh we could see that the farm was divided into pens about twenty by fifty feet , each of which contained an attractive wooden kennel , and was inclosed by a high fence of wire . It was a curious sight : twenty , more or less , kennels built like miniature houses , and a maze of wire fencing . But where were the foxes ? Not one in sight , and not a sound could be heard . Our guide led us down a sort of corridor with wire fences looming up on both sides . At the end we turned abruptly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated on the top of his kennel . He was superb ! Now I knew that the beauty of the silver fox had not been exaggerated . His coat was a lustrous blue-black , and the white hairs intermingled with the black were really silver white . Farther on we came to a pen in which there were several half-grown patch foxes . They were playing with each other like a lot of puppies , but the grace of their movements is quite beyond description . The instant they saw us they took alarm and made a dash for their kennels . Our guide allowed us to enter their pen ; and when we made so bold as to peep into the side window of the kennel queer little dog-like growls protested against such familiarity . In talking with our guide we learned that foxes thrive on almost any kind of food , provided it is not frozen . Frozen meat , he told us , always makes them ill , and sometimes proves fatal to them . January is the mating season ; and , according to our guide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young are expected , is a pretty anxious time for the fox farmer . No strangers at this time are allowed inside the farm ; no unnecessary noises are permitted . nothing that might alarm the foxes . It seems that they are highly excitable during these months , and if anything occurs to frighten them it might mean the loss of the entire litter . A story is told of a good-natured farmer who had n't the courage to turn away some visitors who came shortly after a litter of pups were born . The mother fox , hearing strange voices , became alarmed , and , wishing to hide her pups , dug a hole in the ground and buried them . When what she had done was discovered , the pups were dead . Good things never come singly . That was  |p494  the way it was with invitations to visit fox farms . It had been hard work to get the first one , but others followed without the asking , and not only invitations to fox farms , but to fur farms of every kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salsbury . It was especially interesting because the young man who kept this farm sold only tame animals for breeding purposes . He claimed that a tame fox would not frighten easily , and so the danger of her killing her pups would be greatly lessened . The farm was situated close to the railway track . No wooden fence protected it from the public , and no trees sheltered it from the sun . The wire fences were makeshift affairs , and the kennels were nothing but packingboxes . But the farmer , a mere lad , understood his business . He did n't have the means to do things in the most approved fashion , but he knew how to raise foxes , and he knew how to tame them . His foxes did not take alarm and bolt for their kennels the minute we appeared . They gave us one look and then paid no more attention to us . There was one particularly tame fox that was such a pet that when his keeper entered the pen he frolicked with him , chasing him round and round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me pat him , do you think ? " I asked , doubtfully . " Sure ; he 's not afraid of anybody . " I ventured into the pen , and , kneeling down , held out my hand coaxingly . The fox trotted up to me , sniffed at me inquiringly , then licked my hand in the most friendly fashion . It is not the proverbial fish story that one hears in Canada , it is a fox story . And , let me tell you , some of these stories are well worth hearing . They are truly marvels of the imagination , full of local color and utterly incredible . The tendency to exaggerate is so common among the fox farmers , and the facts concerning fox farming are so amazing , almost past belief , that it is difficult sometimes to detect which is fact and which is fancy . There is no doubt about one fact , however , and that is that silver fox farming has been a real triumph in Canadian industrial life .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
