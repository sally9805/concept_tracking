Amundsen himself states that he wishes this narrative to be published only in the newspapers which , by purchasing his first narrative , have helped to reimburse him . it is pathetically pointed out by Nansen , elsewhere in this morning 's Times , that Amundsen set out on his expedition burdened with debt ; and it is understood that he mortgaged all he possessed to secure the necessary equipment . It is therefore the purpose of The New York Times to prevent as far as possible the loss to Capt . Amundsen of the just reward of his achievement . Copyright , 1912 , by The New York Ti trigs Co . ( All Rights Reserved . ) Special Cable to THE NEIV YORK TIMES HOBART , Sunday , March 10 . ? Capt . Roald Amundsen received me to-day , and not only materially added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the south pole , but also discussed the question of whether it is likely that he was preceded by his English rival , ' Capt . Scott . He said : " I saw no traces whatever ' showing that Capt . Scott had been at the pole , but it is possible that he had been there and had left some unsubstantial memorial which had afterward been destroyed by the storms . " The chances , however , are heavily against this theory , for during the three days that I was there the weather was calm and I still , and I think that is the prevalent condition . There was nothing but the vast level plains of snow , and hence there was no possibility of erecting a permanent cairn of stones . " The season was very favorable , and therefore it is exceedingly likely that Capt . Scott did reach the polelater , if not sooner , than myself : 1 most sincerely hope he did arrive there , for he well deserves success . How the Dash Was Made . " On my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At ' first the expedition daily traveled fifteen miles in five hours , then spent two hours eating and in feeding the dogs , and then we attempted to spend the other seventeen hours in sleep . This period of rest was found to be too long both for the men and dogs , and a new plan was tried . This was to march fifteen miles in about six hours , spend two hours eating and attending to the dogs , sleep six hours , and then breakfast and march again . This accounts for the remarkable speed of over twenty miles a day attained on the return journey . Had Difficulty in Breathing . " The greatest difficulties of the expedition were caused by the *heights encountered . During the latter part of the journey to the pole we spent nearly six weeks at great elevations , which sometimes reached 16,750 feet . This may be an error in cabling , as Capt . self is at an elevation of 10,500 feet . When we were working hard , great difficulty was experienced in breathing at these heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With regard to food , we had full rations all the way , but in that climate full rations ate a very different thing to having as much as a man can eat . There seems little limit to one 's eating powers when doing a hard sledging jourrney . ' However , on the return journey we had not merely full rations , but as mush as we couldeat from the depots after passing 86 degrees . Eating Dog Meat No Hardship . " The first dogs were eaten on the journey to the pole in 85rA degrees , when twenty-four were killed . In spite of the fact that they had not always been able to obtain full meals , the dogs were fat and proved most delicious eating . It is anything but a real hardship to eat dog flesh . " Two skua gulls were seen at 8 4 TA degrees . A small cairn had previously been erected as a mark to guide us on our return , and just when he had left this the gulls came flying past and alighted on the cairn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted the party at 83 degrees . We had killed a female dog at 82/ degrees , and the dogs went back , searching for her . This caused us great anxiety , for it was feared that the dogs would pillage the depots 011 which the party depended . When we returned to 83 degrees , after being at the pole , we saw fresh dog tracks around the large snow cairn used as a depot there . Curiously enough , the pemmican in the depot was untouched . " Traces of the dogs were followed to 82 ' . : degrees , where the female dog had been killed . They had found the body , which was placed on the top of a heap of snow as a food reserve for the party , and , having eaten it , the dogs had gone to the depot at 82 degrees , where a large number of cases were piled up . They had got at one of the cases of pemmican and had not only eaten that , but had also eaten the leath-1 er straps and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we had killed and left for food at this depot . " Eleven dogs survived the whole journey and safely reached the Fram . Christmas Dinner Near the Pole . " 1 and my four companions on the pole party kept the Christmas festival in the high mountains , not a great distance from the pole . The feast consisted of an , extra ' allowance of biscuits cooked in al porridge , . a poor substitute for the abundance of the Norwegian Christmas , but we enjoyed it heartily . " On the return journey we had not a single day 's rest . We did not even rest on Christmas Day , . but passed on , day after day , through all weathers . There was little that was adventurous about the - tri- p , but it vas very hard work . " I attribute my success to my splendid comrades and to the magnificent work of the dogs , and next to them to our skis . " The splendid condition of the dogs on landing in the antarctic was due mainly to the precautions taken on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good health while crossing the tropics a special double-deck planking had been fixed above the deck of the Fram with a space several inches deep left for the circulation of fresh air . This device was constructed before leaving Norway , and in the hot weather sails stretched above kept the dogs always in the shade . As a result , little trouble was experi. enced with the dogs , which Ian ? ed fit for work . Kept Fat on Polar Dash . " Of real hardships in the way of food on the pole journey there were none . Rather the reverse ; for when my companions reached the ship they were almost fat , and could not eat as much as when they started . The dogs , too , were fat , and that they had lived well during the last part of ' the journey , was shown by the fact ' that they would hardly touch . the seal mea.11. which was lying in large quantities about the base of the camp . " Washing was a luxury never indulged in on the journey ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be kept short to prevent ice accumulating from one ' ? breath , a beard-cutting machine which we had taken along proved invaluable . " Another article taken was a tooth extractor , and this also proved valuable , for one man had a tooth which became so bad that it was absolutely essential that it should be pulled out , and this could hardly have been done without a proper instrument . " The party which explored King Edward VII . Land reports seeing a bird of a new species . They are certain of that , as they got close to it and saw it distinctly . Protecting His Narrative . " I am gratified to learn that the steps taken to prevent the results of the expedition prema. turely leaking out proved success . ful , and that The New York Times was the first to publish the news in America . " The method adopted here wag , simple . Nobody was allowed on board the ship , and no member of the expedition other than myself was allowed to go ashore . All necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " I arrived Thursday and sent you a brief cablegram announcing my success , and on Friday dispatched a long account of my . journey to the pole and the discoveries we had made . " From all over the world telegrams had been pouring into Hobart , chiefly from newspapers in England and America , begging for messages from me . I had arranged that The London Chronicle , The New York Times , and their associates should have the story exclusively , and that promise I have been glad to fulfill . Will Now Seek the Arctic . " I have been most gratified today to receive hearty congratulations from King George . " Before sailing to Buenos Aires I have arranged to go on a month 's lecturing tour in Australia . From Buenos Aires I intend to make my way to the arctic via Bering Strait , thus carrying out my original programme More than too telegrartis of congratulation were received at Hobart yesterday by Capt . Amundsen , fifty being delivered to him in one bundle .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
