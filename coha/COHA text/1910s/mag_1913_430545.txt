 | ALMOST every important European city has its Old Town and its New Town , each expressing the cultural ideas of its period in the character of its architecture and its streets . In their time the width of a saddle-horse , of a Sedan chair , and of a coach have determined the width of the thoroughfares of the Old Town , and the traffic in the thoroughfares in turn determined the sizes of shops , inns , and other quasi-public buildings . So , too , the width of the tramcar has resulted in giving us the broader avenues of the New Town , and the increased carrying capacity of the tram-car has , in turn , so increased the width of streets that buildings were designed with accommodations far more ample than those of the corresponding structures of the Old Town . If evolution in transportation is thus accompanied by a corresponding evolution in municipalities , what may we expect when aircraft have been so far perfected that air journeys may be undertaken as safely as automobile tours and railway excursions ? HOW THE LIMITATIONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like any soaring bird of prey in this : It can not leap into the air straight from the ground . A in motion . In other words , he must run along the ground at constantly increasing speed until the pressure of the air beneath his wings becomes great enough to support him . He is in no better position than a boy 's kite , which can be raised on a calm day only by much assiduous running against the breeze . Consider the aeroplane as a motor-driven kite , in which the pull or the thrust of a screw takes the place of the string , or consider it as a mechanical vulture , and it becomes apparent that it can not leap straight up into the air , that it must first be propelled along the ground at automobile speed . Add to the necessity of acquiring rapid preliminary motion not only the disadvantage of size ? most flying-machines have a spread of about thirty to forty feet ? but also the enormous difficulty of rising above tall buildings in the teeth of the inevitable eddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them , would seem fearfully like the torrents that boil and rage in the Whirlpool Rapids of Niagara , and even the man who has never ridden on the atmosphere , and who has only a vague notion of the incessant vigilance and the acrobatic skill required to keep a machine on an even keel , will realize that muncipalities must adapt themselves to the limitations of the aeroplane , if we are to fly from the heart of one city to that of another . Even were it possible to utilize the broadest avenues , the hurricane set up by a propeller that whirls around at a speed of twelve hundred revolutions a minute , so that it seems like a solid glittering disk , would be intolerable . You ask , Why not turn to the lawns of our public parks ? Because the few green open spaces provided for a population of a million or more , even if they could be encroached upon without encountering stubborn resistance , would be neither numerous nor large enough to meet the requirements of hundreds of aviators waiting for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wide circles , ready to snatch the first chance to alight . If streets can not be used because the aviator may be buffeted by treacherous currents against stone walls , and if park lawns are too few , obviously only the roof is left . Housetops , then , must be adapted to the needs of aerial navigation . That end will be achieved far more easily than may be supposed . STARTING AND ALIGHTING ROOFS FOR AEROPLANES In the first place , the chasms that separate buildings on the opposite sides of streets and yards will be bridged by gratings , which will cut off but little light and air ; and , in the second place , the chimney-pots and ventilating-pipes that now adorn housetops , designed before the aeroplane arrived , will be surmounted by wooden platforms , each carried on a light steel framework . New buildings will be constructed to meet the special requirements of the aviator . In the metropolis of the future , therefore , those quarters in which structures are of approximately equal height  | will be covered by single roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Equally simple of solution is the problem of housing the thousands of flying-machines that will throng the air . Some of the manyfloored automobile garages of the present city could be employed for the storing of flying-machines . If a military machine of our own day can be taken apart and packed in a motor van in less than ten minutes , no remarkable prophetic gift is required to forese a machine which , when collapsed , will occupy less room than a seven-passenger touring car of 1913 , and which can be lifted to the roof by an elevator of the type now to be found in every city garage . FLORIDA BECOMES A WINTER CONEY ISLAND FOR THE CITY OF NEW YORK The railway created the modern suburb ? made it a residential part of the city on the outskirts of which it is built . Similarly , the flying-machine will bring the city and country measurably nearer each other . Let us not forget that even in our own time , with machines that will seem childishly crude a century hence , speeds of more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too daring to predict that farm-houses will become suburban cottages ; that the scattered population of rural districts will become direct customers of the city merchant ; that the lecturer , the virtuoso , the lawyer , the banker , will all be able to increase their clientele . Because of its great speed and its radius of action , the future aeroplane will be able to cover the distance between New York and Chicago in a few hours . It is not inconceivable that a man may breakfast in New York or London and dine the same evening in St. Louis or Rome . The inhabitants of towns far inland will spend their summer holidays at the seashore . Florida will become a kind of winter Coney Island for New York . When the age of the aeroplane and the air-ship really comes , new political problems will arise . What , for example , will become of our present tariff laws ? Can we prevent smuggling in a machine that travels in three dimensions ? When Selmet flew from London to Paris , some months ago , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sea of mist with no sign of a spire or roof . When he landed at Issy-les-Moulineaux , on the outskirts of the city , he had to explain at length who he was . Even in this twentieth century , when flying-machines are still novelties , he was mistaken for the pilot of an ordinary school aeroplane returning from a short outing . En route he had made two landings . No one had noticed them . Nor was his course through the air more narrowly observed , simply because he was hidden by clouds . When the atmosphere becomes in truth a highway , and the whirring of an aeroplane 's propellers as common as the chugging of an automobile motor , will it be possible to prevent the smuggling of jewels , laces , and silks , and those smaller , easily carried articles of luxury , now subject to an import tax by many countries ? Or will it be possible , by policing the atmosphere above the border line , to prevent violation of the customs laws ? POLICING THE AIR Policing of some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded from the eyes of the military spy . It is not likely that the long line of fortresses on either side of the boundary that separates France from Germany may be sailed over without calling forth a warning signal from a sentinel wheeling with clock-like regularity over that region , which a hostile eye may not study . Over cities , too , the aerial sentry or policeman will be found . A thousand aeroplanes flying to the opera must be kept in line and each allowed to alight upon the roof of the auditorium in its proper turn . In giant circles you can imagine them soaring in a huge flock . Signals will be made by a policeman in a swift monoplane ( on his arm he wears the orange wings of the aerial traffic squad ) , and one by one the machines of the boxholders will separate from the great spinning cluster and glide down . A liveried attendant will assist the passengers as they clamber out . So every hotel , office building , and drygoods store must see to it that its roof is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxicabs and private machines . If a faulty motor compels an immediate descent , an emergency signal will be given ; by day , a rocket that leaves a trail of black smoke ; by night , a flash of light conspicuous in color . How can the man in the air pick out the roof for which he is bound ? A dozen ways of disentangling roof from roof immediately suggest themselves . Colors and numbers  | will probably be employed in some distinctive way , and perhaps painted geometrical designs ( squares , circles , and triangles ) will serve to distinguish public aerial garages , hotels , and theaters from one another . The elevator platforms on which machines will be lifted will surely be painted a vivid color , contrasting with that of the roof itself , and an attendant will be constantly on duty to signal to those in the air when they may descend and use the elevator . Quick to awaken to the possibilities of the roof will be the advertiser . He will plaster it , whenever he can do so without misleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues of his pills and soaps , his breakfast foods and his safety razors . The signs which now flank every railway , and which inform the passenger that the particular marsh at which he is languidly gazing is " ten miles from Bloomer 's Emporium , " will find their counterparts in huge advertisements that lie flat on their backs and stare up at the population of the atmosphere . In their horizontal position they will be as useful as the vertical sign erected for the benefit of the railway traveler , for they , too , will indicate the proximity of a town , and serve as guideposts for the aerial navigator . GUIDING THE MAN WHO SAILS THE ATMOSPHERE Indeed , the guiding of the airman will become so highly important that governments will set about the task of mapping the ocean of air as carefully as ever the waters about a rocky coast have been charted . With the aid of a compass and an official map ( a band , perhaps a hundred feet long , which can be unrolled from one cylinder upon another beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate the position of church spires , telegraph and telephone wires , forests , railways , and tall factory chimneys ) the aerial navigator will pick his way through the blue . But suppose that it is night , or that a dense fog veils the terrain below ? Is he helpless ? Not when a really efficient set of wireless instruments has been invented for the use of aviators . He will clap his wireless receiver to his head and listen for the guiding signals of the nearest government transmitter of aerial waves . Every little village will have its wireless station , electrically controlled from a central weather bureau or geographical office hundreds of miles away . Only in the droning central station will operators be found , for automatic instruments will send out the signals from the smaller stations , instruments that are mechanically or electrically controlled , just as United States Naval Observatory time is now transmitted from a master clock to hundreds of timepieces . All this applies to the air-ship as well as to the flying-machine . For , although the giant Zeppelins of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supposed that the aeroplane will completely displace the dirigible . Count von Zeppelin 's leviathans have come to grief , not in the air , but when anchored near the ground in a gale . A stranded schooner , battered by huge waves against a reef , is in a predicament only a shade worse than that of a Zeppelin anchored in a hurricane . The Zeppelin is not simply hammered and twisted , but is also exposed to the dangers of static electricity generated by friction . A single electric spark has been known to ignite the highly explosive buoyant gas with which the envelope compartments of a Zeppelin are filled , and to reduce a vessel costing one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to a chaos of twisted metal . TETHERING THE GIANT DIRIGIBLE OF THE FUTURE To guard against such accidents , steel towers have been latterly proposed ( a small one has even been erected in England ) , from the tops of which the ships may swing with the wind like so many weather-vanes . High above the roofs of the future city , higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these towers are destined to loom ? Eiffel towers padded at the top to prevent injury to the ships in possible collisions . They will not be erected haphazard , with no regard to their location in the city , but , lest they interfere with aerial traffic , they will fringe the city like the steamship wharves of the present . In your mind 's eye ca n't you see the elevators conveying passengers upward through the maze of steel girders to the great ships tethered above , casting enormously long shadows on the roofs and streets below ? Ca n't you see a transatlantic air-liner starting on its voyage simply by floating off with the wind or by backing off with reversed propellers ? Ca n't you see another approaching a tower very closely against the wind ? Ca n't you see the first thin rope cast from the ship uncoiling like a long serpent ? Ca n't you  | see the hawser tied to that rope hauled in ? Ca n't you hear the gong that tells the engineer to reverse his propellers , so that the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mooring of a future air-liner will be fully as impressive , fully as spectacular , fully as ceremonious as the mooring of a Lusitania . It will even be exciting in a gale ; for , if the wind is blowing with a velocity greater than the maximum speed of the ship , it is not difficult to imagine the captain approaching the tower stern first on the windward side , slowly drifting back with the gale , against which he is running with the propellers revolving at full speed . As they disembark the passengers will all pass up into the tapering nose of the envelope , out through a door , and step upon a platform which swings with the ship in the wind . All the experience of the present justifies the assumption that both aeroplanes and airships will cleave the air . How big will they be ? To the size of the air-ship there is no theoretical limit . Indeed , the bigger it is the more economically can it be operated . If there were any good reason for doing so , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count von Zeppelin could no doubt design a dirigible longer than any transatlantic liner , and drive it from Sicily to Liverpool and back on a schedule that could be maintained with fair regularity , even with the imperfect meteorological data at present supplied by weather bureaus . But the aeroplane , on the other hand , is not capable of unlimited magnification . It is not likely that it will ever carry more than five or seven passengers . High-speed monoplanes will carry even less . Compared with them biplanes and triplanes ? both good weight lifters and carriers ? will seem as lumberingly slow as a sightseeing automobile . AIRCRAFT IN THE WAR OF THE FUTURE Long before these changes will be effected , aircraft will so far have changed our methods of fighting that an entirely new science of warfare will have been created . In less than half a century combats will be fought in three dimensions instead of in two . The experience gained in the great European military maneuvers and in the Tripolitan campaign clearly indicates that . Above all , a new system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French army , an officer who has had much practical experience , maintains that an enemy can no longer conceal his movements . He will be compelled to move . Forced marches , in Bellenger 's opinion , will become the rule ? dense masses of troops hurrying on almost blindly in order to escape the attack that must inevitably follow detection by a watchful eye in the air . In forced marches Bellenger sees the salvation of many a future army corps . All this assumes inactivity on the part of the aircraft . Have we any reason to suppose that a brigade can escape destruction merely by . a forced march ? Suppose that a great air-ship , plunging through the air at expresstrain speed at a low elevation above the long , writhing , sweating , toiling serpent of men , necessarily marching in close formation ? suppose that an air-ship should drop two hundred bombs , one bomb every hundred yards . Who can describe the frightful panic that would ensue ? The attack has come so swiftly that there has been no time to prepare for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one will notice the bombs until their awful explosions reveal the true purpose of the aerial visitation . Even if the roar of rapidly succeeding explosions apprises the officers further ahead of an impending attack , and even if the morale of the men is such that they can be brought to fire , there will hardly be time enough for more than one shot per man . Riddled though it may be with a thousand bullets , a rigid Zeppelin can still keep afloat . Indeed , there may be difficulty in keeping it down because of the bombweight that has been discarded . Each bullet hole will have a diameter less than that of an ordinary gas-burner . With no pressure , the twenty thousand cubic meters of gas in a Zeppelin will escape so slowly that there will be ample time , if not to reach headquarters , at least to land in a safe zone near a railway , so that fresh gas and new ballonets can be hurried to it . Aeroplanes , too , will be used in the war of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be employed as auxiliaries to the larger air-ship , which , because of its greater radius of action , may assume the task of locating the general position of a huge hostile army , leaving to the swift aeroplane the task of studying the position and strength of individual batteries and brigades . Perhaps , too , it may be possible to conceal aeroplanes behind a clump of  | trees ( flying-machines are not so easily detected as bodies of troops at an elevation of two thousand feet and more ) and to have them whir off to their tasks in response to the signals of air-ships that have performed the preliminary work . At all events , despite the bomb-dropping exploits of the Italians in North Africa , scouting will be the chief function of the aeroplane in war . Much of the slaughter that attended the siege of Port Arthur centered about the capture of an eminence that has passed into history as " 203-Meter Hill . " The Japanese wanted that eminence , not to plant guns upon it , but to station on its commanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese batteries . Time and time again 203-Meter Hill changed hands . When the Japanese captured it for good the fate of Port Arthur was sealed . A skillfully handled aeroplane would have accomplished the same result more expeditiously , and hundreds of Russians and Japanese who gave up their lives in the fierce struggles that were waged to hold that hill would be alive to-day . The battles of the next century will not be devoid of picturesque incidents ; but bloody scouting expeditions , frightful battles about 203-Meter Hills , will be conspicuously few . Those wars will not be so aeronautically onesided as the Turkish-Italian conflict or the struggle in the Balkans . Each commander will have his aeroplanes , and each will bend every effort to destroy the machines of the other . Victory will probably rest with the side that has the most numerous and the swiftest flotilla of machines ; for number means ability to sacrifice machines in the effort to obtain information , and swiftness means ability to escape uninjured with the information obtained . The general who has lost his last aeroplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where every battery , where every company of infantry and cavalry , is placed . From this it follows that means must be devised to destroy aeroplanes . Special artillery has been designed for that purpose ; but its effectiveness may be doubted . True , the Russian aviator Popoff was brought down by shrapnel in the Balkan campaign , but it is not known how low he was flying . There is nothing for it but to arm the aeroplane with light machine guns and to pit machine against machine in the air . If the elaborate experiments of the French count for anything , three-seated aeroplanes will be employed in war ? three-seated because there must be a pilot to operate the machine , an officer who will study the enemy below , and a gunner who will fight off attack . The click of that officer 's camera-shutter may be the death-warrant of a whole regiment below ; the touch of his pencil on the page of a notebook may spell destruction to a stronghold . Assume that some years hence a threeseated machine will be designed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two armies , the Reds and the Blues , face each other , each having its aerial corps of trained pilots , gunners , and officers . How will the machines be handled ? Back of a crest of hills a battery of artillery has been planted by the Reds . One hour after sunrise there is a single dull , heavy report . A shell whistles through the air . A Red lieutenant on the eminence above the battery raises his glass and watches . Five thousand yards away a group of white huts with thatched roofs lie huddled together . The Red lieutenant sees a little upheaval in one of the huts ? a little splash , as it were ? and then flames and smoke from a burning roof . The shell has found its mark and done its work . " All right , " says the Red lieutenant . Whereupon a soldier at his side picks up a field telephone and informs the commander of the battery that the test shot has found the range . Five minutes later the air is split with ten sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huts ; for a little behind them lies the first of seven lines of outposts back of which the Blues are intrenched . To be fired on by concealed guns is not pleasant . There is no way of retaliating . If the battery behind the hills is to be silenced its position must be accurately known . A Blue captain of infantry leaps into an automobile and dashes off to the north . Fifteen minutes later he salutes the Commander-inChief and reports that unless the Red fire is silenced ; which is impossible without knowing the position of the hostile guns , the first line of defenses must be abandoned at once . The Blue general calls an officer and orders him to ascertain the number and position of the guns behind the hills . Into a waiting monoplane three men clamber . In front is the pilot ; behind him , in a line , sit a Blue captain of the Aerial Corps , and a man whose duty it is to manipulate a machine gun . The engine is started . It  | spits and sputters and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a gigantic , living bird , with wings outspread , ready to leap into the air . Such is the speed of the eight-foot propeller that it seems more like a solid disk flittering in the morning sun than two wooden blades spinning at the rate of fouteen hundred revolutions a minute . Six soldiers hold the machine in leash , digging their heals into the earth and straining every muscle against the pull of the whiling propeller . The Blue captain taps the shoulder of the pilot in front of him twice ? thee signal that all is ready . Next he raises his hand , and the six men that hold the machine back release their grip . For perhaps a hundred yards the monoplane bowls over the turf at railway speed , gathering momentum for its leap into the air . The pilot pulls a lever . Instantly the elevating rudder tilts up ever so slightly , and the machine vaults from the ground like a vulture . Once in the air the pilot knows better than to wing his way directly to the battery behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any hawk or eagle can fly . But the machine is big ? so big that at low elevations an enemy 's machine guns might bring it down with ease . And so the pilot climbs up and up in great circles . He looks at the barometer . It falls as the machine rises . Five hundred feet , a thousand , fifteen hunred , two thousand , he reads . At last the aneroid indicates three thousand feet . Now he knows that he is safe , for at that height the monoplane , depsite its spread , seems like a sparrow from below . Only by a miacle could a shot fired from the ground strike it . Straight for the battery concealed behind the crest the machine now speeds . Below lies the battlefield ? the trenches , the tents , the cavalry , the infantry , the baggage trains of the Bluses , all more like a child 's tin panoply of war than a nation 's picked men under arms . That yellow ribbon trailing off to the north is a road . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west are the steel tracks of railway , and the long serpent that crawls upon them and vomits smoke from its head is a freight train . This white shimmering thread that winds through the green fields and is lost in the mist is a stream . Its source lies somewhere among the hills toward which the machine is rushing . Perched on his eminence , watching the effect of the shells scattering death among the outposts of the Blues , sits the Red lieutenant . He has seen the Blue monoplane screwing its way up and up beyond the range of rifles and machine guns . Long before the aeroplane has reached a safe height he has telephoned its coming to headquarters . No occult powers are needed to divine its purpose . If the battery is to continue its deadly work , that giant bird of the air , soaring on at railway speed , must be stopped at any cost . Just as the Blue monoplane reaches the crest of the hill , two three-seated biplanes , each armed with a machine gun , are sent up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he must turn and run for it , if he is to reach camp alive . But he knows , too , that only if he can bring back accurate information of the masked batteries ' location can the Blues hold their own . And so , despite two hostile biplanes , despite the danger that lurks in a one-sided battle in the air , he keeps on long enough to note on his map the position of each gun . The battery is easily enough plotted , relatively to a church , a railway station , and a large hotel . Four precious minutes have been lost . The biplanes are only a mile away , and one thousand feet below him . He leans over and shouts an order into the pilot 's ear . A pedal is pressed , the machine cants over , as it swings around in a graceful circle , and begins its homeward flight . The Red biplanes lose no time in worming their way up into the air . Up , on a long easy incline , they fly toward the receding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they soar over the crest , caught in the invisible surf of air that beats against the hill , and then settle down to the grim task of destroying the enemy 's monoplane . On and on the three machines race for life . The monoplane has the advantage of position . The gunner in back of the Blue captain puts his shoulder to his piece and squints along the barrel . Aiming for the nearer biplane at a downward angle of fortyfive degrees , he fires half a dozen shots . No response from the biplane , nor any sign that a single shot has told . If it is hard to hit a moving thing , it is harder still when the platform of the marksman is moving too . The biplanes are gaining . Once more the Blue marksman takes aim and fires , again without effect . Still no reply from the foremost biplane . The captain of the Blue  | monoplane decides on a new course . He orders his pilot to drop five hundred feet , down to the level of the hostile biplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wash of his propeller may prove more effective . The monoplane dives and then straightens out its course again . The pilot of the leading biplane is no aerial innocent . He sees the downward glide and knows its meaning . If he is caught in the turbulent air churned by the monoplane 's propeller , his machine will pitch and roll like a rowboat in a stormy sea . Quickly he pulls the lever that controls his elevating rudder and climbs up out of the wake of the monoplane before him . The pilot of the accompanying biplane does likewise . For a few hundred feet the two double-deckers glide up . The increased head-on resistance retards them and they lose headway . And so the Blue monoplane gains for a few seconds . Once more the marksman in the Blue machine tries his machine gun . The nearer biplane is somewhat above him and behind him now ; it is even harder to hit than before . Carefully he takes aim , as carefully as his throbbing , rocking seat will permit . The helmet of the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsteady muzzle-sight rests for an instant upon it the trigger is pulled . The effect is magical . For an instant the biplane seems to hover like a wounded bird . Then it plunges down , down , down , with vertiginous speed . As the machine drops the pilot works the control levers frantically ? in vain . One of the cables leading to an aileron had been shot in two , and the machine is utterly unmanageable . The officer behind the pilot seizes the duplicate emergency levers , and , in desperation , tries to control the pitching machine . The duplicate controls are of no avail . No power can save him and his two companions . The machine crashes to the ground , a shapeless mass of splintered wood , torn canvas , and twisted wire , buried beneath which lie the bodies of three brave men . The Blue captain smiles grimly . One Red machine at least has been removed by a miraculously lucky shot . The other , however , keeps on undaunted . It is even becoming more aggressive ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the bullets has pierced the left wing of the Blue monoplane ; but the tiny hole that it has left is of no more significance than the ventilating holes in the pilot 's helmet . Again the gunner in the Red machine fires , this time with telling effect . The marksman in the Blue machine falls to one side , shot through the heart , his head and an arm hanging limply over the edge of the fuselage . The machine is unbalanced for a moment . Only by throwing his weight to the opposite side is the pilot able to restore the monoplane to an even keel . He looks back and sees what has happened . The Blue captain lifts the dead man under the armpits and disposes his body so that the machine 's equilibrium is no longer disturbed . It is impossible to use the machine gun now , for the dead man is in the way . The Blue captain picks up a rifle . He raises the weapon to his shoulder and fires . The gunner in the biplane answers . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unheard by either crew above the roar of the motors . The Red biplane glides down to the level of the monoplane , but carefully keeps to the right so that it may use its gun to advantage . The two machines are only five hundred yards apart now , with the Blue camp plainly in sight . The men in the Red biplane realize that they must act quickly lest the monoplane escape with news that may prove the undoing of the battery behind the hill . A hail of bullets pours from the crackling machine gun of the biplane . The gunner handles the weapon as if it were a hose , and the stream of projectiles that spouts from its muzzle as if it were so much water . So short is the distance that he can not miss . The canvas of the monoplane is riddled with shot . Both pilot and Blue captain topple over . Down crashes the machine to the green earth two thousand feet below . Its work of destruction complete , the Red biplane turns back . It winds its way far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then in three long , swift , magnificent stages it glides down to the landing ground of the Red camp . A ladder is placed against the machine . The officer clambers down , salutes his General , reports the loss of one Red biplane and the destruction of the Blue monoplane . Three hours later the first line of Blue outposts are in the hands of the Reds .
