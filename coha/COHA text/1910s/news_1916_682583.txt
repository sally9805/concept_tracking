txt Thirty of yesterday 's 103 cases of in- i fantile paralysis were in the Borough of Manhattan , by far the largest number of cases reported in the borough in a single day since the beginning of the outbreak  --  and the total cases to date passed the 1.000 mark , but the public and disease were brought to a record state of efficiency , according to all reports . The figures for the day , Health Commissioner Haven Emerson said , gave no reason for panicky alarm . He regarded them as what might be expected , even assuming effectiveness for the measures taken against the outbreak . No matter what was done , he said , it would take time for good results to manifest themselves In the figures , and he expressed himself as unhesitatingly hopeful that the disease would be conquered . Unqualified agreement with Dr. Emerson was voiced by Dr. Alvah H. Doty. former Health Officer of the Port and a member of the Physicians ' Committee . which is co-operating with the Department of Health . Dr. C. H. Lavender of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the research work planned to solve the carrier problem , also agreed with Dr. Emerson . Experts Praise Work Done . " Everything possible is being done by the most modern methods , " Dr. Duty said . " That 's all you can say and all you can do . Experience has shown that where modern methods are employed , epidemics are overcome . and I believe that experience will repeat itself in the prese.it case . I would not say that the ' outbreak had reached its worst klage , but I believe that will be controlled . " Dr. Lavender said that , while officially concerned only with the research work , he had had occasion to observe the efforts of the Department of Health and it : - auxiliary agencies , and that , in his opinion , nothing that could be done effectively was being left undone . New units were added yesterday to the great disease-fighting which the authorities believe will enhance its completeness and efficiency , Chief among , the new forces probably was that of the city magistrates as a body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police . The following letter , sent yesterday by Acting Chief City Magistrate Frederick , B. House to every magistrate in the city , was the " call to arms ' : Magistrate House 's Letter . Gentlemen : The infantile paralysis epidemic in this community has passed the point of danger and has become a crisis . Mayor Mitchel , however , after a conference with certain of the heads of city departments . believes that Me epidemic is within the range of control . To this end he has ordered the streets of the city to be thoroughly cleaned each day . and has directed the Police Department to rigidly enforce all city ordinances respecting uncovered garbage cans , the placing of refuse , garbage , and other filth in the public streets . In enforcing these ordinances it is likely that the police will make summary arrests , and It is the earnest desire of the Mayor that the City Magistrates aid in this important work by imposing adequate penalties in these cases . The situation is critical ; and all city departments are united In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the City Magistrates the work of the other city departments will have little effect . It Is not only necessary at this time to thoroughly clean the streets of the city , but It le also necessary that they should be kept clean ; and those who violate city ordinances respecting the streets should be impressed that these ordinances must not be violated ; and this can he done only by imposing substantial penalties . In the absence of Chief City Magistrate , I um asking you to Join the Mayor and the other city departments in this important work . Very sincerely yours , FREDERICK 13 . HOUSE , Acting Chief City Magistrate . Many Sanitary Code Cases . Even before receiving this letter the Magistrates evidenced appreciation of the responsibility devolving upon them , and invariably imposed fines upon the Many violators of the Sanitary Code brought before them . The keynote was sounded by Magistrate Patton in the Essex Market Court , an east side court . One of the first cases upon Magistrate Patton 's calendar was that of a woman charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I fine you ' $2 , " said the Magistrate , " and if you appear before me again on a charge of violating the Sanitary Code I shall impose the maximum penalty . " This warning , " the Magistrate continued raising his voice and addressing the courtroom , packed to its capacity with men and women summoned on similar charges , " applies to every person brought before me Ier violation of the code . You know what the city of New York is trying to do to iirevent the spread of infantile paralysis and you ought to co-operate with the city to save your own and others ' babies . If you wo n't co-operate willingly the city will make you do so . " In all , 127 persons , most of them women carrying hassles , were arraigned . Each was fined $2. 611 Fined in Two Boroughs . In the Tombs Court Magistrate Marsh heard the cases of 14S persons charged with violating the Sanitary Code . Fines ranged from $1 to $2 .

Altogether 611 persons were fined from $1 to $5 in Manhattan and the Bronx yesterday for violations of the Sanitary Code , and , according to reports , a. greater number were similarly punished in Brooklyn , with Queens and Richmond also melting high records . These cases were the result of activity on the part of policemen , members of the Home Defense League , sanitary inspectors of the Department of Health , foremen of street cleaning gangs , and the private citizens . Acting Police Commissioner Godley testified to the part played by the Home Defense League . Lauds Home Defense League . " The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " patrolmen being instructed to r.otify such members of the league as lived on their posts . By 7 o'clock in ' the evening 5,000 leaguers had reported for duty . For hours these volunteers , accompanied by patrolmen , tramped the streets and poked into every conceivable place , looking for violations of the sanitary code . And they made many reports , too , showing that they were on the Job . One of the members of the league working from the Amity Street Station in Brooklyn . found , hid in a cellar , bedding which had been recently used by a child suffering from Infantile paralysis . " The members of the league will remaM on the job . They will work from two to four hours each evening , and I believe that they will give material aid in stamping out the epidemic . " The American Woman Suffrage Association announced yesterday that its entire city organization had volunteered to aid in the fight against the disease , and that Mrs. Catt had notified Surgeon General Blue of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him in his effort to prevent interstate spread of infantile paralysis . The Department of Public Charities , already enrolled among the active forces resisting the disease , yesterday announced plans for the after-care of children surviving it . Kingsbury to Aid Convalescents . " As Brooklyn is the borough In which the epidemic is most prevalent , " said Commissioner John A. Kingsbury , " particular eforts are being made to equip the Kings County Hospital to meet the situation . Treatment consisting of massage , the use of electricity , and movements of the affected limbs , It applied in time , can , in many cases . prevent permanent crippling . If such treatment is not given Promptly , however , the victim is very likely to be a cripple for life . In some eases , however , the disease is so virulent as to destroy the tissues , when permanent crippling is unavoidable . ? ' Dr. Barber , the Chairman of the Medical Board . Kings County Hospital , by direction of the Commissioner . has called a meeting of the visiting orthopedic surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for the after care of these children . " While the disease is in its contagious stage it must be controlled and treated by the Department of Health . After it passes this stage the general municipal hospitals will take charge of the city 's cases . " Commissioner Kingsbury added that immediate after care following an attack of the disease often prevented a child 's being crippled for life . Dr. Louis C. Agee. head of the committee appointed so care for Brooklyn 's crippled children , who appealed for contributions of money for the purpose , yesterday announced a total of $774 in gifts . Some of the Contributors . Principal contributors were Mrs. Daniel Guggenheim. $500 ; J. G. , $100 : Mrs. Edward Gibb , Miss K. R. Bowers , K. M. S .. Mrs. E. S. Bussing . and Mrs. IV , W. Patrick , $10 each ; Hamilton Candee , Joseph D. Poster , and Charles Hunt . $e each . Much of this money will be spent for frames and supports for crippled children . Dr. Emerson announced also that he had received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for any emergency need of the Department of Health . The Manhattan , Brooklyn . and Bronx branches of the American Red Cross met yesterday at 26 Broad Street and decided to render any aid In the present crisis which the Department of Health might desire . The organization , it was announced , stood ready to supply nurses if they were nerved . A call for assistance would be " welcomed , " it was said . The meeting was attended by Robert Iv . de Forest , Newcomb Carlton , Jacob H. Schiff , Morgan J. O'Brien , W. Frank Persons , Leopold Plaut , Charles G. Norton , John ef . Glenn , T. F. Merseles . Mrs. William K. Draper , Alfred T. white , Charles L. Morse . Thomas W. Hynes. and others . Dr. Emerson said later that he deeply appreciated the action of the Red Cross and would not hesitate to call upon the organization if the situation at any time demanded it , hut that ho hoped to obtain sufficient forces from purely local sources to supply every need . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " vies Just passed the joint resolution permitting us to use the 600 beds at Ellis Island . and if we find it necessary to use those beds I shall have to ask the Red Cross for nurses , but practically every hospital in the city has offered us space , and I hope that we will not have to go to Ellis Island at all . 1,200 Beds Available in Hospitals . " We have still unuccupied 233 beds in hospitals under the control of the Department of Health , and other city hospitals have made 290 available for us . We expect to have 75 more soon , and the Department of Charities will let us know tomorrow exactly how many beds they can supply . Altogether , I should say that we still have 1,200 beds in city hospitals which we can use , and I hope that we shall not have to accommodate more patients than this before some of the first cases are discharged , which they will be about eight weeks after the beginning of their illness . " We employed today forty new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with those already in service , meet our present needs . The situation as regards nurses has been constantly improvingn the last few a days , and I do not anticipate the serious shortage of a week ago . " The Public Service Commission was another of the agencies which yesterday announced plans for assisting in the anti-paralysis war . It was said at the commission 's offices that Chief Engineer Alfred Craven had issued orders to the various division engineers instructing them to keep all construction work in the most sanitary condition possible . The commission , It was said , had received complaints that persons had been dumping refuse into excavations , and the division engineers were told to report such offenses to the police . Dr. Emerson Analyzes the Figures . Commissioner Emerson said yesterday that no case of infantile paralysis had been reported from any of the childcaring institutions in the city . Special precautions , he said , were being taken to prevent the disease getting into any of the homes . The Commissioner said that his agents were also notifying outof-town Boards of Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Emerson also gave some statistics indicating that the deaths from infantile paralysis were chiefly in cases of children between one and five years of age , and that the death rate of the city as a whole had not been greatly increased by the present outbreak . According to the Health Department 's figures , the total deaths of adults and children in the city in the week ended July 10 , 1915 , were 1,251 , and the total for the corresponding week this year was 1,845 . The total deaths of Children of lees than one year Of age in the same week of 1915 were 235 , and in the correspondin week of this year 220  --  a significant decrease . The total deaths of children between one and five years of age . however , for the considered week of 1915 were 369 , whereas the deaths for the week in 1916 were 445 . The figures for Brooklyn , where the outbreak has been the most severe , were materially affected by the disease . In the week of July 10 , 1915 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years of age in Brooklyn , but in the same week of this year there were 219 deaths . The death rate of children of less than five years of age in each of the other boroughs of the city has been actually less this year than last . Concerning deaths , Dr. Emerson said that some were reported to the Department of Health as of infantile paralysis which he thought were from another cause , and that he had therefore designated Dr. M. B. , Assiatant Sanitary Supervisor of the department , to examine into the case of death in each doubtful case . Commissioner of Licenses Bell said yesterday that the motion picture inert , in most cases , had observed the regulation forbidding admission of children to theatres . The supposed violations reported from Coney Island on Sunday night . he said , were chiefly cases of restaurant proprietors who displayed free movies as an attraction to their tables . These men , he added . came under his jurisdiction only yesterday , and he at once notified them that they would have to conform to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture houses closed by the ' Commissioner yesterday were six in Brooklyn , and these were closed solely because they were in distrcts so widely infected that any gathering in them was a. source of contagion . Movie Theatres Lose Money . While co-operating with the Departmentment of Health , the motion picture men are suffering heavy losses because , though their attendance has been greatly reduced , they have to abide by their contracts with the film supply houses . To relieve this situation , a number of proprietors yesterday requested Dr. Emerson to close the motion picture theatres of the city entirely , so that no one would have to meet the contract obligations but Dr. Emerson . though expressing sympathy with the applicants , said he did not feel justified in granting their petition . Dr. C. H. Lavinder said yesterday that the research work outlined for the surgeons of the United States Public Health Service would begin aa soon as sufficient money and monkeys had been provided . As yet . he said , he did not know what means he would have for his purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the active campaign against the disease , being solely directed toward laboratory Study of carriers . Dr. Lavinder did not know yesterday what laboratory he would use , but said that several were available . It was suggested to Dr. Lavinder that monkeys for immediate use might be obtained from the zoos of the city , but the surgeon replied that the rhesus monkey was the only species adapted to experimental work , and that he did not think there were many of these in cages . He added , though , that most of the monkeys used by organ grinders were of the rhesus species , and he said that if any organ grinder wanted to sell his coin-collector for $10 he could probably do so at the Rockefeller Institute . Warning About Hiding Cases . Dr. Emerson called attention yesterday to Section S7 of the Sanitary Code . providing that laymen must report cases of suspected infantile paralysis and other communicable disease to the Department of Health . Violation of the section . he added , might be punished , If the maximum penalty were imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imprisonment . Street Cleaning Commissioner Fetherston said last night ( fiat he had 6.000 men working on the streets , as against a normal 2,000 . Many of these men , he said , were working twenty-four hours a week extra , without extra compensation . " But our ability to keep the streets clean , " he added . " depends upon the co-operation of the public . " When questioned concerning the suggestion of Dr. Johannes Moving that the streets he washed after the collection of garbage , the Commissioner said ? and Dr. Emerson agreed with him ? that there was no real danger from the small quantity of garbage Cropped on the streets during collection . an.1 that washing the streets during tho daylight hours was impracticable . Just as Dr. Emerson was not discouraged . yesterday by the report of 10t new cases -- iis : in Brooklyn . 30 in Manhattan , 1 in Queens , 4 in Richmond , and none in the Bronx ? so he was not elates over the comparatively low number of deaths for the day-9 in Brooklyn , 3 in Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 In the Bronx  --  a total of 14 . Hie position was that the figures for any day at this time , unless they ehoweu startling increase or decrease from the average , were no index of the success of the fight against the disease .

There were three deaths from infantile paralysis , six verified new cases , and two suspected cases in Newark , which brought the total for the last seven days up to five deaths and nineteen cases . One of the suspected cases was at large last night , a mother having fled from her home with her child when she learned that a , physician had notified the Board of Health of his suspicions and that an official would soon arrive , perhaps , to take the child away to a hospital .

It was announced yesterday by the National American Woman Suffrage Association that it would establish a new precedent by lending its assistance to relieve the suffering brought on by the epidemic of infantile paralysis . In a letter to Surgeon General Blue of the United States Public Health Service , Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt offered the services of the entire organization to the Federal Government to help in the nation-wide campaign against the spread of the disease . Several days ago the Woman Suffrage Party Of New York City became active in the local campaign against the spread of the disease , and hundreds of workers have been distributing circulars prepared by the Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for their children .
