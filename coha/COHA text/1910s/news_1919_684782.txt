txt In about six weeks South Dakota will elect delegates to the Republican National Convention , and it is reported that they will be in favor of the nomination of General WOOD for President . The Sioux City Tribune , which is an Iowa newspaper , is published on the South Dakota border and has a large circulation in the latter State . Since the first election of delegates will be a matter for national comment and will unquestionably have some influence , The Tribune earnestly advises the South Dakotans not to give the benefit of it to Wool ) . Its reasons are interesting and remarkable . They are three in number , the proGermans , the pro-Irish , and the labor element . All these are likely to vote against Wools should he be the nominee , and labor especially will regard his nomination as a threat and challenge . " Here , " comments the Davenport ( Iowa ) Democrat , " we have the first perfectly " frank suggestion that the Republicans " would be backing a loser if they de " dared themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evident , however , that if any such issue should be made in the campaign the Democrats would be the sufferers and General Wool ) the gainer , should he be the nominee . Tell the rest of the American people that the proGermans , the pro-Irish , organized labor , or any other class , clique , or society have formed their lines against Wool ) , and you will come as near as possible to solidifying the United States in favor of him . The pro-Germans may be against him because he did what he could to prevent their blood-brothers from winning the war . The Sinn Feiners may be against him for the same reason , though we do not believe they will have the support of Irishmen who wanted the United States to win and Germany to lose . As for labor , General WOOD 'S activities in the carrying out of his orders as a soldier were limited to the suppression of violence . The violence was mainly that of foreigners . It is not without significance that the West , instead of speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the habit of referring to " foreigners " and " Americans . " It is quite common to read that " a party of Americans , on . " their way to work , were fired upon by " foreigners . " It is not to be believed that American labor holds any grudge against the man who put down anarchy in a city where American workingmen wanted to work and Were prevented by foreign Bolsheviki . The matter , however , transcends the mere question of the personality and candidacy of General Wool ) . It may wine up as against some other candidatt . Governor LOWDEN , for instance , earned the hearty hatred of pro-Germanv and pacifists . It is just as well that , with the Presidential campaign waiting only six weeks for its beginning , there should be a clear understanding . If any group having separate interests from those of the United States , interests superior to those of the United States , should band together zto defeat any particular candidate , the rest of the country , the American part , will arouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he will receive a majority unprecedented in history . This country id in no mood to be dictated to by groups or to have its Government taken over by Viem.
