txt Dr. ELIOT 'S suggestion that " young " women should in practice work as " teachers no more than five years " is not as radical as it seems . We believe that the average term of service in the public schools in this State for women teachers is considerably less than that The , Doctor thinks that " to this practice there would always be valuable exceptions . " The real problem would seem to be how to regulate the exceptions , how to retain the services of the women who are valuable , and how to make all service as valuable as possible . And that in substance is the whole educational problem in the public schools of cities . It exists in the case of men teachers quite as distinctly as in the case of women , and it is complicated by the fact that public school teaching is not so attractive to young men as it is to young women . A certain proportion , we think a pretty large proportion , of those , who enter the calling drop out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the women , but are perhaps quite as effective . One of the chief roots of difficulty In all cases , if not the tap root , is that the profession offers pretty poor inducements to enter it save as a stepping stone to something better ; that the so-called " lower " grades of it are neither well paid nor otherwise attractive , though the work assigned to them is , in reality , the most Important that is required at any stage ; and that the whole service Is far too much governed by routine and red tape to invite or to keep the best teachers . It is not worth while to blame too severely the men who have our public schools in charge for these essential defects and faults of the system . The system suffers , as so many things do In this country , from the exceedingly rapid increase of our population , tempting and almost forcing us to stick to ideas and methods long after we have outgrown them . It is none the less true that the whole machinery and organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the light of the best that has been attained elsewhore . This was the object of the Hanus Commission , and it was , on the whole , rationally pursued by that . commission . Two principles lay at the base of the report of the commission . One was that the required revolution in the school system should be worked out , so far as possible , through the study , suggestion , and co-operation of those engaged in ' the more responsible work of actual teaching . Another was that there should be organized a means of scientific testing of methods in use and experimenting with changes proposed . Both principles were sound . The application of the first would not only utilize the intelligence and energy of the teaching . force , but it would be a constant incentive for the development of such energy and intelligence . It would give an aim to the teachers and inspire initiative . The application of the second would be a proper and necessary regulator a both old and new methods . It is a great pity that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shown , toward it , But- its . recom ; Rasp:Wails- have . : c9 much ; that is valuable that they can not but be a source of guidance to those who are engaged in an honest effort to reform our educational system , the number of whom is steadily increasing .
