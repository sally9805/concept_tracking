txt The constant espionage that District ' Attorney Whitman has been subjected to for the last six weeks is getting on his ! nerves . Alter the murder of Rosenthal. and while Mr. Whitman was straining every nerve to catch the murderers , he was shadowed pretty nearly all the time.1 But he knew why , and so it did not worry him very much . He believed at that time that the men who trailed him were po- ' licemen or private detectives hired by a common po'ice fund to keep track of his movements . The efforts amused him , for the reason that he did all the important ork behind closed doors and only communicated with the men who were acting for him by telephone , by mail , or by telegraph . He made it a point never to see them or come into contact with them . The fight to beat the police at their own game was full of interest and excitement , and he did beat them . After the trial of Becker and the gunmen Mr. Whitman felt that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . visit a friend on weekdays , or stroll along , the streets for a breath of fresh air with- i out feeling that det ? , ; ves were at his heels . For a time this was a ' ? * . but aster Sipp testified before the Curran Committee in December and crookedness and graft were being unearthed in the Felice Department nearly every day he knew that he was no longer a free agent . But now he has grown tired of the need of constantly protecting himself against the defeat of his plans by the men whose duty it is to help him . ' Many times ! ) he has wanted to meet men in the open and talk over his plans with them and ask there to co-operate with him Without feelPig that the things he was doing were being reported for the purpose of rendering them of no avail . The care with Which-he is being spied on came home to him very fore'hls- on Saturday . Within ten minutes after he and Assistant ' Dise ' trict Attorney Groehl had left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , two men pushed their way roughly into the place and told Tancredi that if he did not stop talking with the District Attorney and other officials Ile would get L'mself into serious trouble . Second Pair Visited Taneredi . Mr. Whitman got a description of these men , and it did not fit the description of the men who trailed Mr. Whitman and his assistant from the doer of Capt . Walsh 's home in Madison Avenue . The inference is that the first two communicated their information to some local point , and the second two were sent out to convey the threat and the warning to Tancredi . This has greatly angered Mr. Whitman . lie had outlined a personal campaign of investigation and exploration into certain dark parts of the city , and lie wanted to feel at liberty to perform this work without the fear of having men trailing him wherever he went . Late yesterday afternoon Mr. Whitman was asked if he had taken any steps to discover who the men were who followed him while he was abroad in Harlem . He replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his fight against police crookedness . He intimated that this was as great a sign of crookedness as any the police had given , but that it was of less consequence than some other things that he had on hand . 1-Ie said that Deputy Commissioner Newburger had telephoned Mr. Groehl earlier in the day , asking if he knew who the sleuths were . Mr. Groehl referred him to Mr. Whitman . " I expect Mr. Newburger will call upon me to-day , " said Mr. Whitman . Mr. Whitman could get rid of the men who trailed him if lie was willing to adopt heroic measures , but he is not ready just yet . He is only willing at this time to make a protest with the idea that if his shadowers are employed with the knowledge of any high police official their services will be discontinued . If it continues Mr. Whitman will take it for granted that the shadowing is for some criminal purpose , and it will fare Ill with the next pair of detectives that get upon his trail .

He also promised to summon Chief Surgeon Palmer to Headquarters this morning and question him about his visit to th , i bedside of Capt . Walsh with another surgeon who was not assigned to that district . Mr. Newburger was asked by the newspaper men to Lind out what the surgeons had said to the Captain to make him cry out that he would not stand for being called a squealer .

Mr. Newburger is still at work trying to uncover as much crookedness as possible in the Sixth Inspection District . It was said that he was getting a fast line on Patrolman Robinson , who , : as indicted on Monday . Robinson was suspected of having tipped off the ** Hotel on one occasion when al overhead raid was expected . Mr. Whitman appreciates the work Mr. Newburger is doing , and would be willi ing to work freely with him if he was sure the Deputy Commissioner would be permitted to Manage things the way his judgment and conscience dictated . His trouble with the police so far has made him suspicious of the motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interesting developments of th eday was the way a political trail was uncovered . Alfred n . Talley of counsel for Sweeney is a member of the Law Committee of Tammany Hall . He holds a job in the State Insurance Department , and he was connected with the Municipal Civil Service Commission during the McClellan administration . In April , 1011 , Talley appeared before Gov . Dix in a hearing to take the transfer appraisers in Controller Sohmer 's office out of the competitive class . Talley appeared in favor of the change and it was adopted , and ? a number of Tammany men were appointed to fill the offices . The surety company that had been employed in a number of the police cases had the backing of Tammany , it was said yesterday by an attache of Mr. Whitman 's office . The inquiry into the political aspects of the fight against graft was not made with any idea that anything crooked would prove to be the connecting link between politics and police graft . but merely to learn just how farreaching and powerful the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the heart of the grafting system . While this investigation was going on this little incident was unearthed . What Happened to Mc t.voy . A man named William A. MeAvoy owned the Dolphin Hotel , at ** Street and Lenox Avenue . He sold out , moved across the st. ' eet , and took his trade with him . The new owner of the old place complained to the landlord that he could not pay biz rent because had all the trade The landlord , it is alleged , said he would straighten that matter ' out . lie explained that he was a strong Tammany man and stood high with the men in power . Shortly thereafter M  --  Avoy was ! raided , arrested , tried , convicted , and I fined WO . besides losing his license . The charge made against him was of keeping a disorderly resort . About a week age MeAvoy told this story to Mr. Whitman . It may be the basis of some drastic action later on . These various political features coming ( into the story recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told hint he would not be permitted to run the Centrai Hotel because Nicholas J. : Hayes was on friendly terms with the proprietor ! of the Harlem House . which wits still , - running. according to a report received I by Mr. Whitman yesterday . The proprietor of this favored hotel is Charles L. Mulford . He is a member of 1-tayes 's club . I and has contributed toward campaign expenses . Mulford , it is said , registers and votes from the hotel while his home is said to be in St. Nicholas Avenue . Sweeney has always been recognized as I a very strong Tammany Hall man . He knows some of the biggest men in that organization and has been frequently seen in their company . He is very well acquainted with Edward J. Newell , the lawyer now under indictment on the charge of attempting to keep Sipp out of this State to the end that he could not be compelled to testify before the Grand Jury . Mr. Whitman has always been sure that if he could induce Newell to confess , the prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interesting character . What be meant is that Newell would be able to tell where the outside influence of the police comes from and how it happens that certain policemen can be kept in one district for years , while others are frequently moved about , At first Mr. Whitman was sure that Newell would give him all the help he could , hut after a week or ten days Newell 's attitude underwent a sudden change , and he declared his innocence and his intention to fight the thing out in the courts . It was because of this change that Mr. Whitman decided to try New 11 first and then Sweeney. it was said yesterday that if Newell had anything to tell that was worth a price he had better take his goods to market without any further delay or lie would find them to be of no value . It was said that the market for confessions was-so glutted now that they brought only the very lowest prices .

They will he ready by the end of next week , when Justice Goff will be asked to set a date for the beginning of Newell 's trial . Sweeney a.rd Robinson , indicted on Monday for bribery , will be arraigned to plead today . They will plead not guilty . The general impression is that there is an agreement among some of the big police grafters to let Sweeney stand the strain , to put all of the wrongdoing up to him anti make it appear that grafting in the department began and ended with , him . Such a situation , it wan said , would anger Sweeney , but it would not entirely discourage him , because he would still ; have his old political friends at his back .
