But most obnoxious of all from the American point of view was the so-called " right " to arrest English deserters wherever they could be found and the defense of the operations of the press-gang . The English notion had always been that a man born in England would always be an English subject ; they had always declined to recognize any oaths or acts of his as a valid release from his responsibility to England . To prove a man of English birth or to have been an English citizen was to prove he was still one . This notion of indefeasible allegiance therefore denied the right of an Englishman to take an oath of allegiance to the United States which would constitute a valid severance of his connections with England ; it was tantamount to a refusal to recognize the citizenship of a very large number of Americans in 1800 , who had no intention whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that country . Here was of course a subject on which cornpromise was hardly possible : the right of the United States to protect its citizens was clearly infringed by the refusal of England to admit that large numbers of Americans were citizens of the United States at all . The necessity for action on the part of the United States was particularly clear because of the operations of the English press-gang . The British navy was chiefly manned by conscripts and by men forced into the service by questionable methods . The press-gang from a battleship would go ashore in any town it happened to be near , whether in England or elsewhere , and seize by main force the sturdy-looking men it met , carry them off to the ship , and compel them to serve as sailors . Poor pay , bad food , strict discipline , degrading punishment , as well as the prospect of being killed in battle , made the service highly distasteful to Englishmen and particularly onerous to the unfortunates " pressed " into it . Desertions were therefore common and it was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deTHE WAR OF 1812 201 serters and that many and many an American citizen was a deserter from the English navy , who sought to save himself from the severe penalties for desertion by forswearing his allegiance . To cope with the difficulty , the English cruisers landed a press-gang in the various ports they called at and seized on sight and without investigation every man they thought looked like an English sailor . They also stopped American merchantmen on the high seas or in American harbors , lined up the crew , and selected those they thought were British deserters . Had they not also availed themselves of the opportunity to collect all likely-looking men without regard to their previous history or origin , the American case would still have been incontestable . There is no doubt that , by 1812 , many men born in America , who had never set foot in England , had been thus forced into the British service . Had the English been willing to confine themselves to the merchant marine , the situation would not have become so intolerable . But the victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused the detention of United States warships from which American citizens were taken and compelled to serve in the British navy.3 A clearer insult to this country could hardly be conceived than this refusal to recognize the citizenship of the men enlisted in its official navy under the United States flag . The growing tensity of English relations only made more apparent the divergence of opinion in the United States and stimulated the local discord which had for a time been ended by the success of the Federalist administrations . Scarcely had the loss of American privileges in the West India Is- // lands and in the fisheries been apprehended than talk of disunion and secession began in the Mississippi Valley . The people who had settled west of the mountains had come to realize that the Mississippi was the only possible outlet for their commerce and that the mouth of the river , and hence control of its navigation , was in the hands of Spain . They believed the Spanish anxious to close the river to American trade , and they so well appreciated the mutual advantages , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of intercourse between the Spanish West India colonies and the Atlantic coast , that they were afraid Congress would allow Spain to close the Mississippi in exchange for commercial privileges in the Spanish West Indies . As early as 1786 this notion was current in the West , and , after the new Constitution had vested in the central government power to regulate commerce and to deal with western lands , the malcontents in Kentucky and Tennessee became sure that such was the design .4 Negotiations were opened with the Spanish at New Orleans and at St. Louis , 6 and the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 were somehow connected with the agitation for secession. ? With this western sentiment , the Southern States largely sympathized , and the AntiFederalists all over the country were disposed to complain vigorously of English insolence and encroachment and to declare themselves in favor of no compromise and of an insistence upon demands to which England clearly would not accede . In New England , on the other hand , and in mercantile circles all along the Atlantic coast , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of agreement with England was far more essential to them and their busi- // ness than it was to the interior and western districts , and they realized far more adequately the impossibility of dictating terms to England , and the very great difficulty under the circumstances of obtaining from her a working compromise , that would give them a part of what they hoped ultimately to obtain . The mercantile community was therefore in favor of minimizing the disputes over the right of search and impressment , which militated against individuals rather than against the country as a whole and on which no compromise was possible , in the hope of obtaining some rights of navigation which would certainly redound to the benefit of the vast majority of Americans . The loud talk of reprisal upon English ships , the insistence upon reparation for insult , the general hostile tone assumed toward England , the laudation of France and everything French , these the New Englanders well knew only made more and more difficult the arrival at any agreement. ?

Nor was there much doubt in Washington that the attempt of either France or England to establish a new empire would be promptly followed by the revolt or secession of the settlers in the Mississippi Valley from the United States and their adhesion to the new empire . Too many pledges of their readiness to join the Spanish had already been given to cause Jefferson to hesitate long . The crisis was , he wrote , " the most important that the United States have ever met since their independence 9 and which is to decide their future character and career .

The Americans were to be allowed to carry goods to Europe from the West Indies by paying a duty upon them to England , and , unless the United States at once resisted the measures of Napoleon , the treaty would be void . Jefferson rejected it at once . Further decrees militating against American trade appeared in 1807 ; the frigate Chesapeake was fired upon by the English ship Leopard and three American citizens and one English subject were seized from her crew .

After a long series of further attempts at legislation and negotiation , and after the receipt of further insults from the English , war was declared in 1812.13 The new policy was the result of the passing of the control to a new set of political leaders ?

The distance which separated us from England , the size of the theater of war , which had made it impossible for her to conquer us , made even more impossible the successful prosecution of an offensive war by the United States against England . To be sure , she was engaged in a life and death struggle with Napoleon and could hardly spare ships and armies to fight the United States effectively at the same time .

Ever since it had become apparent after the signing of the Treaty of 1783 that the commercial question had not been settled , the mercantile community and New England as a whole had more and more vehemently opposed the hostile attitude towards England assumed by the majority , and had more and more consistently declared for a policy of conciliation and the securing of such terms as could be had . The election of Jefferson had convinced the Federalists in New England that little was now to be expected from the central government and that their dearest hopes and most important interests would be sacrificed to the clamor of the mob . The purchase of Louisiana , the rejection of the various treaties framed with England between 1803 and 1812 , the Embargo and non-intercourse legislation convinced them as the years went on that their expectations were only too certainly being realized .

" The New England States , which found the Union very much to their interest in 1860 , quite forgot at that time that they had themselves espoused and believed constitutional and patriotic the same ideas which the Southerners were then promulgating . Hamilton 's decision against the scheme , the discovery that the immediate fears concerning the shift of influence to the South and West were not realized , checked the secession movement in 1804 . In 1807 and 1808 , the disastrous effect of the Embargo on New England revived it ; armed rebellion seemed almost certain , but the danger was averted by the repeal of the act and by the expectation of relief from the renewal of trade . When war was declared upon England in 1812 , New England determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized and the movements concerted which should make its secession final and successful , passive resistance of the old colonial type was offered to the commands of the Federal government . The New Englanders declined to put their troops under command of United States officers , refused to allow them to serve outside the United States and in some cases outside their own borders . In all these States , loans were authorized and troops equipped for their own defense , an example followed in 1814 by New York , Pennsyl- // vania , and Virginia . New England was then the moneyed community and from its resources the Federal government had expected to finance the war . The New Englanders declined to loan money to the government and instead gave aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States , supplying the English fleets and armies with beef and fuel 16 and even with the specie to pay the troops.17 At the crucial moment of the war , two weeks after the English had sacked Washington , one week after they had occupied parts of Maine , the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was withdrawn from the armies of the United States . Rhode Island and Connecticut followed suit and the three entered into bonds for mutual defense . Meanwhile , behind closed doors , the Hartford Convention was elaborating a new constitution and concerting measures for the independence of the New England States . The " civil war " in America was not yet over ; the anti-national feeling was yet strong ; the vision of a single nation was as yet seen only by a few individuals ; but a great advance had been made towards nationalism . The old talk of the necessity of the independence and sovereignty of each separate State had disappeared ; the thirteen sovereigns had been reduced to three ? the East , the South , and the West . The development of the country and propinquity were doing their work slowly but surely . The seriousness of this crisis has not been fully enough recognized .

The Hartford Convention dissolved ; the talk of secession died a natural death ; New England and the West tried to act as if nothing had been intended , and the various parties and interests returned to Congress to debate the common problems .

The end of the war in 1815 happened practically to coincide with the close of the Napoleonic wars in Europe and the natural resumption of peaceful pursuits on the continent . Thus disappeared , in a moment , as it were , the market for American food-stuffs and naval stores and the opportunity for American ships in the carrying trade . Great as had been the dangers and serious as had been the obstacles in the way of the complete utilization of the opportunity by Americans , many fortunes had been built upon it and a really flourishing mercantile marine had been developed . The resumption of manufactures on the continent was a great blow to the English manufacturers , whose business had flourished , not only because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also because the state of war had left them the only manufacturers in Europe , and had given them , despite the militating regulations of Napoleon , almost a monopoly of the European market . With the return of peace , their market largely disappeared , a large surplusage of production resulted , prices accordingly fell rapidly , and English goods at low rates flooded the American market . The disappearance of our market abroad both during the continuance of the Embargo and after the close of the war left the American merchants with 211 // a large variety of produce which they could not sell and revealed to the eyes of even the blindest the fact that there was no home market for what we produced . The flood of English manufactured goods and the practical lack of anything else on the American market made it equally clear that we did not produce much of anything which we ourselves needed . We were utterly dependent upon Europe to buy what we had to sell and to produce for us what we wished to buy . And Europe was three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crises ! The period , which began with the institution of the Federal government in 1789 and closed with the War of 1812 , had been one of unusually rapid economic development in America , and had produced an entirely new alignment of interests in the country . A distinct entity had begun to form in the South concerned with the growing of cotton , another in the North chiefly busied with the manufacture of cotton cloth , and a third to the West intent upon the conquest of the wilderness by the plow as rapidly as possible . Cotton had been found by Columbus and had been used by the early colonists sufficiently to cause it to be enumerated by the Navigation Act in 1660 as a marketable commodity , but it had never rivaled tobacco , indigo , or rice as a great staple crop . A great variety of circumstances , juxtaposited by chance , united to make it the long-sought medium of exchange between America and Europe , the valuable commodity the demand for which in Europe should increase as fast as the ability of America to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the attempt to find a substitute for woolens first called attention to it . Then came the invention in England of machinery for spinning and weaving cotton ; and the accident of fashion created a demand for the new cloth . At or about the same time ( 1786 ) , the first crop of the sea-island cotton , grown near Charleston , S. C. , was marketed , and the extraordinary length and the soft and silky quality of its fiber was first appreciated . It met at once with favor and within a few years was selling for a // dollar and even two dollars a pound . Cotton came as a godsend to the South . The Southerners were seeking a new staple crop , for the indigo industry had depended on the English bounty for its profit and had therefore been ruined by its discontinuance in 1775 . The rice-cultivation was limited to the swamp lands of South Carolina and Georgia ; and the European demand for American tobacco was always distinctly limited , since America did not produce the finest grades . Cotton therefore promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as the planters had found that the upland cotton was filled with seeds so difficult to remove that the process destroyed both fiber and profit ( the sea-island cotton was easy to clean ) , Eli Whitney invented a simple machine with which even an ignorant slave could rapidly cleanse huge amounts from seeds . The European demand , the new machinery to use the fiber , the gin to clean it , the need for a new Southern staple crop , all combined to make cotton within twenty years the greatest asset the South had and the most important single product of the Atlantic coast . 9,000 bales were produced in 1791 ; 211,000 were grown in 1801 ; and at the close of the war of 1812 , 458,000 . Cotton made slavery profitable and therefore permanent . In 1789 , it had been the rather general sentiment that slavery was likely to die of inanition and that its extension was hardly likely . In 1815 , it was beyond question that a great and a permanent interest of the South had appeared which it did not share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , and one as obviously local , had appeared in New England and in the middle States . The Embargo , followed by the War of 1812 , had compelled America to do without English goods and the high prices manufactured goods commanded had stimulated the production at home of cotton and woolen cloth , some pig-iron , glass , pottery , and a few other articles . Of all these industries " created " by the war , the most successful was cotton-spinning . In 1805 , 4,500 spindles were at work ; the imposition of the Embargo raised the number to 31,000 in 1809 and to 87,000 in 1810 , while // the war resulted in an expansion to 130,000 spindles . Where 1,000 bales of raw cotton had been used in 1805 , 90,000 bales were being consumed in 1815 . Slater at Pawtucket had introduced the new English machinery for spinning , and Lowell had instituted near Boston , in some of the first true factories in the world , power looms for weaving cotton cloth . All through New England , abundant water-power and unremunerative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread rapidly . Apparently the war had created industries and a new sectional interest as definite in its needs as the " peculiar institution " in the South . Moreover , a third section had grown over night , as it were , in the Mississippi Valley . By 1815 , on the great prairies where the Iroquois had so long hunted , where in 1783 had been only a few scattered hamlets and a few daredevil adventurers , were four fully organized States , Kentucky , Tennessee , Ohio , Louisiana , and five territories nearly populous enough for admission as States . The band of settlement had spread westward from the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys into the old Northwest Territory , from Virginia and North Carolina through the Cumberland Gap into Kentucky , Tennessee , Missouri , southern Illinois and Indiana , and west from Georgia and South Carolina into the rich river-bottoms of the Gulf country where cotton was most profitable . This last section became soon an integral part of the South , bound to it by an identity of interests , but the more northern districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shut off in the great river valley with characteristic problems of their own . The provision of adequate facilities of transportation by means of roads , canals , turnpikes , was seen at a very early date to be the most difficult problem , upon whose solution rested the possibility of an immediate development and utilization of the land . Unless the crop could be moved south or east , there was no purpose in raising more than the individual needed for his own sustenance . But the crop could not be moved and exchanged // for manufactured goods without money , and of that the West had little and was never able to retain for long what little it did obtain . Compared to these , the more immediate problems of the division and allotment of land , the institution of administration , the taxation of undeveloped land , the provision for schools and universities were simple and were rapidly and on the whole admirably dealt with . The net result , however , was the creation of three distinct and varying interests . Calhoun in an interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then spoke of the three great interests of the Nation , the North , the South , and the West . They had been struggling in a fierce war with each other , and he thought the period was approaching that was to determine whether they could be reconciled or not so as to perpetuate the Union . He was of the opinion that they could . The interest of the North was a manufacturing and protecting one , that of the South , Free Trade , and that of the West was involved in the distribution of the lands and Internal Improvements . " This " fierce war " of which Calhoun spoke occupied the period from 1815 to 1840 to the practical exclusion of every other subject and to some extent has persisted throughout American history and is still of consequence . In this guise , the civil strife in America went on . The great influx of English manufactured goods , which poured into the country in 1815 and 1816 , drove the American cotton and woolen goods off the market . Under any circumstances , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English merchants could export goods , and certainly were helpless in competition with English goods sold actually at a sacrifice because of the overproduction . The cry went up from the new manufacturers : having created us by the Embargo and the war , you must now protect our infant industries . The logic of facts seemed undeniable . Before the war , no manufactures ; after the war , flourishing industries ; the Embargo and the war had been equivalent to a protection of 100% ; therefore protection // could create industries , and by protective tariffs American industries could be enabled to compete successfully with underpaid foreign labor . The argument of course was applied to the encouragement of industries , necessary to the country , sure to be profitable if started , but whose rise was prevented by superficial and artificial difficulties of a nature to be readily overcome by the imposition of a duty on the foreign product equivalent to the difference between the cost of manufacture in America and that in Europe plus the cost of freight . The essential point is that no permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only fair to add that the enthusiastic supporters of the tariff scouted the notion that there was an industry which could not profitably be pursued in the United States . A low tariff had been imposed in 1789 and had proved its value as a money-getter by providing a sufficient revenue to meet the expenses of the new administration . Indeed , previous to 1860 , the tariff provided nearly the whole Federal revenue . In 1816 , a tariff was imposed , however , with the intention of protecting the new manufactures ; the duties were all raised and new duties on textiles were imposed , amounting to about twenty or twenty-five per cent of the value of the article . An agitation against the high tariff was at once begun in the South and in many of the interior districts , which had depended entirely on Europe for manufactured goods and which still depended on finding a market abroad for the great staples , tobacco , cotton , and rice . To their thinking , the new scheme was intended to force them to pay for the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounce their own particular interest , which lay of course in complete freedom of trade , and particularly in the ability to bring back into the country as large an amount of goods as possible in return for the product they exported . This they complained was unfair ; the interest of one section was favored at the expense of the interest of another . In 1820 and in 1824 , Clay and others fought valiantly // for " the American system " of encouraging home manufactures , and in the end their logic won the day . " We have shaped our industry , our navigation , our commerce , " Clay told the House in 1824 , E " in reference to an extraordinary war in Europe , and to foreign markets which no longer exist . . . . Whilst we have cultivated with assiduous care our foreign resources , we have suffered those at home to wither in a state of neglect and abandonment . " " We have seen that our exclusive dependence upon the foreign market must lead to still severer distress , to impoverishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some portion of our industry . We must speedily adopt a genuine American policy .

" The peculiar interest of the South had already been a subject of great concern and recognition of its seriousness had already been ample . Profit from cotton cultivation was even thus early seen to depend upon the ability of the planter to shift his slaves from the fields partially exhausted by successive crops to new virgin soil where the proportionate return for the labor was enormously greater . So great was it , that the Southerners regarded in the light of a calamity the arrival of the day when the supply of virgin land should be exhausted and the cotton-culture should be forced to become intensive instead of extensive . By 1819 , the whole of the land east of the Mississippi available for cotton had already been settled sufficiently to be divided into States and admitted to the Union .

The question of the extension of slavery was not at the time , however , of as momentous consequence as the preservation of the balance of power between the particular interests in Congress . The House , whose members were proportioned among the States according to population , was already con " THE // trolled by the States which found staple crops unprofitable and which could therefore not be expected to defend either free trade or slavery . In the Senate , where the States were each represented by two members , the balance between the slave and free States were exactly even , and had always been so , due to the admission of the new States in pairs , one free and one slave .

That the question should be not simply an issue of morals or of rival institutions but of the political power of great sections of the country whose interests seemed to be and certainly were assumed to be irreconcilable , was seen to contain possibilities which caused all to fear for the future . " The words civil war and disunion are uttered almost without emotion , " wrote Clay , 3 while Cobb of Georgia predicted that the Northern men had " kindled a fire which all the waters of the ocean can not put out , which seas of blood only can extinguish . " ' Clay even predicted the establishment of new confederacies , while John Quincy Adams entrusted to his diary thoughts regarding the desirability of dissolving the union and reorganizing it " on the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on , " so glorious would be its final issue , that as God shall judge me , I do not say that it is not to be desired . " 6 Almost calmly , Northern and Southern men considered the dissolution of the " confederacy " and decided that end not undesirable . Not yet was there anything approaching an agreement that the existence of one government , of one nation composed of all the individuals in America , either existed or could exist or ought to exist . The loyalty of men to their States had been transferred to their sections ; it was yet to be transformed into allegiance to the country as a whole . The difficulty was compromised in 1820 by the admission of Maine as a free State , of Missouri as a slave State , and by the division of the Louisiana Purchase into two zones , one , north of 36 ? 30 ' , which should be free territory , and one south of that line which should be slave territory . The West had yet to receive its share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1808 , Gal- footnote 3 Private Correspondence , 01. k Annals of Congress , 15 Cong. , 2 Sess. , I , 1204. 3 Memoirs , IV , 531 .

These would obviously be of great value if proper facilities of transportation could be provided . As yet , however , their inhabitants did not themselves possess sufficient capital to promote so costly an undertaking . The benefit would really redound to the country as a whole and furnished reason for the adoption of a policy of Internal Improvements by the Federal government . To the declaration that sufficient powers were not vested in Congress by the Constitution , answer was made that the right to charter a bank and to purchase Louisiana were not explicitly mentioned either . There was a general feeling that the development of the Southwest and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of those States against the East ; but to prove that roads and canals were necessary was to establish , to the satisfaction of the western men , the constitutionality of the power to build them . Was the Constitution made only for the eastern States ? In 1817 and 1818 , projects were introduced in Congress by Calhoun and Clay for a comprehensive system of internal improvements and in 1818 the national road from Cumberland on the Potomac to Wheeling was finished ; but nothing further was done till 1825 , when Adams approved of a broad project and over two millions of dollars were voted for the building of roads in the West . A plan was also mooted to distribute the lands reserved to the Federal government in the western States to settlers at My cents an acre instead of the rate of two dollars and a half already established . The appropriation of money for internal improvements and the tariff of 1828 , which raised the duties so much that it was promptly dubbed the Tariff of Abominations , roused the South to indignation . Calhoun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate that the tariff and the internal improvements were responsible for the low price of cotton and the high price of other commodities . The // tariff stole the profit of the cotton-crop by compelling the planters to pay a duty on the goods they bought with the proceeds abroad ; the indirect taxes of the government further depleted their incomes to furnish the money to build roads in the West . The attempt of the government to foster the interests of the other sections was injurious to the South . In South Carolina plans were made to " nullify " the obnoxious Federal laws by an appeal to the reserved powers of a sovereign State . In reality , the general commercial crisis of the period following the close of the Napoleonic wars was the cause of most of the difficulties in the South . The demand for cotton in Europe was not as great as before because the overproduction of the earlier years had been succeeded by retrenchment ; the production of cotton at the South had however increased by leaps and bounds and the supply was therefore greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in price was inevitable . On the other hand , manufactured goods had been abnormally cheap in the South because of the overproduction in England , the resumption of manufacture in Europe , and the growth of industries in New England . The supply in this direction had far exceeded the demand and had consequently reduced prices . The reduction of the output in Europe necessary to restore the normal balance between the demand and the supply had begun , however , by the time the tariff of 1824 was passed ; had raised the prices on manufactured goods considerably , and the increase was of course attributed by the South entirely to the tariff , whose avowed purpose had been to increase the price of foreign goods in America . Furthermore , in the States just north of the cotton-belt , in the tobaccobelt , the border States , as they came to be called , Virginia , Maryland , Kentucky , Tennessee , and Missouri , slavery was no longer as profitable as it had once been , and the commercial crisis had accentuated the planters ' troubles until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deportation to Africa of the surplusage of slaves . // To the excited Southerners , the union , the existence of the Federal government , seemed solely responsible for their ills . Did it not allow the North and West to pass the tariff ? Did not the Constitution recognize and legalize this sacrifice of the interests of a part and that too without possibility of immediate redress by legislative methods ? Of what value was such a union ? " I consider the Constitution a dead letter , " declared John Randolph in the House of Representatives in 1824 . " I have no faith in parchment , sir . . . . If you draw the last shilling from our pockets , what are the checks of the Constitution to us ? A fig for the Constitution ! . . . There is no magic in the word union . " The President of South Carolina College was cheered when he said in a public meeting that the time had come to calculate the value of the Union , and Webster later declared himself convinced in 1828 that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor by the Southern leaders . Was that whither the United States was tending , to separation into two confederacies ? When the value of the Constitution was calculated was there nothing but a piece of parchment , and no magic in the word union ? Senator Hayne of South Carolina had delivered a powerful speech in the Senate in favor of the old anti-national view of the central government . He obviously looked upon the union as a question of present and even temporary expediency , " nothing more than a mere matter of profit and loss , " complained Webster ; not as the embodiment and representative of a great and glorious nation but as a connection between the States whose beneficial operation was sufficiently doubtful to require constant and careful inspection of its working in order to determine the expediency of its longer continuance . When he declared the Constitution " a compact " to which the States were the parties , he denied that the Constitution had created a nation or that one existed . The States were sovereign , he insisted , had always been sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their sovereignty ; and were therefore , as parties // to the compact , obviously capable of judging whether the compact for the creation of a central government had been observed and whether or not it was expedient to continue wader it . The nature of the general government as defined by its own Constitution made it incapable of coercing a State which solemnly and advisedly declined longer to obey the Federal statutes . If the Federal government were to be allowed to interpret the Constitution and decide upon the extent of its own powers , the sovereignty , independence , and liberty of the States would disappear , and the United States would be , what its framers had never intended it to be , an entity in and of itself superior to the States , which would then be bound to obey its behests . To say that the Constitution prevented the Southern States from nullifying the recent oppressive acts of the Federal government would mean that those States had no resource against tyranny , save armed rebellion . He appealed to the founders of the Republic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions . His was , he claimed , the historical Republican doctrine , " first promulgated by the fathers of the faith , " whose triumph in 1800 had " saved the Constitution at its last gasp . " " Give us the Constitution of Jefferson , " he exclaimed , " give us the federal compact of independent sovereign States , . . . the Constitution of 1787 as its framers meant it and constructed it , and we shall deem ourselves satisfied and safe . " That Hayne had accurately described the idea of the Constitution held by the majority of people in most districts since 1789 it was difficult to deny ; that upon those assumptions every section of the country had planned secession and nullified Federal measures was equally incontestable ; but , if such were the truth , it was equally clear that no nation existed in America nor could be created so long as a powerful section of the community stood ready to contest the expediency and desirability of its existence . Hayne took his stand upon precedent and history , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // his criterion of the excellence of union . To his thinking , unless absolute unanimity of opinion existed , unless every State were convinced that its interests were furthered by the federal bond as it would itself have advanced them had it been wholly independent , the union was inexpedient . Webster , in his great speech in reply , delivered early in the year 1830 , took his stand upon the Constitution as it was , not as it had been thought to be ; the document itself , he said , would clear all controversies . IIe took as his test of expediency the welfare of all the States and insisted that the welfare of each individual State would be better served by union than by disunion . Above the States , he placed the nation : the Constitution was not a compact between States , sovereign entities , but a supreme and fundamental law created by the people of the whole country , making of them one nation . " The truth is . . . the people of the United States are one people . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to make them one people in these particulars ; and it has effectually accomplished its object . . . . It is the People and not the States who have entered into this compact , and it is the people of all the United States . " Webster took the highest possible ground and declared that a nation already existed , had long existed , and that the sovereignty of the States had been surrendered by the adoption of the Constitution . IIe thus decided in the negative all the issues Rayne had raised . The Federal government and the State governments were both limited in power ; both were founded by the people , and controlled by them ; but of the two , pending further action of the people , the Federal government was supreme . Upon it , through the Constitution , the people as a whole had conferred the right to decide all disputes as to the meaning of the Constitution . Secession and nullification by any State were under the Constitution impossible . " Sir , the very chief end , the main design for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish a government that should not be obliged to act through State agency or depend on State // opinion or State discretion . " From the Union had resulted safety at home , " national , social , and personal happiness . " In his peroration , he pronounced as a rallying cry for the men of his own day and of a later generation , the flaming words ? " dear to every true American heart " ? " Liberty and Union , now and forever , one and inseparable . " For the first time , the great majority of Americans saw what their Constitution actually said ; for the first time they realized that it proclaimed the creation of one nation ; for the first time under impressive circumstances , a man of prominence boldly proclaimed the actual existence of a nation , declared himself proud of it and eloquently argued for its " continuance . " The vision of nationality was seen ; it had now to be realized . ' It was even doubtful whether it would not be at once authoritatively denied . The jubilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What attitude President Jackson would take was not known . At a great banquet to celebrate the birthday of Jefferson , a series of toasts was arranged to put the issue squarely before the President and to force him to declare himself for one nation or for a compact of sovereign States . Amid breathless silence , Jackson pulled his lank form erect and gave his toast : " Our Federal Union . It must be preserved . " footnote 6 The truth of this statement can scarcely be better demonstrated than by quoting the conclusions of one of the keenest foreign observers who ever visited this country . Alexis de Tocqueville described what he saw and heard here in 1834-5 . " We ought not to confound the future prospects of the republic with those of the Union . The Union is an accident , which will only last as long as circumstances are favorable to its existence ; but a republican form of Government seems to me to be the natural state of the Americans . . .. The Union exists principally in the law which formed it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it forever ; but the republic has a much deeper foundation to rest upon . . . . It was impossible at the foundation of the States , and it would still be difficult to establish a central administration in America . The inhabitants are dispersed over too great a space , and separated by too many natural obstacles , for one man to undertake to direct the details of their existence . America is therefore preeminently the country of provincial and municipal government . " Democracy inn America , I , 425-6 . London , 1875. // The advisability of national government had been argued , its expediency questioned ; statements freely made that a second confederacy was far preferable to a national bond ; but there was little doubt that the North agreed with Webster and stood for one nation and rejected the notion of two . Characteristically , the difficulty was compromised . Where , in 1824 , the policy of the satisfaction of all interests had been espoused , Jackson pronounced himself in favor of the restriction of Federal powers and refused to assist any interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina must submit to Federal authority . At the South there was no desire to force the issue at this time ; they felt sure of obtaining what they asked by some simpler method than a test of strength . For the South had control of the Federal government and was growing so fast in wealth and strength that an equally rapid development of the North seemed hardly possible . There was little to gain , they thought , by actual secession and the concession of a victory to Webster in the forum did not seem materially to affect the real issue . The talk of secession was therefore dropped . To remove the most obvious grievances , the high tariff was repealed and a low one adopted ; the internal improvements which the West demanded were declared unconstitutional . As the West and South both objected to the existence of the United States Bank and attributed to its manipulations the scarcity of currency in their territory and their condition as debtor communities , the Bank was also declared unconstitutional , an " un-American monopoly , " and was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of Federal deposits in 1833 to certain selected State banks . The government declined to renew the charter , and completely changed the fiscal policy of Hamilton . Finally , after various expedients had been tried and rejected , an independent Treasury was established in 1843 into which the government 's funds were to be paid , where they were to // be conserved , whence the currency was to be issued and controlled , and by which , in general , the fiscal business of the government was to be transacted . If the advocates of nationality had now a theoretical victory in the forum , the anti-nationalist party had shorn the Federal government of such national functions as it had been discharging and had in large measure reversed many of its most important policies . Webster might be right as to what the Constitution said ; but States ' sovereignty would be safe until the people as a whole should read the document through his spectacles and should elect an administration to enforce his reading of its provisions . XVII JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY IT is not possible in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the significant constitutional development of the period from 1789 to 1829 during which the warp and woof of American democracy became thoroughly established , but it is essential at least to enumerate the conspicuous elements which practice introduced into the original concept . The democratic institutions which to-day exist in the United States are too firmly knit into the " bone and gristle " of the nation and are too clearly adapted to our conditions to have been " created " by any one document or by any one man . Because certain definite stages of development became perfectly clear at certain epochs , because certain men were largely responsible for informing the public mind of the conditions actually existing and for directing its choice of a remedy , we have been in the habit of writing about Hamiltonianism , Jeffersonianism , and Jacksonianism . In reality the theories and concepts , the administrative machinery by which we have actually been governed , are too complex and too numerous to have been produced by anything short of the slow growth of the community . " It is a great mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to suppose that the paper we are to propose will govern the United States . It is the men whom it will bring into the Government and interest in maintaining it that is to govern them . The paper will only mark out the mode and the form . Men are the substance and must do the business . " 1 The form of the Constitution was evolved in the various State constitutions made during the Revolution ; the federal idea came from an footnote 1 Hunt 's Madison 's Notes , II , 165. 229 // attempt to find some solution for the economic difficulties whose pressure was so seriously felt after the war was ended ; the first administrative traditions were created by the pressure of necessity and the genius of Hamilton . Jeffersonian democracy , on the other hand , was the product of the various attempts to interpret the actual document called the Constitution ; while Jacksonian democracy , in which we recognize the final product of American genius , was caused by the growth of the country , especially of the West , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States is a very large document indeed and provides for the doing of many things not foreseen by the framers of the " paper " and for the doing of many things they saw would be necessary , in other ways than those they deemed best . With the passage of the twelfth amendment in 1801 , the feature most admired by the framers was practically abandoned . It had not been thought desirable that the people should in any direct way influence the selection of the President , and accordingly an electoral college had been provided which the people should elect and which should then calmly and deliberately vote for the fittest man for the highest post , the candidate receiving the next largest number of votes , indicated therefore in the electors ' opinion as most desirable second choice , to become Vice-President . The electors were forced by the Constitution to meet in the various States and to vote in absolute ignorance of what was actually being done elsewhere . After the first two elections , it became apparent that some sort of previous agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great scattering of the votes and the accidental choice by a ridiculously small minority of some obviously unsuitable and objectionable candidate . So completely successful was the attempt at previous agreement in 1800 that Jefferson and Burr received the same number of votes , no candidate received a majority , the election was thrown into Congress , and an unseemly scramble for votes ensued , in which Jefferson , whom nearly every one desired for President , was almost defeated . // An amendment was at once passed providing that the electors should vote for both President and Vice-President instead of simply for President . The provision that the electors should meet in their own States was not changed . Despite the amendment , the desirability of a previous arrangement , generally understood , in regard to the fittest candidate was still obvious . Otherwise , the electors voted in the dark , practically threw the State 's vote away , and permitted the few States who would go to the trouble of a previous agreement to elect any candidate they chose , without giving the rest even a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate was soon seen to be as significant , and perhaps of more practical importance , than the right to select the man really preferred . It had been the habit in the various States from the earliest times to nominate candidates for executive positions in a caucus , composed of the members of the legislature , which met for the purpose after the regular session was over . The voters in the towns and counties could not spare the time to come to the capital and found it much more satisfactory to vote for or against certain men , whom their representatives from the legislative caucus told them were being voted on elsewhere , than it was to vote at random . This flourishing institution , the caucus , long familiar to all the members of the first Federal congresses , was at once employed to solve the self-same difficulty , and to its deliberations we owe the choice of Madison and Monroe . The electors were not compelled to vote for the caucus candidate ; but it was safer , for he invariably received enough votes to elect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excellent character but not widely enough known to cause that sort of unanimous decision as to their fitness which had been responsible for the choice of Washington and Jefferson . Indeed , by 1820 , it was seen that no candidate , however admirable , would stand any chance in opposition to the caucus candidate without the same definite previous agreement , scrupulously observed , to vote for him in enough States to command a majority in the electoral college . The congres232 THE RISE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE sional caucus had been invoked to prevent haphazard voting and had literally taken the choice of President away from the electors and put it into the very hands deemed most unfit by the framers of the Constitution , into the hands of the legislature . As each successive election more and more clearly demonstrated the power of the caucus and the fact that its nomination was equivalent to election , the advantages which would result from its manipulation were appreciated by the less scrupulous . In 1820 , Crawford , a politician of unsavory reputation and little ability , nearly secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . The fact that the people did not directly elect mattered little , for the electors had for years never used their prerogative of choice and had nearly always voted as directed by their constituents . The people were really robbed of their right to choose . To break the power of the caucus , to restore the right of selection to the people ( a right which it had already been forgotten had been thought most undesirable by the framers of the Constitution ) , an attempt was begun in 1822 to obtain by previous announcement and hard work a sufficient consensus of opinion in favor of some one man to enable him to defeat the next candidate of the caucus . Clay was nominated by the legislature of Kentucky two years before the election of 1824 and was soon only one of sixteen or more candidates , all nominated in a similar way , among whom Jackson was clearly most popular with the masses . The caucus , by this time thoroughly unpopular , was thinly attended in 1824 and nominated Crawford and Gallatin . Jackson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends in most of the States and something like a real vote by the people on all the candidates for President took place . Jackson , Adams , Crawford , and Clay all received a considerable vote in the order named , but none had sufficient for a choice , and Congress was after all to choose between them . A great deal of excited discussion and the passing // of promises between Adams and Clay finally made the former President . Mr. Clay 's adherents were strong in the House of Representatives and he was able to control enough votes to decide the matter in Adams 's favor , with the understanding , faithfully observed by Adams , that Clay should become Secretary of State . The result was loudly denounced by Jackson 's supporters ; the people had been again defrauded . Jackson had received easily the largest popular vote and a plurality in the electoral college , and had been " robbed " of his rights by the " corrupt deal " between Adams and Clay . War to the death was declared ; the most elaborate arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphantly swept into the presidential chair . While he received nearly double the number of votes in the electoral college that Adams did , the estimated popular vote showed something approaching equality , and the number of States in which the vote had been close was sufficient to give the opposition hope of reversing the result . The caucus was dead indeed , but it was even more apparent than ever that if the minority were to prevail or the majority maintain their position , both must organize even more carefully than before . The amount of labor involved in the method of nomination pursued in Jackson 's case was so great that it seemed hardly likely to succeed again , and much more likely to reproduce the situation of 1824 and throw the election into the hands of Congress . The campaign of 1832 , therefore , saw in the field a new organization , nothing more nor less than a caucus or convention chosen by the people expressly for the purpose of nominating a candidate and of formulating a policy . The name " National Republicans " was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party " platform " or policy announced . The Democrats promptly followed suit and by a similar convention nominated Jackson again . Thus originated the two great national parties , whose influence has dominated Federal politics ever since and which are the most important part of the machinery designed by // Jackson and his supporters to make effective the new democratic maxim , the direct rule of the people . As Calhoun put it , " Let the people have the power directly . " Needless to add , no idea had been further from the minds of the framers of the State and Federal constitutions . Colonial democracy had been a limited democracy where the fit acted for the unfit ; it had favored indirect influence by the majority , and had allowed the people in Federal government even less actual participation than in State government , restricting their share to the choice of the presidential electors , of representatives , and of the State legislatures which elected the senators . Indeed , the electors had been by no means infrequently chosen by the legislatures prior to the Jacksonian regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence in local , State , and Federal government and , whether or not as a direct result of his campaign , certainly universal manhood suffrage became the slogan in the States , and of course the States , having in their hands the provisions for the Federal suffrage , promptly projected manhood suffrage into Federal politics . Herein Jacksonian democracy differed from Jeffersonian democracy . Jeffersonian democracy had laid stress upon the proper scope of central government , upon the proper interpretation of the Constitution , upon the relation of the individual to the central government rather than upon the definition of " the people . " On the whole , its august founder had been content with the limitations upon the suffrage common at the time and had felt that local and State governments were in their existing condition almost ideal . He had been concerned with guarding the individual from the new colossus , Federal government , had been anxious to limit its province as much as possible , with the idea that the less direction the individual received from without , the better ; the freer he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to exert by an appeal to the judiciary , the better it would be for him and for the community . Could the strict interpretation of constitutions and laws beJACKSONIAN // come an actuality , all desirable results would follow . That elaborate machinery would be necessary to enable the people even formally to participate in elections and to influence the policy of the State , he declined to believe . After all , it must be remembered that the form of Jefiersonian democracy was largely due to the fact that it was a reaction from the Hamiltonian notion of a strong centralized administration which should effectively correlate and direct the energies of the individuals who composed the community . Similarly , Jacksonian democracy was a revolt against the machinery which had been developed to express a decision for the people . The people could act directly , must act directly , and needed no mediator . It was not Jackson , however , so much as Webster who gave the idea immediate currency and stability by showing a delighted and astonished public that their own Constitution vested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate power of decision . " It is , Sir , " said Webster in that famous reply to Hayne of 1830 , the people 's Constitution , the people 's government , made for the people , made by the people , and answerable to the people . " Upon Hayne , he cast the stigma of maintaining a notion repugnant to democracy , that the States and not the people were sovereign . The subtleties of Hayne 's doctrine he brushed aside ; its historical defense he ignored with magnificent assurance , conscious that for the first time the American people would see that States ' rights was in essence undemocratic and contrary to the notion of the supremacy of the people as individuals . That it was also an anti-national doctrine , he declared with eloquence , but this the people did not as yet grasp . It is this reading of the new Jacksonian democracy into the Constitution , the realization of what the words of the document actually said , the failure to know that he was not using the words " the people " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1830 speech a landmark in our constitutional history . States ' sovereignty was undemocratic ! The notion so completely harmonized with the interests and desires of the New // Englanders that it was caught up at once and became the basis of their political thinking . Behind the ideal of nationalism , Webster had definitely placed Jacksonian democracy and a reading of the Constitution whose cogency and accuracy it was impossible to deny . Historical evidence , quotations from the fathers , all were and always will be futile against Webster 's dramatic , eloquent reading of the words of the document . Moreover , Webster made the word " union " synonymous with nationalism , and made nationalism equivalent to strong central government , all of which he asserted was provided by this same democratic Constitution . Yet the idea of union was less potent in causing the popularity of the speech than the proof that the Constitution itself already contained the idea of democracy and popular rights , the proof that Jackson was right and the caucus wrong . Jefferson had been able to show the anti-nationalists that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant of power did not necessarily presume its abuse or even its use . It had remained for Jackson and Webster to prove that the Constitution explicitly enthroned radical democracy : ? that the interpretation of the document and of the powers granted by it rested not with the States or with the Federal officials but with the electorate . Along with this fundamental change in the notion of who were the people went the development of legislative , administrative , and judicial forms and traditions . The House of Representatives was soon after 1789 forced by the exigencies of the situation to develop the committee system , the rules for restricting debate , and the enormous power of the Speaker , which really to-day have taken from the House itself the power of legislation . As the Constitution was the work of Madison and Wilson , as the executive departments were the creation of Hamilton , so the machinery by which legislation is actually made in the House was distinctly the work of Henry Clay .

He made the // Speaker of the House more powerful than the President and raised that office to a height it has never lost . By 1830 , too , the transfer of the preponderance of legislative power from the House to the Senate , which has made the latter what it is to-day , the balance wheel of our legislative fabric , was well under way . The real Constitution of the United States by which we live was largely written by Chief Justice Marshall during his long term of office from 1801 to 1835 . The interpretation of the broad phrases and inclusive wording intentionally placed in the document by the framers to enable it to be adapted to the exigencies of times and occasions was a difficult task under any conditions . It was essential that something more than a few specific decisions should be made ; the general rules for the consistent interpretation of the document under all conditions had to be developed , tested , and applied to a sufficient variety of cases to provide the country with the definite body of constitutional precedents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and civil liberty the Constitution guaranteed him . In particular the clause concerning the powers of Congress required most careful treatment . It was at once obvious that only a tithe of the powers which Congress must actually exercise had been enumerated and that only a liberal interpretation of these clauses would permit the Federal government to legislate outside a very narrow range indeed . Jefferson and Madison had declared for the strictest possible construction and the unconstitutionality of every power not explicitly granted . Marshall , however , as Chief Justice , possessed an authority to interpret the Constitution which was denied the President , and the Constitution itself made his decisions binding law . To him we owe the doctrine of implied powers which permits Congress to legislate upon all subjects " necessary and proper " for compassing the ends for which the Federal government was instituted . Under this mgis the most important work of the Federal government has been done . The decisions of Marshall are actually as much a part // of the law considered binding in the United States as if they had been solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the extension of the direct control of the people spread with extraordinary rapidity in the decades following the election of Jackson . In the States , manhood suffrage was generally adopted ; the appointment of executive officers pretty thoroughly abandoned in favor of election for short terms ; the terms of legislators generally reduced in length ; and the separation of powers , long since adopted in theory , actually instituted in practice . Scarcely were these changes completed than the first of the great waves of immigration reached the eastern States and created new conditions in State and especially in city government . Soon the registration laws and laws fixing the qualifications for voters were being altered to admit these newly arrived members as citizens after shorter and shorter periods of actual residence , until , by the outbreak of the Civil War , boss rule , with its accompanying graft and corruption , had become thoroughly established in State , municipal , and local government in most parts of the country . In Federal government , a new rule concerning executive officials had been instituted by Jackson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To the victors belong the spoils " was the slogan of the army of officeseekers who stormed Washington in 1829 . There was no doubt a plausible defense : the chief executive must have around him " friends of the people , " who would execute his commands according to the spirit as well as the letter in which they had been given . Washington 's and Adams 's unsuccessful attempts to create a Cabinet from warring elements had early caused the general acceptance of the necessity of harmony in the immediate circle of the President ; but Jackson was the first actually to put into operation the principle of the " clean sweep " throughout the Federal offices . Thus the spoils system entered American politics and became speedily one of its best accepted maxims , whose literal fulfilment // was invariably demanded by the impatient cohorts and rarely denied . The period between 1815 and 1840 was a great formative period when protective and compromise principles were adopted ; when legislative , judicial , and executive traditions assumed the form they still retain ; when manhood suffrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aspects of democracy as the earlier generations lived it . Lastly and by no means least , it had been a period in which the bud of national consciousness had been bursting into flower among the people themselves . A new nation was slowly evolving ; and here and there an individual , seized with the consciousness of the great developments gradually unfolding , began to express in no doubtful tongue his notion of what that national spirit was and ought to be . Among those who influenced popular thinking , Daniel Webster again stands foremost with his great orations on the Pilgrims and on the Battle of Bunker Hill . He created a new conception of the colonial period and of the Revolution , national in its scope and expression , which was caught up into the schoolbooks children were given to read and on which men who later fought in the Northern armies were nourished . Weems had already produced eulogistic biographies of Washington , Franklin , and other notables , whose ready sale showed the growing popular taste for literature glorifying the endeavors of the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State 's welfare but obviously for the good of the whole country . By 1850 , the literature of American history had been further enriched by Irving 's dramatic tale of Columbus , by Bancroft 's intensely " patriotic " and nationalistic description of the history of America to the adoption of the Constitution . Sparks 's editions of the writings of the Revolutionary fathers were also intentionally prepared to inculcate a love of the country as a whole and an admiration for the men who had worked for our union under one government as well as for our independence from England . The poets of New England , Lowell and Longfellow especially , gave // voice to this growing sentiment of admiration for our national welfare . So far as the new country had any literature , it was written by Northern nationalists , a fact significant in explaining the strong sentiment in favor of nationalism in the North in 1860 . Of an identity distinct from other races , the individual American became acutely conscious about 1830 . Truth to tell , an idea that we were different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and became common during the Revolution ; but it was then almost certain to reflect as much local pride and satisfaction as a sense of difference between Americans and Europeans . Until 1830 , the feeling of a difference between Americans was still too keen to allow it to become apparent that the people of the whole coast had really begun to think of themselves as Americans rather than as inhabitants of certain States . With this acute consciousness of racial difference came at first an arrogance and a conceit which we find only too faithfully reflected in the pages of travelers . The American insisted upon the instantaneous recognition of the superiority of his country , and its institutions , literature , and culture , over all other countries and their qualities and graces . Crude , rough , ill-mannered as this spirit seemed to the sensitive Dickens , it is nevertheless to the historian unmistakable evidence of the dawning of a truly national consciousness , of the disappearance of the harsh lines which had kept the people so separated from one another throughout the colonial period . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinion on any subject had been attained , except on the one fact that America was different from and therefore better than Europe ; and until a clear consensus of opinion should reach a point at which the community as a whole became conscious that it existed , until it was no longer a matter of idealism but a plain inevitable fact , no nation , in the modern organic sense of the word , could or would exist . Still , all-unconscious , the nation had begun to try to think , act , and believe . XVIII THE TWO DIVERGING SECTIONS THE economic forces in operation in 1830 , which were swiftly producing south of Mason and Dixon 's line and of the Ohio River conditions more and more widely divergent from those north of it , are all connoted by the single word ? cotton . And cotton connotes slavery . In 1789 neither cotton nor slavery were factors of prime consequence ; in 1815 both were clearly of growing importance and were seen to be potentially capable of great extension . By 1830 , the increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been able to meet it , the astonishing profits , proved to the dullest minds that in cotton the United States had at last found the medium of exchange with Europe which it had so long lacked , and which with every decade was becoming more and more adequate . Indeed , many and many an excited planter and New England merchant saw in cotton the means of freeing the country from its long economic dependence upon Europe . They were ready to teach their children , in the words of De Bow , " to hold the cotton plant in one hand and the sword in the other , ever ready to defend it as the source of commercial power abroad and through that of independence at home . " The most obvious result of the cotton-culture had been to render slavery extremely profitable and to put an end to the talk at the South of the desirability of its abolition which had been so common in Virginia and in South Carolina between 1815 and 1825 . The vast increase in the cotton crop ? from about four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1826 , over eighty per cent of which was promptly exported ? of course greatly increased the exports of the United States and facilitated exchange with Europe . In-241 // deed , in the palmiest days of the old pre-revolutionary smuggling-trade , the ease and profitableness of trade with Europe had never been so great . The loss of the West Indian trade became each year of less consequence , and , as the country developed , it became clearer and clearer to Americans that the West India market , even if it had continued open to them , would have been inadequate to consume the whole swelling volume of produce . Thankfully , they realized their deliverance when the abolition of slavery by England in 1833 ruined her West India sugar plantations. and hence destroyed at one blow the original source of the commercial prosperity of the Atlantic coast . The problem of our relations to the West Indies had solved itself . There was now no recourse save cotton . The cotton-culture had also trebled the value of land and of slaves at the South . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . The stalks of the previous year 's crop were first broken down ; the field was then laid off into hods by plowing a furrow between the old rows and lapping on it from four to six other furrows , thus leaving the field in ridges about four feet apart . After the earth had been pulverized with a small harrow , and the center of the ridge split with a plow , negro women sowed cotton seed in the trench at the rate of about two bushels per acre and the trench was closed by dragging a sort of scraper over it . The young plants were thinned out with a hoe , a laborious task , so as to leave two plants about a foot apart , and , until the crop was ready to pick , the ground was constantly hoed or stirred every twenty days . Picking , a long and tedious rather than laborious occupation , consumed months , and when it was over the field gang began to break stalks and plow again the old field or to clear new fields of weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small number and rudimentary character of the tools needed , the constant but not exhausting labor all the year round , the profitableness of organizing labor on a large scale and of performing simultaneously the same task by great gangs of slaves , all made the cotton-culture ideally fitted for the use // of forced labor . The expense of maintaining slaves in comparative comfort was small in a warm climate where housing , fuel , and heavy clothing were not essential , and where the vegetable food abundantly provided by nature formed an important part of the negroes ' diet . Cotton , however , rapidly exhausted the land , and even virgin soil after two or three years ' cropping yielded a perceptibly smaller return . Since manure and fertilizers were expensive and little understood and since new land was plentiful , it became customary to abandon a field after a few years and move the gang of slaves to a new scene of operations . From this grew a tendency towards large plantations of thousands of acres where several shifts of operations could be made on the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then permit a return to the first field , which would have lain fallow long enough to recover its fertility . The profits , too , were indubitably greater from farming on a large scale and great gangs of slaves owned by comparatively few men were soon producing the bulk of the cotton crop . The extraordinary profit in cultivating the richest bottom lands compared to the more moderate returns from cropping the uplands promptly sent the more adventurous and ambitious into new districts and caused the rapid growth after 1830 of the territory along the Gulf of Mexico . A very large superficial area was at once occupied : the land sales in the five Gulf States in 1834 aggregated nearly three million acres ; and in both 1835 and 1836 , over five million acres . The rush of capital to the district was equally marked ; the number of slaves owned there increased 86% in the decade after 1830 , while the production of cotton increased 163% . From this expansion flowed results of consequence . The preponderance of slaves and of wealth shifted from the Atlantic coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia had owned three-fifths of all the slaves in the country ; by 1840 about two-thirds of the slaves had migrated to the Gulf States , and one-half of the total number were absolutely // dependent on the cotton-culture . By 1850 , nearly 80% of the total number of slaves were in the cotton States . The value of a good field-hand had risen from $200 in 1778 to $600 in 1836 . Indeed , compared to cotton , tobacco , the staple crop of Virginia and Kentucky , was not profitable enough to retain the slaves in the district , while in Tennessee and Missouri the profit of using slaves for agriculture was in no way comparable to that of selling them to the cotton-planters . Practically , the enormous success of the cotton-culture in the Gulf States and the consequent high price of slaves made it more profitable for the border States to breed slaves for the Southern fields than to cultivate any crop themselves . " Virginia is , in fact , " wrote a Southern professor in 1830 , " a negro-raising State for other States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton-belt where the slaves could be profitably used for the actual production of the staple ; but it perpetuated it in the border States where it made the slave himself a marketable and valuable commodity . " It is believed , " said Henry Clay in 1829 , " that nowhere in the farming portion of the United States , would slave labor be generally employed , if the proprietor were not tempted to raise slaves by the high price of the Southern markets which keeps it up in his own . " Certainly , too , the cotton-culture made the South essentially agricultural and essentially an agricultural community of one crop . As years went on , the amount of food raised proportionately declined , the amount of manufactured goods , even under the most liberal interpretation of that term , was so very small that the cotton States practically depended on the North , the West , or Europe for literally everything necessary for life . Other industry than cotton-culture aid all sorts of man a factures were dwarfed , discouraged , or prevented from developing . Where in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dixon 's line compared to their value north of that line had been about one-half , it was by 1840 only one-third , and had sunk by 1850 to one-fifth . Some growth there was , but relatively to the growth of manufactures at the // North , the South suffered an actual decline . The two sections were developing in different directions and certainly those geographical and geological conditions , which made the cottonculture so profitable in the South and which forced the North into manufacturing and varied industry , are mainly responsible for the contrast which plainly existed between them in 1860 . A Southern historian has made a careful study of the condition of Alabama in 1850 . Out of 750,000 people , there were 330,000 slaves , owned by 30,000 men , that is , by about seven per cent of the white population . About three-fourths of the total number of slaves , with nearly that same proportion of the land , were owned by less than 10,000 white men , from whose plantations came the great bulk of the cotton crop . The profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State were valued at ten million dollars annually while the imports were under a million . To New England and to Europe , the State sent cotton ; from the Northwest via the Mississippi and the Gulf she drew bread and meat . Some 75,000 whites and as many negroes derived a livelihood from manufactures , banking , and the professions . Until just before the Civil War there was no attempt at an organized public-school system . Alabama was a State of small towns and villages , of scattered plantations , with no large cities and little if any community life in the broadest sense . The figures given by the census of 1850 for the South as a whole prove these conditions typical . There were 347,525 slaveholders in the South , and something over three millions of slaves . " Of the large planters owning more than fifty slaves , whose elegance , luxury , and hospitality are recited in tales of travelers , over whose estates and lives has shone the luster of romance and poetry , there were less than eight thousand . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its geographical extent and its economic position , naturally provoked both North and South a vigorous and eager discussion of its cause , its methods , its morals , its expediency , and its justifiability . Societies for the abolition of // slavery or for its limitation were old in America , had been common both North and South in the decade following 1789 and in that following the commercial depression of 1816 ; but the vital changes in the position and importance of slavery , together with the general intellectual ferment which produced as dissimilar movements as the Sunday-school , the Mormon church , temperance and women 's rights societies , roused a section of the Northern people to agitate against slavery and led to the formation of a new type of Abolition and Antislavery societies by a new group of leaders , of whom the most remarkable were Garrison , Parker , and Phillips . Their propaganda , which seems to modern investigators to have contributed little to the outbreak of the War in 1861 , did cause a searching of consciences and in particular of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic status of slavery ; was it profitable ; was it fair , equitable , just , ethical , moral ; was it cruel , was it as good for the slave as for the master ? The discussion was carried on by both parties with a furious intensity , with the uncritical use of socalled " facts , " and with that sentiment and prejudice which are so certain to accompany the political discussion of any moral issue . While it is hardly profitable to-day to consider the detailed arguments advanced by either side , it may be briefly pointed out that the chief difference seems to have lain in the fact that the Southerners lived with the negro and treated slavery as an essentially practical economic question , while the Northern men , by reason of their lack of actual contact with slavery , were able to look upon it with a certain detachment and to apply to its difficulties moral and ethical theories drawn chiefly from their own widely different practi ml experience . The planter believed that cotton could not be grown without negroes and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of the problem raised by the juxtaposition of a superior and an inferior race except slavery . If any individuals then alive were to blame for the existence of slavery at the South , he felt some share of the // blame ought to be borne by the New Englanders whose fortunes had originally been based on the rum , molasses , and slave-trade during the colonial times . That cruel treatment of slaves occurred , he was willing to admit , but he claimed that on the whole slavery at the South in 1850 was as humane and considerate as it had ever been anywhere . Northern opinion more and more came to lay stress upon the moral and ethical issue , upon the claim that any slavery anywhere was of itself wrong , inhuman , and cruel . It pointed out that the trend of human development had been clearly toward the emancipation of the individual , and that the enlightened opinion of Western Europe in 1850 regarded the institution with abhorrence and had everywhere abolished it . Both sides employed many other arguments and illustrations whose truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument was that the truth on one side did not offset or answer the truth on the other . The Southerner , quoting history and the Scriptures , declined to listen to what he was told was the moral sense of the world . Nor was the claim that slavery in the South was in general humane and that no individuals then alive were in any way to blame for its existence , at all satisfactory to the excited Abolitionists who declaimed against it as a wrong in itself , whose very existence proved it wrong . After the dark days of the Reconstruction , it is hard to convince many sincere men that most negroes were not happier and better cared for under slavery than they have been since under freedom . In fact , the South raised the issue of expediency : how could we or can we do otherwise . The real difficulty was the existence of millions whose actual ignorance and incapacity made them economic slaves , literally unable to care for themselves , and not to be made capable and industrious by fiat . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuation of this situation by making it legally , economically , and socially impossible for the children to rise above the position their fathers and grandfathers had occupied . It was the clash between present and future expe248 THE RISE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE diency , a choice between the probable evils of emancipation with which men then alive must cope , or the postponement of the remedy for the evils of slavery to a future time . If we confine ourselves strictly to the point of view of 1850 , we shall be likely to agree that humane , sensible , honest men might find much that seemed cogent and convincing in either argument and be able consistently to espouse that side with ardor . Meanwhile , north of Mason and Dixon 's line and of the Ohio River , in the districts popularly known as the North and the West , an extremely different type of social economic structure was growing apace . Even before the Revolution , a difference in development between the North and South had been remarked by casual travelers , and by the inauguration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a truly stupendous growth in the North of diversified industry and in the West of more intensive scientific agriculture , whose reaction upon the social and political life of the community was exceedingly significant . It was not so much an increase in the output of Northern factories and Western farms which attracted attention , though the doubling of the wheat and corn crops and of the production of raw iron and the trebling of the value of manufactured woolens and cottons were sufficiently interesting facts . The normally rapid increase of the population , plus steady immigration , necessarily meant the application of more hands to the soil , enormous sales of land , more acres under actual cultivation , and hence ensured a great increase in total production . The remarkable fact was the undoubted gain in efficiency , the proportionally greater return from the investment of capital and labor than ever before ; the increasing variety of the output ; the rapid rise of new industries , and the steady development of a home market for home products as well as the manufacture of domestic products to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining on the South from the more rapid natural increase of the white population ; it was gaining immensely by immigraTHE // tion year by year , especially after 1850 ; and it was utilizing more of its natural resources more skilfully and adequately than was the South . This new efficiency was largely due to improved methods and to the invention of new machinery to perform the manual labor for which it was impossible to procure hands enough on the Western farms . The cast-iron plow , the mowing-machine , the horse-rake , the reaping- and threshing-machines , the horsecultivators and seed-sowers , all of which were in use by 1840 and all of which had by 1850 become practically universal in the West , were enabling a few men to do the work of a hundred hand laborers . And the North found that the increased output of raw iron , the better pig iron produced by the new process of smelting with anthracite coal provided the material out of which busy hands in Northern factories could form the machines needed by the West . Then , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weaving-machinery , the sewing-machine , changes in factory organization , cheaper machines due to cheaper iron and cheaper transportation , increased the proportionate output from the factories and reduced the cost of production . More people to be reached , living on a constantly greater area of land ; more produce to be moved , more markets demanding it , required and secured a tremendous improvement in the facilities of transportation . In 1825 , the Erie Canal connected the Great Lakes with the Mohawk and the Hudson Rivers , and was soon linked to a network of canals through the low watershed separating the Ohio River system from the Lake system . By 1840 grain traveled a thousand miles to the Eastern States more cheaply and expeditiously than it could have been moved a hundred miles a decade earlier . A vast acreage of land hitherto inacessible became available and to it flocked the ambitious . Soon canal lines were supplanted by the rapid growth after 1840 of railroad trunk lines which made transportation of all bulky goods still cheaper and greatly fostered the rapid development of diversified industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines , larger cars , stronger // rails , and enabled the railroads to haul longer trains of larger cars , each with heavier loads , in less time at constantly diminishing cost . As transportation became cheaper , districts were able to send grain to market which had never before been able to compete and were consequently able to afford manufactured goods for the first time . The increased supply of food enabled men in the East hitherto dependent on local supply to abandon the farm for the factory and produce the articles the West demanded . Yet , as food and clothes grew cheaper because of the improved process and the development of transportation , the profit to the individual seemed to increase on each transaction , and the bushel of corn bought more manufactured articles , and strange to say a yard of cloth or a pig of iron bought more corn . It was as if some magician had waved his wand and bade them all make one another rich . As the economic fabric grew in size , it developed in strength and complexity . Corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of labor unions attempting organization on a national scale had appeared . Particularly evident and gratifying were the increasing number of banks , the swelling volume of deposits , and the extension of credit facilities in the East . The amount of capital seeking investment had never been so great and proved the unquestioned soundness of the country 's development . Exchange through London for trade between the States was long obsolete , and the banking centers were really capable of handling all domestic business transactions . The complexity of the economic life of the North , the proportion of skilled workmen , the variety of industries , as well as the stability of the credit structure , were to be of the utmost consequence in the waging of the Civil War . Most significant of all , the new development depended upon cooperation and was profitable in proportion to the efficiency of that collective effort . This the North clearly saw . In the South , on the other hand , the individual was still isolated and was either unconscious of the greater possibilities of a more complex social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In the social structure , too , occurred striking changes between 1840 and 1860 , utterly transforming the aspect of Northern society . The population not only doubled but was able to remain practically upon the same area which had supported the previous generation . In earlier decades , no more people could live together in a town or city than the district could support , unless the ease of water transportation and the nearness of a great source of supply enabled them to import their food . But as the efficiency of the new farming by machinery enabled a part to feed the whole , and as the efficiency of the new factories made the labor of a part sufficient to clothe the whole , a larger proportion of the community than ever before was free to live where it pleased and could rely upon the railroads to supply its wants . Thus was made possible a new type of social unit , the modern industrial city , devoted perhaps to the production of a few articles and relying upon the outside world for all else . Concomitantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coal to heat them , of gas to light them , of sewers to drain them , of water-works to supply fresh water , made the rapid growth of cities possible and freed these hundreds of thousands of people , huddled upon the same spot , from the old menaces of the plague and the scurvy . The community had time to build cities and public works , and to supply the multifold new economic wants which community life in cities promptly created . It was becoming wealthy , beginning to have traces of a leisure class , able to afford systematically to develop its tastes in a variety of directions not essential to existence but imperative for culture and education . Theaters , magazines , books multiplied ; the opera and concerts became popular . Education received more careful attention and a considerable part of the swelling profits were wisely invested in school buildings and equipment , and the children could be , and were , left longer in school than ever before .
