Why is it that better wages , shorter hours , more physical comforts do not lead to happiness or refinement ? Why is it that social questions seem more hopeless than ever before , so that the student of philanthropy dreads to awaken a happy , dirty , lazy family to the possibilities before it , lest the last state shall be far worse than the first ? Because by thrusting the implements of the highest culture into the hands of those not strong enough to hold them safely , we have given sharp-edged tools to children . " When civilized man has more privileges than he deserves or requires , he lapses into practical barbarism . " The so-called improvements are seized upon not because of their value , but in imitation of others . The houses , furniture , food , ornaments of the great mass of the people are chosen because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need in one 's own consciousness which they satisfy . Is not this trait of mere imitation without the use of thought or reason a most serious menace to real progress ? Go through a great department store , note-book in hand , and check off the articles which are valueless either for use or ornament and those which , with a semblance of either , will lose the little SANITARY SCIENCE AND PRODUCTIVE LIFE . 2I value they have with the first day of use ; then go into the home for which the articles are destined and note the amount of money spent for these things in comparison with that spent for the essentials of good living and for the things which make for moral and mental advancement . The only practicable remedy yet proposed is education in true standards of living , in what constitutes better homes , more comfortable conditions , and in a clearer perception of those tendencies toward mere imitation and luxury which lead to degeneration of mind and body . What better method of determining these standards than by measuring them with the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health ? Any comfort , any expenditure of money which will increase health is legitimate , for health is not only the workman 's capital , it is the essential factor in the success of the author , the business man , and the pleasureseeker . But it is equally true that all above what is needed for healthful development is luxury and tends to debasement . An increased food-supply would be conducive to the health of the laborer , while the very abundance on the tables of those who take no thought in the matter may lead to over-indulgence and undermined health . Relief from daily drudgery will render the life of // many a woman more tolerable , but when it only results in idleness , dissatisfaction ; and a mania for shopping and the bargain-counter , such relief is not in the line of higher standards of living , but is in the nature of luxury , which undermines the health of the body politic and leads to sure decay . But it must be borne in mind that standards are not the same for all ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another , so powerful is habit and education , but each should have only that standard which proves conducive to the best health , and in this the development of sanitary science is of the greatest service . Standards of living should be regulated , not by money spent , not by servile imita-tion of others , but by that which will produce the best results in health of body and health of mind . At first sight this might seem to be pure material-ism , but nothing is better recognized to-day than that health includes contentment of mind and serenity of soul ; that an environment of pictures , books , and pleasant society will bring relish to the plainest food and serve to maintain the highest ideals . It is , then , not in the material portion of the daily living that we are to look for improvement so much as in the ideals , standards , aspirations , by which the uses of the materials are governed . And it is just in this particular that most of the recent discussion of household economics and woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seem to fail . It is taken for granted that if the material conditions of the home are ameliorated , if the kitchen is taken out of the house , if the charwoman lives outside , if the artistic decorator has been allowed free scope in the drawingroom , if the school teaches cooking and sewing , if the college teaches business law and economics , or if women receive the same wages as men and have the right to say how taxes shall be spent , ? that when any one or all of these things are obtained , then life will be all sweetness and light . But these material conditions , while having their value , do not in themselves go to the root of the matter . Their chief function is in the influence they have on race ideals , on individuals or group standards . It is in the perfection of control of matter by mind that higher civilization consists . The savage is dominated by nature ; the man is civilized in proportion as he dominates nature and bends hitherto unconquerable natural forces to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her servants , cheated by her tradesmen , and is helpless before her furnace and her cook , is still a savage , has not grasped the meaning of the ennvironment which we call home . A certain degree of exertion , bodily and mental , self-control and conscious direction of powers of mind , are essential alike to bodily health and individual development . When release from the necessity // of toil brings such bodily indolence and such mental indulgence as to result in lack of stimulus to useful activity ; when the throwing off of religious trammels renders moral questions difficult of decision , then this freedom tends to disease of body and mind . In other words , the moment ease of living lowers vitality and lessens resistance to disease , that moment the boundary between comfort and luxury has been passed . To have pleasure in living implies an ideal to live for , a goal to reach by striving . Where no incentive naturally exists , as is sometimes the case with those who have the traditional golden spoon , artificial prizes are offered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the women some hobby of collecting , of travel , of self-culture . In humbler life , to gain a home for wife and children , to secure an education for a loved son or daughter , is incentive sufficient to sweeten toil and shorten long hours of labor . To " rise in life , " as indicated by size of house , number of servants , or price of bric-a-bric , has been the unworthy motive of many a household , and in that way lies death to all the better ideals . It has been clearly brought out by several recent writers that the prevailing economic , political , and social ideals have been profoundly influenced by the acceptance of that law of evolution in the organic // world which counts the individual as nothing except as a factor in race progress ; which demonstrates that only the fittest survives ; that through the strongest are race characteristics passed on . The ideals governing the thought of intelligent persons a century ago were development of the individual and protection of the weak . This individuality is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall all weak-competitors . The methods of education , even , bring a whole class or school up to the same standard without reference to individual preference , and both tend to reduce to a communistic level all but the very few . Moreover in family life , as in political , irresponsibility has come in with the going out of the religious ideal . Self-sacrifice and menial toil are despised in the light of the economic ideal of the present . The home has ceased to be the glowing centre of production from which radiate all desirable goods , and has become but a pool toward which products made in other places flow ? a place of consu ? nption , not of production . Instead of a nursery of good citizens , teaching obedience , thrift , self-denial , self-helpfulness , the home has become for many a place of selfish ease , of freedom amounting to license , a receiving all and giving nothing . The family as a unit stands between the socialist // ideal of the individual as a unit and the economic ideal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joys of a future world could sweeten daily toil and flavor daily bread ; so long as the pleasure of giving to the missionary cause made an extra hour 's labor pleasant ; so long as saving for the children was a high ambition , little was heard of housekeeping troubles or of overdrawn incomes . When , however , the ethical and altruistic point of view became changed and from childhood each one considered his own wishes as of more consequence than those of the family , and when temptation was offered in the form of unheard-of luxuries on the instalment plan , and when food became abundant , representing high-class living , then a general recklessness possessed the household as well as the coal-miner or the lumberman . The housewife has but followed their example and paralleled the waste of small-coal in the mining region and the wholesale destruction of forests , by her garbage-pail and overfurnished rooms . She is not primarily to blame for the fact that average American housekeeping costs twice as much as is necessary ; it is due to the general reckless extravagance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are the standards , not of bare existence , but of good living ? of physical comfort , mental health , and spiritual satisfaction ? " // If your ideal , gentle reader , is that of the sleek tabby cat , plenty of food and sleep , the softest corner and no duties , then we have no message for you . To live is to appreciate the joy of being a part of the world of action , to share in the joy of work , and work for mankind ; this joy includes an apprehension of the possible meaning of it all . Most human actions are prompted by the desire to escape pain or to procure pleasure . These efforts will be successful in proportion as knowledge controls these actions . Human welfare includes health of mind as well as health of body , and sanitary science , in its broadest sense , includes all that relates to either . It is a knowledge of the practical standard of sound health for the community and of the means of securing it . Sanitary science not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage-earner by lessening his days of sickness , by so nourishing his body that it may serve him longer and with more efficiency , but it also furnishes the rules of conduct which make any man capable of the highest enjoyment of life by teaching him self-control in the use of all that goes to make up the sum of human happiness . " Children are workers in preparation , are future citizens . The state can not afford to allow them to grow up inefficient . " Therefore public welfare // demands that the home life shall be governed by the best knowledge which science has been able to gather with reference to health and efficiency . It is man only who has the power to see beyond the present and by resistance to its alluring temptations to secure future gain . Each human being has a money value to the state in proportion as he is a productive individual with either hands or brain . Not only death but sickness lessens the usefulness of an individual , since the care of one sick person means loss of work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means even more loss by the weakening effect of sorrow and anxiety . The higher the standard of living , the more costly do the accessories of sickness become and the greater the blighting effect upon the higher intellectual faculties . It has been estimated that on an average each death in a community means 720 days of sickness with its attendant cost in money and anxiety . For the standard of income we are now chiefly considering this may bring an actual expense amounting to even five thousand dollars . It may mean the crippling of the family as to the children 's education , perhaps loss of position of the father , perhaps years of wearing invalidism for the mother , and a loss to society of the benefit which an efficient family always confers . // When it is considered that the death-rate in America is nearly double that which is estimated as necessary , and that ten in every thousand needlessly die , half of them perhaps in the prime of life , that for a city of one hundred thousand this means five hundred deaths annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be seen why the study of sanitary science is so strongly urged and why the cost of the various departments of household expenditure should be considered not only in the light of economics and aesthetics , but of hygiene . If the requirements for healthful living can be once understood and an ideal held up to the young student while his habits are yet plastic , a great advance is possible in the pleasures of life and especially in the beauty of living in conscious obedience to the laws of life . CHAPTER III . HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE . DIVISION BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS ACCOR1 ) 1NG TO IDEALS . " National prosperity depends less upon the amount of wealth than upon the utilization of the national possessions in deriving the annual income . " ? Bur.I.Och . " Economy of time , effort , and materials , and therefore of expense , is in essence scientific . " " With a progressive people , the satisfaction of existence wants serves merely to arouse new desires and to stimulate men to satisfy them . " THE sum of ten billions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States for household expenses , and yet very little attention has been paid to the rational division of the annual income between the different departments . The business man has found it easier to make money than to save it ; the economist has been fully occupied in finding out how money was made . That the results of this outlay are not satisfactory there is abundant evidence . That the money is not economically used is seen in the rapid changes in habits of living due to economic pressure . 30 // Hence , before it is too late , a careful study of the conditions of life affecting the household expenditure should be made . The cost of living in any given case depends upon the ideas and standards of the person spending the money ; that is , it is a mental rather than a material limitation ; a result of education rather than of location . In America the typical family of the economist , of father , mother , and three children under the earning age , can live very comfortably on ten dollars a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material existence . Moreover , if its members will avail themselves of the education of the libraries , of the art museums , of the lectures and classes , of the baths and parks , pleasure-grounds , the non-material pleasures , and of the opportunities provided for the children at the public expense in most cities , their actual income is equivalent to double that sum . The real struggle in living comes in the case of those whose character and principles demand that they shall pay for the pleasures as well as the necessities of life , and in whom the desire for ownership demands the personal possession of books , and pictures , for which they are willing to deny themselves even comforts . An income of sixteen dollars a week or eight hundred dollars a year admits of this gratification in a fair degree provided that the // fines exacted for the disobedience of nature 's laws are not too heavy . Therefore , for the sake of argument , we may say that our present discussion begins with that sum , or the lower limit of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five thousand dollars ? since above that sum , as a rule , quite different elements enter ; i.e. , either much is given in charity or in the sustaining of public institutions , clubs , societies , or in collecting books , pictures , etc. , or in promoting sport or industries . While the same general and highminded ideals should govern the expenditure of the larger income , there is not that need of close calculation on some points ; also , in general , there is a far better business management of the larger income . In the present condition of American society probably the greatest difficulty is felt by those who have from fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred dollars a year for all expenses , because their tastes are educated and their habits acquired in such a way that twice that amount would be needed to make any approach to satisfaction , for each step only opens the door to another want , and also because they are rarely skilled in the use of money . A writer in the Fortnightly Review * has cleverly // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " average " of the economist . This man earns about six dollars a week . The " mean " American will earn at least ten dollars a week , and with the rapid rise made possible by better industrial conditions and the greater opportunities for earning money the " mean " American family should have fifteen dollars a week , with twenty in sight as a stimulus to exertion . From this class of intelligent , selfrespecting , self-supporting , industrious persons rises , in the very next generation , thanks to free schools and democratic plasticity , a group which are typical Americans whatever their grandfathers were . These are the educated persons in the community , young college graduates in business , professors and teachers in schools and colleges , clerks , small tradesmen , and skilled workmen . And the income of this typical family is from fifteen hundred to three thousand dollars a year . Such are the possibilities in the industrial conditions of America that it is not uncommon for it to rise to thirty thousand dollars before the children are grown . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home as at present conducted is not managed on an economical basis so far as money value or outward semblance of luxury is concerned . That it fails in the more important essentials of comfort is proved by the great increase // of , clubs and of hotel life . On what grounds , therefore , can the justification of individual homes be based ? Only on the conceded fact before stated that the home is the germ of Anglo-Saxon civilization . If the income is to be used so as to give the fullest satisfaction of human wants , there must be classification of those wants in order of importance and some restraint of unreasoning impulse . " Style in living " has no " standards , " no basis in morals , religion , or economics . The fashion of the day or the whim of the moment is indulged without a thought of the consequences to the next generation . This absence of safeguards , this letting down of ethical barriers brings countless temptations to extravagance . To reconcile the uplifting tendency of the struggle to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striving to seem richer than one really is and to avoid the debilitating effect of luxuries is America 's problem for the twentieth century . As has already been said , it is for those educated persons with one thousand to three thousand dollars annual income to lead the way in the studies necessary to be undertaken before any authoritative statements can be made , and to show what the public ought to have ; not always to cater to what the public likes . The cost of living should be so balanced as to secure the greatest comfort and convenience possible // without sacrificing anything necessary for health , physical , mental , or moral . A few examples of actual budgets will be instructive as illustrative of methods of attacking the problem . That very little variation is allowable until the lower limit of choice is reached is seen in a comparison of the expenditure of the " mean " Englishman and of a New York family in about the same walk in life . Nos . I to 5 illustrate the variety of choice . One family economizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses . No 4 is , it is to be feared , a very common American budget . No. 5 in the table shows what may be done by a thrifty family who will do their own work , and live in the suburbs where the garden reduces the food expense . No. 6 shows how many families of women economize . A widow , with a mother and two children , is a dressmaker and has her noon meal and most of the clothing for the family from her customers . Nos. 7 and 8 are most instructive as showing types in different localities , but illustrating what must be paid for the necessities of life . It is doubtful if either family could safely cut down on food . Dr. Engel has formulated four laws confirmed daily more and more . As Dr. Nitti says : " Laws of which , in all the family budgets I have examined , I have myself been able to prove the absolute exactness . " THE COST OF LIVING . TYPICAL BUDGETS . " The first law is that the proportion between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio to well-being ; in other words , the higher the income the smaller is the percentage of cost of subsistence . The second is that clothing assumes and keeps a distinctly constant proportion in the whole . The third is that lodging , warming , and // lighting have an invariable proportion whatever the income . The fourth is that the more the income increases the greater is the proportion of the different expenses which express the degree of wellbeing . " The less a worker gains the more he invests in food , renouncing out of necessity all other desires . " ( Bull . de l'histitut International de Statist. , 1887 , pp. 50 , 55 , 57 . ) From the examination of various budgets and from observation of many families , as well as from twentyfive years ' experience in housekeeping , I am convinced that the tendency to extravagance in the American household comes in the two columns Food and Operating Expenses ? if the latter include the incidentals or sundries and unexpected outgoes , which count up very fast . Individual extravagance may frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is largely one of waste . Twice as much is ordered as is really necessary , and in small families where there is no separate servants ' table , unless very great care is taken , large portions of the most expensive food are left to be served in the kitchen , so that the total cost of food is very high . If the ordering is left to the cook , this is sure to be so . It is for the interest of the grocer and butcher to have the bills large , and the tips they give to secure this would astonish many a man who now // wonders at the size of his bills . Only an accurate knowledge of how much is really needed , and a close watch over the amounts ordered , can keep the food cost down . It is policy to allow the common , inexpensive articles such as flour and sugar and potatoes to be used freely , but the quantities of meats , highpriced vegetables , and confections should be carefully calculated . One remedy for the extravagance and consequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more directions may be found in a system of strict account-keeping as a check to the impulse to purchase which is often repented of when too late . In order to render the accounts of value there must be certain recognized standards of possible attainment to serve as a guide to the young people in establishing the traditions of the new home . The following table showing a theoretical division of the several incomes may be helpful in some cases and may stimulate the family provider to keep accounts so systematically as to be able to give the several percentages along these division lines . I hear the protest arising from three fourths of my readers that life would not be worth living under these circumstances ; it would be bondage . I reply , not after the habit is once formed . Bagehot said , " There is no pain like the pain of a new idea " ; but on the other hand Mark Twain wrote , " You can not // SUGGESTED BUDGETS . throw habit out of the window ; it must be coaxed down-stairs one step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish , but once fixed they maintain themselves . The moral of which is that it will pay in the end to establish a custom of looking after the small details which will cease to be a burden after a few months . This is especially necessary if the help is constantly changing . Let the rules of the house be known when engaging any servant , then there will be no difficulty . Much of the confusion so prevalent arises because there are no rules ? no accounts . Again , the temptation to spend for things pleasant but not needful , or even beautiful , either for the household or for personal gratification are many , and // it requires some moral support , such as an account book or some great ideal to strive for , to keep the pocketbook closed . What the liquor saloon is to the drinking man the bargain-counter is to the aimless woman . The reason a young man fears to marry is not because of the present cost of a house , but because he can not estimate the future cost of running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most newly established homes there is no governing principle at the foundation to which both man and wife are committed and for which both are willing to make sacrifices . How far shall be carried the habit of saving , of lifeinsurance , etc. , is an open question . Certainly each family should be able to take care of itself under all circumstances , ? such as sickness , lack of work for a reasonable time , etc . The best investment is in the education of the children to be self-supporting , and all should try to " better themselves " as the phrase goes , because the whole community will rise with the elevation of individual homes . That a certain amount should be put by each year for an emergency fund goes without saying ; how much depends upon circumstances . If life-insurance is the best , then in that ; if savingbanks or bonds , or if in small amounts of cash , then in them This question will bear study ; but in all // cases each child of rich or poor should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking care of himself if he is ever called upon so to do . If a family has learned to lead a dignified , comfortable life on fifteen hundred dollars , it will not be difficult to spend more . It is only when the life has been badly adjusted that increase of income brings with it no answering response . If , on the other hand , the socialist limit of eight hundred dollars a year is to prevail , then the family that has had fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars has a better chance of being happy than the one that has felt pinched on ten thousand dollars . It must be said for tho ' 3e who advocate the eighthundred-dollar limit that they assume that much of pleasure , that all of the education , and many of the expenses now borne by private means will then be provided for by the state . At present we may , I think , take eight hundred dollars as the limit below which a family can only take care of its physical needs , ? rent , food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , education , instruction , it turns to the means provided at public expense , // Budget No. 6 is of great interest and value because it points to the underlying cause of the complaint of increased cost of living in the professional and clerical classes . This cause is the fact that desire for luxurious surroundings overpowers the principle of thrift and independence , and results in an expense increasing faster than income . This typical family with inherited literary tastes and college breeding intends to give the children the right atmosphere and education and therefore does not , as the father 's ( lawyer by profession ) income increases , increase the style of living , but allows the excess to accumulate for the future . The cost of several items is slightly increased as the years go on , partly because of the general advance and partly because of the larger number of social calls . The cost of books and periodicals does not represent the total as it would appear except for a system of circulation between the members of the same family living in the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burden and there is abundant time for interests other than mere eating and drinking . This town of three thousand inhabitants is typical of hundreds of American and Canadian towns in which are growing up a class of citizens to make the future of the two countries secure .

The family included husband and wife , one child one and one-half years of age , and a maid . They often had guests in for meals , and occasionally visitors for longer periods . When they wished to entertain formally they had luncheons instead of noon dinners , and had their guests for dinner in the evening ? a four-course dinner , soup , meat or fish , salad , and dessert . It is interesting to note , in connection with the amount expended for food in one year , that the same amount was paid for fruit as for meat and fish . // CHAPTER IV .

EDMOND DEMOLIN . THE factors governing the per cent of the income paid for housing are : 1 . Sanitary requirements . 2 . Social requirement ; location ; architectural appearance . 3 . Standards of living . The house is one of the most serious difficulties in the way of ideal living , for we have inherited the sins of our ancestors in tangible form and , in addition , those of conscienceless contractors and greedy capitalists . The family whose needs we are considering ? one 52 // with an annual income of fifteen hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing the conditions given above either for purchase or rent . Neglect of sanitary precautions by the owners of houses has been so flagrant that the expense of putting a place in condition to live in is often nearly equal to that required to build anew . The rapid , irresponsible growth of many of our towns , whole streets being built up before any system of grading or of sewerage has been established , has done much to keep the death-rate high . The frequent changes in streets or section due to the putting in of railroads or factories or to the intrusion of business necessitates as frequent removal , and to this is largely due the habit our typical family has acquired of renting instead of owning a house . The rent is a definite and certain expense , and a place of one 's own is , in the shifting condition of the modern town , a most uncertain asset and not the safe investment it has formerly been , and besides it is a continual source of unexpected expense . For instance , a change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a year 's rent . At present this feature of the cost of living can not be ignored , but must be reckoned with in any discussion of family expenses . It must be acknowledged that although some families do suffer exceeding discomfort in order that , judged by the house they live // in , they may be supposed to have reached a higher rank , yet an increasing proportion of intelligent young people are looking for better sanitary conditions as well as for social standing . Nevertheless the instability of the material home , the fact of renting instead of owning an abode , has made possible much of the retrograde movement in home manners and customs . While there should be an ideal which is independent of the mere material surroundings , as a fact results seem to show that it is lacking to a deplorable degree . It is for this ideal , this sense of the sanitary and educational value of the home cosmos , that education is demanded , that public sentiment needs to be created . An insistent demand would soon produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitary science demands . A home means four walls and , in this climate , a roof , into however many compartments the space so enclosed may be divided . Sanitary rules say that the space for each person should be not less than 300 cubic feet ; that light and air shall have access freely ; that water shall be freely supplied and quickly removed when used ; that the soil on which the structure stands shall be clean , dry , and porcus . These requirements must be met at whatever cost of money is necessary to procure them , and yet how many of the thousands of house-hunters in the cities // and towns ever think of these things , or , if they do , weigh them in the balance with the style of the porch , the number of bay windows , or with fashion as to street ? It is not only in the slums that there is insufficient air-space . So long as ignorant men and women will rent these closets under the name of rooms , so long builders will put them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the front hall , so long will the showy part of the house be emphasized . Economy of labor has not been thought of in the construction of houses . In what other business would the coal-supply be dumped on the sidewalk to be shovelled and wheeled into the cellar , only to be brought up again ; the ashes carried down , only to be again brought up and carted away ? How few of the really valuable mechanical appliances are found in a house ! How little attention is paid to the saving of labor ! The heaviest kettles are always on the lowest shelf , and articles of daily use are so placed as to require miles of travel . House-architecture is fifty years behind shop-building and factory-construction . It goes without saying that the ignorance of the housewife as to what is possible , and her traditional conservatism , are the causes for this state of things . The attention of students of social science should not be wholly absorbed in the so-called tenementhouse problem ; the needs of the higher-class wage56 THE COST OF LIVING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other object will be soonest accomplished . Example is more powerful than precept . I can think of no greater missionary work possible than that some philanthropic individual should offer a competition in house-architecture which should illustrate the possibilities of modern science , unless it might be the offering of a prize for the best essay on the living in such a house to be written by a college woman of five years ' experience in housekeeping . A house should be comfortable inside , capable of pleasing arrangements , and so planned as not to require excess of work to care for it . Here is true economy . The ideals and standards of life are what should rule . A home must mean more than four walls and food : it must stand for one 's self ; it must be an outer garment as it were , showing the taste and cultivation of its occupants . Exclusive of land , the cost of housing with the demands of modern life , water-supply , drainage , hard finish , etc. , is about one thousand dollars per person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five . It may be halved or it may be doubled in many instances without serious difficulty , except in respect to location . It may be quartered or it may be quadrupled , but these are the two extremes of requirement . One thousand dollars will build only // two rooms ( renting for ten dollars a month , one hundred and twenty dollars a year ) of a tenement , or five rooms of a suburban cottage , giving a minimum of light and air . Sixteen thousand dollars should build all that any family could use for themselves alone , so far as essentials go . Of course sentiment enters into rent , desirable locality , and the reverse , but too often cheapness means lack of water and air and cleanness , and dearness means bad taste in ornament or lavish expenditure for mere show . Our houses in America are mere extension of clothes , they are not built for the next generation . Our needs change so rapidly that it is not desirable . It is far better to spend less for the mere house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real life . Certain questions should be considered by each family . First , what is the object of the house ? What are its essential features ? There is great need of economic and domestic education among architects . It would be possible to add beauty to most family residences without detracting from their utility . Second , what proportion of the income should be paid for rent ? Sufficient to secure the requirements of health , even to half the income . This is not necessary if the family will avoid fictitious values due to supposed . superiority of neighborhood or to mere pretension in building . Without heat and light , twenty per cent of any income betwe ' n five hundred // and five thousand dollars a year should secure safe shelter for a family . If it does not , there is work for a social-reform club in that community as well as for the board of health . The fact that many families pay twenty-five per cent is the first evidence of unsound economic policy , but it may often be interpreted as a tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decrease elsewhere so that the sum total shall keep its proportion . The needs of the family should be carefully set down and the plan of life in the house made out before it is rented or built . Some measure of privacy should be secured to each one , and yet there should be one common meeting-place . The pretentious custom of a large drawing-room furnished for show , occupied only when receiving callers and consequently in which hostess and visitors alike feel the chill of dead things , not the warmth of daily emotions , is responsible for much of the housekeeping misery of the time . Unless the family is large enough and with a combined income amply sufficient to entertain frequently , this habit of keeping a large room for a possible wedding or a funeral is a vicious one . The space may be utilized for the comfort of the family in many other ways , either in separate sleeping-rooms or in a large living-room . All the mechanical arrangements of this shelter must be under control , that is , they must be underTILE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order that the cost of living in the house may not be in great excess of the comfort and health resulting . This is just as essential as a knowledge of the machinery he is to run is for the engineer who is obliged by law to have a license . If each householder were obliged to pass an examination on the mechanical arrangements of his or her house and show a knowledge of furnace , battery , and flue before being allowed to occupy it , a cry of state interference with private rights would be at once raised ; but in that day when it is clear that the carelessness of men threatens to extinguish the race it will doubtless be done . The office of the house is not only as shelter from the elements , not only as shelter from the curiosity and interference of the outside world , but as an expression of the persons in it ? of their ideals , tastes , education , and needs of soul as well as of body . Besides the number , size , and arrangement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the walls , the harmony of decoration , the arrangement of the furniture and pictures . This is not a matter of little consequence or of outside taste . A home is an expression of family ideals , else the place is a boarding-house . That women who are nominally at the head of households take the ready-made plans of landlords and decorators and only stipulate that all shall be as stylish as Mrs. So-and-So 's is proof of 6o THE COST OF LIVING . their low ideals of what a home means and of their unfitness to preside therein . Ignorance and inefficiency in the home are not good recommendations for the opposite characteristics in the business life for which they long . In no one item of expenditure is there so much room for the exercise of ideals , for the development of character , as in this one of providing the best surroundings for the family life . In no department are knowledge and taste of so much money value ? for it is not the most expensive but the most appropriate t and harmonious article which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently appreciated by the ordinary purchaser . Here again it is what others buy and not what appeals to one 's own need that leads to the spending of money for a multitude of articles which catch dust and become grimy or else require an undue proportion of time in a vain attempt to keep clean . It is certainly wiser to pay higher rent for a modern house than to spend much on furnishing an old one ; and if the house is so finished as to need little care , there is an additional gain : less paint to clean , fewer ! IF stairs to go over , gas instead of coal , ? all these things are to be considered in the total of this part of the living expenses . If the rent of a given house is low compared with others , one of three things is the probable cause ? THE HOUSE . RENT OR VALUE AND FUI:NIS111NU. dI undesirable neighborhood , an old house out of repair , or simply cheap construction . The householder must balance well the different elements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sanitary conditions and moral health of the children . The following are some of the questions which should be propounded by every householder : Is the soil dry ? Is the cellar dry and light ? Are the drain-pipes in sight ? Are the drain-pipes sound ? Does the furnace or the steam-boiler warm the house ? Has the bath-room an outside window for sunlight and a double door ? Has every room some means of cross-ventilation ? Will it be possible to keep the rooms clean without inordinate work ? Is there much cut , painted , or ornamented woodwork , etc . ? Are there many stairs , and inconvenient ones ? How many servants , if any , will be needed for the care of the house ? This subject will be more fully treated in the companion volume , " The Cost of Shelter . " CHAPTER V. OPERATING EXPENSES : FUEL , LIGHT , WAGES , AND INCIDENTALS . " Few women when they assume the care of a household know the exact value of the household plant ; the amount to be deducted each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually for rent , fuel , food , clothing , and service ; the number of meals served and the approximate cost of each ; the amount of profit , waste , or unproductiveness that results from all expenditures made . " ? Lucy M. SALMON . " Enjoyment depends on state of mind , comfort on habits . " " The complaint of one 's assistants is a boomerang . It writes the complainant down in large letters as himself poorly fitted for his responsibilities . " HAVING secured a comfortable , healthful house in a satisfactory locality , the daily life is to be established in it . It is to be warmed , lighted , and kept clean and in repair . In short , it is to be operated for the benefit of the family as a railroad is for the benefit of the public ; and the same far-sighted business sense should govern these expenses if the family is to find profit in the life such as the stockholders of a well-managed railroad secure as a result of their knowledge . 62 // The ideal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be held constantly before the eye of the household manager , and no ignorance or parsimony ought to peril either . A maximum of efficiency must be maintained at a minimum of cost . The compartment of the family purse from which these expenses are paid is usually like a sieve , retaining nothing for emergencies . No portion of the income can bring so much comfort , and none is so difficult to expend . Waste of money elsewhere is compensated by crowding down the wages or by cutting off items small in themselves but affecting the family happiness . This department also suffers from the lack of care in details which is required to keep any business at its maximum efficiency . The present only is considered ; nothing is used as if it were to be needed again . The common habit of handing down to the next generation valuable heirlooms having been lost , with it has gone that forethought in small daily duties which preserves for one 's own use one 's belongings , personal or household . It is this carelessness extending to children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running expenses of the house . Before a purchase is made , the labor involved in caring for it , or in cooking it , should be considered . // When a standard of living is once set , the cost of maintaining that standard should be considered . At this point our modern housekeeping is weakest . How much does it cost to keep a house of eight or of fourteen rooms ? How many hours of efficient service are needed for a family of five ? How much fuel should suffice for a suburban house of twelve rooms or a city House of the same cubic contents with fourteen rooms ? The reader will at once raise the question , is this not just that individual freedom , that variety of choice for which the earlier pages plead ? Are we to bring all our methods to one measure , and is each to pattern after the same standards ? By no means ; only each must have his own standard and ideal to aim for , and must not live from hand to mouth as do savages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact conditions . Because we acknowledge that there is more than business in the idea of home , let us not make the mistake of assuming that there is no business side to household affairs . No man in his senses will set up any other manufacturing establishment with as little regard to the purpose of it all and to the future success of its operation as he will allow in the inauguration of his household . OPERATING Ex1'I ; NSES . ( S Light should be regulated on hygienic principles as far as possible , and should not , as is often the case , be allowed to vitiate the air beyond reason . The way in which ignorance on the part of housekeepers blocks social progress is seen in the difference between the development of electric transportation and domestic gas consumption . The use of gas for fuel was proposed before the trolley line was developed , but at each step in the introduction of gas obstacles clue to ignorance of the relations of heat and of the management of mechanical apparatus have so far prevented the extension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utensils have not shown that grasp of scientific principles which is expected of other trades , and small wonder that it is words , not deeds , upon which they rely to catch their ignorant customers . The opportunity for the application of business principles to household management lies in the strict account-keeping which will check unrestricted expenditure on unessentials to the detriment of the fundamental needs . The engineer may design and put up an entirely satisfactory pumping-engine , but if an incompetent man is put in charge of it , or a competent man is allowed too little time to look after it , the machine rapidly deteriorates and finally breaks down . It is a common experience that after an occupation // of a year or two a house becomes unsanitary , battered , saturated with odors of cooking , or that on trial it proves to be inconvenient for the family life . If all the complex collocation which we call living gave real and lasting happiness , we might say that it was in the line of evolutionary progress . Since it frequently does not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early death , why should we not consider the possibility of greater happiness through simplicity and consequent perfection ; of greater satisfaction through the assurance that we have used our resources to the best of our ability ? I am told that the people of culture in New England fifty years ago paid one third their income for rent , but the annual expenses of the establishment were not in proportion what they are now . Life was much simpler , and the actual amount of work done was far less . The sanitary requirements of to-day were unknown . The handsome , simple furniture was more easily cleaned ; the dust-catching bric-a-bric was absent ; the laundry work was far less ; and while the service of the table was dignified , it was not so elaborate as now . There were no telephones , no gas , no lamps ( most time-consuming in care ) , fewer callers , more true hospitality , few brass pipes to clean , on the whole less sickness . We have gained in conveniences , but have lost in real ease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforts have greatly increased : soft rugs have replaced the sanded floors ; easy chairs , the straightbacked settle . But the knocker which announced the entrance of the visitor directly into the living-room is replaced by the electric bell , which calls a maid up one flight of stairs to the door , only to send her up another flight to announce the caller . Has any one ever calculated the foot-pounds of energy and the time consumed in answering the doorbell and the telephone in a modern house ? Has any housekeeper taken into account her increased demands as , year by year , these calls increase ? There is a constantly growing temptation to unnecessary expenditure for things small in themselves and pleasant enough , but not worth while , as would be seen if any effort were needed to obtain them . One of the gravest objections to the telephone in a house is the atrophy of all forethought which it permits . Why should careful account of the larder or work-basket be taken each morning if a yeast-cake or a spool of thread may be ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of courses at meals instead of serving all the food at once , but the cost in time has been increased by more than the number of courses . Yet the average housewife will maintain that the expense is no more . Let us try a readjustment of the different house68 THE COST OF LIVING . hold expenses before we give up the maintenance of the individual home . To-day it would be suicidal for a young couple of the professional class or of any class to pay one third of any income between fifteen hundred and three thousand dollars for rent , because the accompanying expenses of those things that make modern life are so much greater than they were fifty years ago . There is so much more moving about than formerly . Car-fares count up . The woman goes shopping daily ; the family go to the park to see the fireworks . The ice ; the tax on hose and faucets ; the cleaning of the furnace ; the cleaning of sidewalks , ? all swell the monthly bills . There is no mystery about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimating these expenses and of making repairs is shifted to the business man 's shoulders , and the woman has so much the less money to be responsible for . For those who are busy with other duties , who travel or who are getting on in years and who can afford to pay for relief from care , a well-built apart-ment house may be a blessing , but as a family home for children it is a most extravagant luxury , and like other luxuries causes deterioration in the race . Perhaps we shall be obliged to give up the family home for a time in order to find out how much it is worth , but it would be better for a few intelligent // women to first experiment scientifically , in order to put the subject on a practical basis , and then to publish their results for others to study . A social settlement for the study of the domestic questions pertaining to the life of those whose incomes are three thousand dollars a year would , I believe , be more valuable than one for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reader will say it all depends on standards . True ; but sanitary standards can not be so far different for different towns . One railroad does not differ so widely from another in cost of running its cars that no estimates can be made from known facts . How long should it take to clean a chamber or to do the chamber-work of the family of three or five ? It would not be difficult to settle this if women were amenable to reason or if they had any training in mechanics , se/ that they could tell whether the person were wasting time and strength in passing to and fro ten times where once would serve . The following estimates are given for the purpose of a definite point of departure for the study , which the writer hopes and believes will come . For instance , with an annual expenditure of $3000 , $50o for rent , $5oo for wages , $5oo for operation , $700 for food , $300 for clothes , $50o for the higher life may be allotted . If this does not prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or clothes must be cut down or a cheaper house taken . In deciding these problems , there is ample variety to keep up interest in life and to prevent all persons from falling to a dead level . If two teachers , clerks , artists , desire an independent home life , a place of their own to come to after the day 's work , it is quite possible to secure it in the following manner : Assume the income of each to be $750 a year . $15oo will be the sum to be expended . Set aside for rent $300 , for food $375 , for service $15o ( since there are no children and each will take care not to make unnecessary work ) , for clothes $250 , for savings or emergency fund $200 ; leaving for travel , books , church , charity , lectures , and amusement $225 . The last three items , amounting to $337.5 dollars each or 45 per cent of the total income , may be varied according to the individual choice without affecting the other items . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to prevent it from becoming a state burden is an ideal or a standard which must be cultivated . The happy-go-lucky way brings debt , disgrace , and that dependence which is debasing . The ratio between rent and wages must be made a study in economics interpreted in the light of sanitary // science before a rational settlement of the service question can be secured . And no great advance in housekeeping can take place until this is done . Agricultural labor suffers because when a boy is man-grown he receives man 's wages whatever the quality of his work . There is no opportunity for discrimination in values and for rise of wages . So in house service good work is not appreciated or rewarded , and the same wages are paid to a slow or slovenly maid as are offered to a quick , neat worker . No reward in the way of release from duty is offered for the quicker work , but only more and often unnecessary work is added in order to fill the time , in the same spirit in which the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the bill of fare . When the stage-coach carried its passengers and the mails over dangerous roads the driver was perforce a man of energy and resolution , of shrewd observation . The horse-car with its guiding rails required less of its driver , and the position fell to those who could do little else . Now the electric motor has changed the requirements , and in the suburban motorman we find many an old stage-driver and the same type of quick-to-act , capable man . The moral is plain : change the requirements of household service by inventions and arrangements // which demand skilled labor , and the labor will come to it . The unexpected forms a large part of life , the larger , the more complicated it becomes . No good manager is without a fund to draw upon for emergencies . In the household , debt usually comes because the fund has not been reserved . This one principle if insisted upon would lessen the nervous wear of housekeeping by an incalculable amount . In many respects the average housewife is yet a savage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in none more than in this failure to estimate correctly the future possibilities in the small household expenses . Dr. Munsterberg maintains that the one thing an American does not economize is time , and as regards the household I think he is right . There is rarely any system by which the maids are taught to carry out one thing when they go for another , to do the thing first upon which all the rest depends , to accomplish the most for a given number of steps . It will be at once said , " But they do not wish to be told , they like to spend time in trifling . " Possibly ; but it is human nature to enjoy results , to see something done and not forever doing . My point is that the cost of living is greatly increased by the neglect of the householder to estimate // carefully the amount of time it should require to accomplish the end arrived at and the waste at every step of the day 's work . Until better habits , business habits , are brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess over a rational estimate in actual labor , and at least as much more for inefficient labor . For the ordinary city household where cosmopolitan standards are adhered to , and where there are children and social duties , it is estimated that the sum paid for wages should be one half that paid for rent or what would be paid if the house were not owned . In many cases , in fact in a majority of houses renting for three hundred to eight hundred dollars per year , two thirds the rent is usual ; and if the mistress does nothing herself and is not a systematic business woman , the rule should be that the wages paid for all the work about the place , temporary as well as permanent , should be equal to the rent . This may be lessened in two ways ? by greater simplicity , or by the members of the family sharing in the duties . It is hoped that statistics may be gathered on this point as a basis of confirmation or refutation of the charge that too much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little on the care of them . Sanitary science demands freedom from dust , quick removal of all refuse , and absolute cleanliness . This // means time and strength as well as constant watchfulness . The other operating expenses , ? fuel , lights , express business , fares , stationery , water-tax , and newspapers , ? those things that are not permanent , but go to make the comforts of life , ? should be kept in amount equal to wages , for the more servants there are the more some of these expenses will increase without corresponding increase in satisfaction . A large part of the present cost of this class of household expendi ? ture is due to an increased speed in running . In the test of the new British cruiser " Highflyer " it was found that with a speed of 121 knots per hour 2135 horse-power was required , but when she was run at 20.1 knots the horse-power was 10,344 , or nearly five times for an increase of less than two times . The greater the speed the more rapid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the cruiser 20.1 from 19.4 knots , an increase of only . q , than to drive her the steady rate of 121 knots . In our household life we are living at the rate of 20 knots an hour , with the consequent wear and tear on the machinery and without realizing the necessity of increased outlay if the machine is to be kept efficient . Much ' of the expense complained of in modern plumbing is caused by the neglect of the most obvious precautions . // In no other department of household life than in the care of details is the contrast greater between the old-fashioned housewife and the mistress of the modern apartment , and in no other line is there so great need of applied science , ? that science which can not be learned from books , but which women must acquire or resign their position . In engineering science a careful study is given to reducing friction in order that a given amount of power may yield the calculated force . In the household the " running " of the house is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay most to give thought to the reduction of the wear and tear . In regard to fuel the sanitary view must be the first to be taken . The house must be so evenly and thoroughly heated as to preserve the health of its inmates ; and since their circumstances vary as to age , habits , occupations , clothing , etc. , each must be governed by these requirements , only there must be a recognition of these needs and not an ignoring of them . The heating-plant is the heart of the house for eight or nine months of the year , and must be looked after by the most intelligent and responsible person in the house , ? one who understands the chemistry of combustion and the mechanics of draft . The coal-bill might be reduced by one half in most households and the health doubly secured under these circumstances . // To recapitulate : After all is arranged as to house , furnisnings , and supplies , there remains the daily use of all by the family , supposedly for their comfort and pleasure and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use involves an expenditure in time and money which may run up to one quarter or one third the whole income . The efficiency of any business is estimated very largely by the economy shown in the running expenses . Since the housewife chiefly spends money , should she not he reasonably sure that she is getting the full measure of comfort for her family from the expense she incurs ? In fact , a knowledge of the cost of operating a house of a given number of rooms for a given number of people should be considered before building , buying , or renting . The time required to care for furnishings of a given style should be taken into account in buying , and above all must this side of housekeeping outgo be carefully estimated before a given standard of living is decided upon . I venture to state that a majority of the failures in housekeeping come from the actual excess of the outgo in this direction over the estimated need . It is the unexpected , the unprovided for , which eats into the bankaccount . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be scaled down to make it possible to come out even . Have fewer rooms , less furniture , fewer courses at dinner , windows washed less often , and in other ways bring down the outgo of the pennies which leave so large a gap in the household purse . CHAPTER VI . FOOD . " Half the cost of life is the price of food . " ? ATKINSON . " Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread , and your labor for that which satisfieth not ? " ? ISAIAH IV . 2 . " Courage , cheerfulness , and a desire to work depends mostly on good nutrition . " ? MoLEscHo'rT . " The removal of the predisposition to disease is the most thorough-going way of making all infectious disease iunpossible . " ? H UEPPE . NOT all other influences put together can equal in profound effect upon the welfare of the household that exercised by food and the attitude of mind regarding it . The well-nourished child is a happy , strong little animal , making brain and muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hearty , efficient member of society , contributing his share to the common stock of public good as well as enjoying his own work and pleasure . There is little fear of disease for either child or man , since the best prophylactic is a generous store of blood-corpuscles both red and white . The human body in normal condition has a well-drilled army of " phagocytes " ( white blood-corpuscles or leucocytes ) to which the 77 // man needs to give no directions . But if he neglects to take suitable food or to keep himself warm , if he becomes frightened or takes drugs , his faithful army is paralyzed and the enemy finds easy entrance . The condition of this army , like that of any other , depends on its commissariat . If the food-supply is just right , the soldiers are vigorous ; if it is wrong in any particular , they are weakened . Nothing can take the place of food in the human economy . Therefore the poor man is justified in spending two thirds of his income , if need be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under-nutrition . The protecting army may be incapacitated by indulgence in food , may be poisoned by ptomaines or narcotized by alcohol or tobacco . The body tissues may become weakened under the strain of excess , and irritability , disease , and death may follow . Food habits should be formed by young children under careful guidance . Until there is a generation which is well trained in this matter very little progress in the use of food as a means of securing human efficiency can be made . So long as food is looked upon either as a disagreeable necessity or as a means of merely sensuous pleasure the child will grow up with whims and fancies which will prevent the best physical development . For the human race as a whole it has been shown that at least half the cost of life is the cost of food . Food is the essential condition of life , and the race FOOD . 7 9 instincts in regard to it are so fundamental that as a rule only stress of circumstances affects any sudden change . The growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in all nationalities , because of that instinct of self-preservation by avoidance of the unknown which was essential in the early stages of race development . Only since knowledge has replaced instinct , and readiness of adaptation to environment has produced cosmopolitan man , can there be said to exist a science of nutrition which has been founded on a study of the fo ) d habits of a great variety of peoples under a great variety of circumstances and on the results of experimental feeding of animals . As a result of these studies it may be briefly stated that a condition of complete nutrition should be aimed at but not overstepped . It is the belief of most students of economics and sociology that it is the overfed among the nine tenths not submerged who are being eliminated by the various diseases of modern life , ? apoplexy , heart-disease , I3right 's disease , etc. , ? and that the sterility of the better-placed portion of the community is largely due to the plethora of food and drink which induces the eating of more than the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetites are stronger than they need to be under existing conditions . " 8o THE COST OF LIVING . Unless some form of restraint is imposed in place of that asceticism and frugality with which religious ideals safeguarded the more intelligent classes in the past , the present type is likely to die out and " a more primitive man will come forward to try anew to solve the problem of the highest civilization . " Self-evident propositions may be stated as follows : Food is that which supplies the body with such substances as are necessary to preserve it in health and to supply it with energy for daily work or play . Food materials as a whole should contain those substances in sufficient quantities and in suitable proportions . Food materials should not contain anything injurious , nor be so prepared as to develop any injurious qualities . Food materials should not be so stored or packed as to produce by their decomposition any secondary substances which are in the least degree detrimental. * Good health is essential to efficient production of energy and to the enjoyment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must include the idea of efficiency if man is to live up to his opportunities . Food is not only the workingman 's capital , it is the cultivated man 's bank-account . FOOD . tit It is because I believe in the possibility of control of even economic conditions by ideals firmly held by a sufficient number of fathers and mothers ( who alone , according to Patten , count for much in race progress ) that I urge so strongly the dissemination of what scientific knowledge we have , and the importance of gaining yet more facts about food and its part in human welfare The moment when a family is released from the bondage of race instincts and habits as to food , in that moment danger begins for them . Unrestrained appetite in this as in other directions leads to loss of efficiency ; therefore education must come to the rescue . If the proper study of mankind is man , then the study of that which makes him a capable , efficient member of society and not a wretched dyspeptic or a shell of walking contagion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other department of household expenditure is there so great an opportunity for the exercise of knowledge and skill with so good results for pocket and health . No item of expense is so fully under individual control . The house stands out for every one to see . Clothes are scrutinized and commented upon ; if attempt is made to economize in fuel , light , and wages , it is sure to leak out and be put down to a niggardly soul . But in most families there is ample // margin in food from which to take a respectable slice without harming any one . If the family is a close corporation , no one will be the wiser for the time and thought which the mistress puts into an esthetic as well as nutritious table . If the typical servant is required to follow the same plan , she will probably rebel and give warning rather than live with a mistress who measures the sugar and counts the potatoes , so hopelessly wasteful have our habits become . It is not the food actually eaten that costs so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by excessive quantity , and by purchase out of season when the price is out of all proportion to its value . Good judgment as to the amounts to be prepared , as to the harmony of the meal , the blend of flavor ; as to the right appetizers ; and good humor and cheerful conversation , with the most attractive setting and perfect serving , will cut down the cost of almost any table one half . Many seem to hold the idea that hospitality requires the setting of a double portion before the guests , and this alone doubles the cost of food in some families . It may be rightly said that the knowledge of this perfect table involves expensive training on the part of the mother or mistress , and that it will be cheaper for the family to go to a hotel where the chef is paid to do this for a thousand people True , this is what a large number of American citizens think , and if it were not for the increased death-rate // and the alarming prevalence of nervous breakdowns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is another side : fancies and flavors and combinations may be better provided for by one who has had long experience of the tastes of the family than by the chef who suits the average of a thousand . Also the health and manners of children may be more carefully watched at home . And if bright faces and merry hearts gather about the home table in fresh cool air , sweet with the favorite flowers , will not the quiet , the restful atmosphere soothe the tired nerves more than the strange faces , the glare of lights , the rattle of dishes of the restaurant or well-ordered hote ' ? even though the noise is drowned in music ? In sociological work is it not considered a great step when a family is persuaded to gather as a unit about the table instead of each taking from the bakeshop or the cupboard that which will serve to keep soul and body together ? No other symbol of comfort and well-being has been so universal as the family table , and yet many intelligent women are advocating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civilizing agency . The home can not be looked upon as an eatinghouse , as a laundry , as a sleeping-place ; it is the school of life , and anything which renders it more efficient is worth paying for . The cost in money or // time is not to be for a moment grudgingly cut down . What if the parents spend all they can earn , is it not well invested in the next generation ? The cost of living must be measured by the results in flesh and blood and brain , not in houses and lands . Hence we say : the ideals toward which the family is striving come first into discussion before the expenditure can be rightly judged . The home is for the children , not merely for their nutrition , but for development of character ; and that must be the only criterion of its true economic value , not in dollars and cents , but in the character of the men and women which are the product of the homes just as truly as the cloth is of the loom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify the maintenance of the small group , which we call the family , as the unit of the social state . Everything about the home must be judged by its bearing on character . An experienced charity-worker objected to the New England Kitchen on the ground that she could not replace the educational and disciplinary value of cooking for her poor women . It is in the deeper meaning that excuse must be found for keeping up the custom of eating at home , for it can not be justified on economic grounds . The family table is an educational factor of greatest importance to the children There , as nowhere else ; are inculcated the virtues of self-control , self-denial // ant speech . The children 's table presided over by the ignorant maid and the hurried service of the adult has much to answer for in modern life . Whatever it may cost , however uneconomic it may seem , ? in the wider view of the aim of all living , let us keep the family table even if much that is set upon it comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , msthetic , and ethical value . When housekeeping is reorganized on a business basis the present waste and drudgery and dirt in the house-kitchen will be abolished , and along with the soap-making will go the soup- and bread-making  - -  the heavy kettles and greasy dishes . The cleaning of fowls , the trimming of vegetables will be done out of the house , and that bite rzoir the garbage-pail will be reduced to manageable dimensions . More refined ways of doing the necessary tasks will make the work a pleasure and yet , as I believe , will keep the family circle intact . I do not wish to be understood as relegating food to the realm of mere necessities , but I do maintain that the relation of the food-supply to health must not be overlooked or thrust out of sight . The difference between food as an animal need and as a source of pleasure as well may be likened to that other process of combustion and source of heat , the fire on the hearth . The black air-tight stove gave the necessary heat and was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with the latter comes a sense of cheer , of companionship , of worship , that is worth all it costs . It is this same sense of pleasurable comfort , of an actual accession of strength , which is given by a suitable meal in a harmonious setting . As the useful heat of the fire is not wanting , however great its beauty , so the useful fuel-value of the food must be considered under all the accessories . There is here the additional variable , the power of the body to utilize the bountiful gift . The very charm of the surroundings helps to this provided there is not positive harm in the ingredients or their combination . Much of the present cost of food is in the exceeding cleanliness necessary in dealing with the animal foods which are so liable to harmful changes . The right attitude of mind toward food will make its choice , preparation , and serving that which in earlier times it was ? a worship , ? and the office that of a priestess . It was not by chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It served to impress the importance of the right view of food upon primitive peoples . It is just as wrong to ignore food or to hold it of little value as to consider it too much . The health of the human body means sufficient food if the individual is to do his or her work in the world . // Mrs. Bosanquet writes : " Women are supposed to be able to live on a much less wage than men of the same social standing , and this is largely because they accept a much lower standard of living . That is , they are content with less food , less comfort , narrower interests , and less recreation ; and this reacts through their impaired vitality by making them less efficient . The woman needs less ' it is always argued as a reason for woman 's lower wages , but she needs less only in the sense that it costs less to maintain a low physical standard than a high one . " Bullock ' says there are five ways in which fully one fifth the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often fails to provide adequate nutriment . In this manner ten per cent of the income is squandered in  - -  i . Needlessly expensive material , providing little nutrition . 2 . A great deal thrown away . 3 . Bad preparation . 4 . Failure to select rightly according to season . 5 . Badly constructed ovens . This waste if checked would give an increase of income which would appreciably lift the family to a higher plane of efficient life . I am so often asked for definite menus and for a list of articles of food which can serve a family for a * Economics . // given sum that I am forced to the conclusion that there is very little knowledge as to what good food is or what it costs ; that the decision as to what to furnish to the table rests upon what other persons are * known to buy rather than on any individual judgment . This is either childish imitation or foolish following of fashion . Even the writers of cook-books and teachers of cooking have too often followed instead of led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as in any other . Before we can make definite statements we must have definite knowledge . Most of the work done by the United States Government has been among those supposed to waste most in food materials , those with an income less than five hundred dollars . What is more needed is information as to what it costs to live well for a family with fifteen hundred to three thousand dollars a year ; for healthful , appetizing food at a sum not exceeding twentyfive per cent of the income . When we get budgets from a large number of these families we shall be able to formulate much better than now the rules for the expenditure of this part of the income . Extensive studies of the composition of food materials and of the amounts consumed by man under widely differing conditions show that sufficient raw food material for health and production of energy // may be secured anywhere in America within reach of a railroad for nine to ten cents per day per person , provided the appetite is strong and natural and not influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for intelligent workmen whose wives understand both buying and cooking , and also serves for large establishments kept at public expense , such as prisons and almshouses . Eighteen to twenty-five cents per day per person is the most which , according to our estimates in Chapter III , should be spent by those whose incomes are one thousand to fifteen hundred dollars per year . And the knowledge now available for the housewife will allow her to do this satisfactorily , provided that the aims of the family rise above the pleasures of the palate . This sum is sufficient for collections of three hundred to five hundred persons under one roof , ? schools , hospitals , and institutions supported by charity , ? again provided that the right spirit of cooperation exists and that a scientific attitude of mind can be maintained . Twenty-eight to thirty cents is the maximum limit for such institutions and for families who are eager for the higher pleasures of living and have not money enough for both . Thirty-five to forty cents spent with discretion is ample for colleges , paying hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purveyor , cook , and serv-ing maid , each and all , do their duty after they are furnished with the proper appliances . Only when the income of a family of five individuals , including servants , rises above four thousand dollars a year should an expenditure of fifty cents per day per person for raw food materials be looked upon with complacency , unless the momentary pleas-ures of the palate are preferred to the lasting pleasure of health and the satisfaction of the higher nature . From what has been said it will be seen that the aesthetic value of the table can not be realized unless the highest intelligence in the house makes it his or her care . I must say that some of the most perfect examples I know are those in which the man of the house " puts his mind on it . " I believe it would be greatly to the advantage of the health and happiness of the world if this part of the housekeeping were for a time done by men , for then they would systematize it as they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The difficulty would be that they would not be satisfied with the economic waste of using as much effort and time to prepare food for four as is needed for fourteen or forty , and the common dining-room would prevail . The American woman has been much slower than the American man to grasp the meaning of the // proper setting by which to increase the enjoyment of food . The club table is often a model feast , while , since she no longer cooks the meal herself , the housewife has washed her hands of all care for the essentials and wasted her energy on the foolish abundance of entrees , sweets , and bon-bons ; she has not learned to keep the air of her dining-room cool and fresh and has not taken pains to make the meal an intelligent feast ; above all , she has not trained the children to eat for life and health , but allowed them to sacrifice both to mere habit and whim . As a result her expenses are large , her health poor , her children peevish , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she longs to give up housekeeping and board . Most of the women who have written upon household economics have shown how smoothly life would run if there were no kitchens , and have advocated caravansaries where a common dining-room should serve as an amusement-hall . If it were only the drudgery of preparing the three meals a day , this would be a safe solution , but the efficiency of the individual depends almost entirely on his food . It matters little whether his house has a Gothic window or a Mansard roof , whether the lining of his coat is of silk or of cotton , as to the number of miles he can walk or ride , or the business he can transact , but it does matter whether he is able to extract the full number of calories from his breakfast . // Let food and its accessories be once established on a standard of health which means latent power , and not upon fashion , and the college president will be no longer able to include cooking with millinery in the same ignoble category . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many visits are made to the shops to select fabrics and trimmings ; but the cook who is responsible for the upbuilding and preservation of the body is chosen haphazard and the food ordered by telephone . Not until it is generally known how much the food has to do with human welfare will it receive the attention it merits . Let the housewife once grasp this idea and she will fit herself to carry it out . Let the young woman who has longed for a career in medicine turn her attention to keeping sickness away , and so devote herself to bringing up the sum total of human happiness . Patten says : " We now have a fair chance to test the theory of the dominant influence of scientific habits of thought on public opinion . Dyspepsia is becoming prevalent . A dyspeptic is in the same uncertainty with regard to the effect of what he eats that the primitive man was in regard to his ability to get something to eat . The result is the same ? a victim of superstitious fancies and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstition would he as rife as it was in the middle ages . " The race is to be helped , not by argument , but by a relief from dis ease , and this sanitary science is trying to accomplish even against the will of the victims . The following table taken from No. i6 of the Rumford Kitchen Leaflets may be helpful to those desiring to study the cost of food . CHAPTER VII . CLOTHING IN RELATION TO HEALTH OR CLOTHING AS SHELTER . " The pursuit of things fashionable for the sole reason that they are fashionable is not an exalted occupation and is , indeed , I think a somewhat sheeplikeattribute . " ? FREDERICK TREVES . One of the strongest human wants is the society of one 's fellows . " ? BULLOCK . " Possibly . . . because of their strong social ambitions the manual workers in America more than elsewhere adopt a costume that is not sensible or sanitary ... . " The cost of clothing enough for comfort is comparatively small , the amount spent for ornament is comparatively high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net to catch air , which is the best known non-conductor of heat . Even in a temperature greater than that of the body , the airspace prevents the penetration of heat . Recent experiments indicate that several layers of different substances and a loosely woven texture are most advantageous . Loosely woven wool is rich in air ( 87% air , 13% solid substance ) , is elastic and soft , has little contact with the skin , so that in addition to the contained air there is an isolated layer between the garment and the skin . It is 94 // also characteristic of wool not to be wet by moisture , hut to allow it to pass through and evaporate . Cotton over wool becomes saturated and soon gives the odor of decay . Fine , smooth linen is dense , poor in air ( 42% air , 58% solid substance , when starched , no air ) , has close contact with the skin and so feels cooler , conducts heat away more rapidly , has little or no air between it and the skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin-waste in the smallest space near the skin . It takes thirty times as long for a given quantity of air to pass through linen as through wool tricot , hence there is little circulation . That cotton and linen bear washing by unskilled labor is the greatest argument for their use . Some modes of weaving may inclose as much air in a cotton or linen mesh as in wool , but the fibres lack elasticity and tend to become matted and saturated with moisture . Silk lies between wool and linen . The skin needs to breathe , as it were , hence air and moisture should have free but slow passage through all clothing , and the products of excretion , which would tend to clog the free action of the skin , should not be retained . Habit has much to do with clothing certain portions of the body , hands , etc . The skin becomes non-breathing to a certain extent , but knees and wrists , where the arteries approach the surface , should be protected from sudden changes . To foot-gear the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important , as is also circulation of air , free evaporation , and protection from too rapid loss of heat . Air from next the skin in stockingfeet gave only one tenth the amount of carbon dioxide found when a narrow close-fitting boot was worn . Stockings of cotton conduct heat one third faster than those of wool , the thinner , less elastic layer preventing circulation of air and holding moisture . Leather , if loose and soft , approaches wool in the property of not conducting heat . As it is more dense and " filled " with water or enamel , it becomes , like linen , a good conductor . Loss of heat by contact with a cold surface depends upon intimacy and area of contact . Protection by clothing from the rigors of climate is a distinct advance , as it enables more energy to be used for other purposes . Rational clothing has the greatest useful effect with the least material , it does not interfere with the free movement of any part , and acts as a dietetic measure , lessening the quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excess of clothing , on the other hand , leads to tenderness of skin and delicacy of appetite which ill prepare the individual to surmount the obstacles nature has interposed . It is not so often the insufficiently clad person who catches cold as the one who is superabundantly dressed . This is not a treatise on hygiene , but a discussion of certain points in sanitary science which bear on the cost of living ; and in the cost of clothing we must include // the aesthetic , just as was done in the case of house furnish ing and of food . In this there is an unlimited range of possibility , and only certain ideals , rigidly held , will save the exchequer from being unduly depleted on this account . Costume ? outer dress ? may be quite independent of clothing , but it should not interfere by tightness , weight , or impervious material with the true office of clothing . Clothing in excess of physical needs must meet resthetical needs which are as real ; when a garment does neither , but is a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be said to have little value . To feel one 's self well dressed is essential to self-respect and moral equilibrium , but the realization of the term depends on one 's own ideals and not on the fashion-plates . To be perfectly fitted , to have lines and colors becoming to one 's figure and complexion , to be whole and clean and neat , and to have the clothing a part of the personality ( " It looks just like her " is a great compliment ) , this it is to be well dressed , even if coat and hat are three years old . Each family has ample room for choice as to which aesthetic sense shall be gratified after the hygienic essentials are satisfied . It may be clothes , it may be food , it may be pictures , it may be furniture , it may be travel , but in our families it can not be all of them . When the choice is guided by principle and not by fashion the // fami'y will rest secure in their reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . Love of display , of that color which will attract atten-tion , is an instinct inherited from our savage ancestors . An attribute of the early man , it has in the course of evolution reached the woman . As was natural when women were left without the home industries which served as absorbing occupations for them , they began to turn their attention to themselves and to allow free play to an untrained fancy in the clothing of themselves and their families . With the factory cheapening fabrics and becom-ing unscrupulous in the use of evanescent dyes , nearly all articles of clothing used for outside display have degenerated , and waste of money in this direction by those who need it for other things has become shocking . No other form of sense-gratification seems such a mania with women ; their freedom from household occupations has certainly not been well used for the most part . It is not uncommon to find a woman who has sacrificed the well-being of herself and her family to a love of display . With these we have nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated , cultivated families to whom the things of the intellect and of the soul are more than mere material show , to whom a decent exterior life which does not exhaust the energies nor debase the higher aspirations is sufficient . This love of personal adornment , then , is one of the greatest obstacles to a wise expenditure of money in // dress . A savage trait , it is utilized by the money-hunter to attract his game by means of the expensive dress of his womenfolk . But worse than all else ' in its effect on the morals is the same lack of care ' h preservation of material and garments which is seen in furniture and food . The tendency is to use everything as if once were the only time it would be needed . Here again the school must come to the rescue and prevent the next generation from making the same mistakes that have been made in this . The argument is used that it makes better business to cater to these manias ? to manufacture showy materials of so poor a quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for and repair the old ; but it were better that business should not be made for the aggrandizement of the few than that the many should have their ideals debased . Whatever may be said of the morality of a factory for the making of idols for sale in the East , or of printing cloths of barbarous designs and color for savage islanders under the pleas that they want them and will have no other , in a civilized country those who cater to the wants of its own citizens should be forced by public opinion to use their capital and their skill in ways which will elevate and not degrade the ideals of the people for whom they work . No great or sudden revolution can be expected , but a strong pressure can be exerted if intelligent persons
