THE motor stopped . Looking ahead of us , I saw the road barred by a group of men , evidently much interested in something going on in front of them . " What 's the matter ? " I queried of the hired chauffeur . " They 're playing ninepins . " " What ? " " Ninepins . Do n't you see ? We 'd spoil their game if we went through . " It sounded too absurd to he true , so we climbed out of the car and advanced on foot . Neither the noise of our horn nor our approach attracted the attention of these sturdy Breton peasants who had set up their Sunday game in the broad high-way , regardless of their own or oth-ers comfort . As we came up with them a handsome chap threw a sou into a hat on the ground and took his position . Four pins fell . " May 1 have a shot ? " asked our chauffeur from behind , thereby somewhat arousing the curiosity of the group . " Certainly . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I have one ? " " Will madame honor us ? " It may seem incredible , but when half a dozen pairs of wistful gray eyes were turned toward me I was suddenly seized with stage fright . My hands trembled , and in my anxiety to outdo myself I missed my aim . One pin fell . It was apparently a foregone conclusion that H. would try to redeem the family honor , and he was invited to take a shot . Seven ! The contents of the hat , minus two pennies , set aside after each game to supply drinks for the party , were poured CX X into H. 's hand . I ca n't say that the enthusiasm over his triumph was general , but when they saw him throw down a ? coin and recommence a game , the somewhat tightened lines of their sallow faces broadened out , and one or two actually smiled . The morning sun had climbed high into the heavens when the last game came to an end and our chauffeur beat a hasty retreat in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you going to touch glasses with us ? You 're not going away without letting us drink your health ? What was the use of playing ? " The clamor was so genial and so general that we quickly made up our minds to have the motor follow us , and started off with the group . Besides , it was noon , and a gnawing feeling made me hope that luncheon might be procured without going any farther . The inn to which they led us was clean , bright , and cheerful ; the hostess round , ruddy , and cordial . Our short promenade across the village had proved that it contained enough rickety old houses , tumble-down mills , water-logged shipwrecks , and grinning old salts to satisfy the most ardent desires of any young painter and to busy him during an entire summer vacation . We decided to stay . We became quickly acquainted with the village and its inhabitants , thanks to our hostess , who seemed to take an immediate fancy to us , and whose chief delight was to hear us talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welsh and Breton , but , as my native tongue had nothing in common with either , I was somewhat puzzled , and never entirely comprehended why our conversation plunged her into such ecstasies . It seemed that she even relieved her one maid of the duty of serving our breakfast , attending to our wants herself in order to indulge this inordinate passion . At first I thought it was mockery until one day 1 beard her lauding us to a neighbor , saying that her guests were " si savants , ' knowing how to " baraguine le pliche-planche , " and apparently understanding what they said to each other . Of distractions there were none . The village was too small . The only incidents that occurred to break the absolute calm of the place were the homecoming of the fishing-boats , the weekly market , and the arrival of the diligence . Young and old never seemed to tire of visiting the fish-market , for as soon as the first sail would enter port a huge hell was rung , and from all quarters one could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the only persons financially concerned were the half-dozen buyers for the neighbors ' sardine factories . As to the diligence , that rickety old conveyance , probably the last of its kind , would rattle up before the inn every morning , bringing passengers and par-cels of all descriptions . A halt would be made for lunch and then the task of reloading would commence . It was certainly amazing to see our sturdy hostess standing on a ladder passing up bundles , with a muscle that would have been envied by many a militant suffragette , and I often wondered how equilibrium was maintained once the coach was duly charged . One morning the load was heavier than usual , while inside there was but one passenger , a rather timid young salesman who was making his first journey in those parts . Madame Guillou was disconsolate , for the old coach had about all it could carry and there were still a basket of chickens and an unfortunate baby calf to be put somewhere . The coachman , already upon the box , was becoming impa- tient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guillou cast a despairing glance about her , and , climbing down from her ladder , called to a farm-hand standing near by . " Here ! You ! Help ! " The two seized the calf , Madame Guillou opened the door of the coach , and the unfortunate animal was tossed into the presence of the astonished knight of the trade , while the coachman , relishing the joke , let his whip fall on the horses and off they went . The old man who passed me the ball for the first shot at ninepins that Sunday morning turned out to be the village miller , and he and l soon became fast friends . For while my husband was painting the mill from every conceivable point of view , I used to go in and watch the miller at his work . He seemed sad at times , and after I grew to know him better I ventured a question or two . " Sad ? Yes , perhaps . " " Why ? " " Because after me no one will ever grind in this old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To-day people go to the grain-elevators and are buying prepared flour more and more . " " But your son ? Wo n't he continue your trade ? What is his business ? " " He is in the navy , like all the other lads of this part of the country . They go there because the nation demands three years of their lives as a tribute ; they stay because they 've learned the trade . They marry as soon as they become quartermasters , their wives seek situations as cooks or maids in the big cities , and the old folk are left to bring up the children . If they have been fortunate , three or four years after a campaign the family is once again united , buys a little plot of ground , and starts the building of a house to which the master will return when he.receives his pension at forty-five . " It was thus that old Philippe Carentec came to escort me to the spot where he was superintending the construction of his son 's future home . " All the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it costs so much to build . " And I was obliged to pinch myself in order to grow enthusiastic over granite blocks and slate tiles . " But why on earth did n't you build of brick ? Think of the time and labor saved , not to mention the economy . " " But , madame , brick lasts only eight hundred years ! " My American practicality was squelched . I had forgotten for an instant that I was in Brittany , the home of the past , the country of tradition . To his unremunerative trade of miller , old Carentec added one for which I have been unable to find a name save that of " village blesser . " For he was a goodly man and every fortnight could be seen going about from house to house purifying the hearths with holy water and mumbling various orisons . In his own humble dwelling lie had a strange collection of saintly statues , crudely hewn out of wood , most naively painted , but venerated by all the peasants of the outlying country . Carentec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf for the sum of five sous . But for fifty centimes , statue and blesser would come to your home to enhance the miracle . For example , Saint Eutrope was supposed to be a protector against dropsy , Saints Ravin and Rasiphe against wasps and hornets , and Saint Hilarion against witchcra ft . " But why witchcraft ' I can understand dropsy and hornets , but I fail to see the other point . In this enlightened age it is n't possible to believe still in sorcerers . " My language was evidently too complicated for him to grasp , for he looked at me with such an astonished air that 1 repeated , " There are no sorcerers here , are there ? " " Why , yes , of course . " " Bah ! " My incredulity , instead of arousing his indignation , seemed merely to strengthen his belief , and in a very polite but superior fashion he advised me not to speak scoffingly of the Black Arts , as he should hate to have any ill luck befall me while in Brittany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Can you point him our to me ? " Father Carentec took down his coat from a nail , clapped his hat with flowing ribbons on his head , and we starred to walk briskly toward the farther end of the village . About a hundred yards from the mil ! we were passed by a tall , thin peasant with piercing gray eyes and long black hair hanging about his cars . His face was familiar to me , and I often wondered why he had cast such sullen glances toward us when we had met before on the road . But when , after a gracious bow , Father Carentec passed on , and presently explained in an excited whisper that he was the sorcerer , I understood . We were strangers , outsiders , foreigners . He hated and dreaded us . Ca rentec pointed out his house , a presentable structurewith a large garden surrounded by a wall . Everything he might need for his wellbeing or comfort was furnished him through the credulity of his fellow-citizens , and all because he was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mesmerizing persons . When 1 first mentioned him to our innkeeper 's wife her smiling face fell and a little frown gathered on her brow . " Be careful , madame ; he has extraordinary powers . If vou get on the wrong side of him he 'll have the wolves run after you at night . Why , only last week Madame Mahe , who sent for a doctor for her sick husband , instead of consulting him , had half her chickens stolen by a three-horned devil who spit flame . The poor dear soul had such a fright that she is still in bed . " A few days later we walked to Guingamp to spend the afternoon . We were delayed starting back , and night had closed in before we emerged from a little side path which we had taken in order to shorten our route . By the time we reached the highroad leading to the village it was as dark as pitch and the sea wind was howling dismally in the pine-trees . The Mahes ' isolated cottage was the first sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hideous groan and a clanking chain met my astonished ears . I must admit that I shrank closer to H. , and that when a white , vision-like form darted across the road I grabbed his arm in terror . " Come on ! We 've got the scamp this time , " hissed H. in my ear as he sprang forward . I followed , and the phantom , who had evidently guessed our intentions , instead of evaporating or disappearing into the ground , took to his heels and fled . The race was not long , however , for , hindered by his flowing draperies , the ghost was soon overtaken . H. seized him by the nape of the neck and presently the two were sprawling on the ground . In a moment 's time we had our fine fellow bound by his own sheet . " Here , carry this , " said H. , thrusting a large market basket into my hands , and , taking the gibbering peasant by the collar , he started to march him toward the inn . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fright , and I plunged my arm into the basket , only to give a little shriek and hastily withdraw it as three frightened chickens audibly resented my investigations . Our arrival created a sensation , and our now harmless captive slunk into the corner near the chimney , sheepishly hanging his head . " That fellow is no sorcerer ? he 's a thief ! " said H. " Go and fetch me the mayor and the gendarmes . I 'm going to have him arrested . " No one moved . All seemed too fearful of the sorcerer to raise a hand against him . " Here , " said H. to me , putting his hand into his back pocket and pulling out a revolver , " take this , and if he moves while I am gone , shoot him . " The inn gradually filled up , but the awe-stricken crowd was silent . Madame Guilluu , on her knees in one coiner , threw distressed glances in my direction and audibly recited her rosary . At the end of a very few moments , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. reappeared . He walked straight toward the sorcerer , and , whipping out a pair of scissors , snipped off a lock of his hair and a piece of the sheet which was still hanging about his shoulders . Then drawing a red-covered hook from his pocket , he solemnly placed his trophies upon it , lastly producing and adding to the pile an enormous bishop 's ring which we had purchased as a curiosity some time before . Raising the hook on his outstretched arms to the height of his own shoulders , he commenced to make a tour of the room , solemnly chanting , " Ena , Meena , Mina , Mo ! Catch a nigger by the toe . If he hollers , let him goEna , Meena , Mina , Mo ! " The onlookers were hypnotized , and strangest of all , the sorcerer was by no means the least terrified of the crowd . The absurdity of the situation began to dawn on me , and my excitement turned into an almost irresistible desire to burst out laughing . Walking slowly toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and the bit of sheet in a plate on the table ; then , ordering that the basket containing the stolen chickens be brought in , he gravely cut a feather from each of the poor cackling birds , added it to the contents of the plate , and sprinkled the whole with what I imagined was black pepper , all the while continuing his incantations . Then approaching the fireplace , he reached up and seized a piece of fuse used by the smokers of Brittany to light their pipes . Holding it to the flame until it ignited , he placed it on the edge of the plate , and in a thundering voice proclaimed , " 1 hy will , 0 Man , is not so great that another can not destroy it . Look ! " All eyes were riveted on the plate toward whose center the lighted fuse was gradually creeping . The smell of singed hair and burning linen was becoming nauseating , when presently a tremendous detonation and a glaring white light caused all those poor Bretons , unaccustomed to the explosion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in terror . " Thy power is ended ! " shrieked H. from the midst of the smoke , stuffing our Baedeker into his pocket . And the poor sorcerer was a sorry specimen to behold when the gendarmes arrived to arrest him . The next morning when we looked out of the window I beheld a queer group of people evidently waiting for some one . " There 's a man out there whose calf does n't grow . He thinks it 's bewitched and he wants you to help him , " explained our hostess . By the time we got down-stairs , two women with puny babies , and an old hag who wanted a philter in order to win a lawsuit , had joined-the group , and we realized that it was time for us to leave .
