txt Republican Bosses . As an unbossed Republican who will not bow to either Roosevelt . Barnes or Woodruff , let me register a protest against the action of two little bosses of the New Nationalism in Brooklyn . a mean Postmaster Voorhies and Naval Officer Kracke . How is it that a Navy officer can take part in politics as Kracke is doing ? is Taft letting the navy go over to Roosevelt ? He had better look out , for if Roosevelt gets the army too it wo n't be long before we shall see the Colonel with an army at his back riding us down if we oppose his empire  --  the New Nation . Kraeke and Voorhies are trying to get up some feeling against Senator Burlingame , who is one of the original " direct nominations Senators . " because they want the nomination for their district . Let us have direct nominations and , the voters will show these district bosses where they belong . As an enrolled Republican Of the Eighth Senatorial District , I say that if Kracke rejects Burlingame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret it on Election Day .
