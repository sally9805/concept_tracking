At the very edge of Venice is a long and once glorious line of villas where the old Venetians revelled in splendor ; villas built upon the mainland , along the course of the river Brenta ; villas before whose doors ran the landway and waterway , the double highway , between Padua and Venice , which for many centuries was the main approach to the splendid city of the sea . Venice the Beautiful , as a writer quaintly expressed it , stood beside the domes of St. Mark , but the jewelled train of her mantle stretched along the shores of the Brenta . The villas , near to Venice though they are , and readily accessible , are now seen by few , for the coming of the railroad made a new approach to the city , and visitors forget their existence . And Venice herself had first forgotten them . For , when the power of the city dwindled and her riches passed away , there came to an end the golden-robed and silken-shod luxury that had loved to display itself in this suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into ruin , with gardens wrecked and balconies demolished and halls and ceilings tottering to a fall . Others vanished utterly . Still others , their fair radiance departed , and now shabby and defaced , give corners of their spaciousness to peasants , who thus sit in the seats of the mighty . Only a few of the villas are well maintained : one , literally a palace , because the government preserves it as a national monument , and two or three because they are in the hands of rich and liberal owners . It is not only that the poor live in some of the ancient abodes of grandeur . The poor the Italian has always with him , and in abundance ; and so here , along the Brenta , there are not only ruined homes of the proud , but also little villages of the humble . The neglected mansions would not be nearly so full of interest , nearly so picturesque , were it not for the accompanying interest and picturesqueness of peasant and village life . For a gossipy , gladsome , gesticulative folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard of money , rich in content and happiness . Often and often has the Brenta been the text for enthusiasms . The cultured Evelyn wrote , in his famous diary , of the river so deliciously adorned with villas and gardens . Two hundred years later , Disraeli wrote of the number , variety , and splendor of the houses , which even in his day had fallen into the sere , the yellow leaf . D'Annunzio has seized upon the poetry and inspiration in these melancholy remains of former magnificence . And Mrs. Wharton gives the heroine of a powerful short story , set in the Italy of the past , a triumphant season on the Brenta , in a palace of myriad glories . Building sumptuous houses on the mainland followed as a consequence of landward conquests and acquisitions . And , indeed , it was the realization of landward ambitions that marked the beginning of the end of Venetian power . The discovery of a route around the Cape of Good Hope is generally set down as the reason for decline , but it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened by its landward successes . It conquered Belluno and it conquered Padua , and its warriors loved to ride on horses as well as on vessels of war and gondolas . And it would really seem ? to take the ultimate step in this inquiry of cause and effect ? as if the Venetian love for horses lay at the root of their desire to be masters of land . For Venice is an absolutely horseless city . On foot or by water must its people go . And hence there came into operation the yearning , deep-based in human nature , for what is tantalizingly attractive and at the same time attainable only with difficulty . The  |p744  Venetians put themselves on horseback and , although infinitely distant from beggarhood , went the proverbial way . The best of all the statues of Venice is an equestrian : that of Colleoni , by Verrocchio , an admirable replica of which has been placed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York . And the hugecolumned church , that of Saints Giovanni and Paolo , whose portal is guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old-time doges , bestriding caparisoned steeds . In the sombrely housed libraries of Venice are ancient prints showing Brenta villas in their glory , and in front of the villas the artists loved to place cavaliers upon curvetting horses . For these cavaliers , crossing the lagoon from the city , loved to gallop along the road to Padua , past barges filled with travellers intent on reaching the wonderful city . For centuries the Brenta was fiercely fought for by Padua and Venice . For centuries its stream has been confined as a canal , for its uncontrolled meanderings led it changefully across the plain between the rival cities . For centuries it was a great artery of commerce , and the interests of Padua and Venice were so diverse as to its course that battles were fought for the mere object of demolishing an old dike or constructing a new one . Not until Padua itself was taken and held by Venice were bounds finally set to the river , and then , at its mouth , was set a contrivance of pulleys and inclined planes , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar which was always forming . The Brenta firmly secured , the advantages of its banks as a dwelling-place for wealthy Venetians were seen ; and patrician after patrician chose his locality and his stately pleasure dome decreed . " Venice , " naively wrote dear old Froissart , five and a half centuries ago , " is one of the dearest towns in the world for strangers . " He knew Italy and its cities , his principal visit to that country having been to attend , as a guest , a princely wedding , at which ( so runs the delightful old tale ) two of his fellow guests were Chaucer and Petrarch . Froissart did not set down that Venice was a town of extravagant citizens as well as a town expensive for strangers , for he doubtless took it for granted that the citizens ' extravagance was matter of common knowledge . And it was but a very few years after he wrote , that the city sought a new outlet for luxurious expenditure by beginning this expansion along the Brenta . Leaving Venice , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and setting forth for the forgotten villas and the forgotten highway that was so long a highway for the world , you do not turn down the familiar Grand Canal , but into the broad and forgotten Giudecca , where you pass big gondolas , two-rowered , heavy laden with great logs that stretch out on either side with centipedal effect . You pass boats with sails of yellow and hulls of red and brown . And you pass merchant ships at anchor , that have come from distant ports of the world . And now the marvellous city is behind you , and you are sailing across a broad and shimmering lagoon , and you pass an island with the delightful name of St. George in the Seaweed , and you see the darkened surface and the reed-like wavings that tell that the island is well named . Of note , this island , in the ancient days , though no one ever visits it now ; for , midway between mainland and city , it was where ambassadors and other guests of state were often received . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and monks looked out upon a busy world from what is now a crumbled red pile of masonry ; and , glancing at it as the boat carries you by , you notice that a few soldiers militant have replaced the soldiers of the cross . Farther you go , across the shallow waters of the lagoon ; and soon you are nearing a reedy and melancholy shore , where a little patch of tile and plaster , red and yellow , marks ancient Fusina , at the Brenta 's mouth . Following the river inland , there is a great stretch of level country , endlessly ditched and irrigated . Here and there the thatched house of a peasant , here and there a stooping line of toilers in the fields ; women and men in clothing of sun-mellowed charm ; and soon , above the vine-grown levels and the glimmering canals , a spacious building comes in view . A palace , this ; but its glory has departed , its princely tenants have gone .  |p745  It is fronted by a row of mighty columns , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen away in ruin , and of the noble stairways which formed the outer approach , one has altogether vanished and the other has lost its classic balustrade and stands in bare denudedness . This palace , one of the masterpieces of Palladio , was built for two brothers of the house of Foscari ; and the name by which it is known ? Malcontenta ? is the survival of the dark story of a woman , of discontent , of love and jealousy . The palace is now naked and bleak , and on either side are apartments exactly alike : one set of rooms for one brother and one for the other , with a crossshaped audience-hall between for the common use of both . There are fireplaces of pink marble , and vaulted ceilings , and in the central hall there are frescoed Muses and Arts , that , regardless of their faded beauty , look down with a smile or with grave regard at the visitor whose echoing footsteps disturb their solitude , even as they looked on the gay throngs of vanished time . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow covering has flaked away just enough to show a lovely woman , in the splendid apparel of the time of Venetian glory . She is painted on the wall , with her foot on the level of the floor , and gives a curious impression of standing within the room . A haughty and enigmatical smile is on her lips , and you like to believe the legend of the countryside that this woman , decked with pearls and apparelled in silk and lace , is the one whose history gave the shivery name of Malcontenta . Push aside the shutters from a window whose leaded glass has long since vanished , and there is a sweet and lovely view . There are the interminable stretches , crowded thick with luscious growth ; there , to the northward , rises the Alpine line ; there is the lagoon , on whose farther side lies Venice , with the sun glistening on towers and domes . A red-sailed , black-hulled barge comes slowly up the Brenta ; a painted ship on water painted marvellously green ; and one 's mind goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time in the sixteenth century when , with mighty pomp and circumstance , Henry the Third of France came to this house , accompanied from Venice by senators and patricians in barges rowed by slaves . With stairs and vaultings of solid stone , and roof and floors of tile , the house defies the desolation of the centuries . But there are lichens and mosses on the walls ; latticed windows are wrecked ; scrolls andornaments and carving are defaced . And in a perspectived avenue of trees I saw an incongruous descendant of the past : a strutting peacock with tail gloriously outspread , owned by the peasants who live in a corner of the palace and who cook their dinner of herbs in an enormous Palladian fireplace with carved lion 's feet and fluted pillars of stone . Beyond Malcontenta are willow trees and orchards , and meadows rich in grass , and endless vineyards , and long vines garlanded between pollarded mulberries ; and here and there a great gate of wrought iron tells where a villa stood , or at a cottage door stands a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a noble house . Great numbers of statues are still to be seen . At many of the villas the ancient statues were long since destroyed or carried away , and empty pedestals alone remain ; but a host of figures still stand grouped in gardens or extend along old avenues . Smiling or dancing , posing in stateliness , or eternally pouring libations ? gods and goddesses , nymphs and heroes , loves and graces , marred , broken , yellowed , lichened ? they are doing patiently on their pedestals for the peasants what in old days they did for patricians ; and in all this is a grim and theatrical impressiveness , as of broken-down actors and actresses representing the glories of the olden time . Numbers of the villas have not only the charm of general association with the pride of former days , but have definite legends or history clinging about the great rooms and the window-seats and the charming alcoves . ' There are tiny canals running up to private landingplaces , and loggias from which the procession of boats and horses was watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , gleaming austere , and cold above the steaming plain .  |p746  One house , not far from Malcontenta , is honored because it stands upon the site of an earlier one which Dante for a time occupied . Dante wrote of the Brenta , too , but the time of his residence there was before the era of Venetian occupancy . One must look heedfully if he would see every one of the still existent villas , for there are defaced and cheaply stuccoed houses which might hastily be passed by without interest , but which are shown in the ancient prints as the villas of this or that great family whose name is in the Golden Book . The Italians love to stucco any building , old or new ; and , so far as apparent age is concerned , a touch of stucco makes all buildings kin . Less interesting , except as illustrative of human nature , are the few garish houses , comparatively modern , put up by pretentious folk who would fain have the appearance of living here as did the rich and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the frankly humble . And the villages and those who live in them have a peculiar right to attention , because some of these towns are very , very ancient , having authentic histories running back for many hundreds of years , and because numbers of the village folk are doubtless of ancestry antedating the period of the glory of Venice . Tradition has it that near one of these towns one of the battles between Venice and Padua took place , and that the Venetians won through setting free large numbers of bees , who flew at the Paduans and , slipping under their visors , stung them into retreat . The humble Brenta dwellers are a cheerful and credulous folk . They love music , they love games , they love color , they love the dance . I remember that the little Dutch children of Maarken all seemed men and women ; but the men and women of the Brenta all seem children , and all happy ones . Even the grimness of certain of their beliefs does not give them gloominess . They know that three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Death ? but ( crossing themselves ) we ought not to worry , for all of us must die . They know that to spill olive oil or milk brings bad luck , but they also know ( praise this or that Italian saint ! , ) that to spill wine means a marriage . To dream of a tooth drawn out means death ; but to find a horseshoe or a muleshoe means good luck , and to find a coin with a hole in it insures very good luck , and , on the whole , there is more good than evil in the world , and so let us eat and drink and be merry , for , in spite of dreams prognostic , to-morrow we live ! I have heard Italians of more favored regions deplore the malaria of the Brenta , and say , " The people are yellow of face . " But the Brenta folk do not permit even malaria to disturb them . The men contend endlessly at bowls , or perhaps , in the evening , they eagerly play with queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chess ; their chess permitting odd moves with the pawns , and their checkers having the rule that a king is immune from capture except by another king , and that ( to border on a Hibernianism ) these are not kings at all , but queens . Even in the literature read by the Brentaside there is found a certain amusement ; for I have seen one man reading L'Islao and another Il Mulo and another Sigoretta . Incidentally , it reminded me of having heard , in America , that Italian humor is far beyond our own in purity , delicacy , cleverness , and charm . The great villas , through the limitless extravagance of their building , their outfitting and maintenance , were the cause of the breaking of many a fortune , and thus of the subsequent desertion and decay of the buildings . That several were built by Palladio recalls the story that , in revenge for being refused admittance into the order of nobility , he deliberately , set himself to ruin Italian nobles through the expense that his building plans entailed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves not backward in working for their own ruin ; like the one who loved to skip gold pieces , sequins , like pebbles . along the surface of the Brenta , or the one who was in - the pleasant habit of throwing the fragile table service out of window to thrill his guests . At one ruined villa . where I found pigeons roosting in the bare and desolate entrance hall , the peasant who opened doors and gates told me , with deep mean/ ing in his tone , as he showed me into the garden , that oleanders once grew there , but had vanished ; it being an ancient Italian superstition that with the decay of oleanders begins the decay of the fortunes of a house . What is known as the villa of Valmarano , near the town of Mira Porte , is a splendid example of the glorious extravagance of the past . I reached there , from my last stopping-place , by driving beside a Brenta man in a tiny cart drawn by a pony no bigger than a dog , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaky dugout , which he looked at in lengthy dubitation before deciding that it would do , and which absurdly sank just as we reached the farther side . This so-called villa consists of two palaces placed where the river , curving , gives a charming view . They are precisely similar , and each stretches back in a succession of lofty rooms . But to say this is to say only part ; for in the space between these two palaces there once stood a still grander structure , every vestige of which has gone ; a palace of such noble size that these two served fittingly as appanages . And all these united to make the home of a single patrician ! And these two appanages stand in desolation . They have long and stately colonnades , a n d they show pillared vistas of great impressiveness , but some of the rooms are heaped with grain , others are littered with winepresses and carts , in others the plaster has fallen in great pieces ; and yet , amid this wreck of past glory , lovely goddesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm , bravely smile as if to assert that the smile of woman is superior to ruin and may even recall the tender grace of a day that is dead . And the reflection comes , that while nations were quarrelling , and a r m i e s clashing , artists and sculptors kept calmly at their work . Dante wrote of the Brenta , and Veronese painted ceilings , Palladio erected homes there , and Tintoretto made pictures for their walls , heedless of affairs of peace or war . To drive beside the river , along the  |p748  hard firm roads and past the endless stone road-posts , puts one vividly in touch with the past , and it is even more fascinating to go slowly up the stream by boat ? for there are boats , for freight , with red and ochre sails ; there are boats drawn by horses or drawn by men ; there are boats with long ropes running quaintly , as of old , from the stern to the top of the mast and thence to the towingpower on shore , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poplars which send their shadows far down into the water . There are pretty peasant girls standing wider the escutcheons of nobility . Ox teams swing down ancient avenues . There is a shipyard , where barges have for centuries been launched and where a handful of men still work at hull and keel . There are long white roads . There are ditches , thick-padded with water-lilies and with yellow primroses on their banks . There are ancient plane trees long since trimmed to fan-shaped flatness and now grown distorted and grotesque . There are old stone wells . It is of especial interest to notice how different is the architecture from any in Venice . It might have been expected that the architects would follow familiar Venetian forms , but instead they put up a series of houses of an entirely different character . The possession of this river and of Padua meant much to the Venetians . Not only did it solve questions of health and commerce , and give them indisputably a line of traffic ; not only did it give the longed-for chance for rural homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also gave them the source of supply of a strong dark lime which would resist the action of salt water and sea air . It was in the fifteenth century that Padua was seized ; had it been earlier , the Campanile of St. Mark 's would not have fallen . At no great distance above Valmarano is a fine villa , yellow-fronted and of happy aspect ; with white stone lions pawing armorial bearings at the entrance and little lions crouched captivatingly above . It looks like one of the charming modern Florentine villas of to-day , so fresh and clean it is . Yet it is a house of the sixteenth century . and was then inhabited by a Contarini , Procurator of St. Mark 's , and was given a visit by a foreign king , who , passing by , was so taken with the charm of its appearance that he stopped his barge and landed there .  |p749  Noble old apartments are those in this favored Contarini villa ; but the ancient furnishings and frescoes passed with the passing of ancient ownership , the finest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In front of the villa there is a mighty line of gnarled trees , the trunks of which are green with moss . The immediate surroundings were in the past particularly pleasing , although now all is changed . Here and there , along the line of the Brenta. there are still the remains of ancient gardens ; and an ancient and overgrown and high-walled garden must needs be felicitous , especially when still shaded by the cypress and the ilex , and when untrimmed shrubbery has grown into mysterious thickets , with here and there neglected wall-flowers growing from wall crevices where they have found refuge , and here and there a tangle of rosemary hanging like an old man 's beard . And as one walks through such a deserted garden a pungent and fascinating odor arises from the gray-green artemisia crushed underfoot , and mingles with the haunting odor of the hay . And now and then one still finds the great terra-cotta pots , three feet or so across , that held oleanders or orange trees . One sees along the Brenta that color is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown field with white oxen . From the blue-shuttered window of a gray house a green-gowned woman lowers a tiny basket for the casual letter or the morning 's milk . A black-hatted priest flourishes a big blue handkerchief . Redskirted , purple-skirted , maroon-waisted girls sing as they paddle , washing by the waterside . A green-shirted man hammers a tawny dried fish on a gray stone post with a yellow mallet . White ducks go swimming on green water in front of a red-tiled house . It was not an Italian who said that to add another hue unto the rainbow is wasteful and ridiculous excess . A certain spirit of independence among the peasantry comes largely , I think , from their lifelong familiarity with palaces and coats-of-arms in a state of ruin . It comes , too , from the simple character of their local government . Each man who pays taxes of not less than ten lire ( two dollars ) a year is privileged to vote for member of the council , and each town council elects the sindaco or mayor . If in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rife here , for a single small town is likely to have as many as thirty , who serve without pay , and come together twice a year unless called for some special meeting in addition . " The Brenta is a country of gold ! " said a councillor to me , proudly , one day ; but he did not mean this in a material sense . The old woman who sells you ( for one cent ) a very holy picture , in very gaudy colors , has her feelings really hurt if you give her the desired wealth and then do n't care to take the picture , for she fears you will think her a beggar . Yes ; and this in Italy ! Most of the poorer folk never get so far as even to visit near-by Venice . " Why should we go ? We do not care for the city . We are tillers of the soil , " they will say . But always , from contemplation of the people , no matter how simple-hearted and interesting , and of the villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one comes back with renewed and deeper interest to the palaces and the villas . One of the most interesting of the villas is that of the ancient family of the Foscarini , but as you approach it , boating up the placid stream , you see but a building of plain and almost commonplace aspect , with some shabby greenery peeping over the wall behind it . It has changed since the days of the past , when it was one of the most beautiful and charming villas of the Brenta . This is the Brenta villa in which Byron for so many years lived , and in connection with his life here there are tales of his love for an imperious peasant beauty , a Brenta girl , who was long an important factor in his life . A school for peasant children occupies some of the rooms of this villa , and a maker of soap uses the remainder ? but there is much in the history of the building which soap can not wash away , and there is more to learn from it than will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of the simple desks and forms . For there are more than Byronic associations ; the villa having been associated with one of the  |p750  grimmest of Venetian tragedies , that of the love of Antonio Foscarini for an Englishwoman , the Countess of Arundel , wife of the Arundel of the Marbles , Earl Marshal of England . The Countess had first met Foscarini when he was ambassador at London ; and that he held such a post marks him as a man not only of importance , but of manners and presence . Some time after Fosearini 's r e c a l l from London to Venice , about 1620 , it was noticed that the Countess of Arundel secured a villa on the Brenta , close beside his ; but all prudence a n d conventionality were observed , and it merely appeared as if she were a foreigner who appreciated the fineness and beauty of that riverside life . The tragedy , when it came , was made to appear the work of an Italian enemy , but it can scarcely be doubted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he found means to deal a distant blow . One day in 1622 the great Foscarini found himself before the most dread tribunal on earth , on a charge of treason , the ground for the accusation being his frequent visits to the English Countess , with whom he was charged to be plotting against the interests of the Republic . It was pointed out that he was a man who walked a good deal by night , and that his steps had often led him to the home of the Countess , who was deemed an apparent enemy of Venice . Foscarini found his position eminently embarrassing , for his birth and his manliness prevented him from offering such a defence as would put a different face on the matter . The end , for him , came swiftly . The Ten had heard him in secret , but at least they rewarded him openly , for one morning his dead body was found dangling by the foot from the public gallows . The English ambassador at Venice ,  |p751  deeply impressed by all this , sent warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thing in her thoughts ! Hers was not the first case nor the last in which guilt has been far more bold-faced than innocence could possibly be . She went into the city , and so violently protested her innocence of wrong-doing of any sort , of even wrong intentions , that the Doge was constrained to issue a declaration that her protests were just and that there had been a terrible mistake , the judges having acted on evidence given by a man who , under torture , had now confessed his wickedness . The Doge also sent to the irate Countess his most contrite personal apologies , and with them , in recognition of the eternal feminine , a magnificent gift of waxworks and sweetmeats . Nor was she content with this . She demanded an exonerative resolution from the Venetian Senate , and it was promptly voted . She then demanded that the Venetian ambassador in London inform her husband and King James the First that there had been a grave mistake , and that she was an innocent woman who had been deeply maligned ? which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of his art treasures to receive , with outward thanks for the care for the reputation of his wife and the inward reflection that at least Foscarini was well killed . The garden is still as it was , save that the trees and greenery , long untrimmed , have grown wild and thicket-like , and that some of the pedestals are now statueless . There is a bosky avenue , crossed with black shadows , where the ill-fated ambassador , little thinking that the shadows were falling across his life , was wont to pace . There are broken stone seats circled about in a retired nook ; and there are violets and flowers of yellow and red , such as have been picked by generations of lovers there . From Fusina to Padua is a little more than twenty miles , and at the distance of fifteen miles one comes to the town of Stra , and near this town stands a palace , of great size and cost , which was put up in final flaunting arrogance when the Venetian Republic was hastening toward its fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished for its doges and generals , and may be deemed almost modern , for it was begun and finished less than two centuries ago . It is a huge palace of over two hundred rooms ? and Italian rooms are always large ! ? and there was no sparing of expense for pomp and decoration ; and whereas most of the other palaces stand so near the river as to be vividly reflected in the water , this at Stra is set in the midst of a great park . The palace has a host of princely and even royal associations , through the titled folk who have been visitors there . The great Napoleon made his home at this palace for a time , and the people still tell of how he reviewed his troops from a. belvedere above a great entranceway which opens into the palace gardens . It is said , too , by the country folk , that the huge gates of the central portal have remained closed since the time of Napoleon 's stay , so that it might forever be said that his carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by beliefs such as these that the real greatness of a man may be tested , even more than by the winning of battles . Only a giant can print indentations in memory and legend with his lightest touch . Napoleon so admired the place that he purchased it , and afterward gave it to Eugene , the son of his beloved Josephine . It is now cared for by the Italian government as a national monument . Continuing up the Brenta , the city of Padua is reached , where the Venetian lion still stands in front of the palace wherein dwelt the Venetian governor , and where the famed university still occupies the building whose erection Venice decreed . To gain a deep and final impression of this strange Brenta land one should drive . along the waterside , on a gloomy day , as the evening mist rises toward a blurred sky . The pallid , sallow houses , the slim campaniles standing above the level plain , the red-stockinged boys clattering in wooden shoes , the women drawing heavy harrows across the fields , the thatched roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight white oxen yoked together to draw one plough , the kneeling women washing clothes on the river 's  |p753  brink and stooping to paddle them with rock or wood all seem part of an unreal world . Villas wrecked and ruined or transformed into tenements , palace windows closed with wattled twigs , gaunt facades , once graced with wings and balustrades and pediments , statues standing like spirits of the past , sculptured heads grinning down in sinister enjoyment , the water softly whispering along the shore , the sun-dials which marked the passage of a time which those patricians thought would last forever , unite in telling of a life that has vanished as a tale that is told . And as darkness creeps on , and peasants and fisherfolk , gregariously grouped , trudge through this land of shadows , shadowily homeward , one thinks of the old belief that , on the vigil of All Souls , the past and gone Venetians , shrouded with invisibility , leave their graves and wander to their former homes and seat themselves uncannily by the firesides ; and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruined palaces of the Brenta.  |p754
