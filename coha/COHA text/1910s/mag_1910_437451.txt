WHEN I planned to write this paper , I thought I would call it " The New Woman " ; but the last page of Puck , and the first of Punch , rose before me ; ladies in bloomers , with latch-keys , mothers-in-law and club-women and Suffragettes , made the title impossible . When you come to think of it , it is curious how fatal it is , either to a situation or to an individual , or even to a name , if in an evil moment it becomes funny . And that the New Woman has been funny , I suppose there can be no doubt . Indeed , one can hardly say " The New Woman " with any hope of being taken seriously ; although some of us feel that certain conditions of which she is a symptom are serious enough , in all conscience ! However , as I am going to venture to speak of her , I shall begin by mentioning briefly those facts which lead me to conclude that she exists ? outside the columns of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . Of course there have been sporadic " new women , " ever since the world began , and they have shocked the old women and amused the men , young and old , just as our new women shock or amuse to-day . When Miriam and her VOL. lay - NO. 3friends took timbrels in their hands and danced out before the children of Israel , declaring that the Lord had triumphed gloriously , for the horse and his rider had been thrown into the sea , no doubt the women who were too fat or too stiff to dance , declared that such things were unknown when they were young ; and when Deborah sat under the palm-tree between Ramah and Beth-el in Mount Ephraim and judged Israel , I am sure there were respectable housewives who called her a " very unwomanly woman . " There have always been occasional women who did so-called unwomanly things , that is , unusual things , things generally left to men ; there have always been stray women , who have distinguished themselves in art , or politics , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they were . strays . Achieving women are not very conspicuous now , simply because there are more of them . Indeed , the New Woman is almost ceasing to be " new , " and that is why she is ceasing to be entirely a joke ; for there is something more than a joke in all this curious turning upside-down of traditions and theories in regard to women ; something more than a joke in the girl with a latch-key ; in the matron who gives 290 THE CHANGE IN THE FEMININE IDEAL her time to civic affairs or to berating officers of the law ; in myself here on this platform instead of being at home , as a good and contemptuous man said to me once , " making soup . " To my mind there are several things which point to the conclusion that this amusing person , who is called the New Woman , is to be reckoned with as a reality which is not entirely amusing ; but I shall mention only two of them : the first is a prevailing discontent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we might call the " feminine ideal . " Once grant these two things , the discontent and the change , and we find ourselves face to face , not only with the lady herself , but with certain sobering possibilities which accompany her . For that discontent and change are in themselves sobering , is as certain as that they are in themselves hopeful . There is always a threat where there is a promise . That the condition of women is full of hope , is obvious enough to any open-minded person , so obvious that we need not dwell upon it here . We are all of us , I think , conscious of a certain lifting up of the heart when we see what the women of to-day have achieved , and what their influence has accomplished . We believe in the New Woman , and we are proud of her ; indeed , the last thing that is needed is to give us a good opinion of ourselves ! And that is why I am going to attempt the ungracious task of speaking only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be taken for granted . All the privileges of life hold this union of a threat and a promise . The opportunity of wealth implies the opportunity of meanness ; the happiness of parentage walks side by side with the temptation to be selfishly indulger t ; if we have the chance to be faithful , there is always ? the corresponding chance to be unfaithful ; if woman has , as she asserts , the power to make hu man society over , she has at the same time the opportunity to wreck it . A hope always implies a menace . It is neither cowardice nor pessimism then which makes serious-minded men and women say that with the promises and privileges of life , as they are revealing themselves to woman in her discontent and in her changing ideals , there is also a danger . II Of the prevailing discontent among women I shall speak very briefly , and I must not go into certain industrial and economic conditions which have forced stern and inevitable discontents upon us all ; nor shall I refer to the discontents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are discontented unless they dope themselves with amusement ? novel-reading , bridge-playing , theatre-going . It is women with minds of this quality who have put their sex to shame in the last year or two by the wild vulgarity of their silly , and hideous , and selfish hats ( these adjectives will , I think , bear analysis ) ; but happily such women are generally too indolent or too ridiculous to do much harm to the community ? their example being really a warning , and their precepts too uninteresting to be listened to . It is the discontents of the woman of privilege , the woman of sane and sheltered life , which have real significance . I am sometimes amused to have the response made by some mild-eyed , domestic creature , in her comfortable home , with her little children about her knees , " Why , I do n't believe women are discontented . I 'm not discontented ! " and so ending the subject ; for women must , it seems , always be personal . It is recorded that a husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You women make everything personal . " And the lady , aggrieved , responded , " I do n't . " Yet even this satisfied and sheltered woman can hardly venture outside the warm and narrow circle of her own content , without hearing a shrill feminine chatter and clamor , a more or less petulant criticism of life as it is lived ; a. demand , ? often intelligent but sometimes extremely silly and devoid of any economic basis , ? a loud demand for the reconstruction of many things : government , business , the laws of property , the education of children . This contented woman ( who has to be told by her husband whether she is a Republican or a Democrat ) , whose property never troubles her because her dear and honest men-creatures take such affairs from her shoulders , whose children are admirably well and good , ? even this happy and contented woman must know that all women are not so satisfied as she . Even while she thanks God that her girls are not as other mothers ' girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This young person ? a wholesome , lovable creature with surprisingly bad manners ? has gone to college , and when she graduates she is going to earn ' her own living . She declines to be dependent upon a father and mother amply able to support her . She will do settlement work ; she wo n't go to church ; she has views upon marriage and the birth-rate , and she utters them calmly , while her mother blushes with embarrassment ; she occupies herself , passionately , with everything except the things that used to occupy the minds of girls . Restlessness ! Restlessness ! And as it is with the young woman , so it is with the older woman . Countless Woman 's Clubs , largely composed of middle-aged women , have sprung into eager existence in the last twenty years : they are admirable and helpful organizations , but they all express in one way or another the restlessness of growth , a restlessness infinitely removed from the old content of a generation ago . The " club-woman , " as she likes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content with things as they are , any more than she has the pretty little accomplishments of her mother 's youth , or her small conventional charities , or her sweet and gracious and dutiful living . III . But it is not the various discontents , it is the changing ideals of women , which seem to me most significant , ? because the ideals are responsible for the discontents . The feminine ideal has changed , and is still changing ; changing , indeed , with a rapidity extremely jarring to those of us who have reached complacent , and too often narrow-minded , middle age . We need only compare the women of to-day with our mothers ( for it is not necessary to go very far back ) to realize how great the change is . Of course there were women a generation ago , as in all the generations , who asserted themselves ; but they were practically " sports . " Now , the simple , honest woman ; the shy , respectable , commonplace , dear woman ; the woman of ringlets ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pom padours and fewer babies ; the good housekeeper , the good wife , the good mother ? is evolving ideals that are changing her life , and the lives of those people about her . As for the difference between us and our mothers , of course we all begin by protesting that if we can ever hope to do our duty as well as they did , our consciences will acquit us . Who of us women , in our comfortable living , dare compare ourselves to our mothers ? They did not talk about their " rights " ; they fulfilled them ? in taking care of their families . They did not talk about " reforms " ; they would have thought interference in municipal questions , 292 , THE CHANGE IN THE FEMININE IDEAL and agitation for legislation , most unbecoming and unfeminine . They had , bless their dear hearts ! a gentle and ladylike irresponsibility in regard to the world lying in darkness in city halls or legislative chambers ? though they gave their pennies toward the saving of souls in dark Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which most of us arc strangers . No ; the mothers of forty or fifty years ago had no theories about improving the world ( except the heathen ) outside their own respectable doors ; but they had strength , and patience , and tenderness , and courage , and selflessness . ( That , I think , would be the name of their ideal ? selflessness . ) Can we remember that selflessness , and see no difference between it and the present feminine in-dividualism ? We , or at any rate our . daughters , have begun to say that the old selflessness ? dear and admirable beyond a doubt to those who were made comfortable by it ? was often demoralizing to an appalling degree . Their own individual welfare and happiness was the last thing our mothers thought of . Instead , they gave all their power , moral , intellectual , physical , to their households ; and in so doing practiced , sometimes , a curiously immoral unselfishness , which , because it absorbed the chances of sacrifice , turned well-meaning husbands into brutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly of unselfishness : they gave , instead of received ; they grew in grace , but it was at the expense of their families . Such virtue wrote upon their tombstones , " Here lies a saint , who never thought of self " ; and it helped to make us the selfish men and women that some of us are to-day . There is another point of conspicuous difference , and of tremendous social significance , between the woman of yesterday and the woman of to-day . We havecome to appreciate the fact that our mothers were unconscientious concerning the right of children not to be born . We are beginning ? alas , only just beginning ? to say that when parents , unable to support a child in physical and moral and intellectual well-being , bring such a child into the world , for the state , or for their unfortunate relations , to support , they are socially criminal . Contrast our mothers ' ideas of large families with that ! Quantity , not quality , marked the good mother of fifty or sixty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high places ? who still cling to that tradition ; but one would like to ask such persons whether the state would have been benefited if , for instance , in a recent notorious murder trial in New York , the principal had been twins ? No ; maternal instinct , that exquisite blossom of pure animalism , is now strikirig its roots into spiritual responsibilities , and is becoming divine enough to forbid an undesirable existence . It is such contrasts as these between the past and the present , that show what a change there is in the ideals of women ; but the contrasts ? generally so favorable to the present ? are so many and so obVious , that it is not necessary to point them out . The really important thing is to recognize what it is which is creating the change . There are , it seems to me , two forces at work : one is the sense of individualism , and the other is the sense of social responsibility . Both seem to have been evolved in women in our generation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each in itself is good . We do not have the sobering misgiving which comes with a recognition of the prevailing discontent among women . But here again the hope implies a menace : for these two forces , ? a woman 's sense of her right to her own life , which we call individualism , and her sense of her abil- // ity to help others , which we call social responsibility , ? both so noble and so full of promise , sometimes threaten the very springs of life . For the fact is , with all its hopefulness , individualism may be selfish ; and with all its nobility , social responsibility may be shallow : and selfishness is a threat to the family ; and shallowness is a threat to the state . And when we recognize these two threats , some of us are beginning to tremble for the hope .. Let us consider first the impulse of individualism as we see it in the home life . The sudden and very general expansion of the girl 's horizon is manifest to everybody . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with an affected and ludicrous swagger ( which the boys , at any rate , see through , and do not really like ) ; but with that independence , she has grasped at the splendid possibility 9f physical perfection , which implies a resulting mental strength heretofore classed as masculine . This is fine , and apart from its occasionally aesthetic objectionableness , we all rejoice in it . The day of the interesting feminine invalid is gone , thank Heaven ! There was a rhyme of our childhood which ran , But nowadays brides hardly blush , much less faint . Instead , our girls are approaching Walt Whitman 's ideal woman , He begins with the vigorous egotism of the healthy animal : ? Themselves ! The young woman of today is supplementing a certain old-fashioned word , duty , by two other words , " to myself . " Sometimes , just being happy , just enjoying herself , seems to be a duty , ? but for the most part , our girls are not so trivial as that . They feel that education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind , or , for that matter , cultivation of the soul ; the finding a vocation , the joining a sisterhood , the going off to take care of lepers . Noble impulses , all of them ; but contrast them with the old ideal , and you will notice one thing : in all such expressions of individualism , the family is secondary . The new ideal attacks the old . This is especially striking in what we call the higher education , which has become so general since the days when I went to a school kept by English ladies , where we celebrated the Queen 's birthday and were instructed in deportment and religion . I do not mean education merely in regard to school-books ; so far as that goes , I doubt whether we are much more deeply educated than those of our mothers who happened to be studiously inclined , though we may be more widely educated . I mean the spirit of the higher education . Now there is a certain regal word , the only word that can finally compel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , " I want , " and " will , " or sometimes , " I must " ; but they are not learning to say , " I ought . " Instead , the education of to-day too often cries out to them in their colleges : " Look ! The heavens and earth and waters that are under the earth are yours ! The song that the morning stars sing is for your ears . The eternal tides of life await your adventurous prows . The very winds of God are blowing for your sails ! " " You ? you ? Wu ? " the higher education cries ; " never mind other people ; make the most of 294 THE CHANGE IN THE FEMININE IDEAL your own life . Never mind marriage : it is an incident ; men have proved it so for themselves ; it is just the same for women . Never mind social laws ; do what your temperament dictates -- art , affairs , enjoyment even . But do your duty to yourself ! " " And , " remarks the observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake the hindermost ! " Then he adds , ? the observer is generally he , ? he adds , with the candor peculiar to his engaging sex , that , according to his poor way of thinking , he would call the state of mind of the girl who acts on this advice , just plain garden selfishness . Of course , he is only a man ; but certainly some thoughtful women wonder whether these gracious opportunities of learning which are flooding in upon women , are not translated in terms of self in the minds of many girls ? Hannah Kimball sums up this passion for growth that is so characteristic of the New Woman , in four subtle lines : And there is another scripture which saith , " He that saveth his life shall lose it . " A very striking instance of individualism occurs in the life of Sister Dora . We all remember how she left her home and went into hospital service . She did an immense amount of good ; she relieved suffering , she comforted , and strengthened , and ennobled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , homely need of her in the little English rectory she had left . She was a saint , and the poor , and sick , and outcast , named her sister ; but in the station of life where it had pleased God to call her , she was not a sister . Was she wrong ? Was she right ? Far be it from us to say ! But there is a question here that the new woman has raised , which vitally affects the family : what is the relative value to society of individual development , which comes at the cost of family life ? But , somebody says , " Is n't one to seek for goodness , or culture , for one 's self ? " Surely yes ! But is there any culture , of mind or soul , to equal that which comes from the simple doing of one 's duty ? Of course , the puzzle is , what is duty ? It may be to go away and live one'sown life and exploit one 's own soul ; that is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For my part , I should say that it was only safe when it was done for love , not of self , but of humanity . The desire to save one 's soul is full of dreadful risks . The pursuit of personal salvation and team-play are rarely found together . Indeed , that wicked old Calvinistic theology stated a profound truth when it bade a man be willing to be damned for the glory of God ! There is one touchstone , it seems to me , that may be applied to culture , either material or spiritual , to see if it may be taken honestly ; it is this : " Is this culture for myself , or for others ? Do I live to myself , or even save my soul to myself ? " Do you remember certain deep words spoken by One who , being the supreme Aristocrat of the world , yet said , " I am among you as one who serveth " ? " For their sakes , " He said , " for their sakes , I sanctify myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no realized ambition of soul or body , can hurt one who can say for " their sakes " I am rich , I am learned , I am comfortable ; yes , even for " their sakes " I am religious ! But how many individualists can say that ? // IV The sense of individualism , as it expresses itself in the occupations of women , is one of the most interesting economic facts of our generation , ? but it is too large and involved a subject to take up here . I must only say that individualism has taken advantage of certain grim industrial necessities to create the business woman. ? not the occasional and shrinking figure of a generation or so ago , the " woman in business , " who was pitied and smiled at and helped ; but an eager , hard-headed , strenuous person , ready to give and take , neither asking nor granting favors ; she is , generally speaking , a fine , wholesome , sound person . But , however clearly we may see the necessity that has created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us see , also , a menace to family life . There is another threat in the promise of individualism , and to my mind it is the most serious of all . I mean the matter of divorce , ? for divorce is supreme individualism . Somehow or other , after we " began to stand on our hind legs , " we hammered out of bitter experience one hard fact , namely : that because of what we may call " property , " the matter of descent must be kept clear . The cave-dweller wanted his stone axe to descend to his son , by his woman , and not to another man 's son by the same woman . Here , in the evolution of the idea of property , is , curiously enough , in its naked crudity , the beginning of the sense of honor governing the relations of a man with another man 's wife . But out of this idea of property came the belief that the relationship of the man and the woman , once entered into , must be permanent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem a very lofty stepping-stone to a divine and spiritual ideal of marriage ; butwith the race , as with the man , it apparently must be first that which is natural , then that which is spiritual . So in all these painful ages of evolution , body and soul have wrestled together , until , at last , Occidental civilization began to say , one husband and one wife till death us do part ! Man is imperfectly monogamousstill ( or , at any rate , men are ) ; but man builds his civilization on the indestructibility of the family . One traces it down : the state , the tribe , the family , a series of concentric rings , as Sir Henry Maine expressed it , in Ancient Law . And in the centre of the rings is marriage . Civilization , in other words a highly differentiated idea of property , is like a pyramid standing on an apex that rests on the permanence of marriage . Any one who tampers with the stability of that base , tampers with civilization . " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how bitter , slow , and toilsome , has been the upward struggle to subdue , for the good of the mass , the lusts of the individual ! " For this idea of marriage asserts that the individual 's happiness is a secondary consideration . But all the same , the individual , crushed by that impersonal , delicately-balanced apex , suffers ; and now the individual is beginning to protest ; and he voices that protest in the divorce courts . The fact is , this matter of divorce , the most intensely social question in the world , is almost invariably treated as an individual question ; for it is not for the sake of society that a man and woman are divorced ; it is not , as it well might be , to avoid the sin and shame of bringing children who are spiritually illegitit ate into the world ; it is for their own selves , it is that they may have another fling of the dice , another chance to be happy ! See how this desire ? this poor pathetic human desire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is base for a man and ns THE CHANGE IN THE FEMININE IDEAL woman who hate each other to live together . " To that we , looking on , aching with sympathy , and knowing too well that the condition of the unhappily married man or woman is the nearest approach to Hell on this earth , to that we must agree , ? it is base , ? unless sanctified by a very lofty sense of duty . " So we will part ! " the frantic voice goes on . And we must sometimes agree to that , too ; indeed , some of us would do more than merely agree , we would protest that bad marriages were not dissolved nearly often enough for the good of the state . For if the state depends for its existence on the preservation of the family , the family for its existence depends upon the preservation of its own unity . To imprison hatred within the little circle of a wedding-ring does not often make a family , it generally merely destroys a home . Divorce is sometimes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in jeopardy by our careless liberty in the matter of marrying . But the individual morality , which recognizes the baseness of a marriage without respect , goes , often , a step further than mere parting , mere legal separation ; it is not content with that , which would answer every purpose of safety , honor , and decency . Following the assertion that marriage must be dissolved for the sake of morality , comes the admission that it is really for the sake of the individual 's future happiness : " I will get a divorce , and marry A , B , or C , whom I love ( for the time being ) , and who will make me happy . " Here , surely , is the heart of the whole matter : the demand for personal happiness . And in that perfectly natural demand we touch what seems to be the fatal defect in our present attitude towards marriage . The individualist believes that happiness is the purpose of marriage , ? whereas happiness is only an incident of marriage . The purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happiness and marriage may go together ; God send they do ! But if the incident of happiness is lost , duty remains ! the obligation of contract remains ; marriage remains ? it remains , even though , for profoundly righteous reasons , the principals have seen fit to separate by the width of the world . Marriage is civilization 's method of remaining civilized . It is deep with the elemental human impulses of life for generations which are to come ; it is solemn with its opportunities of spiritual insight through suffering ; it is dreadful with its sense of responsibility for the ideal of permanence , which makes us men and women and not beasts ; an ideal which we are to hand on , like a torch , from heart to heart , from soul to soul ! hand on through the heaven of happy love , if it may be , ? or through hell , if it must be , ? but never losing our hold upon it , because if we do , if we let the flame of idealism be quenched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the rocks ! Over and over we see this belief ? that happiness is the purpose of marriage ? leading to the divorce court , and almost always ( alas , that we must say so ! ) woman leads the way . Man apparently is better able to stand by his failure , to play the game through , so to speak ; but woman , who can bear physical suffering better than he can , has apparently less endurance when it comes to spiritual suffering . And so she cries out for escape from the consequences of her own blunder , and freedom to try and find happiness in a new experiment . And how logical and how pitiful her cry is ! " Why should a wronged and innocent person , who has made a mistake in marriage once , be compelled to renounce the chance of happiness in remarrying ? What can be wrong in that ? " demands the // individualist ardently . Nothing ! nothing , ? if every man and woman of us lived or died or married to ourselves alone . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , what a sense of social responsibility St. Paul had ? if my happiness in remarrying lessens in my brother 's eyes the racial importance of the permanence of marriage , then will I give up my happiness . The advocate of the remarriage of divorced persons replies to this , that to forbid remarriage would be to encourage sin . Perhaps . Yes , alas , perhaps ; but it would discourage divorce , because it would make the matter of getting married far more serious ; there would be , perforce , more soberness , discretion , and fear of consequences , if possible blunders could not be so lightly , rectified by the divorce courts . Not that we should make it harder to get a divorce , ? perhaps it is too hard now ; but we should make marriage a far more solemn and difficult matter . And as for the increased sin which might follow legislation forbidding the remarriage of divorced persons , what shall we say ? That sometimes the integrity of the greatest number is paid for by the wrong-doing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we say it , we are finding a deeper depth of truth in still another scripture : " It is expedient that one man should die for the people . " But the individual does not wish to die for the people , he wishes to live ? for himself ; he does not wish to endure , so that the foundations of society may not be weakened by his search for happiness . If only this pathetic creature , clamoring for personal happiness at any cost to the race , ? if only he could realize that when individual happiness conflicts with any great human ideal , the right to claim such happiness is as nothing compared to the privilege of resigning it ! While this strident voice is crying in the wilderness for self-culture , self-advancement , self-satisfaction , ? the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eye , and the pride of life , ? it is crying , on the other side , for power to act for the pub- lic good ; and that we call the sense of social responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a generation ago they were not in the least interested . They are making themselves heard in municipal affairs with no uncertain voice ; city housekeeping seems to them a duty ; they want clean streets , and decent markets ; they see that penal institutions ought to be improved , and that the conditions of labor need investigation and legislation ; and they say so , often with an impetuosity so nearly childish that it antagonizes legislators , ? or amuses them , which is even worse . But how strenuous , and fine , and courageous it all is ! Every one feels that ; every one appreciates its obvious hopefulness ; but it is the danger which accompanies the hope , it is shallowness , which is too apt to be overlooked . This sense of social responsibility is expressing itself , first and foremost , in the determination of women to exercise the suffrage . Out of that determination spring , of course , many fine and noble purposes , which would contribute to the general well-being of the race . In the excitement of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot ( even if she upsets the whole kettle of fish , so to speak ) a curious thing has happened : she does not apparently realize that she has secured by intelligent influence , and plain unsensational common sense , a large number of rights and privileges without the ballot . But , all the same , she is eager to try her " ' prentice han ' " in a government , 298 THE CHANGE IN THE FEMININE IDEAL whose most complicated machinery is the ballot . Incidentally , she proposes to force upon men the feminine view of morality : " Let me get the reins in my hands , " she says , " and I will make men temperate ; I will make them pure ; I will cut corruption out of their politics . In fact , my vote shall make human nature cease to be human nature ! " What the outside , gaping , anxious world thinks of us when we make such statements , we do not stop to hear , ? perhaps we would not like it if we did ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists upon the civil equality of men and women which will be secured by woman suffrage , there has come , upon her part , an insistence on their essential difference , which is most unlovely . She has her " Woman 's Building " at the World 's Fair , her " Woman 's Editions " of newspapers , and the exploitation of " Woman 's Inventions . " Heretofore the work of women in the arts has been simply work , good or bad , as the case may be , and considered irrespective of sex ; now , it is classified as " feminine , " and loses immeasurably in consequence . I hope I shall not be thought too dogmatic if I say that I believe there was very general regret among thoughtful women that there should have been a Woman 's Building at Chicago in 1893 , and that it was on the whole a mortifying and humiliating display . How much better if the few great things ? the noble pictures , the valuable inventions , the dignified expressions of any art or science ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside as noticeable because women did them . Such insistence upon sex in work is an insult to the work , and to the sex , too . In fact , all this emphasis on the difference between women and men is too apt to remind one of what Dr. Johnson said of a woman in the pulpit : she was like a dog standing on his hind legs , ? the wonder was , not that she did not do it well , but that she could do it at all ! This sense of social responsibility which has , at least to some extent , dictated woman 's demand for the ballot , is perhaps the most delicate spiritual possession of the human creature ; and into eager , unused woman 's hands has come this priceless toy ? for indeed , in our dilettante charities , in our passionate reforms , in our light-hearted disrespect for law , in our sentimental cocksureness , can we honestly deny an excited , conceited , inconsequent empir. icism which is saturated with self-con. sciousness , and treats this divine and spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger in the promise is shallowness . Look at this very matter of suffrage , which the New Woman demands so that she may right the wrongs of time , does she stop to reflect with what terrible elements she is playing ? She is reaching out , panting for , insisting upon ? power ! True , it is power to make for righteousness . " Am not I , " she cries , reproachfully , " I , an intelligent and educated woman , better qualified to vote than my ash . man ? " " True , " replies public opinion , " but shall the suffrage therefore be given to your cook ? " But to gratify that desire for power , the New Woman is willing to include her cook ; she is willing to multiply by two the present ignorant and unconscientious vote , a vote which many thoughtful persons , anxiously doubting democracy , believe is already threatening our national existence . Universal man suffrage ( saving your presence , gentlemen ! ) has certainly not yet proved itself a success ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discourage the New Woman , in the midst of the most critical experiment in government // which the world has seen , from asking for the further complication of universal woman suffrage . She has never , so far as I know , suggested for women an educational qualification far , far stricter than that which has accomplished so little for men ; she does not even propose suffrage for widows and unmarried property-owning women , which would go a little way toward eliminating the irresponsible vote . Her cry is , " All of us ? or none of us ! " ? just because many men , absolutely unqualified to do so , vote , let many absolutely unqualified women do the same ! Could there be wilder ( alas , that I must say so ) , more feminine logic than that ? We have suffered many things at the hands of Patrick ; the New Woman would add Bridget also . And ? graver danger ? to the vote of that fierce , silly , amiable creature , the uneducated Negro , she would add ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female . I hope I am not understood as being opposed to woman suffrage . I am only protesting against suffrage for all women ; just as I would protest ( if there was any use in doing so ) against suffrage for all men . In other words , I protest against any extension of the suffrage . And my protest is not at all because of any traditional sentimentality as to woman 's inherent unfitness . The objection of the Antis that the majority of women do not wish to assume the responsibilities of the suffrage , is , of course , entitled to respect ; but the assert ion that women can not take time from their households , their bridge-playing , or their shops , to go to the polls , would be irritating , if it were not ridiculous ; and that cant phrase ( which is almost'enough to make the hearer a suffragist on the spot ! ) to the effect that the hand that rocks the cradle is unfit or unable to cast a ballot , is as silly as it is unconvincing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , it is more dangerous to the state to trust a cradle to it than to trust a ballot . No ; my objection is only on the ground of expediency : all things are lawful , ? to go back to St. Paul , ? but all things are not expedient . If there could be a qualified suffrage for men and women , the case might be different . But the unqualified men wo n't give up what they have got , and the unqualified women are trying to get what they do n't deserve ; ? so there you are ! In their passionate desire for the public good , women seem to have more heart , and less head , than men ; they seem to be more single-minded , but with all their earnestness , there is a sentimentality , a lawlessness , an emotional shallowness , a lack of thoroughness , in the way in which they approach public questions , which , quite apart from the question of doubling the irresponsible vote , makes the matter of their exercising the suffrage alarming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their indifference to law . The most majestic thing humanity has evolved is surely the abstraction called law . That the administration of law is defective is neither here nor there . Of course it is defective ; but the idea itself , law itself , terrible and glorious , is the wonder of time . That we , poor " agglutinations of dust , " as Stevenson calls us , that we should have evolved law , surely shows us to be part of the Eternal Law that is named God . And how does the New Woman regard this majestic thing ? She flouts it ; she makes merry with it ; she treats it as something to be used for her wellbeing , or her amusement , or else ? down with it ! Of course , this disrespect for law is at present , an American , not merely a feminine , characteristic ; but in the past , women , if they have not respected the abstraction , have at 300 THE CHANGE IN THE FEMININE IDEAL least had a wholesome fear of the reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a balance to that spirit which bids the American man " make the law he flouts , and bids him flout the law he makes . " But now woman 's disrespect for law , as regards her own conduct , is especially alarming because of what her example means to the children . Nevertheless women are ready enough to use the law for their emotional ends . As an instance of this , look at the way women have sprung up like mushrooms , in a night , to declare that they are capable of solving the riddle of the painful world , that riddle which is tangled up with the very fibres of human nature , which is full of mystery and misery , and which yet , in some strange , dark way , is built upon everlasting law . I mean prostitution . The New Woman , whose metier at this moment happens to be reform , says , lightly : " We ' II close disreputable houses by law , " and feels that all is settled . When man , sad enough , puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the right kind of man , says tentatively , " But may we not perhaps scatter the poison by that process ? " see how the New Woman scorns him for his cowardice , or his baseness ! In this connection I recall a grim illustration of the effect of a shallow sense of social responsibility , mixed with sentimentalism . A company of good and earnest women took steps to secure the enforcement of a certain law in regard to disreputable houses ; as a result a whole street full of these hideous places was closed , and the inmates went flocking out upon the town , like evil birds of prey . A young woman who had once lived in one of these houses was at that time in my care , and I asked her what would become of these poor creatures , whom the good women had sent out into the world ? each one of them a microbe of sin ! . I can never forget her reply : " Oh , they do a very good business on the street . " Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better business , really . " So , in one instance at least , did the new feminine sense of social responsibility , decking the law with sentimentality , do its part to retard righteousness in a community . The New Woman tried to reform details , to check symptoms . She would cut off the branches of evil , over . looking the root deep down in human nature ; she would , in fact , produce spirituality by legislation , forgetting that the Kingdom of God is within us , ? must be within us ! But the process with which Nature works to build that kingdom is too slow for her fury of impatience for goodness . Hot with her new sense of social responsibility , she says drunkenness is of the Devil ; and the advocates of high license are procurers to the lords of Hell . She is going to shut up the saloon ? , just as the pressure of her influence has already abolished the canteen in the army , with a corresponding and awful increase of drunkenness . The education of self-restraint has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She does not take into account the slow and painful process of evolution which has , in a hundred years , brought about a finer temperance than our forbears could have dreamed of , in the days when it was gentlemanly to roll under the table after dinner . Yet think what it means to character to he temperate , rather than to be carried about , whither one would not , in the strait-jacket of legally enforced total abstinence ! ? to say nothing of the criminals that such enforcement would inevitably create out of decent folk . With the ballot in her hand , the New Woman would make laws to prevent drunkenness . In other words , she seems to confuse a purely individual // issue with a social issue . She would bend society to the needs of the individual , for her conviction of the necessity of legislative interference springs so often from personal experience . Women suffer from the curse of liquor as men do not . The drunkard suffers in his own person , as he deserves to do ; but his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with her personal misery , the New Woman says , " I will close the saloons so that temptation shall be removed , " ? with never a thought for the education it would be to some other woman 's son to learn to pass that saloon without going in ; still less does she reflect upon that nobler education of moderation which means the sane use of liquor . Yet which is better ? to remove temptation , or to teach people to overcome temptation ? To prevent badness is to prevent goodness , for an unwilled action has no moral significance . And certainly the highest righteousness includes the highest power of being bad if you want to be . One can not but think what it might mean in character to the race to have this passionate and noble New Woman , who would reform things , recognize the right of the individual ( where society is not directly menaced ) to choose between righteousness and baseness ; and that implies his right to work out his own salvation , by suffering , yes , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regeneration on those lines takes so long ! We are so eager to make people good that we forget that the consequences of wrong-doing ? suffering , pain , failure , and even death may be the angels of God , those angels who are given charge over us , to keep us in all our ways . The thousand years of the Lord , we would put into one clay ! Our day ? not His . Indeed , the New Woman 's intemperate temperance betrays her small honor for human nature ; her small belief in time , but her very large confidence in her own judgment . Archbishop Whateley said , with flippant but humorous discourtesy : " Women never reason ; or if they do , they either draw correct inferences from wrong premises , or wrong inferences from correct premises ? and they always poke the fire from the top . " This new element in reform which seems to be poking the fire from the top , this New Woman , does not know how to wait . Haste ! That is surely the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social responsibility . It is this haste which has lately driven some of us into ludicrous and wicked disrespect for law ; it has made us , with mistaken kindness , seek to interfere with individual development which comes by wrong-doing and pain ; it has robbed us of patience with differing opinions ; it has created a god in its own image , and cries out that he shall be worshiped only in ways of which it approves . Oh , let us learn to wait ; it does not follow that we must be idle because we refuse to be precipitate ; it may only mean that we have a faith that is large in Time , and that which shapes it to some perfect end . Indeed , there seems to me a certain unhumorous arrogance in this bustling , feminine haste to make over the world ? it is as if we thought ourselves so important that nothing could go right without us . It is the same sort of hurrying " anxiety to do " which every housekeeper of us knows so well in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the discomfort of our families . Yet , when you come to think of it , ? it may not be flattering , ? but when an illness sweeps us off our feet or some duty calls us upon a journey , how well our families do get along without us ! I have often been struck by it in my own household . 802 THE CHANGE IN THE FEMININE IDEAL It is this same fretting impatience that shows itself in the attitude of women toward reforms . But our sense of humor is surely in the eclipse when we take ourselves so seriously , for , after all , God has drawn this earth along its path among the everlasting stars , suns have burned and cooled , nations have lived and died , and human life has drawn nearer and nearer that " far-off divine event , to which the whole creation moves , " ? without us . Beautiful , dark , true words ; a lofty fatalism which declares that the Judge of all the Earth does right . But not the final words for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with the Eternal . I suppose the plea for time is really a plea for law , ant that always seems to me a statement of the faith that is in us : " I believe in God , the Father Almighty , Maker of heaven and earth ? " Yes , of the new heavens and the new earth , which we hurrying , worrying , experimenting little human creatures would usher in ? day after to-morrow ! Of course , if this high reminder that God will take care of His own business is meant for those of us who hurry and clamor to push on the processes of evolution , it is meant just as much for those who shrink and hold back , lest in all the shallowness of living , and all the selfishness of life , we should , like certain animals in the New Testament , rush violently clown a steep place into the sea . Take courage to wait , one cries to the younger generation ; take courage to go forward ? to those who , fearfully , lag behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are not individualism and the sense of social responsibility the two working hands of one central heart , ? a heart that we call Duty ? Surely neither can be cut off from that life-giving source and live , and neither can work against the other without the destruction of the whole . It is , of course , Kant 's categorical imperative , expanded into the homely terms of duty : No one snag do that which , if ' done by all , would destroy society . In other words , the individual must see that when the gaining of his own poor little happiness involves an injury to a great human ideal , it is better to cut that happiness off and cast it from him , than to do his part to bring the body politic to hell-fire . When social responsibility conflicts with individualism , as exemplified by the removal of the chance to choose between good and evil , then society must wait and let the individual soul learn its own bitter lesson of sin , and righteousness , and judgment . One is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , " Oh , see largely , see widely ! Realize that this flash and minute of existence is but a line , a dot , in the horizon of time . Do not think that law is to be pushed on , just because we are in a hurry . Do not think that God will loiter , just because we are slow . This small , glittering fragment of time here under our eyes , blinded as we are by the dazzle of eternity , is almost nothing to the sum of the whole ! Do not haste . Do not hold back . and she is still so young , this woman of our new and solemn and glorious day
