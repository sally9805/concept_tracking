txt The Federal Grand Jury will begin the consideration on next Monday of the charge that Miss Rae Tanzer , who is suing James W. Osborne for 00,000 damages for alleged breach of promise , used the mails to defraud him by writing him certain letters prior to the institution of the civil action . At the same time that United States District Attorney Marshall presents the evidence against Miss Tanzer he will place before the Grand Jury other evidence intended to show that Miss Tanzer 's attack on Mr. Osborne was part of a conspiracy . Mr. Marshall said yesterday that there were reasons why he could not be specific regarding the conspiracy evidence and the individuals against whom it would be directed . It is expected the work of the Grand Jury will be completed next week and motions for the trial of any one accused by it will be made at once . When questioned about his statement of Thursday night attacking Miss Tanzer 's lawyers , Mr. Marshall said that he could not amplify it . " I 'll stand on that statement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I meant it . " David H. Slade , of Slade &; Slade , Miss Tanzer 's lawyers , said : . " I would not dignify it with a reply. ? Mr. Slade criticised Mr. Marshall for making the statement to the newspapers for publication before any evidence to support it had been placed before the Grand Jury . " If Mr. Marshall had anything to say , " he contended , " he should have , Said it to the Grand Jury'first.I ' ' 2 When Mr. Marshall was asked why he , had give out the statement he said that the exigencies of the situation had made it seem advisable to do so . Still another woman , whose name was withheld , went to Mr. Marshall 's office yesterday and delivered three letters signed " Oliver Osborn , " or " Osborne , " which she said she had received from a man of whom she gave practically the same description as that given of " Oliver Osborne " by the proprietor of the Hotel Kensington in Plainfield , N. J. , James W. Osborne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted that " Oliver " Is not James W. Osborne . The woman surrendered a third letter signed with the initials " 0 . H. O. " None of the letters bad been mailed , nor was any of them dated . The woman said they had been delivered to her by messenger boys less than three weeks ago , and that she was confident they had come from the " Oliver Osborne " mentioned in the case . Although In the signatures of two of the letters the final " e " had been left off " Osborne , " Assistant District Attorney Hershenstein , who made them public , said that the two signatures undoubtedly had been made by the same " Oliver Osborne " who signed all of the other documents in the Possession of the Government to which that name is appended . While each day seems to bring forth some hitherto unheard of person who says that he or she knew " Oliver Os , borne , " the man himself remains in I places unknown to any one associated with the Government 's case against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days " Where is Oliver Osborne ? " has become a catch phrase about the Federal Building . Mr. Marshall denied a rumor that " Oliver " had been found in a New Jersey suburb and was under constant surveillance of agents from his office . It is said the man has been known at different times , or at the same time by different persons , as Oliver Wooster , Oliver Ayre , Oliver , and Oliver Sawyer . The alibi by which James W. Osborne will try to show that he was at the Bar Association on the afternoon on which Miss Tanzer has charged he was with her at the Hotel Kensington will be supported , it is said , by Reuben Peckham of Mr. Osborne 's office . Mr. Peckham is ready to show by his diary record for Sunday , Oct. 18 , 1  --  the day in question  --  that ? he spent all of the Afternoon with Mr. Osborne in a room in the association building , in West Forty-third Street . Additional support for the alibi will come from Matthew J. Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an affidavit that he met Mr. Osborne at the Sherman Square Hotel at 1 o'clock on the duy named , took luncheon with him , and was with him and Mr. Peckham from 2 until 6 . When this alibi was called to the attention of David H. Slade he said that it would be fittingly answered with laughter . He complained that when Miss Tanzer was released on bail by Commissioner Houghton on Thursday she was taken by Federal officers through the United States Marshal 's office , so that two women sitting in the office might identify her . ' " I saw the two women nod to some man standing by them , " Mr. Slade said , " and I knew what was up . ' I 'm on to your game , ' I said to one of the men in the Marshal 's office , and he answered , ? Get out of here or I 'll punch your nose . ' My nose , he said he 'd punch my nose . " It was denied at the Marshal 's office that Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than to protect her from the crowd of curious stragglers in the corridors . It was also positively denied that any official in the office had threatened to punch Mr. Slade 's nose . The two women in the office , it was said , were Federal witresees in another case waiting for $1.50 apiece , their legal fee for testifying . James W. Osborne made an unannounced trip to ' Washington , taking the midnight train last night . This caused speculation in view of David Slade 's hints of " proceedings " there growing out of the Tanzer case . Miss Tanzer , it was said by persons who professed to know her , lived at 163 Ferry Street , Newark , about two years ago . Her brother conducted a clothing store near that address , it was said . and : she . wOo , employeet tle.etore ..
