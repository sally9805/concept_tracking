txt After J. J. Keppler , International Vice President of the Machinists ' Union , Ilad ! issued formal order this afternoon ter the machinists to strike at the Remington Arms plant tomorrow at Noon , John A. Johnson , Vice President of the Struetura ! Iron Workers , came to this city from New York and announced that , in response to a personal appeal from a New Yorker financially interested in Bridgeport factories , he had agreed to delay calling the walkout for fortyeight hours . Mr. Johnson refused to reveal the name of the man . He did say that he was connected with neither the Remington Company nor the Stewart Construction Company . This man , said Mr. Johnson , realized what a calamity a general strike throughout New England would be at this time . " I left Bridgeport yesterday afternoon , and went to New York , " said Mr. Johnson . " As soon as I reached my office there I found a telephone message from this man , a friend of mine , who is not connected with any labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something to settle the difficulty . " Mr. Johnson said he understood an effort would be made W have Major W. G. Penfield , works manager of the Remington Arms &; Ammunition Company , enter into conference with the labor representatives . It was pointed out to Mr. Johnson that the two nays ' delay would give the machinists time to strengthen their organization , which is not over strong in the Remington cartridge plant . lie scoffed at the intimation Ilikt the dmon men had shown the white-feather . Mr. If eppleze said that it was 151anned to call out first the men in. the ReMington Arms plant , next those in the cartridge factory and then those in all factories having sub-contracts from the Remington Company . He insisted that any material delay in granting the demands would result in a general strike throughout New England . The strike fever seems to be in the air . The workmen are prosperous and have money in bank . The picayune Question of proper union affiliation of the millwrights has faded into insignificance ; it is now one of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridgeport breathed . easier when the news came that the strike would not be declared . The men ordered to walk out of the Remington arms plant were 150 machinists , 200 hod carriers , 50 riggers , 50 sheet-metal workers I and ' 60 die sinkers and drop forgers. t had been planned to have these men make a demonstration in front 07 the Remington U. M. C. plant and A parade through the city . Guards /hrenten to strike , Too . In addition the 700 guards at the Remington plants agreed that they would not risk their lives in a strike for $15.10 a week , and had planned to walk out when the machinists struck . The Remington people say that most of these guards are retired United States soldiers . The labor officials deny this . " 1 have agreed to Mr. Johnson 's request to delay the strike for one or . two days , " said Mr. Keppler , " but this does not mean that either the Machinists or the Remington people have backed down . It means simply that organized labor agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body blow to Bridgeport , and we are opposed to the needless destruction of the city 's prosperity . If this mediator can obta:n a ' conference for us with the Remington People he will have done something . 1 hope the delay will bring about a settlement . " Manufacturers of Bridgeport were tonight inclined to be skeptical as to the assigned reason for the delay . They maintain that the machinists are not ' well enough organized in Bridgeport to conduct a successful strike . On the other hand , the labor leaders are firm in their declaration that they will insist on nothing less than the original demands  --  a permanent eight-hour day in all the Remington plants , recognition of millwrights as metal workers and a minimum scale of wages . There was much sub-surface discontent among the machinists over the delay . The men are anxious to start the fight for a strictly " closed " New England with an eight-hour day in all shops . A new grievance was added by the ' . peremptory dismissal ' of thirty --  five union machinists from the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any settlement , shall include the reinstatement of these men . Strike leaders here did not conceal their anger today at a published state-1 ment of Samuel Gompers , President of the American Federation of Labor , that I offers of money had been made to labor men in Bridgeport to force the strike . This recalled vividly the charge by Major Penfield that pro-German money was hack of the move to tie up the manufacture of arms for the Allies . The Major is said to have the affidavits of several labor men , including that of Ernest O'Brien , ex-business agent of the Carpenters ' Union , that twice he was offered e200 to call his men off the arms plant construction work . Simon Lake , the inventor , head of the Lake Torpedo Boat Construction Cornearly , at whose plant the patternmakers struck yesterday , and which would be tied up by a strike of the machinists . was asked today what he thought of the talk of outside Influences . " I have no direct evidence , " he replied . " But if I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms foe enemies I would not hexitete to approach some of these labor tetors . As for the patternmakere . I am a patternmaker myself , and I know that some patternmakers are worth more than others . They have struck on the demand that all receive the same pay . I regard that as opposed to the American Constitution , which gives a man a right to advance himself . I shall stand on that platform , and , strike or no strike , I shall pay my men what I think they are worth . " Bridgeport is overrun with detectives , some working for the labor faction , some for the employers . Gumshoe men are numerous in the saloons and hotel lobbies . There was a fracas in the lobby of the Stratfield Hotel today when one detective who had seen another taking notes on the backs of match boxes picked his rival 's pocket to get the information . Detectives have been put to work in the Remington plants . There are women detectives among the girl workers . The union officials have had printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Columbia Bolt and Nut Company , in which he declared that long hours and little money were the best condition for the . ' workingmen . Agitators plan to use this as strike propaganda . " The more work and the less mOnexl they have , the better off they are , Mr. Atwater is quoted as saying in the interview . ' To reduce their working hours from ten to eight would simply give them more time to loaf around corner saloons . " Talk of Immense War Orders . Those among the labor leaders who emphasize the assertion that now Is the psychological time for a successful , strike , point out that , according to a generally accepted estimate , Connecticut concerns have more than 5500,000,000 in war orders , which have been pouring in tor the last six months . Every factory Is said to have enough orders on hand to keep it going at capacity for two or three years . Bridgeport alone , these labor leaders say , has more people making munitions of war than the great Krupp works of Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are crowded with floating workmen , and there is serious talk of erecting a tent city for 300 families which have sought in vain for quarters , the families of men expectmg to work among the 10.000 persons to be employed in the new Remington ' Arms plant . Bridgeport is the centre of this great new industry , but it has no monopoly .

According to the talk heard among the labor leaders , the Winchester Company has orders for $15,000,000 worth of arms , the Colt works are turning out hundreds of thousands of revolvers of a new magazine type and are making machine guns of a new style for England and Russia , and the Scovill Company has more than ' a year 's work ahead to fill shrapnel orders for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French War Department , is being made by the BritishAmerican Manufacturing Company of this city .
