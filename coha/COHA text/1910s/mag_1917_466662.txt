VERY country , in. every war , and every country during those periods of peace which are the preludes to war , has employed spies . Every captain , however much he may protest , has used spies to discover the forces of the enemy , his re-sources , his state of mind . Spies have been engaged , especially of late years , to penetrate into the vitals of the modern state ? industry , commerce , and espe-cially banking . This is reluctantly ac-knowledged , and indeed I do not think that any states confess to the use of spies ; they control a " secret service , " or an " intelligence department , " as if states accepted a morality and shrank from advantages held as mean . To a logician , who cares little for the road he travels toward truth , this is absurd ; it is not absurd to statesmen , most of whom are ordinary men , fond of chil-dren , games , and good wine ; anxious to be respected , and especially to be justi-fied before the terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halo round the spy ; it is a halo which at-taches more or less to all romantic trades , that of the journalist or the hang-man , only this is no golden nimbus that swathes the brow of the spy . Fiction has not favored spy heroes ; we know heroic thieves , like Arsine Lupin or Raffles ; we have had glorious highwaymen in Dick Turpin and-Robin Hood . Frank Norris even went so far as to make a hero of a capitalist . But the spy has died un-known and unsung , because mankind can not reconcile itself to his dark trade , because it feels an ineradicable prejudice against the full use of intellect and main-tains an obstinate faith in hard knocks . I do not propose here to sing the praises of the spy ; the spy , as any other man , deserves only a balance between praise and blame ; and who shall say , when all is adjudged , whether a man shall hear a laurel wreath or a crown of thorns ? I seek rather to understand , and therefore to explain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not without heroism , nor without baseness ; he combines more vividly than most those contrasts which make . up a man . ' There are various kinds of spies : there are the civil and the military ; there are the spies who ply their trade in peace time , those who venture on it during war ; some serve only their own country , while others give themselves over to the enemy . All differ by their tinge of criminality , their distinguishing badge of service . And those , more easily identified as criminal , who injure their own country , number strange people who think they do no wrong , who hold with Mr. Maeterlinck that they can inclose a single sin in the keep of their hearts , a sin they will not commit . There must he some who will say with the Belgian poet : " I am a spy , but I do not beat my wife . If I were to do that I should look upon myself as a bad man . " ( For man is a biased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) We need waste no time over spies of enemy origin , who either during peace or war hunt out the secrets of an enemy . Mostly they share in the characteristics of that single spy I wish to consider further on , but nearly all are heroes ; it needs but a slight effort of the imagination to picture what it must mean to an intelligent , nervously developed man to live among people whom any false step will array against him , to play parts , to outwit and to elude , knowing all the time that a slight error of judgment will mean prison or death . But they a-e not selfless heroes , for the wages of danger is delight , and many think with Nietzsche that to live safely is not to live at all . They earn compensations similar to those which are afforded to the last and most interesting of the spy class , those who turn against their own country and would procure its downfall Atfirst sight that class is entirely vile , and indeed , logician though I may strive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ugly trade ; I am interested in a man who betrays his own country , just as I would have been interested in Brigham Young or Doctor Crippen , but I do not feel attracted to him . Nothing obvious can be said for this kind of trader ; he is trying to injure and upset a state , and one should have nothing more against him than against Washington or Bolivar ? only those men upset by force and not by stealth , and so logic is swamped in passion . It is true that the average spy is not actuated by the impulses which made Washington , Cromwell , or Kosciuszko . He is altogether a smaller man ; almost invariably he takes money for his work , and , though of course he must have money to live , work such as that done for profit is not ennobling . Also , however deep one 's cosmopolitanism , one can not shake off a natural bias in favor of one 's own country ; one suspects that the man who betrays his friends is used but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received and used the offers of the Olynthian traitors , treated them well , paid them their fee , and then had them driven from his camp as unworthy to mix with his own loyal men . Over the trade hangs the nasty secrecy of it . Yes , I know business men are often secretive , lying , treacherous , and if they are not they often fail ; few barristers have a conscience ; inventors hedge themselves about with mystery . But still . . . we are reduced to Kant , and to say , " The spy produces a feeling which is not agreeable ; therefore , he is evil . " All those are my own feelings , and I suppose those of most men ; but facts as to one case , apparently neither peculiar nor rare , have come into my hands , and show that there is more in the spy than just a money lust , for the satisfaction of which he will sacrifice his country and his people . Early last year a spy was caught in the British lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though there are several stereotyped ways of introducing a spy into the lines of the enemy which , for obvious military reasons , I am not allowed to mention here . Moreover , this interesting matter would be irrelevant ; it is enough to say that the spy in question , whom for convenience we will call Witney , was an Englishman ; he was dressed in the ordinary uniform of one of the regiments present on that particular section of the front , and he appears to have moved about for some days at the back of the lines without arousing any suspicion . This is also fully accounted for by a stratagem which may not be detailed . It is quite possible that Witney would have seen what he was minded to see and ultimately rejoined his employers if a trilling accident had not exposed him . It was a perfeCtly simple case . Witney believed that he would escape unchallenged , and that once caught he had no defense . The information he collected was not of the slightest military value , but the intention was there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be shot . The sentence was duly executed , and there would have been nothing more peculiar than in the cases of various peasants who have been shot for signaling , if Witney had not made an extraordinary remark . Information comes to me from the officer who had charge of Witney for a night . There was , of course , no military prison available , and so the spy , after sentence , was locked up in a stable and placed under guard . Strictly , he was in charge of a non-commissioned officer ; for reasons which I do not know , the orderly officer was involved , and I can not sort out the details , because this officer is now dead . As is nowadays generally the case in the British army , my informant was not a professional soldier ; he was a schoolmaster , a man of no special perception , but of good intelligence and of rather judicial mind . You will conceive his surprise when , on receiving the spy , the latter , with a rather jaunty air , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he loved this treason but hated the traitor ? " There is room for surprise when an officer taking charge of a spy is addressed by a man who quotes Plutarch . To put it in his own words , " he was flummuxed . " It is no doubt because of this chance remark of Witney 's that this essay has been written . He had , it is true , provided a temporary excitement by escaping his captors for a moment and trying to drown himself in a canal , but you will realize that even a resolute suicide would not create in the mind of a schoolmaster an excitement comparable with that which might be bred out of a classical quotation . Whatever the causes , the officer was interested , and no doubt because of Witney 's peculiar lead was induced to do more than pay him the regulation visit at nightfall to see that he was properly treated and had no personal wishes to express . Between that evening and the dawn he visited Witney three times , and it is important that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communion of captor and captive . On the other hand , romantic surroundings such as those which emanate from a man about to die , from an apartment such as a stable , from the distant noise of guns , the fitful light of a star-shell , and the silence of the night inhabited only by the sharp squeak of a bat against the dull background of full-throated guns , must have that effect ; it is most likely that Witney would have been more sullen and the officer less detached if this scene had been played in some English penitentiary . In a way , both felt balanced upon the edge of life , one of them assured of losing it , the other ill-assured of retaining it . It was their common bond , perhaps . Whatever the cause , Witney did not at once expand ; apparently he was suf-hciently sensitive to realize that the officer 's first visit was more or less the regulation visit , and he may have felt the irony of being asked whether he wanted anything or had anything to complain of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he was cold or hungry , given that they were going to shoot him next day . In the words of the officer : " He was just like any other kind of prisoner . They 're all much the same , whether their offense is serious or slight . Like them , he was sort of sulky and reserved . He did n't want to talk and he did n't seem to care . He seemed to have shed the touch of devilry that was in his eyes when hequoted that bit of Plutarch . He said he did n't want anything , and I just left it at that . Somehow I felt it was n't the thing to pump the fellow , so I wished him good night and he did n't answer . " So far , Witney was quite a natural man . To look at he was almost too ordinary to describe . You will imagine a smallish man , with indeterminate brown hair , intelligent gray eyes , and a ragged little mustache , the sort of man you see dozens of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him something excited , one might almost say vibrant , but that was normal enough ; I suppose one would be excited if one were going to be ceremoniously shot next day . As Peter Pan said , " Death must be a very great adventure . " But apparently this second-rate little person who quoted Plutarch must have interested my informant . He was not clear about the time , but it seems that later in the night he again went to Witney , and I like to imagine him in the stable lit up by rather a dim oil-lamp , trying to look soldierly , and grim , and inhuman , and Witney determined to carry it off with a swagger , thoroughly selfconscious , and posturing in his agony . I imagine that it must have been Witney who made the first advance , largely , no doubt , because in his condition he would want to talk ; he would either want to talk or be absolutely sullen . There would be no intermediate condition . He would want either to withdraw within himself or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far as I remember , he began by asking the officer for a drink of water , for he had emptied his jug . This was brought to him , and after he had drunk Witney threw off his air of defiance , and found words in which to express it . He said , " I suppose you think I 'm just a swine and deserve to be shot . " Without any doubt , the officer was surprised . He may have expected bold defiance ; perhaps he half expected ( in response to the sympathy which his presence conveyed ) a whining appeal for freedom . But , as he put it , when he heard that phrase , half provocative , half argument-ative , he felt that the attitude was ? cheek . Still , the spy was being queer , doing a rare thing : living up to a first impression . There was a suggestion of a case which he wanted to plead , and it passed through the officer 's mind , much to his surprise , that there might be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not respectable , at least understandable ; he had a sudden glimpse of some unexplored field behind this man 's mind , a sense of unconveyable impulses . It was as if the man had said : " I 'm a spy ; you 're a soldier . Well , what about it ? We 're on different jobs in life , and that 's all there is to it . " It was a queer feeling , as if a prisoner had stepped out of the dock ( so he put it to me ) , whipped off the judge 's wig . and solemnly rendered justice . And all this , as is the way with inarticulate Englishmen , translated itself in a mumbled remark , " You sound like an educated man . " There was nothing premeditate about Witney then . It was as if the sudden personal allusion opened a window in him . Febrile in his excitement , he spoke of himself ; it was a story which is not a story , so common is it . Witney came from a poorish family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself an academy , became a clerk in an English town , in a firm of ship-owners , I think . " 1 was doing all right , " he said ; " always managed to keep myself somehow . " He grew confidential . " Always had a bit of money to have some fun with . There 's my girl , roe , whom I thought of marrying this year . Wonder what she 'll think when she hears of this . S'pose she wo n't , though , " he added , without much emotion . There was something in this man , so brave before death , that was callous and shocking . The officer was irritated into speech , as a musician is rasped by false note . He had to conquer the impulse of reserve that is in nearly all the English , but he was assisted by the materialistic common sense which is always theirs . It struck him as ridiculous that a man who obviously had never starved , who indeed seemed to have made a fair living , who was young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry her , should ply such a trade , take such risks for so little pay . From my point of view , " he told me , " it did n't seem good enough . " Corn-mon sense conquered reserve , so that he said , almost irritably : " Look here , what did you do it for ? " Witney , I believe , thought for a little while . His excitement had subsided , for his mind was working and set his nerves at rest . He did the characteristic English thing : he drew back a little into himself , finding it easier to think than to express ; he showed cowardice before self-manifestation . He replied : " Oh . . . well , I hardly know . " " Money ? " said the officer ; and there is in that remark something of the tragic , for in that moment the schoolmasterofficer must have lost all his class selfconsciousness or he would not have made a remark which , addressed even to a sentenced criminal , was ill-bred . ( " Afterward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was jolly bad form . " ) Witney did not seem offended . The remark did not to him sound ill-bred ; with the simplicity of his class he accepted the simplicity of sincerity . " No , " he said , " it was n't money . This sort of thing gets a man a living , but it 's not a fat one , not unless you get hold of something big , and you do n't in the ordinary way . Besides , I " ? he smiled ? " I 'm not mercenary ; I could have done quite as well in my old job . Of course I do n't say ? " A tinge of pride came into his voice , as there comes into that of a country doctor w &n; he mentions the name of a worldfamed specialist . " There are some who 've done big things at this game . Oh yes , one might make a lot . One might get all sorts of things ? influence , you know , or an estate , or something . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer shook his head . " No , I do n't know what . I see you mean it 's not just money , but what else can it be ? " Witney looked at him with something like pain in his eyes . as if he were trying to express an idea he hardly understood himself . Then he tried : " You see , " he said , " it 's not easy to get hold of , but it 's like this . You do n't know what an office is like ; you 're a gentleman , being a clerk and all that . Ding-dong , half-past seven , get up and cut yourself while you shave . You do n't want to shave , but the boss will have it ; and it 's cold in winter , and you run for trains , and you 're ? Oh , well , if you 're late you get the sack . " " Yes , " said the officer . " All that sort of thing . You do n't care what the work 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If business is good , it does n't pay you any better ; they go on paying you your wages so long as the thing just keeps out of bankruptcy . So it goes on all day and every day , writing figures in a book , and saying , ' Yes , sir . ' And you have three meals , and get jawed , and keep your temper , and try to pretend you 're a man . And in the evening , you 've got no money , so you go to bed and make ready for another day like that . I tell you , a fortnight a year at the seaside , it 's not enough to keep a man going . You want ? " " Well , what do you want ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Sort of thing you see in the illustrated papers . The big hotels , and running round in a motorcar , and going to all sorts of places abroad , and ? messing about the world , you know . " At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Oh , I see what you mean . Advent-ure . , ' " That 's about it , " said Witnev ; " that 's the word I was looking for . I tell you , men like me , they just ca n't go on in an office like that , running round and round like a white mouse in a wheel . I 'm not a white mouse ; that 's what 's the matter with me . Things ought to have been different . They might have been . If I 'd been born a thousand years ago I might have become a lord . " The officer smiled . This version of history was not inaccurate . " Adventure ! ' he repeated . Excitement seized Witney again . " Yes , " he said , " that 's it . And I tell you there 's some adventures in this job of mine . My , what a life ! The way you go into it ? at least the way I did ? the way a fellow gets hold of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't do it . And it wo n't let you alone . It 's not the money , but you sort of feel what a game it 's going to be ? Sherlock Holmes , and all that sort of thing ? making up with sham whiskers . I went to the theater one night when they were trying to get me on to the game , and the villain , as they call him ? well , he fair finished me , he was so dodgy . " He grew reflective , and here one of the strands in him indicated itself the lust for change , for color in an endlessly unvarying world . He quivered as with hurrying words he described the shifts of this strange new life ? the going in at one door and coming out at another , the messages in code , the secret countersigns in the streets , the tense atmosphere of melodrama . Witney had with that side of his temperament taken up spying as other men take up the aeroplane or exploration . He had escaped from respectability into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no right and wrong . " From the moment when he began to prey he felt absolved from laws and even from the regulations of the city council . It was a true liberation to have no home , no ties , no occupation , no master , because his trade demanded of him that he should be familiar in all places and the duper of most men . His voice grew thick with excitement as he told of long watches to find out some fact , of friendships skilfully struck up , of playing one day the part of an engineer , the other that of a curate . " I tell you , " he said , " it 's grand . It 's always changing , and you never know where you are . When you 're on that sort of game it does n't matter if the papers ' are dull ; you always know when the door opens that there 's a good chance they 're coming to hang you . " Nothing could more clearly express the impulse to the singular which rises to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mapped out , interminably divided under county councils , painfully organized , law-abiding , devoid of danger because devoid of uncertainty . To quote twice from Mr. H. G. Wells , they find with Mr. Ponderevo that mankind is like cold muttonfat , and with the friend of Art Kipps that the only thing they can do , like the rats in a drain-pipe that they are , is to crawl along until they die . We all know these rebellions ; we have felt them ourselves ; at least I have , who once for nine years knew what it meant to go every day to a city office punctually at ten , to go out for lunch punctually at one , come back punctually at two , and stay there punctually till six , to be open to censure , to be ordered about , to look forward to fourteen days ' holiday , and then to look back upon the lost freedom , to see myself getting a little older , perhaps not much richer , and to . think all the time that this sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , with luck , until I was dead . I know the impulses that come to one , to go to West Africa and make one 's pile or die of fever , to run away to sea and live a Jack London sort of life , or to enlist in the Rhodesian Border Police , or to become the secretary of a charitable society , or something equally desperate . I confess it never occurred to me to become a spy , but I suspect that it did not occur to Witney , either ; the thing happened to him , which is the history of most men from Witney to Napoleon . Presumably spying , when the chance came , struck him as a way out . There he was , a very intelligent man , educated enough to care for translated classics , as irremediably jailed in his shipping-office and with as much chance of getting out legitimately as has a kitten at the bottom of a well . It is clear that it was not money drew him , even though he realized that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable , too , that the literature of the last fifteen to twenty years , the literature of the successful burglar , the respected railway magnate , and the intuitive detective influenced him . ( Detectives , from the point of view of the poor , are exactly in the same class as thieves ; they are their natural complements and antagonists . ) He saw poetry in himself , the poetry of movement which he might have perceived in a drummer , the poetry of uncertainty , as in the Imbue , the poetry of the streetloafer without links , who gazes at the public-house lights and a little at the stars . Mainly , he saw that this new life was different from the old ; and as the old was prose in its most malignant form , he took the new life for poetry . Witney 's idea of the romantic life was a low form of the idea which animated CXXXV. ? No.men like Bismarck , Machiavelli , Villon , Cecil Rhodes , and such like , all of them fairly predatory , fairly dangerous people ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of degree , not of type . Few men who have set their mark on history are different from these ; most of them have practised tyranny , lying , forgery ; most have had a giant 's strength , and few have hesitated to use it as a giant . And many minor successful people , chiefs of police , diplomats , are Witneys ? except that they have succeeded . It is quite possible that in other times , under Elizabeth , or under Lorenzo the Magnificent , Witney might have become an envoy or an intriguing friar . Together with the taste for adventure , however , there was in Witney another i and a baser strain ; it is well indicated by his own reference to the villain at the theater ; this was vanity . At first sight it appears ridiculous . One can imagine a spy , especially a detected one , cringing and fawning for his life , and moral peo-ple would like to imagine him pursued by the furies of his own remorse ; it is a pretty picture , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done , " or bewailing " the shaine he has brought on his father 's gray hairs , " and all that sort of thing . That is the spy of the novelette or of the third act . In fact , , I suspect that the spy does not differ much from other law-breakers . This means that he readily confesses . All lawbreakers confess . They do so mainly because they are men and because men feel a violent need for expansion . Few can live close lives , contain the deeds of heroism or ignominy which they have committed . They seek sympathy , and the records of nearly every police-office contain confessions of theft , forgery , and even murder which have been made by the criminals when they were perfectly sober , when nothing threatened them , because they felt that they must talk . To push the inquiry a little further , why does a man talk ? to a woman ? to a friend ? to a stranger in the street ? to a policeman , even ? Why have men , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that every time a crime is so well advertised as to become almost popular several confessions come in from people who obviously have nothing to do with it ? Rather unbalanced people often , but still people to whom prison and the rope mean something . It is not only because man is to himself the axis of the earth and must talk about himself ; nor is it because he feels remorse at having " brought the gray hairs of his father with sorrow to the grave " ; it is because crime is interesting and unusual ; therefore it is something to be proud of , to brag about . All achievement , proud or low , is pregnant of Coriolanian pride : like an eagle in a dove-cote , I Flutter 'd your Volsces in Corioli : Alone 1 did it . . . Witney was stuck up . He bragged abundantly to his new friend of the coups he had brought off . He had nothing to hide ( a privilege that few men enjoy until doomed to be shot next day ) . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , indeed that lie should exaggerate . Isolate in the midst of life which , tick by tick , was withdrawing from his body , there rose in him something histrionic that made him want to appear a true villain if he could not be a true man . " You 've behaved all right to me , " he said , " I do n't mind telling you . After being what I was , perched up on a high stool , with some fool whom I 'd have smacked in the eye for the fun of it having the right to bullyrag me , and doing it , too ? Well , to come out of all that and to he somebody behind the scenes , somebody who knows and who is n't found out , somebody who 's out for big things , finding out some new gun , or some new dodge of the navy , and going about among all those people who do n't know , with the secret in my pocket , it 's grand . I tell you I felt a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't bullyrag you ; if they know what you 're worth , they treat you decently ? like a man , not like a clerk . They call you Mr. , even if they do pay you . And if you do something smart they do n't mind telling you and praising you up until you feel as big as a turkeycock ; they 're not afraid that you 'll ask for a raise just because they 're pleased , not like those people outside grubbingin the dirt for sixpences . You feel big . Listen . I 'll tell you . " Witney talked . He must have talked most of that night . Unreservedly he revealed his methods , the ordinary objects of his work , making it clear that he felt no more loyalty to his employers than to his own people , and that to him spying was a sport . Indeed , he almost said so , for I know that he used the metaphor , " It beats cock-fighting . " What he said may not be printed here , but I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving penetration into one of the most august places in Europe , was a pure invention . I have been able to make inquiries into the ways of that place ; the story Witney told involved entry by a door which has been bricked up on the inside for the last ten years . Could anything be more significant ? Could anything more closely confirm the theory that crime makes more braggarts than virtue ? Witney , assured of an audience , was showing off . He was acting ; he was being a desperate character , a serious Charlie Chaplin . There is in all this something terrible and burlesque . Evidently the man was burnt up by the fire of his own egotism . This does not single him out from other men , for we can none of us escape interest in ourselves or in our surroundings ; it needs almost impossible sympathy for a man to suffer as much when his neighbor is operated upon without an anesthetic as when he himself has a toothache . It is the old story ? the proximate thing is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a dog fight in one 's own alley . Witney phrased it when he said : " It 's not only the things that really happen to one . They 're exciting enough , my word ! but it 's all the rest that grows round it . One thinks of making a success of it . Do n't you laugh . A chap like me wants to get on , just as much as you want to be a general , or to get into Parliament , or whatever it is . I tell you what , now and then I sit sort of dreaming of things not asleep , of course , but in that dreamy way , in a soft chair . S'pose you think that a funny thing to do . Often I see myself going to the usual place , and there are half a dozen people there . Not the fellow I generally see , who used to be a police inspector in his own country . Oh no . It 's in a great big room all over gold , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen different kinds of cigars . They 're all sitting around ? the ambassador , and a duke or two , and some generals to fill in , all over stars and garters and things . No , nobody talks ; they 're much too excited about seeing me . I come in , quiet like , and I go up to the table , and I take my time ; I undo a brown-paper parcel , wrapper after wrapper , and bit of string after bit of string , I go on un-They ' re it ( I 'm not in a hurry , not me ) . They 're all leaning over a table and staring at me , and one of the generals gets so hot with excitement that he has to wipe his head . At last , when I 'm ready , I stand up and throw out my chest , and I fling a bundle of papers on the table in the middle of them , and I say : ' There you are ; there 's the treaty . I got it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do it for you any day . ' And I get out a cigarette , and strike a match on my boot . I do n't mind their being excited ; I 'm above it . And then there 's no end of a fuss . They crowd around me , shaking hands with me , and slapping me on the back , and calling me a fine fellow , and I tell them to give it a rest . Sometimes they make me a count on the spot , and the ambassador puts a gold chain with a lamb on it round my neck . You know the thing I mean . I get an estate given me by and by , and sometimes they ask if I 'd like to marry the duke 's daughter , and I say have a look at her first ? and so on and so on . It 's not always the same sort of dream ? I suppose you 'd call it a dream ; it 's a grand dream . Only a dream , but what 's life but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite what Witney said , for it comes to me distorted by report and necessarily by my own imagination , but substantially Witney was confessing to being the prey of frequent day-dreams . All men have them , and nearly always they are dreams of this character , traveling on more moderate lines . We are all familiar with the phenomenon . We dream out our own career , which is generally very successful ; we encounter antagonists and defeat them . Notably , we are defendants in court and are triumphantly acquitted after an eloquent speech . Or we are in the fashionable world and say the most , urbane and witty things . Witney was a prey to dreams where his importance was always immense and always of the same kind . This prompts the inquiry , " Was he sane ? " Is any sly sane , any more than other kinds of outlaw ? The day-dream is a sign which must not be ignored . Its significance must not be overrated ; all men suffer it , but not all are enthralled by it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ego . All men who are intensely concentrated round themselves are not mad ; I do not suppose that Louis XIV . was mad when he said , " The state , that is I " ; but almost every lunatic is greatly preoccupied with himself ; his conceits stand in relation with a self which he imagines ; he may he a king , a god ; even if , as suggested by Phil May , he thinks he is a poached egg , it is probably the egg out of which will be made the omelet of the universe . All text-books on psychiatry are crammed with instances of lunatics who think themselves powerful , or rich , or beautiful , or divine . Most of us have acquaintances whom we call vain , who are actually over imaginative and on the way to the megalomania of the lunatic . Megalomania is not irrelevant to the character of Witney , for nothing could be more characteristic than this day-dream of his , where the poor little back-stair spy sees himself among the great , and declining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the early signs of various neuroses ; indulged in , they almost invariably lead to eccentricity in the rich and to lunacy in the poor . This is well established , and Prof. Bernard Hart ( medical superintendent of Northumberland House Asylum ) has no doubt as to their nature or their influence : ? . . These complexes may expend a variable portion of their energy in the construction of fantasy . The fantasy produced in this way constitutes the common phenomenon of " day-dreaming , " which , although it occurs at every age , attains its most luxuriant development during adolescence . At this period the young man will often revel in astonishing feats of the imagination , fascinating scenes of great deeds and applauding crowds , in which , of course , he invariably plays the part of hero . In the construction of this imagery the complexes we have mentioned are assisted by the sex complexes , and the effects of the two causal groups are closely intermingled . The great deeds are generally performed before the admiring eyes of some fair lady whose favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within reasonable bounds their influence must , indeed , be regarded as harmful , because the energy of the complexes is expended in the weaving of fantasies , and is not translated into action . . , . A path opens here which leads us easily across the bridge into the regions of insanity , and the processes just considered provide a key to the interpretation of many of the symptoms which we observe in the asylum . The phenomenon of day-dreaming , however , would not be enough to indicate clearly a streak of insanity in Witney . If the idea had occurred to his interviewer , more details might have been obtained , but I am confirmed in the view that Witney was unbalanced by a chance remark which he made . The officer ultimately said to him : " Yes , that 's all right ; I see what you mean . It 's exciting in a way , and it gratifies your vanity , and it pays , but what about the end of it all ? Would it have been worth your while , leaving loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your country 's busi-ness ? " Witney did not reply to the direct question . He simply said , " I like to know . " Nothing can more clearly indicate the mad strain in him . Witney was revealing a tendency which , I suspect , is common to most of his fellows , to all except the grossest . He was exhibiting the wellknown symptom of maniacal curiosity . This symptom has been established by Prof. Bernard I IoRender ( president of the Ethological Society ) in his book , First Signs of Insanity . I quote a rev.ealing passage : There are patients who forever ask and try to answer questions to themselves , some of which are absurd , some metaphysical . . . If they are not interrogating themselves , they put questions perpetually to others . They must know the " How , " " Wherefore , " and " Why " of everything . Every answer they receive is met by further questions , so that they become a nuisance to everybody . To make it clear that I do not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir George Henry Savage ( late president of the Medico-Psycho-logical Society of Great Britain ) , who , in his book , Insanity and Allied Neuroses , says : Another variety of delusional insanity is seen in what might be called the inquisitive or meddlesome cases . . .. This feeling of extension of personal interest is a phase of mental oversensitiveness . Much more evidence can be adduced , but , that I may not make this paper wearisome , I have confined myself to three of the highest authorities . Considering Witney 's entirely spontaneous declaration that he liked to know , a declaration he made with a queerly intent passion , I am driven to submit as a psychopathic fact that part of the impulse which made him a spy is to be traced to a disordered mental state . Disorder plays strange tricks with minds ; some , like Nietzsche , like De Maupassant , like Morphy , it leads close to genius and into the darkness of the mad ; some , like Dostoievsky , like Shelley , like Napoleon , it contrives to spare ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in circumstance , it makes Witneys . To me , this aimless creature that was filled with lead in the morning , this ineffectual rebel against a uniform life , who forewent comfort and safety for adventure as truly as Don Quixote , even though his path was base and that of Don Quixote august , was little and vain , yet perhaps not much smaller nor much less vain than many a one who has fluked into power and into pomp ; that creature whom madness fogged when it might have illumined is pathetic , not because it died stupidly for stupid reasons , it because nature had created it , as a creates many others who to-day are spies , in such a way that even if it tried , it could not fit its contours into the formal mosaic of life .
