The Cynic said , finding himself the pleasantest seat , after the Easy Chair , in the room , and sinking into it with an effect of not meaning to get out of it soon , " I see that in some of the papers they are beginning again to thresh that old straw of the question whether poetry is a dying art or not . " " Yes , " we said , " it seems always to divert them , " and as we spoke we were aware of the Muse anxiously , and the veteran Reviewer critically , standing behind the Cynic 's chair in shadowy apparition . " Every now and then they expect some art to die . From time to time they have sculpture on the sick-list , but every now and then a good sculptor comes along in whom the art revives and starts fresh . When daguerreotyping was discovered , people thought that portraiture was done for , but with all the improvements in the camera more and more portrait-painters come from Europe every year and take the bread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five thousand or six thousand dollars a full length . We can remember very well when fiction itself , which now flourishes like a green upas-tree over the whole earth , was pronounced a plant which could not possibly recover from the peculiar kind of yellows that had attacked it . But by simply changing the color of its paper cover , and binding itself up in cloth , and offering itself for one dollar and a half instead of twenty-five cents , it has practically achieved perpetuity . What the people want is novelty ? even in novels . The people want change . " " And in poetry there can be no change , " the Muse suggested , with the satisfaction of a fated man in his doom . " Its form is fixed by its very perfection . " The Cynic looked round and up , and said , " Oh , are you there ? " with a smile . " Well , perhaps its clothes are not fixed , though its form may be . It may yet put on a different guise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cynic returned , " Ossian . " The Reviewer nodded acquiescence , with a warning glance at the Muse and ourself . " When the divine Macpherson felt the need of reproducing prehistoric Gaelic poetry in modern terms , which should admit no question of its genuineness , he chose the meterless pace of rhythm and the apparel of prose , in which it should n't trip up . I must say that whether it was genuine or not , some of it was fine . It was better poetry than the rhyme of Dr. Johnson , who declared it spurious . Then , if you want another flagrant instance , quite of our own era , there are Walt Whitman 's poems , Leaves of Grass , which in their purely rhythmical movement revert to the Old Testament , though I am bound to say that they are not such good poetry as the Book of Job , which is frankly printed as prose . As a lady , " the Cynic more directly addressed himself to the Muse , " you may not be aware that Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ! " the Muse haughtily returned . " I 'm Greek myself 1 " " To be sure ! I forgot , " the Cynic apologized . " Then you do know . " " One of the most delightful chapters of Mr. Taylor 's Mediceval Mind , " the Reviewer observed , " is that where he traces the rise of rhyme in Latin verse . " " Yes , that is delightful . We wonder if rhyme rose the same way in Greek verse ? " and we looked at the Muse . " As to that , I ca n't say , " she answered . " I am Periclean Greek ! " " Oh ! " we said , apologetically . The Cynic remarked : " The Greek poets got along without rhyme as long as they were in Greek ; but when they were put into the English of Queen Anne 's time they had to have it . Dr. Johnson was very stiff about it ; he did n't think much of Milton and his blank verse ; but blank verse , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more ? reverting to the Elizabethan dramatists in that , and bettering them ? till hardly any serious poem of considerable length was written in rhyme . But now poetry , divinely immutable in form , has put on the guise of prose ; and I must say I find some of it curiously more readable in that semblance . " " You mean that Kansas man ? " we said . " Yes , that Kansas man . And very probably he uses prose clothes for his poetic form merely because he is nervously impatient of the conventional way of printing rhymes . " " More likely , " the Reviewer said , " he finds that costume better adapted to the gait of his unfailing horse-sense , and his true and simple closeness to life in his thinking and feeling . If it were inflexibly a question of getting the civilization of Emporia , Kansas , into the flowing garments , flounced , frilled , furbelowed typography of rhyme as usually printed , he might have given up at the outset ; and we been the losers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we asked of this impartial sage , while the Muse looked wistfully at him . " I go further . I own that in a long life of checkered reviewing I have never really enjoyed reading rhyme except of the most exceptional excellence . " " Is n't this rather extraordinary ? " We turned to the Cynic . " On the contrary , " he said , with a malicious smile , " it is a very prevalent experience . I fancy that when our friend 's confession reaches your readers there will be a storm of acquiescence . I lately heard one of the literary laity ? a lady of taste Day that she could not endure the sight of verses beginning with capitals and breaking on the rhymes in the established way . You know how impossible printed drama is to some people , most people . The names of the characters and stage directions in italics , and the parentheses and brackets , render the text so repulsive to the general eye that it turns from the page in abhorrence . " " There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No doubt that has had a good deal to do with enslaving the novelist to his quotation-marks and his explanatory clauses , his said-he 's and cried-she 's , and the Iike , when he breaks from narrative into dialogue . He would give anything to print it like a play , but he knows his reader would not stand it . " " Yes , we do n't take sufficient account of the part that the eye plays in such matters . It would be easy , " the Reviewer said , " to convince the reason that through ought to be spelled thru ; the reason is already convinced ; but the eye stubbornly refuses the new spelling , and will not reconcile itself in a generation . Something more radical is wanted : a reform that runs through , or thru , our whole orthography , with exact and invariable duties assigned to every letter of the alphabet . I have seen some attempts , in other languages , to reform the printing of prose by beginning only the first line of a poem with a capital letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period is reached . But it would n't work with me . My stupid eye wanted the capitals . " " Yes , " the Muse said , rather than put off my head-dress I would choose to appear at once in the dress of prose . " " The trousers and the sack-coat and the derby ? " the Cynic mocked . " Our Kansas man has divined your preference ; he has given you your ' d'ruther . ' " " But hold on a moment ! " we put in . " Ought n't we to distinguish ? Is the prose form adapted to all kinds of poetry ? Our Kansas man makes it go in his drolling , in his hard , dry , business wisdom , in his realistic study of countrytown character and event ; but does n't the heart , the mind , the soul , come in somewhere ? What about the imagination ? " " What about The Little Green Tents ? " the Reviewer asked , and he began to read from a book which he carried : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunbeams play , and the women weep , are covered with flowers to-day ; and between the tents walk the weary few , who were young and stalwart in sixty-two , when they went to the war away . The little green tents are built of sod , and they are not long and they are not broad , but the soldiers have lots of room ; and the sod is part of the land they saved , where the flag of the many darkly waved , the symbol of dole and doom . The little green tent is a thing divine ; the little green tent is a country 's shrine , where patriots kneel and pray ; and the brave men left , so old , so few , were young and stalwart in sixtytwo , when they went to the war away ! ' " The Reviewer 's voice broke on the last words ; it was a moment before he could say , as he offered the book to the Muse : " It 's printed as prose , you see . " " I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she took out a pretty laced handkerchief and wiped her eyes . The Cynic blew a resounding nose . " Well , " he said , " that 's country-town , too , I suppose . " " Is n't the country-town thing the universal American thing ? " we asked . " Yen might say so , " he assented , recovering himself , but I do n't feel bound to like the universal American thing . I have said my little say in behalf of poetry printed as prose ? cavalry fighting as infantry ? but if I said it mainly to tease our fair friend here , " and be indicated the Muse , " I 'm willing to demand , on her behalf , something more classic in that form than our Kansas man has had time to produce before I advocate its universal adoption . Suppose we each try a well-known poem in prose-printing ? " " Never 1 " the Muse exclaimed ; but the experiment seemed so interesting that each of us others took a volume from the well-stored shelves surrounding the Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our prose version of Herrick 's Delight in Disorder , which we had chosen perhaps because it was short : " A sweet disorder in the dress kindles in clothes a wantonness ; a lawn about the shoulders thrown into a fine distraction ; an erring lace , which here and there enthrals the crimson stomacher ; a cuff neglectful , and thereby ribbons to flow confusedly ; a winning wave , deserving note , in the tempestuous petticoat ; a careless shoe-string , in whose tie I see a wild civility , do more bewitch me than when art is too precise in every part . " We exchanged pages with the Reviewer , and found that he had transformed Emerson 's Brahma " If the red slayer think he slays , or if the slain think he is slain , they know not well the subtle ways I keep , and pass , and turn again . Far or forgot to me is near ; shadow and sunlight are the same ; the vanished gods to me appear ; and one to me are shame and fame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fly I am the wings ; I am the doubter and the doubt , and I the hymn the Brahmin sings . The strong gods pine for my abode , and pine in vain the sacred Seven ; but thou , meek lover of the good , find me and turn thy back on heaven ! " When the Cynic showed us his prosified poem we were both somewhat mystified by his choice of Collins 's ode : " How sleep the brave who sink to rest by all their country 's wishes blest ! When Spring , with dewy fingers cold , returns to deck their hallowed mold , she there shall dress a sweeter sod than Fancy 's feet have ever trod . By fairy hands their knell is rung ; by forms unseen their dirge is sung ; there Honor comes , a pilgrim gray , to bless the turf that wraps their clay ; and Freedom shall awhile repair to dwell , a weeping hermit , there . " " Why did you choose just that piece ? " we asked . " For no very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic -- eighteenth - century classic . Perhaps it was through an impulse that carried from the kindred feeling in The Little Green Tents of your Kansas man . " " They are of kindred feeling , " we owned , in relief from a vague sense of sacrilege in the performance . " I could n't say at all what controlled my choice of Brahma , " the Reviewer volunteered to say . " That 's classic , too , though in a loftier and severer sort . Perhaps I was curious to see whether it would be clearer in the prose form without losing anything of its fine mystical quality . What do you say ? " We let the Cynic take the word . " I should n't say it had gained . But if you think more people would like it as prose ? as cavalry fighting as infantry ? " We saw he would not be serious , and we said , concerning our own choice : " We fancied that in a light thing like this of Herrick 's the test would be completer . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , and in the prose form it keeps the winged feet just the same as ever . As I understand it , what we want to do is to render poetry less repulsive to the average eye , and so make it generally popular . What do you think would really be the effect of a universal metamorphosis l " No one else spoke , but the Muse shuddered out , " Horrors ! " " But , dear child , " we protested , " you have n't even looked at these prose versions 1 " and we offered them to her . She shrank back . " I could n't touch them . To my Greek eye they are a profanation. "
