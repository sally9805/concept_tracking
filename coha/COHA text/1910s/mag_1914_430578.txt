IN the entire field of architectural history there is no style which is the equal of Gothic architecture . Egyptian buildings may impress the beholder with their size and color , Greek temples with the perfection of their proportions and the pure beauty of their sculpture , Roman monuments with their lavish decoration and the tremendous daring of their builders ; but in none of them is there a fraction of the emotional power -. which lies in the Gothic cathedral . Gothic architecture is the very embodiment in stone and glass of all that is noblest in human faith . It is the concrete expression of the hopes and fears of Christianity . That this is so , is due in no small measure to the historical conditions in the midst of which it attained its growth . France was the birthplace of the style ; but it was not a France of peace and civilization , as one might expect . Rather , it was a country given over to petty strife among its nobles and to lawlessness in its cities . Yet , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange fact that religion was supreme , and that the power of the church reached the highest point to which it has ever attained . It was this religion which led men , whose homes could scarcely have been better than hovels , to bend their backs to the  | task of erecting churches which remain to this day the wonder of all eyes . It was not a religion of faith , however , so much as one of fear , which produced the condition of mind necessary to bring men to such a task as this . It was the fear of punishment in the future life , and the desire to lessen or escape this fate , which was largely instrumental in leading men and women to harness themselves to carts and allow their bodies to be whipped by zealous priests as they hauled the stone and wood for building such a cathedral as that of Chartres ( shahrtr ) . It was the same fear which led the warlike nobles , who even dared attack the bishops of the church , humbly to contribute land and money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not make amends for warring among themselves or against the church 's ministers . BEGINNINGS OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE Although the product of such religious conditions , it must not be thought that Gothic architecture sprang full grown from the soil . The thirteenth century , in which it reached its bloom , was preceded by hundreds of years of experiment , during which the Christian builders of France were laboring to erect larger and more beautiful churches from very simple beginnings . It is a long step , for example , from the tenth century nave of the cathedral of Beauvais ( bo-vay ' ) to the choir of the same church , and in between the two there lie three centuries of progress . The first two constitute the period known as Romanesque.  | The greatest problem which the Romanesque builders set themselves to solve was how to cover their churches of ever increasing size with roofs , or rather vaults , of stone , which would check the disastrous fires which were constantly destroying the roofs of wood . After many more or less unsatisfactory experiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaulting problem . Its solution lay in what is known as the ribbed vault . This consisted in the construction of a series of arches , some across the church , some diagonally between these transverse arches , in such a manner that a skeleton of stone was formed above the entire building . Upon this skeleton panels of light masonry were laid , and the whole space inclosed . It is this ribbed vault , with its many structural and decorative possibilities , which forms the keynote of Gothic architecture . With it came the introduction of the pointed arch , which is so often erroneously thought of as the mark of Gothic , but which is really only a byproduct of the style . As the builders became more skilful in constructing the vault , they next turned their attention to the problem of raising it higher and higher above the ground , in order to obtain more lofty church interiors with increased window space . This introduced the question of supports ; for the higher the vault was raised the more difficult it was to meet its pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the builders evolved flying buttresses , those great half-arches of stone which appear in long rows above the side aisle roofs of almost every Gothic church .  | The vaults thus raised , and the windows thus increased in size , the problem of how to fill them with glass now presented itself . They were s , large that the previous method of using a single sheet made up of small pieces of painted glass was no longer safe , since the enlarged expanse would have been in constant danger of destruction from the pressure of the wind . So the builders found it necessary to subdivide the windows . This they did with stone bars or mullions , which mullions form what is known as tracery . In the earlier churches like Bourges ( boorzh ) and Chartres the bars between the openings are heavy , almost like a part of the wall itself , and the tracery which they form is known as plate tracery , since a windo ? thus divided has the appearance of a number of openings of different shape cut through a plate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often richly molded . This constituted bar tracery . In its use the windows were subdivided into patterns of most varied and beautiful design . In the best period these designs are made up of simple geometrical curves , as at Rheims ( reemz ; French , rongs ) . and the tracery is known as geometric bar tracery . Later many compound curves were introduced , as in the transept of Beauvais , and the tracery is known as flamboyant or curvilinear . Finally , in the last Gothic period in England , the bars were placed largely in horizontal and perpendicular lines , and the tracery is therefore termed rectilinear or perpendicular . Tracery is thus an important factor in determining the period of Gothic to which a church belongs . With this account of the ribbed vault , the flying buttress , and tracery , the three chief principles of Gothic construction , it is now possible to turn to some of the churches themselves and get an idea of their actual appearance , as well as a little insight into the marvelous decoration which accompanies their structural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chartres is one of the earlier examples of French Gothic architecture . Like most of the great cathedrals , how- ever , it was many years in building and many times altered in one part or another . This is well illustrated in its west front , or facade , the lower part of which , together with the south spire , is very early Gothic , and dates from the twelfth century , while the spire to the left is flamboyant , and dates from 1507-1513 . These towers have been much admired , especially the older one , which , though severe in its lines , shows remarkable skill in the manner in which a square base has been carried up into an octagonal spire . Taken as a whole , the facade is rather plain . Gothic decoration is only beginning to unfold its richness here . The circular window is , however , a most pleasing example of plate tracery , and a closer view of the three central doorways will reveal a wealth of sculpture and carving . A careful study of this sculpture is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is not in any sense extraneous decoration . It portrays in the clearest possible manner the purpose for which the building was erected . The figures carved in such profusion around these doors provided a Bible for the thousands of people of their day , who could not read a printed page . The long , slender statues are kings and queens , prophets and saints , of the Scriptures . Above their heads the little figures in the capitals of the shafts depict scenes from the life of Christ ; while above the central door sits the Master himself , the Book of Life in His hands , the symbols of the four evangelists around Him . To be sure , the figures are somewhat crude , almost laughable if you will ; but remember that they are early works belonging just at the threshold of Gothic art . Moreover , a certain amount of their stiffness is due to a very proper feeling on the part of their sculptors that these figures should harmonize with the archi. -  | tectural lines of the building on which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when a thorough study is made of its hidden as well as of its outward meaning , this sculpture may be more fully appreciated and understood . Far finer work was to be done in the thirteenth century , and fortunately Chartres may boast of some of the best in its north and south porches . The interior of the cathedral is less pleasing than that of a number of other French Gothic churches . It may boast , however , some of the finest painted glass in the world , which , like the sculptures of the exterior , affords to the beholder a complete series of Bible scenes , written that all may read . BOURGES The cathedral of Bourges is almost contemporary with Chartres , dating in the main from the early thirteenth century . Compared to such later churches as Amiens ( ah-mee-ahng ' ) and Rheims , its exterior is somewhat plain ; but it has the distinction of being unbroken by a transept , and its continuous line thus gives a good idea of the length and height of one of these Gothic marvels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flank does not lack a decorative character ; for the simple plate tracery in the windows and the long rows of flying buttresses , with their play of light and shade and line , give it a most pleasing appearance . The interior is even more impressive . It is with a sense of awe that the visitor beholds the length and breadth and height of this great church . It is truly a House of God , and one worthy of His worship . Down the length of the nave for more than 300 feet run long rows of lofty piers ;  | with slender shafts along their faces rising to support those tremendous vaults of stone 125 feet above the floor . And there beneath the vaults are windows , some of them filled with glorious painted glass of the thirteenth century , depicting in color in the interior of the church the Bible stories so beautifully wrought in sculpture on the exterior of the portals . If the arches between the nave and aisles seem a little high in comparison to the size of the windows above them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the aisles , each with its own row of windows beneath the vaults , which thus seem borne upon a wall of glass , or rather suspended by some invisible hand above the church . RHEIMS The early type of Gothic facade has been seen at Chartres . A more developed form may be seen at Paris , and still a richer example at Amiens ; but for sheer decorative beauty the front of the cathedral of Notre Dame at Rheims outranks all which either preceded or followed it . It is exquisite from the ground to the top of its traceried towers . Unfortunately these have never received their spires ; but they are almost perfect without them . Geometrical tracery of the richest character may be seen in the great rose win- dow , in the belfry openings , and in the spaces above each of the three doors . The latter are decorated with a wealth of sculpture ; while hundreds of statues , beneath beautifully wrought canopies , may be seen in other parts of the church . That the reader may have some idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may suffice say that the central portal alone is nearly fifty feet in width and over seventv-five - feet high , sufficiently large to cover beneath its arches a five or six-story building . A side view of the church is no less impressive . It dominates the city at its feet , not merely by its size , but by the beauty of its proportions and its decoration . Had it been finished as planned , there would be seven great towers rising above its roofs ; but unfortunately the dream of the original builders was never realized . Nevertheless , the beautiful pinnacled buttresses , the traceried windows , and the splendid parapet which crowns the walls render this perhaps the finest exterior in France . Climbing to the roof and walking beneath the buttresses , one realizes the intricate structural character of this Gothic architecture , as well as its tremendous scale . COLOGNE This sense of size is even more pronounced when one stands before the cathedral of Cologne ( ko-lone ' ) . Furthermore , Cologne is the only great cathedral which is complete . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic era ; for the nave and spires were built in recent years , though in true Gothic style . This may not detract from the impression which the church produces ; but it can not fail to detract from its appeal to the emotions , and this is one of the most important possessions of the truly me- dieval church . Although in Germany , Cologne is French as far as architecture is concerned , and its builders were evidently inspired by the cathedral of Amiens , which ? as just being completed as that of Cologne ? as begun . Its choir thus dates from the close of the thirteenth and the early fourteenth centuries ; in other words , from the end of the best Gothic period . Beautiful as is its exterior , the interior of the cathedral is even more worthy of admiration . If Bourges and Rheims have given the reader a sense of size and of building skill , what shall be said of this church , whose total length is over 450 feet , whose vaults rise ' so feet above the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by open arches and vast sheets of glass ? AMIENS AND BEAUVAIS Only two Gothic churches can compare with Cologne . One is Amiens , which has the advantage over its rival of possessing far more and finer sculptural decoration and none of it new , but all the product of the religious fervor of the Middle Ages . The other is Beauvais . And this is a fitting church to close an account of Gothic architecture in France ; for it is not only the loftiest Gothic church in the French style , but its transepts date from the early sixteenth century , and illustrate in an admirable manner that last phase of Gothic known as flamboyant . The most striking feature of this period is the S-like curve used in arches , tracery , and decoration . This may be clearly seen in the great windows above the transept door . Unfortunately the cathedral of Beauvais is only half a church ; for its nave was never built . Its choir , however , is quite as beautiful as those of Amiens and Cologne .  | THE GOTHIC STYLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such height as that attained at Amiens or Beauvais . When compared with contemporary French examples , the English Gothic cathedrals will generally be found to afford many contrasts in style and decoration . They are , as a rule , longer , but much lower , the loftiest having a height of but a hundred feet in the interior . Perhaps because of this lowness the English builders made far less use of the flying buttress than the French , depending for the stability of their vaults upon the strength and thickness of the walls . The vaults , too , vary greatly from the French , in that they usually have a large number of ribs , most of them serving a purely decorative purpose . The facades of the English cathedrals are also quite different ; for they are likely to be screen walls , as at Lincoln , Salisbury , or Ripon ; sometimes flanked with towers , but rarely bearing much relation to the church behind then. : . English doorways are small , proportioned rather according to their purpose than to the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , the English cathedrals have a charm which is all their own . Many of them are situated in the midst of broad green fields instead of among the crowded houses of a great city , and their long , low lines are in true accord with such pastoral surroundings . Moreover , they have a glorious feature in their central towers , a feature seldom found in France . Sometimes these towers are crowned with spires , as at Salisbury and Lichfield ; but more often they are square at the top , with graceful pinnacles and parapets , as at Lincoln , Gloucester . and Canterbury . The windows play an important part in determining the period of English Gothic to which a particular church belongs . When they are long and slender , with no tracery  | at all , but with an arch at the top shaped like the head of a lance , they date from the Early English or lancet period ; when bar tracery of geometrical or curvilinear type is used , the period is the Second English or decorated ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , the window belongs to the last period of English Gothic , the perpendicular or rectilinear . Many English cathedrals have portions dating from all these periods , and very often from the preceding Romanesque as well . Lincoln , for example , is largely lancet ; but its tower is geometrical , the rose window of its south transept curvilinear , and certain chapels added to the church are perpendicular Gloucester still possesses many Romanesque portions dating from the twelfth century ; but its choir was one of the first works of the perpendicular period , and from the east the cathedral appears to be entirely in this style . It has been necessary to compress this account of Gothic architecture into a very few pages , and the style as it appears in Italy , Spain , and elsewhere has been purposely omitted . These and other countries possess Gothic churches of most imposing size and beautiful appearance , as , for example , the cathedral of Milan ; but they will readily be recognized as Gothic by those familiar with the principles of the style as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
