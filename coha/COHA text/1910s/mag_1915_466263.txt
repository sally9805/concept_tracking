WHEN John Hay went to his desk as Secretary of State , on October 1 , 1898 , he found many important matters pressing for an issue . With most of these his year and a half in London had made him acquainted . He had the further advantage of knowing the leaders of public life in Washington and in England , and lie was generally regarded as a man of nor only singular personal attraction , but also of keen intelligence and of unblemished uprightness . If he had little taste for the routine work of office , still he performed it conscientiously . His health , never robust , became more and more precarious under the strain put upon it by questions of vast moment , by opposition which he thought factious , and by a tragic sorrow . More than once he was on the verge of breaking down ; but he held , duty-true , to his task , until he had spent his last ounce of strength in the service . Then he died . The public , little aware of his trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoyed a comfortable sense of security that while he was Secretary of State the national honor and safety were assured . One of the first annoyances which beset Secretary Hay was the rapacity of office-seekers . When they did not attack him themselves , they worked through their Senators . To say " no " to the local statesman of Pumpkin Four Corners , who aspired to be consul-general in London , was easy ; but to deny his Senator might alienate one whose hostile vote would kill an important treaty . In vain did Hay protest that his predecessor , Judge Day , had swept the shelf clean ; in vain did he declare that there were fifty applicants for every vacancy ; the swarm gave him no respite . And if Senators slackened , Congressmen redoubled their importunities . At first the Secretary saw the ludicrousness of this system and discharged its drudgery with a smile ; but later , when his health made even pin-pricks unendurable , he turned the business over to Assistant-Secretary Loomis . The following notes to a distinguished Senator show Hay in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulate in the service is Iquique . Do 1 understand that the great Commonwealth you so nobly represent wishes to fill it ? It brings in to the pampered occupant something like $800 a year . April 2 , roon. ? A candidate for Iquique has turned up . . . . Unless you have a man with a better claim on that $800 salary , I think this low-priced Phoenix may take the cake . April 5 , 1900. -1 . have your letter of yesterday . Of course , if you want Iquique for Mr. C. you shall have it , but are you sure he would want to go ? The place is not in Mexico , as you seem to think , but in Chile , and I imagine would best be described by Goldsmith 's line : " Remote , unfriended , melancholy , slow . " The Secretary was pestered by requests for favors other than offices . Thus a Congressman of fashionable pretensions writes that his relatives , who are at Dresden , desire to be presented to the King and Queen of Saxony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides sending a polite reply to the fashionable Congressman , to communicate with the American ambassador in Berlin to instruct the American consul in Dresden to request the royal chamberlain there to include the names of the ladies of the fashionable Congressman in his list of invitations to the next Court reception . And so the house-that-Jackbuilt circuit was completed . Not less interesting is the demand of Senator Hanna , established at Aix-lesBains for the benefit of his health , that Secretary Hay shall authorize the American consul at Nuremberg ? who appears to have been appointed to that office because he was the Senator 's private physician ? to take leave of absence , hasten to Aix-les-Bains , and watch the effect of the waters on Mr. Hanna 's impaired system . We are not informed whether the Senator or the United States Treasury paid the traveling expenses of the doctor ; we suspect , however , that it paid for the cablegram to Nuremberg , and presumably it continued the doctor 's salary while he was absent on private business . Such practices would cause no remark in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironies of patriotism . On entering the State Department Secretary Hay was confronted by many grave international questions . The Peace Commissioners had received their general instructions when he took office , but during the negotiations he was in constant communication with them . How far the later modifications sprang from President McKinley , and how far from him or other advisers , I can not say ; but there is no doubt that Hay approved of the terms of settlement with Spain , including the retention , by the United States , of the Philippine Islands . The policy of embarking on colonial possessions aroused a storm of opposition , which came to be called Anti-Imperialism . Many of its leaders ? Carl Schurz , Charles Eliot Norton , Edward Atkinson , Charles Francis Adams , Senator G. F. Hoar -- had been among the earliest Republicans at a time when that party worked to abolish slavery . To their protests that the country ought not to go into the business of ruling Filipinos against their will , Hay and the McKinley administration replied that , whether the United States liked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not evade . On both sides , the debate was very bitter ? how bitter can be inferred from this letter of Hay 's to Whitelaw Reid , dated November 29 , 1898 : In all the vicissitudes of the last few weeks I have been delighted to find you always on the side of square and resolute dealing , and VOL . CXXX. ? No. 780. - 104 now that I hope the end is in sight I feel that the country is under great obligations to you and those of your colleagues who felt as you have on the subject . There is a wild and frantic attack now going on in the press against the whole Philippine transaction . Andrew Carnegie really seems to be off his head . He writes me frantic letters , signing them " Your Bitterest Opponent . " He threatens the President , not only with the vengeance of the voters , but with practical punishment at the hands of the mob . He says henceforth the entire labor vote of America will be cast against us , and that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fall in irretrievable ruin the moment it shoots down one insurgent Filipino . He does not seem to reflect that the Government is in a somewhat robust condition even after shooting down several American citizens in his interest at Homestead . But all this confusion of tongues will go its way . The country will applaud the resolution that has been reached , and you will return in the role of conquering heroes with your " brows bound with oak . " If Secretary Hay were living to-day , he might well be on the side of Mr. Carnegie and the Anti-Imperialists . Among the larger diplomatic labors which Hay inherited from his predecessor was the effort to adjust with Canada various claims and grievances which had been a recurrent source of irritation between the two countries . Twelve subjects were specified in the protocol ; and a Joint High Commission was appointed , which , having met at Quebec , removed to Washington and held its sessions there during the last months of 180 . Several of the differences could be easily settled ; one , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recent discovery of gold in the Klondike and the rush thither of troops of adventurers , made it imperative that the frontier lines should be marked . Since 1867 , when the United States bought Alaska from Russia , certain inlets , harbors , and channels had been undisputedly American ; now , the Canadians laid claim to them . The Americans believed that the Canadians , knowing that they had no case , insisted on including the Alaskan contention in the general negotiations in the hope that it might slip through with the rest . On December 3 , 1898 , Hay wroteconfidentially to Mr. Henry White , First Secretary of the American Embassy in London : I hear from no less than three members of our Canadian Commission that by far the worst member of the Commission to deal with is Lord Herschel who is more cantankerous than any of the Canadians , raises more petty points , and is harder than any of the Canadians to get along with . In fact . he is the principal obstacle to a favorable arrangement . If you could in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even Lord Salisbury , should occasion offer , intimate this state of things , so that they might speak a word which would moderate his excessive lawyer-like zeal to make a case , it would be a good thing . On January 3 , 1899 , the Secretary complains again to Mr. White : Lord Herschel , with great dexterity and ability , represents his own side as granting everything and getting nothing , and yet I think the letter of Fairbanks shows with perfect clearness and candor that we are making great concessions and getting no credit for them . . . In the case of Alaska , it is hard to treat with patience the claim set up by Lord Herschel that virtually the whole coast belongs to England , leaving us only a few jutting promontories without communication with each other . Without going into the historical or legal argument , as a mere matter of common sense it is impossible that any nation should ever have conceded , or any other nation have accepted , the cession of such a ridiculous and preposterous boundary-line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put forward a claim that he had no belief or confidence in , for the mere purpose of.trading it off for something substantial . And yet , the slightest suggestion that his claim is unfounded throws him into a fury . Nevertheless , the Lord Chancellor stuck uncompromisingly to his demands , and the commission adjourned on February 2o , 1899 . Only in the following October was a modus vivendi agreed to ; but not until January , 1903 , were negotiations reopened which led to the final settlement of this fretting dispute . In the mean time Lord Herschel had died , the Boxer uprising and the Boer War had supervened , President McKinley had been assassinated , and Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House . In President Roosevelt Secretary Hay had a vigorous chief . The convention which Hay then signed with Sir Michael Herbert , the British Ambassador , called for a limited commission , to consist of three Americans and three Britishers . ' It being taken for granted that the Americans and Canadians would each uphold the contention of their respective governments , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fortuitous . For President Roosevelt , who thought Hay 's attitude indecisive , if not actually timid , privately caused it to be understood by Mr. Balfour , Mr. Chamberlain , and other members of the British Cabinet , that if this effort at settlement failed he would get the consent of Congress to enable him to run the boundary " on his own hook . " He said emphatically that he would no more consent to arbitrate , in the ordinary sense of the word , than the English would consent to arbitrate the possession of the Orkneys or the Hebrides . The claim of the Canadians for access to deep water along any part of the Canadian coast is the wrote just exactly as indefensible as if they should now suddenly claim the island of Nantucket .. . I wish to make one last effort to bring about an agreement through the Commission he said in closing which will enable the people of both countries to say that the result represents the feeling of the representatives of both countries . But if there is a disagreement , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no arbitration of the matter , but that in my message to Congress I shall take a position which will prevent any possibility of arbitration here-after : a position . which will render it necessary for Congress to give me the authority to run the line as we claim it , by our own people , without any further regard to the attitude of England and Canada . If I paid attention to mere abstract right , that is the position I ought to take , anyhow . What passed through the minds of the British Ministers when they heard , confidentially , the President 's decision is not reported . Possibly they realized The Americans appointed by the President were Senator Lodge ; Elihu Root , Secretary of War ; and ex-Senator George Turner , of Washington . The English members were Lord Alverstone , Chief justice of England ; and the Canadians , Sir L. A. Jure and A. B. Aylesworth. that the claims which the Canadians had pushed for the past five years were only a bluff ; assuredly , they knew that Mr. Roosevelt meant what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Alaska ; at all events , they appointed as England 's representative Lord Alverstone , whose opinion that the American contention was just is said to have been no secret to them . Whatever demur Secretary Hay may have made in his consultations with the President , he defended the American policy stanchly as soon as Mr. Roosevelt had adopted it . To Mr. Frederick W. Seward , who complained in the New York Tribune that the government was too conciliatory , he wrote ( January 3o , 1903 ) : ft seems to me there can be only one objection to the treatyl , and that is the possibility that the decision of the tribunal may not be final ; the Commissioners may be evenly divided . In that case we are no worse off than we are now , and the gain we have made is to separate this question from the other questions of which it prevented any solution . But I can not help thinking . . that the English are convinced they have no case , and have , therefore , consented to this apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . It is inconceivable that any American should decide against us , while if we succeed in convincing one of their men ? and we ought to do it with the case we have ? the troublesome question is settled for ever , and the two countries can go ahead , delimit the frontier and put up monuments for all time . Gen. John W. Foster , ex-Secretary of State , well versed in the Alaskan controversy , prepared the American ease which the Administration hoped Mr. Choate , American Ambassador in London , would present before the tribunal . Your note of the zznd of January , Iwo IMr . Hay wrote to himl , has never been answered , and we regard it as absolutely unanswerable . Still Mr. Choate declined the appointment , and Messrs . Watson and Dickinson served in his stead . In expressing his regrets to Mr. White , Hay said : A mere legal argument is not what is required in this unprecedented case . A sharp , aggressive lawyer will run great risk of getting Lord Alverstonc 's back up . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skill , and knowledge of human nature . In due season , on October 20 , 1903 , the tribunal gave a decision in favor of the chief American claims . Lord Alverstone voted with the three Americans . The two Canadian members dissented . After long waiting Secretary Hay saw one of his cherished measures adopted . An even weightier question which pressed for settlement was that of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama . A French company under De Lesseps had collapsed in 1888 after it had accomplished more than a third of the excavations . Thenceforward , the feeling strengthened year by year in the United States that any isthmian canal should be built and controlled by the American government . But the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty , ratified in 1850 between the United States and Great Britain , stood in the way ? since it pledged each party never to " obtain or maintain for itself any exclusive control over the said shipcanal , " or " assume or exercise any dominion . . . over any part of Central America . " As soon as Hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove this obstacle , and , being on the friendliest terms , official and personal , with Sir Julian Pauncefote , the British Ambassador , he broached the subject to him . Sir Julian was responsive , but they encountered a check in London , where the deadlock over the Canadian negotiations was taken somewhat severely . I think it deplorable Hay wrote Mr. Henry White on February Li. , 1899 that the British Government insists on making the arrangement in the Clayton-Bulwer matter depend on the successful issue of the Canadian negotiations . The two questions have nothing to do with each other . Every intelligent Englishman is ready to admit that the Canal ought to be built , that the United States alone will build it , that it can not be built except as a government enterprise , that nobody else wants to build it , that when built it will be to the advantage of the entire civilized world , and , this being the case , it is hard to see why the settlement of the matter ought to depend on the lumber duty or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail in this Congress . The maritime concession will lapse in October , and we shall be confronted with new difficulties in our relations with Costa Rica and Nicaragua . Sir Julian 's conduct in the matter has been everything that we could desire . While , of course , always mindful of the interests of his country , he has shown a breadth of view and a spirit of conciliation which would have made the negotiations very easy and very agreeable if his opinions had been shared by the home government . I only wish he had been at the head of the Canadian Commission . After nearly a year 's delay , during which impatient exploiters caused bills for the immediate construction of the canal to be introduced into Congress , Hay and Pauncefote , with Lord Salisbury 's consent , took the matter up , quickly agreed upon terms , signed their treaty , and on February 5 , 1900 , it went to the Senate . To Mr. Choate in London , Hay wrote on February 6th : We signed our treaty and got it into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comment , of praise and dispraise . Senator Hoar , you will regret to hear , thinks that we have been unmindful of the honor of our country and the glory of the flag , and various other gentlemen think that we are derelict in our duty in having got a whole loaf and not having demanded two . Hay 's forebodings of danger were soon verified : eager Senators began at once to find flaws in the treaty and to offer amendments . The Secretary wrote to Senator Lodge on Februrary 7 , Iwo : I hope you may sec your way to opposing any change in the treaty in Committee Ion Foreign Relations . I would far rather see it defeated by a minority than so changed as virtually to defeat it by a majority . On the same day he sent a note , brief but febrile , to Whitelaw Reid : I must venture to thank you most heartily for the splendid support the Tribune has given the Canal Treaty . It is in some danger in the Senate , and what you say will naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what the country has wanted and striven for during forty years , and at last has attained without an atom of compensation , should be thrown away through mere spite . It is as if you should offer Yale College a million dollars and the trustees should refuse the gift on the ground that they wanted a million and a half . An unidentified correspondent sent him a letter of criticism which called out this appealing reply on Februrary 12 : Et tu ! Can not you leave a few things to the President and to the Senate , who are charged with them by the Constitution ? As to Sea Power and the Monroe Doctrine , we did not act without consulting the best living authorities on those subjects . Do you really think the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty preferable to the one now before the Senate ? There is no third issue , except dishonor . Elkins and P . say " Dishonor be damned . " I hardly think you will . Please do not answer this ? but think about it awhile . During the next month Hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Senate at work mutilating , as he thought , the treaty by amendments . At last , when the amended measure passed , he sent his resignation to the President . The Secretary 's desire to resign was not prompted by personal pique , but by chagrin at seeing a project of incalculable benefit rejected by a body not merely incompetent , but so immovably hostile that he feared it would be useless for him to struggle against it further . His lack of robust health made him oversensitive and probably increased his constitutional tendency to periodic fits of depression . Nevertheless , upon the President 's immediate return of his resignation , coupled with words of warm appreciation and confidence in him , he went ahead manfully . That winter and spring crowded new business upon him . The situation in China , which had grown more and more angry since the Germans pounced upon Kiao-chau in 1897 , now threatened an outburst . The Boer War in South Africa indirectly affected American politics by giving Trish- and German-Americans an excuse for heckling England at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government a friendly settlement of long-standing disputes . The insurrection of the Filipinos , the status of Cuba , the excitement of the Central American republics at the prospect of an isthmian canal , secret negotiations for the purchase of the Danish West Indies , and the campaign for the nomination of Presidential candidates were among the business on the Secretary 's calendar . I can not do more here than quote a few passages from his letters showing his position on some of these matters . This extract , of June 15 , ! goo , refers to the Boers : What do you think now of our poor dear British ? Hay asks Mr. White . Was there ever seen anything like it since Xenophon ? The slim Boers flanked out of Bloemfontein , Croonstadt , the Vaal , Johannesburg , and Pretoria , not to mention Laing 's leek and other places , and not losing a man or a mule , a gun or a cart . It looks now as if Oom Paul will get to Lydenburg with his whole army intact ? bar Cronje ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own , with every ounce of his material saved . 1 have the greatest admiration for the Boers ' smartness , but it is their bravery that our idiotic public is snivelling over . If they were only as brave as they are slim , the war would have ended long ago by their extermination . We do occasionally kill a Filipino , but what man has ever yet seen a dead Boer ? Your friend Bryan . . . says the Boer War is an issue in our campaign ? I suppose because the British are 16 to I. The serious thing is the discovery ? now past doubt ? that the British have lost all skill in fighting ; and the whole world knows it , and is regulating itself accordingly . It is a portentous fact , altogether deplorable in my opinion ; for their influence on the whole made for peace and civilization . If Russia and Germany arrange things , the balance is lost for ages . The abuse which the Administration , and particularly the Secretary of State , suffered for its friendliness toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side and an irresponsible but perniciously active horde of demagogues on the other , he feared that his projects would be hopelessly shattered . While he betrayed neither resentment nor trepidation to the enemy , he spoke out almost with ferocity to his few confidants . Witness the following letter to Gen. John W. Foster : June 23 , 1900.  --  . . . On one side is a great danger , on the other a great opportu-nity . I think I see both the danger and the opportunity . It is enough to turn the hair gray not to be allowed to avoid the one and embrace the other . But what can be done in the present diseased state of the public mind ? There is such a mad-dog hatred of England prevalent among newspapers and politicians , that anything we should now do in China to take care of our imperiled interests , would be set down to " subservience to Great Britain . " France is Russia 's harlot ? to her own grievous damage . Germany we could probably get on our side by sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan we might manage to save our skins . But such a proceeding would make all our fools throw fits in the marketplace ? and the fools are numerous . We had great trouble to prevent the Convention from declaring in favor of the Boers and of the annexation of Canada . Every morning I receive letters cursing me for doing nothing , and others cursing me for being " the tool of England against our good friend Russia . " All I have ever done with England is to have wrung great concessions out of her with no compensation , and yet these idiots say I am not an American because I do n't say " To hell with the Queen " at every breath . Cassini has gone to Europe ; Cambon was to have sailed last week , but has stayed over for a few days ; Holleben is absolutely without initiative , and in mortal terror of his Kaiser . Pauncefote has apparently no power to act , nor even to talk . And even if he had , every Senator I see says , " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any understanding with England . " How can I make bricks without straw ? That we should be compelled to refuse the assistance of the greatest power in the world , in carrying out our own policy , because all Irishmen are Democrats and some Germans are fools , is enough to drive a man mad . Yet we shall do what we can . In the middle of the summer there suddenly flared up in China a tragedy which fastened the world 's attention . The Boxers , a Chinese association whose aim it was to rid China of foreigners , starred , with the obvious collusion of high officials , a campaign of extermination . On June 14th they assailed the foreign Legations at Peking , which during the next eight weeks defended themselves with unflagging endurance and valor in the British compound . " I hey numbered in all only about five hundred persons , including the women and children . About June loth the outside world ceased to have news of them . Week after week an appalling silence brooded over the Legations . On June isth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , telegraphed to General Conger , the American minister : Do you need more force ? Communicate with the Admiral and report . No answer . In vain did Mr. Hay try to get tidings through Mr. Wu , the Chinese Minister in Washington . Foreign governments were equally unsuccessful . Then Mr. Hay appealed to Li Hung Chang , the Chinese Viceroy of greatest influence , to send the following message through the Boxer lines to Conger in the Legations : July Jr. ? Communicate tidings bearer . Days passed , but brought no reply . The world began to believe the rumors which had been circulating for weeks , that the Boxers had captured the Legations and slaughtered all the foreigners . At last on July zoth , Secretary Hay received a despatch dated July xGth : For one month we have been besieged in British Legation under continued shot and shell from Chinese troops . Quick relief only can prevent general massacre. ? CoNGER . Although this despatch came in the State Department 's cipher , many persons doubted its genuineness , for they argued that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cipher-book also . Accordingly , Secretary Hay hit upon a clever device , and telegraphed on July zist : Despatch received . Authenticity doubted . Answer this giving your sirter 's name . Report attitude and position of Chinese Government . In due course a reply came , with the name of Mr. Conger 's sister , which it was hardly probable that the wiliest Boxer could know . Convinced that the besieged were still alive , Mr. Hay now urged Li Hung Chang that the Ministers be allowed to communicate freely with their governments . Li answered that he and the other Viceroys had petitioned the Imperial government either to do this or to deliver the Ministers , under safe escort , at Tien-Ts in . Hay wrote the President on July 2.9th : I told him that we could not consent to any such arrangement as the latter alternative ; that if the Chinese Government was able to send them safely to Tien-Tsin , it was able to put us into free communication with them ; that if the Chinese Government undertook without previous arrangement to deliver them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign governments that the Chinese had acted in good faith . Ile Wu finally consented to telegraph Li again to-day . . . . He is greatly perturbed m spirit , but seems to be acting squarely with us . He admits there arc many things he can not explain . He does not attempt to account for the silence of the Legations , but believes the Ministers , except Ketteler , are alive . On August i4th Conger cabled Hay : Do not put trust in Li Hung Chang . He is an unscrupulous tool of the cruel Dowager . There can be no adequate negotiation with Peking until the high authors of this great crime have surrendered . Imperial troops firing on us daily . Our losses 6o killed , 120 wounded . We have reached half-rations horse-flesh . Have food only for a fortnight . 6 children have died . Many others sick . That same day the relief expedition entered Peking and saved the Legationers . ? A week earlier Secretary Hay , on the brink of an alarming collapse caused by the intense strain and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , was forced to take refuge in his summer home at Newbury , N. H. From his sick-bed he directed the chief business of the State Department for several weeks . I should soon get back to my usual form he wrote Senator Fairbanks if I could keep my thoughts away from the thousand worries of this crazy old world of ours . When he began to convalesce , he confessed to his oldest friend , Nicolay : I did not imagine when I left Washington how bad it was . If I had stayed another day , I should not have got away at all . I have had two or three slight complications ? the last and most agreeable is a lumbago , which makes my walk slantendicular , so I do n't walk much . .. . The thing that has aged me and broken me up has been the attitude of the minority of the Senate which brings to naught all the work a State Department can do . . . But what is the use of all this buzzing ! You and I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the thought that probably to him , more than to any one else , was due the saving of the Legations.
