txt What particular joy do our Socialist friends get out of Tuesday 's elections ? It seems that they profess " to view with satisfaction " the result . " What result ? The result that they cast a smaller vote in New York City than in 1917 ? In that year Mr. MORRIS QUIT got 145,322 votes . In 1918 Mr. ram : , the Socialist candidate for Governor . got 85,552 votes . Tuesday Mr. ONEAL , the Socialist candidate for President of the Board of Aldermen , got 126,366 votes . The amiable or unamiable adventurers into Utopia profess themselves to be very happy in consideration ? of this result . In 1917 women did not vote in New York . The addition of their votes , in any proper comparison of the returns of 1917 collated with those of 1919 , should have given them practically a double vote . According to ordinary reckoning the Socialist , , vote in 1919 should have been twice that of the vote in 1917 . That is , the Socialists should have polled 200,644 votes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register in proportion to their numbers . Instead , then , of assuming that the Socialist vote should have been , in 1919 , twice that of the Socialist vote in 1917 , assume that the feminist part of it was only 40 per cent . To assume this is to assume a good deal . Nobody was quite as anxious for female suffrage as the Socialist Party . At least the Socialist women may be assumed to have done their duty . But let that go . Whether the diminution or the addition should be 40 or 60 per cent. , where do the Socialists still " come in " ? It is not merely their general vote , palpably less , and greatly less , than they should have expected to get , in view of the feminist addition  --  and the Socialist women are certain to be registered and qualified  --  but nearly everywhere they were beaten . Their most illustrious advocate in the Board of Aldermen , Mr. At.cEnNoN Len , was defeated . In the new Board of Aldermen . Manhattan will have one Socialist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx . There the Socialists , from temporary conditions of unassimilated immigi ttion , have two representatives . Looking the whole thing over , what reason have the Socialists in New York City for keeping up their fruitless agitation ? It Is not merely the City of New York that has registered opposition to their theories . AD over the country Americans have shown their resolve that American institutions shall be conserved . Why do these persons , many of them the dupes of generous theory , persist in setting themselves against the irresistible determination of the American people , manifested this week all over the United States ? Why do they not try to become American ? Why do they refuse to assimilate themselves ? They beat vainly against the solid forces of American conservatism . One sees the immediate salience of personal ambition . But the rank and file , If there is any rank and file in socialism : if there is any desire among these amateurs and their followers to have any influence on the American polity , should become American citizens in fact as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
