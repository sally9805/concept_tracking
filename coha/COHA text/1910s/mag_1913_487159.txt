Mr. Choate 's Speech at the New York Chamber of Commerce dinner , proving so delightfully as it did to his hearers that age has not withered his wit or dimmed his wisdom , drove home with great force the duty of giving the President every support in his dealing with the Mexican crisis . Nor was this put forward as a mere banality or bit of blatant jingoism . There was in it nothing of the spirit displayed in the appeal to Congress to " stand behind " Cleveland when there was foolish talk of our going to war with England over Venezuela . The plea now is for peace , and for aid of a President striving to maintain it . Nor was it urged by Mr. Choate merely as a pious hope . He does not , of course , speak in this matter as a partisan , though such praise of Mr. Wilson as he uttered is peculiarly significant coming from a veteran Republican . The reason which he gave is clear and ought to be convincing . Mr. Choate has had experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he dwelt upon the chief argument for trusting the President . It is that he knows more about the Mexican affair than anybody else . Information from all sources , much of it official and confidential , has been laid before him , so that his knowledge is certainly wider than that of any of his critics . It is not necessary to say that we have no sympathy with the idea of an abject deference to the Chief Executive in every matter that comes up . His views on the tariff question , for example , or the reform of banking and currency , are not to be meekly accepted just because they come from him . As regards those subjects , full information is open to all . And every man who knows what he is talking about is entitled to assert his opinion , against that of the President , if need be . But the case is wholly different from a foreign complication so delicate as the Mexican . It is not a question of blind dependence upon another when we ought to be exercising an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enougn to reach a sure conclusion , and of confiding hopefully in the President , who has the whole case before him  --  trusting him , that is , so long as we believe that he is doing his best , is keeping within the law , respecting the rights of other nations , and striving to the utmost of his power to avert war while maintaining the dignity and discharging the international obligations of the country . We are evidently in for fresh discussions of the Monroe Doctrine . Its supposed bearing on the Mexican complication made them inevitable . And here a strange fact is to be noted . It is that whenever the time seems to have come to make a vigorous application of the Doctrine doubt is expressed of its real meaning , and of the wisdom of enforcing it in the given instance . This looks as if the Monroe Doctrine were a fine thing for political platforms and for orations and essays , but that it has a disconcerting way , in a crisis , of retiring to private life . And of late there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time . Prof. Hiram Bingham , who knows his South America well , has called the Monroe Doctrine an anachronism and a folly ; and in the December Century Mr. W. Morgan Shuster elaborately argues that it has become only a disadvantage to the United States . Mr. Shuster , if he could have his way , would abolish it altogether , but suggests , as a feasible alternative , that we " modify " it . But that is just what we have always been doing . Col. Roosevelt is at this moment engaged in modifying it in Argentina and Chili . He has , in fact , modified it to death , so far as those two republics are concerned . For them , he says , it no longer exists . But it must be preserved , he continues , to throw an appearance of legality and Americanism about such acts as his seizure of Panama . All this illustrates the great convenience of keeping the Monroe Doctrine mysterious . It is more " elastic " than any currency ever devised . It means just what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when we think it wise . The presentation which began Commission at Washington , of the evidence on which the Eastern railways base their request for an advance in freight rates , is in many respects an event of high economic importance . When the application for higher rates was made in 1910 , there was a very general feeling that to permit such increase might be merely to start a vicious circle . With rates increased , it was contended , demand for higher wages by the railways ' employees would follow . In the end the shipper and consumer would suffer increased burdens , with the railways no better off than before . But in the meantime , and without the rate increase , the demand for higher wages has been made , has been considered by arbitration boards , and has been granted . In 1912 a 10 per cent . increase was thus awarded the engineers , involving additional annual expenditure of $2 , - 000,000 by the railways ; this year , the firemen 's wages were raised 10 to 12 per cent. , involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent. , involving $6,000,000 . The railways dp not , however , base their request for higher rates on these arbitrary changes alone . The general level of expenses has increased along with wages . During the three-year period since 1910 , the railway brief of Monday sets forth , three of the largest systems  --  the Pennsylvania , the New York Central , and the Baltimore &; Ohio  --  have invested $423,000,000 additional capital in their properties . The result has been an increase of $109 , - 000,000 in the gross receipts ; yet the increase in operating expenses and in taxes for the period has been such that net income of the three systems for the period was actually $8,000,000 less in the fiscal year 1913 than in 1910 . On all hands it is admitted that fur-ther large use of capital , to provide fa-cilities for the expanding traffic move-ment of the country , will be needed in the next few years . The railways agree in this conclusion ; but Mr. Willard 's not unnatural comment is that , unless the conditions were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additions if possible to avoid doing so . " Everybody notes a change of public feeling towards the railways . This goes beyond the mere question in band at present . Irrespective of an increase in rates , we think it clear that a different and better sentiment about the whole place and function of the railways in this country has been slowly forming . Forty or fifty years ago , there was some blind idolizing of railway promoters and managers . They were thought of as patriotically advancing our national . development . But there shortly set in , not wholly without justification , an almost equally blind spirit of hostility to everything connected with railways . To-day , however , their case is better understood , and a juster attitude towards them is shown by the public . It is certain that neither Congress nor the people would now demand impossibilities of them , or really , in the long run , countenance any gross injustice to them . This new feeling might easily be changed into the old antagonism by unwise railway policies ; but , obviously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a fuller understanding of the entire railway problem , but a just settlement of the difficulties to-day outstanding . The sharp disagreements in the National Conservation Congress at Washington last week reflect the lack of unanimity among the host of those who now call themselves conservationists . One point of difference is whether the control of certain natural resources should be Federal or State . Another is concerned with the rate of development of these resources : a conservative section in favor of going slowly , with the exercise of the greatest care lest- private interests get their hands upon what should be held for the public , while a more radical section desires speedier exploitation . These two points of difference have the appearance of uniting when advocates of State against Federal control are found crying out at the slowness of the national Government in allowing any use to be made of the reserved resources . Just here is the weakness of the case of the advocates of State control . Whatever the merits of their main contention , these are obscured by an apparent willingneSs on their part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of the immediate ekploitation of the natural resources in question . They need to make unmistakably clear , first of all , that they stand firmly against misuse of any of these resources . Otherwise , the advocates of Federal control must inevitably gain the support of all earnest conservationists . It was a wise decision by the Federation of Labor , last week , not to attempt at present the formation of a Labor party in this country . There are certainly enough Richmonds in the field as the case stands . With the Progressives apparently intending to pursue their divisive tactics , and with the Socialists playing for their own hand , it would be little that a national Labor party could expect to accomplish , for some years to come , except to hold the balance of power in certain Congressional districts , or to send a few stray Representatives to Washington . It is possible , too , that the Federation of Labor has found as much warning as encouragement in the example of the Labor party in England . Many signs of discontent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A writer in the November Fortnightly goes so far as to argue its complete failure . This is an extreme view , though some of the weaknesses pointed out in the Labor party 's position and acts are undeniable . But even if the English Labor party could be called a complete success , it would not follow that its methods could be copied to advantage under American political conditions The movement for a perra.anent anti-Tammany Democratic organization in New York made a distinct advance , when the temporary committee of the Anti-Tammany Jeffersonian held a meeting for a definite tion . Among those present were a number of men of the highest standing in the community , and some of the Democrats who took a leading part in the campaign for Mr. Mitchel . It was decided to form a committee of eleven , whose duty it shall be to nominate members of a committee of 250 , which is to undertake the actual organization of an anti-Tammany Democracy . Upon the choice of these 250 will depend the success of the movement . There is reason to hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to impress the whole city with its representative character , and to carry great weight through the personal standing and qualities of its members . Never has the time been more favorable for taking away from Tammany its intolerable Position of domination , and its claim to be the Democratic party of the greatest city in America . With a permanent organization , through which the honest feeling of hundreds of thousands of Democrats can be expressed , we shall be able to look forward to the destruction of Tammany 's malign power in a riot distant future . Dayton , 0 , is in danger of getting herself misjudged In trying to link to her destinies first Col. Goethals and then Col. Roosevelt , she is offering a target to the dissolute newspaper paragrapher , who will soon be suggesting that Dayton try the Kaiser , or Bernard Shaw , or Mrs. Pankhurst , or Harry Lauder , or any one of similar high-calibre publicity-power . And yet in the original suggestion of Col. Goethals there was an idea worth considering . Only in a superficial sense would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal to take up with the reconstruction of an inland city of the third class . One can easily imagine how the opportunity exists at Dayton ' for setting , up a scheme of city building and organization that might serve as a model the country over . It would be a source of pride that America should no longer have to go to Dusseldorf or Budapest for inspiration . A model Dayton from the hands of a Goethals would be all the more native because it would arise out of peculiarly native conditions  --  the devastation of flood or fire with which modern European cities have scarcely to reckon . The terrible storm on the Great Lakes has already resulted in plans to call governmental attention to the need of increased provision for emergency refuges . The extent of the disaster must give weight to such proposals . Not less than 254 lives , according to the Toronto Mail and Empire , were lost , nine large vessels foundering with their entire crews . In all , eighteen ships , worth $3,000,000 , went down , while four more were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infrequent harbors , made  --  like those at - Chicago and Milwaphee  --  by artificial breakwaters at river mouths , for vessels caught by late autumn gales There are no sheltered bays . But by taking advantage of coves and islands , it is held that even such engineering work as this year 's $3,1.199,000 loss would go far to cover might provide , a number of safe shelters for a time of sudden stress . Upon representation of the Lake Carriers ' Association that much of the appalling loss of life and property is preventable , a Govern ' ment investigation in Canada , with the possibility pf a Royal Commission , is already premised . The matter is worth similar study on this side the border . For any " back to the land " movement the present ought to be an unusually favorable time , owing to the remarkable and world-wide rise in the price of agricultural products . It has gone in very large measure to the farmer , despite defects in the middleman system , and is in great measure due to the failure of supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cities . A special possibility in the direction of remedy , in the case of our own country , is vigorously set forth in an open letter to Bolton Hall , author of " A Little Land and a Living , " by William Borsodi , whose letter to the author prompted the writing of that book five years ago , and formed an introduction to it . Mr. Borsodi is impressed by the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who work in our mines and mills , save a thousand or two by the hardest labor and economy , and with it go back to their native land and buy a farm of two or three acres . These men might , with the same money , buy a good-sized farm in this country . He thinks that intelligent effort by " an organization that should have the support of earnest , conscientious men " would result in the settlement on American farms not only of a large part of those who return to Europe to go into farming there , but also of great numbers of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan seems worthy of attention There can ' no longer be any doubt that the stage has become the great educative force of our day . An advertisement of a new " crime play " contains the following quotations front the " district attorney " . " Our National Government spends twenty millions a year to exterminate an animal pest , but not a dollar for preventive measures against the human pest  --  the criminal . " Every night intelligent audiences , hearing this terrible indictment of our much-praised GoVernment , must exclaim : " How true ! " and go home wondering why no one has said it before . Why should our prisons not be full when we make haste to vote money for a crusade against the boll weevil , but never dream of spending a cent for schols , parks , or playgrounds ? One would suppose that a nation governed by public opinion would think it to its interest , not only to provide meane of education for its youth , but to compel them to take a certain amount of advantage of such provision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in the United States of America ? No , we let our boys and girls run the streets all day and all night , and then clap them into prison as soon as they break some law But all this will be remedied now . The stage has come to the rescue . In view of the long years of effort to open up the game of football and make it really football , it is rather amusing to read the complaints that there were no touchdowns scored in the most important games of the year . It is even hinted that something must now be done to penalize the drop-kickers , who are becoming so dextrous that , in Brickley 's case at least , it is unsafe for his adersaries to let him get an inch beyond the centre of the held . Sentimentally , Harvard may have some regrets that the great superiority of her term was not demonstrated on Saturday by a touchdown , but the game from the spectator 's point of view lacked nothing It was interesting , varied , and exciting enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen the modern game and remembered only the incessant line plunging of ten years ago , with everybody piling up in a heap , found it a revelation Doubtless , the game can yet be improved , and will be ; it is undeniable , however . that the rehabilitation of the kicking game and the introduction of the forward pass have worked wonders . The threat of the latter keeps the lines extended and open , even when it is little used . In the surroundings of the game itself and its conduct , time has produced a better and more sportsmanlike feeling between , the rival bodies of undergraduates and the teams themselves . As spectacles , the chief contests are ifanything more impressive than ever . But the objections to the game persist ; the overemphasis on athletics remains . The Superintendent of West Point , a school very largely concerned with the development of the physique of its students and the bringing out of what are known as the manly qualities , unhesitatingly condenins the game and asks for its abolition . Col. Townsley finds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not counterbalanced by any great advantages . Ex-Commissioner Dean C. Worcester has given out an elaborate statement of the havoc wrought in the Philippines by the announcement of Democratic intentions in regard to the independence of the islands . His words would have a more convincing sound if they were somewhat less smooth and rounded . After depicting in glowing colors the magnificent business prosperity which had obtained up to a year ago , he says : This extraordinary commercial development was rudely interrupted by President Wilson 's expression of the hope that the boundaries of the United States might soon be contracted , made in his Staunton speech Real estate values promptly fell 30 per cent , banks called loans and refused credit to back new enterprises ; merchants can-celled orders . Now , real estate is not much in the habit of " promptly falling 30 per cent. , " or any other easily ascertainable amount ; and , furthermore , when such a state of business demoralization as is above described does set in , the effects of it have never been known to be swiftly wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily news . Yet Mr. Worcester goes on to say : As months passed and no radical practical action was taken by the political party in power , confidence was partially restored and business conditions progressed towards the normal , only to be again upset by the announcement that Filipinos would be given a majority in the upper house of the Legislature and by rumors of sweeping changes among the executive officers of the Govern-ment Ir these chameleon-like changes have actually taken place in this brief period , the nature of business in the Philippines must be something quite unique .
