As it is not , strictly speaking , a business transaction , we shall charge no interest on the money , and if there is any loss I will : assume it myself . " Mr. Morgan sent for his lawyer , and asked him to draw the necessary papers , instructing him to make the conditions as liberal as possible .

Commenting upon the transaction , Mr. Page said : The Depot Quartermaster was forced to suspend payment due on vouchers for merchandise inspected and accepted by the Government on March 6 . E.vcr since then the hardships thus imposed on contractors supplying the War Department with merchandise , and the consequent impairment of Government credit , have been matters of great concern to our Advisory Committee . Contractors were dishonoring the requisitions of the Government by refusing to deliver some of the most necessary supplies for the troops on the ground that they could not get their pay . Purchases , when possible . had to be made on exorbitant terms , and the news was spreading among merchants and deterring them from making offerings . " Mr. Page said he regarded the action of Mr. Morgan as a most happy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quartermaster 's office was laboring . It was recalled that in a similar emergency years ago the late J.

Mr. Morgan also did tho same thing a few years ago , when no Government money was available to pay the salaries of customs employes at this port .
