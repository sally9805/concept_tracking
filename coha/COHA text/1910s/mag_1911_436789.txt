THE long chapter of troubles which led to my father 's emigration to America began with his own illness . The doctors sent him to Courland to consult expensive specialists , who prescribed tedious courses of treatment . He was far from cured when my mother also fell ill , and my father had to return to Polotzk to look after the business . My mother kept her bed for nearly two years , suffering and wasting . The business was ruined and the house was stripped to pay the doctors ' and apothecaries ' bills , and my father grew old under his worries . Then everything took a sudden turn . My mother began to improve , and at the same time my father was offered a good position as superintendent of a grist-mill . As soon as my mother could be moved , he took us all out to the mill , about three versts out of town , on the Polota . We had a pleasant cottage there , with the miller 's red-headed , freckled family for our only neighbors . If our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun shone in at all the windows ; and as the leaves on the trees grew denser and darker , my mother grew stronger on her feet , and laughter returned to our house as the song-bird to the grove . We children had a very happy summer . We had never lived in the country before , and we liked the change . It was endless fun to explore the mill ; to squeeze into forbidden places , and be pulled out by the angry miller ; to tyrannize over the mill-hands , and be worshiped by them in return ; to go boating on the river , and discover unvisited nooks , and search the woods and fields for kitchen herbs , and get lost , and be found , a hundred times a week . And what an adventure it was to walk the three versts into town , leaving a trail of perfume from the wild-flower posies we carried to our city friends ! But these good things did not last . The mill changed hands , and the new owner put a protege of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short breathing-spell , we were driven back into the swamp of growing poverty and trouble . The next year or so my father spent in a restless and fruitless search for a permanent position . My mother had another serious illness , and his own health remained precarious . What he earned did not more than half pay the bills in the end , though we were living very humbly now . Polotzk seemed to reject him , and no other place invited him . Just at this time occurred one of the periodic anti-semitic movements whereby government officials were wont to clear the forbidden cities of Jews , whom , in the intervals of slack administration of the law , they allowed to maintain an illegal residence in places outside the Pale , on payment of enormous bribes , and at the cost of nameless risks and indignities . It was a little before Passover that the cry of the hunted thrilled the Jewish world with the familiar fear . The wholesale expulsion of Jews from Moscow and its surrounding district , at cruelly short notice , was the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next ? The Jews who lived illegally without the Pale turned their possessions into cash and slept in their clothes , ready for immediate flight . Those who lived in the comparative security of the Pale trembled for their brothers and sisters without , and opened wide their doors to afford the fugitives refuge . And hundreds of the latter , preceded by a wail of distress , flocked into the open district , bringing their trouble where trouble was never absent , mingling their tears with the tears that never dried . The open cities becoming thus suddenly crowded , every man 's chance of making a living was diminished in proportion to the number of additional competitors . Hardship , acute distress , ruin for many : thus spread the disaster , ring beyond ring , from the stone thrown by a despotic official into the ever-full river of Jewish persecution . Passover was celebrated in tears that year . In the story of the Exodus we would have read a chapter of current history , only for us there was no deliverer and no promised land . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long service ? Not May we be next year in Jerusalem , ' but ' Next year ? in America ! ' So there was our promised land , and many faces turned toward the West . And if the waters of the Atlantic did not part for them , the wanderers rode its bitter flood by a miracle as great as any the rod of Moses ever wrought . My father was carried away by the westward movement , glad of his own deliverance , but sore at heart for us whom he left behind . It was the last chance for all of us . We were so far reduced in circumstances that he had to travel with borrowed money to a Ger man port , whence he was forwarded to Boston , with a host of others , at the expense of the Baron de Hirsch Emigration Committee . I was about ten years old when my father emigrated . I was used to his going away from home , and ' America ' did not mean much more to me than Kherson , ' or ' Odessa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understood vaguely , from the gravity with which his plans were discussed , and from references to ships , committees , and other unfamiliar things , that this enterprise was different from previous ones ; but my excitement and emotion on the morning of my father 's departure were mainly vicarious . I know the day when ' America ' as a world entirely unlike Polotzk lodged in my brain , to become the centre of all my dreams and speculations . Well I know the day ! I was in bed , sharing the measles with some of the other children . Mother brought us a thick letter from father , written just before boarding the ship . The letter was full of excitement . There was something in it besides the description of travel , something besides the pictures of crowds of people , of foreign cities , of a ship ready to put out to sea . My father was traveling at the expense of a charitable organization , without means of his own , without plans , to a strange world where he had no friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-equipped soldier going into battle . The rhetoric is mine . Father simply wrote that the emigration committee was taking good care of everybody , that the weather was fine , and the ship comfortable . But I heard something , as we read the letter together in the darkened room , that was more than the words seemed to say . There was an elation , a hint of triumph , such as had never been in my father 's letters before . I can not tell how I knew it . I felt a stirring , a straining in my father 's letter . It was there , even though my mother stumbled over strange words , even though she cried , as women will when somebody is going away . My father was inspired by a vision . He saw something ? he promised us something . It was this America . And ' America ' became my dream . If it was nothing new for my father to go far from home in search of his fortune , the circumstances in which he left us were unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable source of income , no settled home , no immediate prospects . We hardly knew where we belonged in the scheme of our small society . My mother , as a breadwinner , had nothing like her former success . Her health was permanently impaired , her place in the business world had long been filled by others , and there was no capital to start her anew . Her brothers did what they could for her . They were well-to-do , but they all had large families , with marriageable daughters and sons to be bought out of military service . The allowance they made her was generous compared to their means , ? affection and duty could not do more , ? but there were four of us growing children , and my mother was obliged to make every effort within her power to piece out her income . How quickly we came down from a large establishment , with servants and retainers , and a place among the best in Polotzk , to a single room hired by the week , and the humblest associations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my mother who turned away her head . She took to using the side streets , to avoid the pitiful eyes of the kind and the scornful eyes of the haughty . Both were turned on her as she trudged from store to store , and from house to house , peddling tea or other ware ; and both were hard to bear . Many a winter morning she rose in the dark , to tramp three or four miles in the gripping cold , through the dragging snow , with a pound of tea for a distant customer ; and her profit was perhaps twenty kopecks . Many a time she fell on the ice , as she climbed the steep bank on the far side of the Dvina , a heavy basket on each arm . More than once she fainted at the doors of her customers , ashamed to knock as a suppliant where she used to be received as an honored guest . I hope the angels did not have to count the tears that fell on her frostbitten , aching hands as she counted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us children while my mother tramped the streets with her basket ? Who but Fetchke ? Who but the little housewife of twelve ? Sure of our safety was my mother , with Fetchke to watch ; sure of our comfort , with Fetchke to cook the soup and divide the scrap of meat and remember the next meal . Joseph was in heder all day ; the baby was a quiet little thing ; Mashke was no worse than usual . But still there was plenty to do , with order to keep in a crowded room , and the washing , and the mending . And Fetchke did it all . She went to the river with the women to wash the clothes , and tucked her dress up and stood bare-legged in the water , like the rest of them , and beat and rubbed and rinsed with all her might , till our miserable rags gleamed white again . And I ? I usually had a cold , or a cough , or something to disable me ; and I never had any talent for housework . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samovar , and ran errands , I was doing much . I minded the baby , who did not need much minding . I was willing enough , I suppose , but the hard things were done without my help . My mother sent me sometimes to deliver a package of tea , and I was proud to help in business . One day I went across the Dvina and far up the other side . ' It was a good-sized expedition for me to make alone , and I was not a little pleased with myself when I delivered my package , safe and intact , into the hands of my customer . But the storekeeper was not pleased at all . She sniffed and sniffed , she pinched the tea , she shook it all out on the counter . ' Na , take it back , ' she said in disgust ; ' this is not the tea I always buy . It ' s a poorer quality . ' I knew the woman was mistaken . I was acquainted with my mother 's several grades of tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I said ; ' this is the tea my mother always sends you . There is no worse tea . ' Nothing in my life ever hurt me more than that woman 's answer to my argument . She laughed ? she simply laughed . But I understood , even before she controlled herself sufficiently to make verbal remarks , that I had spoken like a fool , had lost my mother a customer . I had only spoken the truth , but I had not expressed it diplomatically . That was no way to make business . I felt very sore to be returning home with the tea still in my hand , but I forgot my trouble in watching a summer storm gather , up the river . The few passengers who took the boat with me looked scared as the sky darkened , and the boatman grasped his oars very soberly . It took my breath away to see the signs , but I liked it , and I was much disappointed to get home dry . When my mother heard of my misadventure she laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to laugh myself . This is the way I helped in the housekeeping and in business . I hope it does not appear as if I did not take our situation to heart , for I did  --  in my ownfashion . It was plain , even to an idle dreamer like me , that we were living on the charity of our friends , and barely living at that . It was plain , from my father 's letters , that he was scarcely able to support himself in America , and that there was no immediate prospect of our joining him . I realized it all , but I considered it all temporary , and I found plenty of comfort in writing long letters to my father , letters which he treasured for years . As an instance of what I mean by my own fashion of taking trouble to heart , I recall the day when our household effects were attached for a debt . We had plenty of debts , but the stern creditor who set the law on us this time was none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother sublet two of our three rooms , furnished with her own things . The police officers , who swooped down upon us without warning , as was their habit , asked no questions and paid no heed to explanations . They affixed a seal to every lame chair and cracked pitcher in the place ; aye , to every faded petticoat found hanging in the wardrobe . These goods , comprising all our possessions and all our tenants ' , would presently be removed , to be sold at auction , for the benefit of the creditor . Lame chairs and faded petticoats , when they are the last one has , have a vital value in the owner 's eyes . My mother moved about , weeping distractedly. all the while the officers were in the house . The frightened children cried . Our neighbors gathered to bemoan our misfortune . And over everything was the peculiar dread which only Jews in Russia feel when agents of the government invade their homes . The fear of the moment was in my heart , as in every other heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I retired to a quiet corner to grapple with it . I was not given to weeping , but I must think things out in words . I repeated to myself that the trouble was all about money . Somebody wanted money from our tenant , who had none to give . Our furniture was going to be sold to make this money . It was a mistake , but then the officers would not believe my mother . Still , it was only about money . Nobody was dead , nobody was ill . It was all about money . Why , there was plenty of money in Polotzk . My own uncle had many times as much as the creditor claimed . He could buy all our things back , or somebody else could . What did it matter ? It was only money , and money was got by working , and we were all willing to work . There was nothing gone , nothing lost , as when somebody died . This furniture could be moved from place to place , and so could money be moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transfer . That was all . If anybody Why , what do I see at the window ? Ilreine Malke , our next-door neighbor is ? yes , she is smuggling something out of the window ! If she is caught ! ? Oh , I must help ! Breine Malke beckons . She wants me to do something . I see ? I understand . I must stand in the doorway , to obstruct the view of the officers , who are all engaged in the next room just now . I move readily to my post , but I can not resist my curiosity . I must look over my shoulder a last time , to see what it is Breine Malke wants to smuggle out . I can scarcely stifle my laughter . Of a II our earthly goods , our neighbor has chosen for salvation a dented bandbox containing a moth-eaten bonnet from my mother 's happier days ! And I laugh not only from amusement , but also from lightness of heart . For I have succeeded in reducing our catastrophe to its simplest terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no matter of life and death . I could not help it . That was the way it looked to me . I am sure I made as serious efforts as anybody to prepare myself for life in America , on the lines indicated in my father 's letters . In America , he wrote , it was no disgrace to work at a trade . Workmen and capitalists were equal . The employer addressed the employee as you , not , familiarly , as thou . The cobbler and the teacher had the same title , Mister . And all the children , boys and girls , Jews and Gentiles , went to school ! Education would be ours for the asking , and economic independence also , as soon as we were prepared . So he wanted Fetchke and me to be taught some trade ; and my sister was apprenticed to a dressmaker , and I to a milliner . Fetchke , of course , was successful , and I , of course , was not . Fetchke managed to learn her trade , although most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend in sweeping , running errands , and minding the babies ? the usual occupations of the apprentice in any trade . But I ? I had to be taken away from the milliner 's after a couple of months . I did try , honestly . With all my eyes I watched my mistress build up a chimney-pot of straw and things . I ripped up old bonnets with enthusiasm . I picked up everybody 's spools and thimbles , and other far-rolling objects . I did just as I was told , for I was determined to become a famous milliner , since America honored the workman so . But most of the time I was sent away on errands ? to the market to buy soup-greens , to the corner store to get change , and all over town with bandboxes half as round again as I. It was winter , and I was not very well dressed . I froze ; I coughed ; my mis- tress said I was not of much use to her . So my mother kept me at home , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our last year in Russia , when I was between twelve and thirteen years of age . I was old enough to be ashamed of my failures , but I did not have much time to brood about them . My Uncle Solomon took me with him to Vitebsk , where I spent several months in comfort and happy activity . The thing that looms up above all the adventures of this pleasant interval is my introduction , through the books I found in my uncle 's house , to the garden of secular literature . For the first time in my life I read stories that were not in the Bible , and poetry that was not solemn . I ransacked the house for dusty old journals , and sat up nights to read them . Many things fell into my hands that were not intended for a reader of my tender years and slim experience , ? wild novels , in Russian , about cruel Cossacks and abducted maidens , ? but nothing printed ever harmed me , as if the things that did not belong to my nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metropolis , compared to which Polotzk was a mere village . Through Uncle Solomon , who traveled much in connection with his business , I got an idea of a world greater even than Vitebsk , and my imagination reached out beyond my boundaries . My cousin Hirshel also , who was a student in the high school , where he learned many things out of many books , afforded me alluring glimpses of a large world just beyond my reach . I worshiped his retreating footsteps when he set out with his student 's satchel in the morning , and envied him the troubles of which he complained in the evening . It was during this epochal visit to Vitebsk that I earned money by the work of my hands , for the first andonly time in my life . Although I was hopelessly clumsy at knitting and embroidery , the more difficult art of lace-making aroused my enthusiasm , so that I attained considerable skill with the cushion and bobbins . In Vitebsk I turned my one accomplishment to good account , by giving lessons . I enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher , and I began to feel superior to circumstances . I have never seen money that was half so bright to look at , half so pretty to clink , as the money I earned by these lessons . And it was easy to decide what to do with my wealth . I bought presents for everybody I knew . I remember to this day the pattern of the shawl I bought for my mother . When I came home , and unpacked my treasures , I was the proudest girl in Polotzk . The proudest , but not the happiest . I found my family in such a pitiful state that all my joy was stifled by care , if only for a while . Unwilling to spoil my holiday , my mother had not written me how things had gone from bad to worse during my absence , and I was not prepared . Fetchke met me at the station , and conducted me to a more wretched hole than I had ever called home before . I went into the room alone , having been greeted outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the shabbiness of the apartment was all the gloomier for the light of a small kerosene lamp standing on the bare deal table . At one end of the table ? is this Edle Dvereh ? My little sister , dressed in an ugly gray jacket , sat motionless in the lamplight , her fair head drooping , her little hands folded on the edge of the table . At sight of her I grew suddenly old . It was merely that she was a shy little girl , unbecomingly dressed , and perhaps a little pale from underfeeding . But to me , at that mo- ment , she was the personification of dejection , the living symbol of the fallen family state . Of course my sober mood did not last long . Even ' fallen family state ' could be interpreted in terms of money , ? absent money , ? and that , as once established , was a trifling matter . Had n't I earned money myself ? Heaps of it ! Only look at this , and this , and this that I brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did not remain old . For many years more I was a very childish child . Perhaps I had spent my time in Vitebsk to better advantage than at the milliner 's , from any point of view . When I returned to my native town I saw things . I saw the narrowness , the stifling narrowness , of life in Polotzk . My books , my walks , my visits , as teacher , to many homes , had been so many doors opening on a wider world ; so many horizons , one beyond the other . The boundaries of life had stretched , and I had filled my lungs with the thrilling air from a great Beyond . Child though I was , Polotzk , when I came back , was too small for me . And even Vitebsk , for all its peepholes into a Beyond , presently began to shrink in my imagination , as America loomed near . My father 's letters warned us to prepare for the summons , and we lived in a quiver of expectation . Not that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from rich that he was going to borrow every cent of the money for our third-class passage ; but he had a business in view which he could carry on all the better for having the family with him ; and , besides , we were borrowing right and left anyway , and all to no definite purpose . With the children , he argued , every year in Russia was a year lost . They should be spending the precious years in school , in learning English , inbecoming Americans . United in America , there were ten chances of our getting to our feet again to one chance in our scattered , drifting state . So at last I was going to America ! Really , really going , at last ! The boundaries burst . The arch of heaven soared . A million suns shone out for every star . The winds rushed in from outer space , roaring in my ears , America ! America ! ' On the day when our steamer-ticket arrived , my mother did not go out with her basket , my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup three times . I do not know what I did to celebrate the occasion . Very likely I played tricks on Edle Dvereh , and wrote a long letter to my father . Before sunset the news was all over Polotzk that Raphael 's Chane Chaye had received a steamer-ticket for America . Then they began to come . Friends and foes , distant relatives and new acquaintances , young and old , wise and foolish , debtors , creditors , and mere neighbors ? from every quarter of the city , from both sides of the Dvina , from over the Polota. , from nowhere ? a steady stream of them poured into our street , both day and night , till the hour of our departure . And my mother gave audience . Her faded kerchief half way off her head , her black ringlets straying , her apron often at her eyes , she received her guests in a rainbow of smiles and tears . She was the heroine of Polotzk , and she conducted herself appropriately . She gave her heart 's thanks for the congratulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for condolences ; patient answers to monotonous questions ; and handshakes and kisses and hugs she gave gratis . What did they not ask , the eager , foolish , friendly people ! They wanted to handle the ticket , and mother must read what was written in it . How much did it cost ? Was it all paid for ? Were we going to have a foreign passport , or did we intend to steal across the border ? Were we not all going to have new dresses to travel in ? Was it sure that we could get kosher food on the ship ? And with the questions poured in suggestions , and solid chunks of advice were rammed in by nimble prophecies . Mother ought to make a pilgrimage to a Good Jew , ' ? say the Rebbe of Libavitz , ? to get his blessing on our journey . She must be sure and pack her prayerbooks and Bible , and twenty pounds of zwieback at the least . If they did serve trefah on the ship , she and the four children would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , she must take all the feather-beds ! Featherbeds are scarce in America . In America they sleep on hard mattresses , even in winter . Chave Mirel , Yachne the dressmaker 's daughter , who emigrated to New York two years ago , wrote her mother that she got up from child bed with sore sides , because she had no feather-bed . Mother must n't carry her money in a pocketbook . She must sew it into the lining of her jacket . The policemen in Castle Garden take all their money from the passengers as they land , unless the travelers deny having any . And so on , and so on , till my poor mother was completely bewildered . And as the day set for our departure approached , the people came oftener and stayed longer , and rehearsed my mother in long messages for their friends in America , praying that she would deliver them promptly on her arrival , and without fail , and might God bless her for her kindness , and she must be sure and write them how she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my uncle 's house , having disposed of all our belongings , to the last three-legged stool , except such as we were taking with us . I could go straight to the room where I slept with my aunt that night , if I were suddenly set down in Polotzk . But I did not really sleep . Excitement kept me awake , and my aunt snored hideously . I was going away from Polotzk , forever and ever , in the morning . I was going on a wonderful journey . I was going to America . How could I sleep ? My uncle gave out a false bulletin , with the last batch that the gossips carried away in the evening . He told them that we were not going to start till the second day . This he did in the hope of smuggling us quietly out , and so saving us the wear and tear of a public farewell . But his ruse failed of success . Half of Polotzk was at my uncle 's gate in the morning , to conduct us to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we arrived . At the station the procession which accompanied us disbanded and became a mob . My uncle and my tall cousins did their best to protect us , but we wanderers were almost torn to pieces . They did get us into a car at last , and barricaded the door with our numerous bundles , but the riot on the station platform continued unquelled . When the warning bell ? rang out , it was drowned in a confounding babel of voices ? fragments of the oft-repeated messages , admonitions ? lamentations , blessings , farewells . ' Do n't forget ! ' ? ' Take care of ? " Keep your tickets ? ' My Jacob ? ' Garlic is best ! ' ? A happy journey ! ' ? ' God help you ! ' ? Good-bye ! Good-bye ! ' ? ' Remember ? ' The last I saw of Polotzk was an agitated mass of people , waving colored handkerchiefs and other frantic bits of calico , madly gesticulating , falling on each other 's necks , gone wild together . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sky to sky . I was in the middle of the great , great world , and the longest road was mine . IV Our route lay over the German border , with Hamburg for our port . Leaving the city of Vilna on a gray wet morning in early April , we set out for the frontier . This was the real beginning of our journey , and all my faculties of observation were alert . I took note of everything ? the weather , the trains , the bustle of railroad stations , our fellow passengers , and the family mood at every stage of our progress . The bags and bundles which composed our traveling outfit were much more bulky than valuable . A trifling sum of money , the steamer-ticket , and a foreign passport , were the magic agents by means of which we hoped to span the ten thousand miles of earth and water between us and my father . The passport was supposed to pass us over the frontier without any trouble ; but on account of the prevalence of cholera in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as emigrants , were subjected , at this time , to more than ordinary supervision and regulation . At Verzhbolovo , the last station on the Russian side , we met the first of our troubles . A German physician and several gendarmes boarded the train and put us through a searching examination as to our health , destination , and financial resources . As a result of the inquisition we were informed that we would not be allowed to cross the frontier unless we exchanged our third-class steamer-tickets for second-class , which would require two hundred rubles more than we possessed . Our passport was taken from us , and we were to be forced to turn back on our journey . A long letter which I wrote to my uncle in Polotzk during my first year in America describes the situation : We were homeless , houseless , and friendless in a strange place . We had hardly money enough to last us through the voyage for which we had hoped and waited for three long years . We had suffered much that the reunion we longed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer more in order to bring it about , and had parted with those we loved , with places that were dear to us in spite of what we passed through in them , never again to see them , as we were convinced ? all for the same dear end . With strong hopes and high spirits that hid the sad parting , we had started on our long journey . And now we were checked so unexpectedly but surely , the blow coming from where we little expected it , being , as we believed , safe in that quarter . When mother had recovered enough to speak , she began to argue with the gendarme , telling him our story and begging him to be kind . The children were frightened and all but I cried . I was only wondering what would happen . Moved by our distress , the German officers gave us the best advice they could . We were to get out at the station of Kibart , on the Russian side , and apply to one Herr Schidorsky , who might help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kindness of Herr Schidorsky , who became the agent of our salvation . He procured for my mother a pass to Eidtkuhnen , the German frontier station , where his older brother , as chairman of the Baron de Hirsch Emigration Committee , arranged for our admission into Germany . During the nego- tiations , which took several days , the good man of Kibart entertained us in his own house , shabby emigrants though we were . The Schidorsky brothers were Jews , but it is not on that account that their name has been lovingly remembered for fifteen years in my family . On the German side our course joined that of many other emigrant groups , on their way to Hamburg and other ports . We were a clumsy enough crowd , with wide , unsophisticated eyes , with awkward bundles hugged in our arms , and our hearts set on America . The letter to my uncle faithfully describes every stage of our bustling progress . Here is a sample scene of many that I recorded : There was a terrible confusion in the baggage-room where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags , valises , and great , shapeless things belonging to no particular class , were thrown about by porters and other men , who sorted them and put tickets on all but those containing provisions , while others were opened and examined in haste . At last our turn came , and our things , along with those of all other American-bound travelers , were taken away to be steamed and smoked and other such processes gone through . We were told to wait till notice should be given us of something else to be done . ' The phrase ' we were told to do this ' and told to do that ' occurs again and again in my narrative , and the most effective handling of the faits could give no more vivid picture of the proceedings . We emigrants were herded together at the stations , packed in the cars , and driven from place to place like cattle . ' At the expected hour we all tried to find room in a car indicated by the conductor . We tried , but could only find enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we made believe to be sitting comfortably . For now we were obliged to exchange the comparative comforts of a third-class passenger train for the certain discomforts of a fourth-class one . There were only four narrow benches in the whole car , and about twice as many people were already seated on these as they were probably supposed to accommodate . All other space , to the last inch , was crowded by passengers or their luggage . It was very hot and close and altogether uncomfortable , and still at every new station fresh passengers came crowding in , and actually made room , spare as it was , for themselves . It became so terrible that all glared madly at the conductor as he allowed more people to come into that prison , and trembled at the announcement of every station . ' The plight of the bewildered emigrant on the way to foreign parts is always pitiful enough , but for us who came from plague-ridden Russia the terrors of the way were doubled . In a great lonely field opposite a solitary house within a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conductor commanded the passengers to make haste and get out . He need not have told us to hurry ; we were glad enough to be free again after such a long imprisonment in the uncomfortable car . All rushed to the door . We breathed more freely in the open field , but the conductor did not wait for us to enjoy our freedom . He hurried us into the one large room which made up the house , and then into the yard . Here a great many men and women , dressed in white , received us , the women attending to the women and girls of the passengers , and the men to the others . This was another scene of bewildering confusion , parents losing their children , and little ones crying ; bag- gage being thrown in one corner of the yard , heedless of contents , which suffered in consequence ; those white-clad Germans shouting commands always accompanied with " Quick ! Quick ! " the confused passengers obeying all orders like meek children , only questioning now and then what was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some minds stories arose of people being captured by robbers , murderers , and the like . Here we had been taken to a lonely place where only that house was to be seen ; our things were taken away , our friends separated from us ; a man came to inspect us , as if to ascertain our full value ; strange-looking people driving us about like dumb animals , helpless and unresisting ; children we could not see , crying in a way that suggested terrible things ; ourselves driven into a little room where a great kettle was boiling on a little stove ; our clothes taken off , our bodies rubbed with a slippery substance that might be any bad thing ; a shower of warm water let down on us without warning ; again driven to another little room where we sit , wrapped in woolen blankets , till large , coarse bags are brought in , their contents turned out , and we see only a cloud of steam , and hear the women 's orders to dress ourselves , quick , quick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . We are forced to pick out our clothes from among all the others , with the steam blinding us ; we choke , cough , entreat the women to give us time ; they persist : " Quick , quick , or you 'll miss the train ! " Oh , so we really wo n't be murdered ! They are only making us ready for the continuing of our journey , cleaning us of all suspicions of dangerous sickness . Thank God ! ' In Polotzk , if the cholera broke out , as it did once or twice in every generation , we made no such fuss as did these Germans . Those who died of the sickness were buried , and those who lived ran to the synagogues to pray . We travelers felt hurt at the way the Germans treated us . My mother nearly died of cholera once , but she was given a new name , a lucky one , which saved her ; and that was when she was a small girl . None of us were sick now , yet hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted their commands at us from a distance , as fearful of our touch as if we had been lepers . We arrived in Hamburg early one morning , after a long night in the crowded cars . Here we were piled up ' on a high wagon , with our bags and baggage , and driven for hours , not one of us guessing where our destination lay . At length our mysterious ride came to an end , on the outskirts of the city , where we were once more lined up , cross-questioned , disinfected , labeled , and pigeon-holed . This was one of the occasions when we suspected that we were the victims of a conspiracy to extort money from us ; for here , as at every repetition of the purifying operations we had undergone , a fee was levied on us , ? so much per head . My mother , indeed , seeing her tiny hoard melting away , had long since sold some articles from our baggage to a fellow passenger richer than she , but even so she did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamburg . Her statement of that fact was not accepted , and we all suffered the last indignity of having our persons searched . We had nothing left for the policeman in Castle Garden . This last place of detention turned out to be a prison . Quarantine they called it , and there was a great deal of it ? two weeks of it . Two weeks within high brick walls , several hundred of us herded in half a dozen compartments , ? numbered compartments , ? sleeping in rows , like sick people in a hospital ; with roll-call morning and night , and short rations three times a day ; with never a sign of the free world beyond our barred windows ; with anxiety and longing and homesickness in our hearts , and in our ears the unfamiliar voice of the invisible ocean , which drew and repelled us at the same time . The fortnight in quarantine was not an episode ; it was an epoch , divisible into eras , periods , events . The greatest event was the arrival of some ship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were opened and the lucky ones said good-by , those left behind felt hopeless of ever seeing the gates open for them . ? Our turn came at last . We were conducted through the gate of departure , and after some hours of bewildering manoeuvres , described in great detail in the report to - ' we found ourselves , w ( lgrims from Polo of a great big steamship afloat on the strange big waters of the ocean . For sixteen days the ship was our world . My letter dwells solemnly on the details of the life at sea . It does not shrink from describing the torments of seasickness ; it notes every change in the weather . A rough night is described , when the ship pitched and rolled so that people were thrown from their berths ; days and nights when we crawled through dense fogs , our foghorn drawing answering warnings from invisible ships . The perils of the sea were not minimized in the imaginations of us inexperienced voyagers . The captain and his officers ate their dinners , smoked their pipes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigrants turned our faces to the wall and awaited our watery graves . All this while the seasickness lasted . Then came happy hours on deck , with fugitive sunshine , birds atop the crested waves , band-music and dancing and fun . I explored the ship , made friends with officers and crew , or pursued my thoughts in quiet nooks . It was my first experience of the ocean , and I was profoundly moved . ' I would imagine myself all alone on the ocean , and Robinson Crusoe was very real to me . I was alone sometimes . I was aware of no human presence ; I was conscious only of sea and sky and something I did not understand . And as I listened to its solemn voice , I felt as if I had found a friend , and knew that I loved the ocean . It seemed as if it were within as well as without part of myself ; and I wondered how I had lived without it , and if I could ever part with it . ' And so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer and nearer to the coveted shore , until , on a glorious May morning , six weeks after our departure from Polotzk , our eyes beheld the Promised Land , and my father received us in his arms . During his three years of probation my father had made a great many false starts in business . His history for that period is the history of thousands who come to America , like him , with pockets empty , hands untrained to the use of tools , minds cramped by centuries of repression in their native land . Dozens of these men pass under your eyes every day , my American friend , too much absorbed in their honest affairs to notice the looks of suspicion which you cast at them , the repugnance with which you shrink from their touch . You see them shuffle from door to door with a basket of spools and buttons , or bending over the sizzling irons in a basement tailor-shop , or rummaging in your ash-can , or moving a pushcart from curb to curb , at the command of the burly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dismiss him from your premises and from your thoughts , never dreaming that the sordid drama of his days may have a moral that concerns you . What if the creature with the untidy beard carries in his bosom his citizenship papers ? What if the cross-legged tailor is supporting a boy in college who is one day going to mend your state constitution for you ? What if the ragpicker 's daughters are hastening over the ocean to teach your children in the public schools ? Think , every time you pass the greasy alien on the street , that he was born thousands of years before the oldest native American ; and he may have something to communicate to you , when you two shall have learned a common language . Remember that his very physiognomy is a cipher , the key to which it behooves you to search for most diligently.
