FLAGSTAFFS ; three gilded eagles gleaming aloft ; a ripple of red , white , and blue ; a monument , half bell-like , half mound-like ; yonder an open plain , and in the distance three pearly silhouettes of buildings , one supreme in its joyous , colonnaded immensity , thrusting heavenward the noblest and stateliest of all soaring domes ? this is your first glimpse of Washington . Framed in an archway of the station , what a picture ! You barely suppress a cheer ; for we go to Washington very much as we salute the-flag or as we spring to our feet when a band plays the national anthem . Once there , we feel an exultance of anticipations more than realized . No other capital flings itself upon the visitor so instantaneously ; no other city dramatizes itself with half this dazzling effectiveness . Away spins your taxi . You have named your hotel , adding instinctively , " But first run past the Capitol . " - Nearer , taller , more exquisitely graceful looms the matchless dome . Your heart leaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with administration ; - that dome is king . - - - Vistas ; statuary ; a profusion of shadetrees ; broad avenues unmarred by trolleypoles ; majestic temples sheltering the departments ; a sky-piercing , pale-gray obelisk , with peep-holes at its tip ? all these you had foreseen , but not the headlong commercialism , or the little red schoolhouses on yellow wheels trundling sightseers hither and yon , or the hundred thousand negroes whose political riots led Congress to disfranchise the entire District , or the village-like atmosphere that wins and caresses you . Within fifteen minutes you feel that you have lived in Washington as many years , and strangers at the hotel seem convinced that you have , so intently do they stare , hoping to identify you with some statesman half-toned in the newspapers . Now , since every patriot begins his more intimate explorations by going afoot from the Capitol to the White House , you set forth in high spirits ; and , alas ! here beginneth the second lesson . Pure marble in your fancy , the Executive Mansion screams with white paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the visit of our attentive British cousins in 1814 . Pennsylvania Avenue , in your expectation the Broadway of Washington , is more or less its Bowery , since proprietors , aware that the Government will soon  | take over their holdings , see no object in improving them . Dowdy hotels bid for lodgers at fifty cents a night ; twenty-five , even . Shop-windows teem with souvenirs : the Capitol on brass slippers , the Capitol on silver puppies , the Capitol on patriotic dust-pans , the Capitol illumined with mother-of-pearl . Chop-suey resorts abound . On the way to his inauguration each new President passes a " home of burlesque , " a penny arcade , a tattooist 's studio , and the shrine where a " beautiful lady palmist " reveals your name . And vet at the end of this amazing thoroughfare rises the matchless dome that crowns the Capitol , which crowns a lordly eminence . There , surely , you will regain your first elation . Do you , though ? Fine old sycamores line the approach to a marble staircase . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bronze charmingly discolors the balustrades , while dense ivies and rich clusters of dark , glistening magnolias lend a grateful picturesqueness ; but the facade above ' is white paint again , except for dull gray wings which , newer than the rest , failed of their share in the cousinly attentions bestowed a century ago . The composition falls apart and disappoints , rousing a hot fluster of esthetic indignation . There was excuse for paint ; but not the slightest for wings in Massachusetts marble , sure to turn gray and matching the paint no more in texture than in tone . You go in by a painfully insignificant door ; but this , you remember , is not the Capitol 's front , and thereby hangs a tale ; for Washington set out to grow eastward , fell among real-estate speculators , balked at their extortionate prices , wheeled right about face , and grew westward instead . Up yonder the statue of armed Liberty shows its back to the city . Just within the entrance a doorkeeper in plain clothes lays a foot on his desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand beneath the ineffable dome , and could tear your hair and weep . In a vast and gaunt rotunda there lurks a dusty , gray-brownish sadness where radiance and glory and high splendor should be . Immense canvases display a style that was copied by chromo-lithography , and for which mankind banished chromo-lithography from the earth 's surface . A colossal head of Lincoln , admirable , but misplaced ,  | rests upon a marble block , which rests upon the floor ; inference , the guillotine . In the painted frieze you behold a personage with three arms , and question a stranger . Yes , he , too , sees it . Such calamities to happen here , of all places ! Away with them ! They are not yet sacred , for the dome itself reached completion only in 1865 . At a word from Congress ( speed the day ! ) its rotunda will glow with beauty and outrival the very Invalides . A corridor leads to what Washingtonians have conservatively christened the " Chamber of Horrors . " State worthies in marble or bronze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surmounting pedestals of all colors , shapes , and sizes , throng the edges of an enormous semicircular room . Illinois immortalizes Miss Frances E. Willard . Virginia , with touching fidelity , erects a statue of Lee . At the general 's feet lies a wreath of fresh flowers . So far , interesting ; but the jumble of haphazard images suggests an auction , and you listen for " Going ! going ! gone ! " And how your heart goes out to those manifestly unenticing effigies of Glick , Gorrie , Kirkwood , Curry , Collamer , and Shoup ! Poor America ! Seeking the sublime , attaining the feebly ridiculous . But the corridor leads straight to the National House of Representatives , where solemnities are about to begin . With its reward at hand , why resent the preliminary hazing ? You have blushed for your country ; now , so you trust , will come thrills . You mount to the gallery that frames an immense hall . Spectators sit waiting there , lost in admiration of its dismally stenciled walls , the crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demoded air of ? shall I say ? ? boarding-house grandeur . A dozen bitterly prosaic congressmen enter chattering . The sergeant-at-arms , nonchalantly coddling a rather small and rather sheepish-looking mace , enters . That bauble he sets more or less upright against a white marble tribune that rises in stages . The Speaker enters unattended , wearing a business suit . He mounts the tribune , and stands at its summit beneath a magnificent , gold-starred United States flag , while the mace takes a loftier perch than at first , and officials in business suits range themselves upon the white marble stages  | below . The mingling of pomp and tweeds recalls Mr. Chesterton 's warning , " Give the king a crown , but do n't give him half a crown . " The Speaker thumps mightily with a huge gavel , commanding order . During an extempore prayer by the chaplain the twelve congressmen stand , with heads bowed . Then to work amid pandemonium ; the instant a member rises to address the House , it is a signal for loudvoiced conferences . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come ; the Speaker plies his gavel ; demented urchins streak to and fro ; and scarcely twenty intelligible words can you hear . But the orator takes it all in good part . What cares he for the four hundred empty seats or for the members who converse in heavy tones or for the few who unfold their newspapers ? Years ago a statesman from Buncombe County , North Carolina , noticed that his fellow-congressmen were leaving while he spoke . " Leave , the whole pack of you , " said he ; " I ' m only talking for Buncombe . " There are many Buncombes . Yonder silver-tongued orator hails from one , and it hears . But the Senate , the suave , learned Senate , renowned for its decorum and more than unctuous courtesy , at least remains . Thither you hasten , to find the VicePresident arrayed in a ceremonious black cutaway and enthroned in solitary dignity upon a rostrum resembling a judge 's , while order reigns throughout the chamber . Does it always ? I quote from the " Congressional Record " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the senator . Would it be too great a strain upon his vocal cords to speak loud enough to be heard above the din ? " Mx . KENYON : " I am willing to speak loud enough to be heard above an ordinary din , but not above the usual senatorial din . " At present , however , you count barely eleven senators . Are there more on the way ? Should a bell ring ? but a famous senator has explained this to a nicety in explaining a recent misadventure : When the bell rings , I come down from my committee-room , where I work from six to eight hours a day attending to my  | correspondence and other things for my constituents , and answer to my name if it is a roll-call and vote if it is a vote . 1 inquire of some senator upon whom I think I can rely as to what the question to be voted on is . In this instance I voted " No " when I wanted to vote " Aye . " Not long since a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no quorum , he demanded a roll-call , and in poured the absentees . While they were departing he gave them two paragraphs , then talked of other matters . Again he bewailed no quorum . A second roll-call fetched them back . During the next hejira he gave them two paragraphs more . By keeping that up , in a kind of serialized recessional , he eventually said his entire say . But this morning 's senator exhibits no such spunk . Like the congressman , he is " only talking for Buncombe . " Enough of all that ! You bolt . Through unlovely corridors you go , beneath mediocre paintings in Brobdignagian frames , and past committee-rooms the mural wonders of which affront the intelligence no less than they affront the eye . In grim sincerity you could write : " My dear Uncle Sam : I have seen your Capitol . 0 my dear Uncle Sam ! " Sunshine , open air , then a visit to the Congressional Library , and a rebound from aggrieved dejection . What a palace ! Devoid of fusing grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where chrome clashes with vermilion , and both with the chill bluish-white of gleaming marble , yet overflowing with exquisite details . Those Shirlaws ! Those Alexanders ! Those enchanted , gracious Vedders ! And now back through the city . Your Government made that . A planned city , it achieves what other r illes d'art only strive for . Architecturally , it grows finer year by year , for taste improves wonderfully . You are proud of America , proud , and only the more so when an old acquaintance bobs up ( Washington is the City of Long-lost Cronies ) and takes you to lunch at the Cosmos Club . No matter how many clubs you may have known , in no matter how many cities , there was never a club like this . It is an academy , an institut . By indirection your Government made it . Despite the dearth of genius on Capitol Hill , Congress has founded in Washington a colony of most charming savants . You call to mind the Scottish professor of divinity who ministered to a village kirk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute ; for then it was that Deacon Kiltie MacFarthing said of the professor , " He maun be a kight honest mon to turn oot preachers better than himself ' . " How strangely mercurial you become ! Idealist , cynic , enthusiast , and then joker , you lean at last toward tolerance ; thanks to good company and good cheer , you can almost forgive Congress . Are its eccentricities worse , really , than those of other parliaments ? IIembers wear hats in the Commons . Members doze in the Lords . Members cry " Canaille ! " in the Deputies . Members pull noses at Budapest . Mr. Britling was right : all governments , looked at closely , are incredible . In certain noteworthy respects our own has improved . It no longer pollutes mosaics with Tobacco-juice . It seldom cracks a head . Not for years has a page carried that oncefrequent message , " The Speaker 's compliments to l'Ir. , and will he please take down his feet ? " Deserted seats there are , and uproar and " talking for Buncombe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its real work in committee-rooms ; of necessity the House does . " Sir , " quoth Bourke Cockran , " this House is organized for disorder and incapacity . Look at it . Distances are such that conversation is rarely regarded as an interruption . In the resulting confusion it is impossible to follow or understand the proceedings . " History relates that when Charles Lamb heard that no mother would allow her daughter to read " Rosamund Gray , " he cried : " Hang the age ! I ' 11 write for antiquity . " In a like spirit a congressman , with salvos of unquenchable verbosity in him and no one to listen , might exclaim : " Hang the House ! I ' 11 talk for Bun- combe . " Yet it is not by any means thus that he reasons , though he comes out at the same door . Observe him . Within every congressman 's breast flames a white-hot yearning for reelection . But fate has bound him hand and foot ; immobilized at the Capitol , he can not roam up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " viewing with alarm , " and displaying his " famous vote-getting smile . " Nor can he hope to mimeograph letters enough or sprinkle free seeds enough . Yet , behold ! Custom bids him excogitate his campaign speeches at Washington , thunder them in the House , have them printed in the " Record , " folded without charge , tucked into eleemosynary envelops , and franked to his adorers . A merry old soul is old Uncle Sam , and a merry old soul is he , even encouraging representatives to brighten the " Record " with those " speechless speeches " that figure as appendices in the daily issue , but as addresses actually delivered before an awestruck House in the " home edition . " If a congressman writes " applause " after a rounded period , then in goes " applause . " Strangely lifelike the " speechless speech " may appear . After a recent widows ' pension bill had sped through without rollcall or debate and become irrevocably a law , congressmen voted themselves five legislative days in which to " extend their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex post facto outpouring of persuasiveness enriched with such heart-throbs as " Let us pass this bill and be just ! " and " Ir . Speaker , coming now to the immediate bill before the House , let us pass it , not as partizans , but as patriots ! " However , congressional ingenuity can outdo even that . When a member happens upon a poem , an article , or an editorial foreordained to wheedle votes , he imagines it his " extension of remarks , " gives it an introductory , albeit speechless , puff , inserts it in the " Record , " and has it distributed free throughout his bailiwick . There is something deliciously smallboyish about an outsider 's adventures in Washington . You feel like Old Sleuth . After a few weeks , you can actually construct a worm's-eye view of Washington as seen by some innocent congressman ex- posed for the first time to the dangers of a great capital . No doubt the immortal George and his high counselor Major L'Enfant would turn over in their graves at the bare suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took pains to protect him against violence , mob-pressure , and the wiles of foreign princes ! With inspired prudence they established the Government at a place unpeopled by aliens and unlikely ever to be , a place remote from large and overweening centers of population , a place so planned that a few field-pieces on Capitol Hill could sweep radiating avenues with deadly fire . But there their foresight stopped . They failed to protect him against temptations that have come into being without blame to any one in particular and the abolition of which it is not the business of any one in particular to accomplish . In what follows I intend no rebuke to our innocent congressman ; I merely bewail his circumstances . He has a very questionable little something on his conscience by the time he reaches Washington . An ancient law , enacted in the days of stage-coaches and wayside inns , allots him twenty cents a mile for traveling expenses , and his wallet bulges with the overplus . Ought he not to return it ? If so , then where is the grated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honest thing ? None exists . With a distinct squirm of uneasiness , the congressman " keeps the change . " A much less ancient law allots him fifteen hundred dollars for clerk-hire . Some congressmen spend that and more , but the majority economize , and profit nobly thereby . With a straight face and in the House itself a famous congressman said recently of clerk-hire , " It is not the salary of a clerk ; it is an allowance to the member . " But let that pass . An incomparably more subversive temptation assails him next . To his boiling disgust , he discovers that unless he surrenders his independence and " stands in with the machine " he is now and henceforth a helpless , hopeless , ignominious " mawsh " member . You know the pretty word ? It derives from the initials of " might as well stay home . " Drop a tear for our innocent congressman . Morally , he can not afford to stand in with the machine ; politically , he can not afford not to . Only thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on good committees " and secure " a slice for his district " and feel confident of reelection . He wavers . He has come to Washington with a bill neatly drafted . It represents party pledges " back home . " The campaign was fought on that issue . The bill must pass . And all the while he has the children on his mind , not to mention an ambitious dame known endearingly as m a . ? She , too , feels " mawsh . " In society at Washington ? or , at all events , in the society of officialdom ? women shine by the light of men ; and while a congressman as such is not impossible , he is quite definitely improbable . So " ma " desires her luminary to increase his candle-power . Congressmen have become senators ; congressmen have been head-lined as " Presidential possibilities " and have been " groomed " and uproariously advertised . By dint of long service ( and politeness to journalists ) congressmen have attained such worldwide celebrity that even Washington unbent . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corcoran to the Smithsonian , from the Smithsonian to the superb new National Museum . She has a private den at the library , drops in at the foreign book-store , takes lessons in Spanish , and dreams of entering the life class at Zolnay 's . She haunts a feminist stronghold within view of the White House . Night before last she danced with an attache of the Chinese embassy . She knows a Filipino , three Cubans , a Liberian , and a duelist who , when prodded , owns up to baronial ancestors . Although she scorns tufthunting , her letters home indicate a waving , wind-blown opulence of exceedingly nice tufts . It would break daughter 's heart to leave Washington ; it would break son 's . It would break " ma 's . " Inciden- tally , it would break our innocent congressman 's . He likes " glory , " and while the invaluable " Hon. " will stick to him through life , he dreads the anguish of hearing himself referred to before long as " former congressman . " He likes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventyfive hundred a year , with office-rent free and clerk-hire and mileage thrown in . He likes the Capitol ; he likes the city , so clean and burnished and radiant it looks , with its three hundred factories using gas engines or electricity , and its unspeakable tenements all cleverly hidden away in rear courts . How it thrills him to live in a show-town ! So the congressman capitulates . To get his bill through , he helps others get theirs through . He secures " a slice for his district " by rolling the harmless , necessary log . Tiny hamlets receive monumental post-offices ; villages of no strategic eminence receive " forts . " Our hero inserts " jokers , " skulks in committee-rooms when to vote would mean " going on record , " and considers himself " paired " for the same heroic reason ; yet he is boldly outspoken in his allegiance to a rivers and harbors bill that " approaches as near to perfect depravity as the infirmities of human nature will permit . " I pause to retouch his portrait , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since our congressman encounters nothing at Washington that he has not already encountered in miniature at home . He was a politician there . Long before his departure , gossip attributed to his genius the maxim , " For public service ' read public serve us . ' " Dogging his career , one might soon amass material for " The Life and Crimes of an Innocent Congressman , " though personally I should christen it " Somehow Good . " That fits . The vast bulk of legislation at Washington is neither frivolous nor depraved . Nor can it be ; for the day has ac- tually arrived when party platforms have the dignity of contracts and when perfidy spells " Go . " If one chamber sets out to pull down the starry heavens , the other takes fright and props them up again ; if both would pull them down , then comes the Presidential veto . Moreover , there sits a court of nine black-robed justices , and Congress dreads the chance that , after all the aching drudgery of enacting a law , the nine irreproachables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Congress dreads the little gold gridirons in certain cravats at Washington . They represent the press . So Congress for the most part behaves . Fleeced extensively , humbugged a little , and now and then rasped , we sleep soundly o ' nights , and by day there is business as usual . Hence , a Washington unique among great capitals for its downright sensational placidity . Berlin has its Liebknecht , and shudders . Paris has its Orleanists , who post amazing handbills : " The hour has struck ! Frenchmen , proclaim your king ! " London has its coteries disgusted with those upstart " tons of soil , " its multitudes disgusted with lordships who " have merely taken the trouble to be born . " Yet all is quiet on the Potomac , where no one exclaims , " A fine morning ; let us go out and overthrow the Government ! " Washingtonians believe in their Government so implicitly that they feel free to poke fun at it or gently chide it . Their faith abides , though sundry astonishing phenomena conspire to uproot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture 's illustrated report on mushrooms and toadstools , with every mushroom marked " Poison , " every toadstool marked " Edible . " They have not forgotten the embalmed beef of ninetyeight or the comment , " Be sicrity iv war if ye must , Hinnesy , but do n't be sicrity iv a war . " They recall an epoch when congressional pianos enjoyed free transportation by mail . The other day they read Mr. Morse 's remarks on governmental bookkeeping : " No mortal knows what the Government owns or how much it is worth . If Uncle Sam had been an individual , he would not now be in business . " From month to month they peruse the " Searchlight on Congress . " It tells of a committee that has not held a meeting for thirty-seven years . It tells of another that within seven days befriended four thousand private pension claims , all of which had previously been proved ridiculous by the pensions department . It calls Congress our " Supreme Court of Spoils . " How can Washingtonians see what they see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refrain from brandishing the red flag ? Your mirror will give you the answer , or at least a hundred millionth thereof . Washingtonians believe in our institutions because they believe in America . We wanted representative government . The Government we got represents us , and a Washingtonian is not at all seriously disturbed when critics from abroad seem skeptical . Nothing strikes him as funnier than a Frenchman 's disparagement : " No negroes in your Senate ! Ah , messieurs , we order these things better in the France . We have black senators ? toujours . From the colonies , " unless , perchance , there may gleam a more pleasing comicality in an Englishman 's interrogation , " I say , how many bishops have you got in your House of Lords ? " Indeed , whole classes go unrepresented , if you accept the sample-case theory of representation . Not until 1916 was a woman elected to Congress . There are no Indians in the House . There is only half an Indian in the Senate . And yet the sample-case theory meets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionel of Market Benham stands for election in Stoke Pogis or Wormwood Scrubs . So Washingtonians talk back . Our representatives at least represent localities ; and if foreigners berate our lack of a " responsible government , " meaning a cabinet doomed to resign the instant it becomes odious , the Washingtonian has seen many a cabinet officer sent " kiting " and more than one chief magistrate " snowed under " in due course .  | There are moments , to he sure , when the supreme luxury of being a Washingtonian appears to consist in owning a government and at the same time mildly despising it . With desperate seriousness the Sixty-second Congress changed the name of Sixteenth Street to " the Avenue of the Presidents " ; with a seriousness as desperate the Sixty-third Congress changed it hack . Washingtonians jeered . Then , too , they encounter obstacles whenever they would convince a President that , since charity begins at home , he should sacrifice the country at large to the private , economic whimsicalities of Washingtonians . Moreover , Washington teems with departmental clerks who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries and a Saturday half-holiday . They wail . All Washington hears them and vaguely sympathizes . Meanwhile it hears the slurring , disgruntled , sourly cynical term , " professional politicians . " Professionals , are they ? A race apart ? A caste ? In the nature of things quite dismally unrepresentative ? The next moment these same scoffers are crying , " Now you see what comes of being governed by amateurs ! " This states the truth precisely . Americans blunder into politics . They begin as lawyers , reporters , schoolmasters , and what not ; something happens . The amateur spirit lives on in them ; after thirty years in Congress a country lawyer from Ohio is still a country lawyer from Ohio . Washingtonians know it ; the more they see of Americans , the more they respect congressmen . Living in our only non-sectional city , they view us through unprejudiced spectaIles as all America streams past their doors : office-seekers , reformers , lobbyists , travelers , convention-goers , scientists , and men of affairs big and little . Seeing us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our inferiors . Then , too , they see Europe . It comes to them . In summer , when Washington sizzles , European capitals invite , and Washingtonians have a passion for studying governmental systems abroad . They return with renewed admiration for ours . Even foreigners have shared it . Said Munsterberg , " The number of powerful and striking countenances to be seen in the House is greater than in the German Reichstag . " Indeed , WWashingtonians believe that , for better or for worse , Congress even represents us morally . In the wrong mood they describe us as a rabble of greedy , unprincipled communities eking out a shameful existence by robbing the cooperative clothes-line ? robbing it by ' proxy at that , by making our honored deputies do the pilfering , and threatening them with political electrocution if they fail . But Washingtonians are not uniformly as cross as all this . If they recognize our shallowness , our weakness , and our misguided selfishness , they recognize also our underlying honesty , and hold to a conviction that year by year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so do our representatives . When last year 's rivers and harbors bill reached the Senate , a well-known voice shouted , " If the price of my seat is to vote for bills of this kind , then the seat may go ! " In the House the Speaker actually broached a plan to abolish " talking for , Buncombe " by abolishing the " Record . " And there arrived in Washington that wonder of wonders , an independent congressman . He belongs to no party . He owns his soul . He will keep on owning it . In both wings of the Capitol he is envied . For a new spirit has begun to pervade Congress . " Mr. President , " declared a senator , " I am not a seventh son of a seventh son , but I risk the prophecy that there will never be another rivers and harbors bill like this of 1916 . " Members detest the policy of skinning Peter to tickle Paul . They detest log-rolling . They detest being mere attorneys for neighborhoods and men . They detest duplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debates them afterward " for Buncombe . " The Senate , like the House , desires to become once more a deliberative body . Your sojourn ends . You stand again within the creamy-white archway of the  | station . As you turn and look back , is there mockery in the three gilded eagles gleaming against the sky ? Or in the ripple of red , white , and blue ? Or in the far-off , soaring dome ? Not the least . You left home in a string-tie mood redolent of Webster 's " Reply to Hayne . " You arrived in a mood out-Fourth-ofJulying the most glorious of Fourths . You have had your emotional ups and downs ever since . no Washington ; there is only a project . By the same token , there is as yet no America . Instead , there is a project , original , daring , momentous . We struggle toward democracy . We shall win . What , then , have you seen ? A hope , an experiment , and withal a great adventure .  |   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
