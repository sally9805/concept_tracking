txt An undercurrent of apprehension regarding the labor situation in the steel trade is evident in certain circles . A secret meeting of labor leaders was held early this week in Chicago and , it is understood , the delegates decided that an attempt should be made to unionize the steel trade . : tee men , almost unanimously holding to the open shop position , point to the fact that the President has declared himself in favor of a status quo during the war in respect to organization of labor in different plants and industries . That is , his position is that employers should make no effort to disoand unions in unionized plants , while labor leaders should keep their hands off open shops . It has been suggested that an arrangement somewhat similar to that between capital and labor in the shipyards might be arrived at in the steel trade . It might be pointed out , however , that the rates of pay decided on for shipyard employes were purposely set very high in order to attract workers from other industries .

The steel industry employs several times-the number of mar that are engaged in shipbuilding and if the steel companies had to pay the same rates as the shipbuilders , footing the bill themselves , they would operate at a heavy loss . Over half a million men are engaged in the manufacture of steel and it has long been the ambition of the leaders of organized labor to bring these into the union fold . The fair attitude that the steel companies have always taken in dealing with their employes , however , has rendered the efforts of the union men unavailing . Common labor in the steel mills is now getting ** a day . compared with $2 a day lust before the war , or more than double . This advance has been accomplished by voluntary increases granted from time to time by the steel companies . Besides voluntarily increasing pay whenever prices and profits warranted the steel companies have for many years been the leaders among employers in looking after the interests of their employes . The Steel Corporation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sanitation and welfare generally , has made a careful study of the housing problem and in many other ways has done a great deal toward mitigating the former rather severe lot of the common laborer in the steel mill . The corporation 's attitude toward its employes has been followed closely by practically all other concerns in the industry .
