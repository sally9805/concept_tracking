Welcome are the reports from Washington that President Wilson is determined to complete his programme of legislation to prevent railway strikes . His position , it is true , has been squarely challenged by the Federation of Labor . In session at Baltimore , it again went on record against the plan to make either a railway strike or a railway lockout illegal unless the matter in dispute had first been duly investigated . Compulsory inquiry , declares Mr. Gompers , means compulsory labor , or holding men to the involuntary servitude forbidden by the Constitution . Thus we have the Federation of Labor arrayed in advance in opposition to the President ; and all the smooth words which its delegates addressed to him on Saturday can not disguise this fact . In his reply , Mr. Wilson did not commit himself on the main issue . Yet the root of the matter lay in his warning that classes and class interest must not be allowed to dominate American public policy . We shall doubtless long have in this country groups with different class-feelings . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not , indeed , the abolition of classes which the President or any other sensible man expects or demands . But the various social classes have got to learn the lesson of working together in a republic . Between them there must be give and take . A spirit of reasonable concession and of conciliation must be cherished , or created ; otherwise the country 's affairs can not get on . We can endure many things . We can manage to get along , for example , with shorter hours on the railways and higher wages , with the consequent higher freight rates ; but what we can not put up with is the tyrannizing and monopolistic spirit , whether in masters or men . It is trite to say that there is always a public interest overtopping that of any class , but we have to keep on hainmering at such elementary truths . The particular thing to bear in mind at the present juncture is the paramount concern of the American public in this whole railway question . It is , obviously , the assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dread that it might break in our hands was what caused the nation-wide fear of last August . Against such a possibility there is no doubt whatever that the people as a whole desire and have a right to be guarded . The President himself said to Congress that the chief hope and aim of his pro-posed legislation was to take a bond of fate that so alarming a situation should never again lay its paralyzing touch upon the country . But only a part of his project could then be enacted into law . The remainder ? and by far the more important section  --  has still to be sanctioned . And we can but hail every indication . that Mr. Wilson intends to use his enhanced prestige to the full , and to see to it that his own promises , and the tacit pledges of his party , to the country shall be kept . There could be no better reason for the President to put on his fighting clothes and go forth to meet his enemies . If among them figure Mr. Gompers and the railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has squared his account with them . It is their turn to do a little yielding . If they resist all compromise in sullen obstinacy , and with the assumption that their power is so great that it can be held in terror over Congress in a way to leave the public helpless , popular disapproval will fall upon them like an avalanche . On a plain issue between their arrogant demands and the good of the country , President Wilson could surely win a complete victory . It is hard to believe in the sincerity of the leaders of the Federation of Labor when they protest so solemnly that no man should be compelled to work against his will , and give this as their main reason why they never will consent to have the Canadian plan of preventing railway strikes adopted in the United States . Men already holding a whip over labor are hardly the ones to be tearful over the spectacle of railway unions not being allowed to declare a strike at the drop of a handkerchief . That there is no real hardship and no true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundantly shown . Canadian workmen are not so different from ours that they would submit to an intolerable tyranny . It has not appeared such in practice . It is only a , rational way of ascertaining the merits of any railway controversy , and meanwhile of guaranteeing the nation that its transportation shall not suddenly be thrown into chaos . Even if Mr. Gompers and his fellows have strong objections to the course urged by the President , they ought to see that here is a case where class interest must give way to that of the general public . And if they insist selfishly and mulishly upon denying this , and proceed once more to swing their lash about the ears of Congress , it is to be hoped that Mr. Wilson will teach them a hard but needed lesson in public duty . " THE NEW EUROPE . " Cardinal Mercier , that intrepid prelate and exalted soul , has again raised his voice in a protest to the civilized world against the deportation of Belgians from their native land . That this act of the German authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war is not denied . The attempt is made to mask it in humanitarian guise . Belgian artisans are without work . It is better to take them to German shops and give them employment and pay than to leave them at home in dependent idleness . But this conveniently overlooks two questions : Who threw them out of work ? Who is supporting them ? The fact that the needy Belgians have been and are largely fed by American and English philanthropy makes the high-handed proceeding of Governor-General von Bissing something which our Government can not ignore . In fact , the State Department has already made strong representations to Germany on the subject . From Rome it is reported that the Pope is also to make a solemn protest to Germany ; and it was even rumored that joint diplomatic action would be taken by the Vatican , Spain , and the United States . While waiting to see whereto this thing may grow , it Is well to note the spirit In which this protesting movement by neutrals is conceived . There is no desire to take sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that right and humanity be respected . The animus of the whole can not be better expressed than in the words of Cardinal Mercier himself . In his Pastoral Letter of last Lent , after his visit to Rome , he sought both to comfort and strengthen his distressed Belgian flock . He predicted a triumphant end of their sufferings : My conviction , both natural and supernatural , of our ultimate victory is more firmly rooted in my soul than ever . If , indeed , it could have been shaken , the assurances given me by several disinterested and careful observers of the general situation , notably those belonging to the two Americas , would have sufficed to consolidate it . But his most striking exhortation was this : Whatever happens , never doubt of justice . At no other period of my life have I seen its action penetrating , to all appearance , the most trivial circumstances , the most insignificant incidents , the events most foreign to our personal calculations , as in this recent journey of mine . It is in the stirring and spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies . And that the noble words of Cardinal Mercier are finding wider and wider echo scarce a week passes without bringing fresh evidence . Even from the place in the Reichstag where the German Chancellors have exalted the policy of blood and iron , unaccustomed language about humanity and the rights of small nations has lately come . One can see a similar vision and a kindred striving in the recent foundation of a weekly periodical , The New Europe , of which the first number has just reached this country . Established and conducted frankly in the Interest of the Allies , and having a list of eminent French and English collaborators , It yet sounds a note higher than that of any single belligerent interest . What it looks ' forward to eagerly is " European reconstruction . " And the basis of such rebuilding it - would find in " nationality " and " the rights of minorities . " More specifically , it means to work for " permanent peace and the reduction of armaments , " together with the ' fulfilment of the " solemn pledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : national rights and public law . " Signs that this new Europe  --  one might say , a new world  --  is not going to be impossible of realization are multiplying . A great reaction of the mind of men against - war is visibly under way . It is not only the calamitous losses and the unspeakable miseries and brutalities which are repelling and appalling millions . The immense futility of the resort to war is impressing itself on the heart and conscience of mankind . How to secure peace and how to buttress it , the whole world is now discussing . Recently In England that hard-headed lawyer , Sir Frederick Pollock , came out heartily in favor of the League to Enforce Peace . It was not in the least to be thought of as an amiable dream , he contended , but as a measure easily to be made workable , and one which the civilized nations could not afford to ignore . With even the German Chancellor forced to pay tribute to the idea  --  forced " by the rising feeling against war in Germany herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present horrible welter ' there will come , not merely a new Europe , but a new respect for the law of nations , a new regard for the weak and helpless , a new sense of human brotherhood . " MARITIME TYRANNY . " Some of the phrases used by Viscount Grey in his reply to the American note on the blacklist have aroused angry comment in Germany . Thus the Koinische Zeitung exclaims : Everything remains as before . England is mistress of the seas , and whoever wants to , carry on commerce can do so only with herpermission and under her supervision . Is not this navalism a thousand times more complete and more oppressive than anything German militarism  --  which really does not exist  --  is supposed to have done ? On this , we are bound to say that , so far as the present war is concerned , Germany has put herself out of court . From its first days she has suffered , and till its end will continue to suffer , from the effect of her own high-handed acts . And these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as on land . The German strewing of mines in the high seas , and the murderous use of submarines , not only gave England an excuse for extreme measures by way of retaliation , but prevented the indignation of neutral nations from rising as high as it otherwise would have risen at the irregularities of the British blockade and its many incidental stupidities and injustices . Moreover , German statesmen can not pretend to be surprised at what has happened . They were frequently and plainly warned , as by Prince von Billow , long before the war , exactly what use of sea-power England would make if she were drawn into hostilities against Germany . The English navy was kept in great strength and in a high state of preparation with the avowed aim of protecting British commerce and food-supplies , in case of war , and also of cutting off enemy trade . It was certain from the beginning that German ships would be driven from the ocean , and that a rigid blockade would be established . No intelligent member of the German Government could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German public men have been frank enough to admit that if their country had been in control of the seas , it would have acted precisely as England has done . Everybody knows this to be true . It is for such reasons that the voices raised in Germany , during the war , in behalf of " the freedom of the seas " have not wakened echoes in the neutral world . They have sounded neither sincere nor convincing . The retort made by Mr. Balfour , months ago , was too obvious . The German object , he declared , was to " free military absolutism on land from that barrier of the seas which even Napoleon could not pass . " Furthermore , to " abolish the right of sea blockade , while preserving the right of land blockade , would exalt the power of states with big armies at the expense of non-military states like Britain and America . " It is not necessary to pursue the argument . Suffice it to say that at present there is no likelihood whatever that Germany will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English sea-power , or that any improvement of the rules of ocean-warfare will be made , or even attempted , so Long as the war lasts . This , however , is not to deny that there is a measure of justice in German complaints , or that the question of the use of naval power in war-time is one which the nations of the world ought to take up seriously when peace comes . Lord Grey himself has acknowledged that the matter is one which might properly be " passed in review " in the negotiations for peace . And there has long been a powerful element in England ready to concede that the old rules of naval warfare ought to be modernized . What is meant is a more sure definition of contraband , and , in general , the recognition of the rights of private property at sea , in time of - war , as they have long been recognized on land . The subject Is candidly discussed in the book , " Towards a Lasting Settlement , " recently published by a group of English Liberals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas , and argues that the world will never submit to a maritime tyranny , any more than it would to a military tyranny . The way out is plain . Contraband and blockade must be more limited than at present . Above all , the historic American contention for the immunity of private property at sea must be adopted by an international Congress . The general principle ought to be that commerce should be exempt from the operations of war so long as it takes no part in them . There is no true freedom of the seas " so long as an enemy 's private property is liable to capture under its own flag . " That kind of looting has been abolished on land ; it ought to be on the sea . That it should be , the United States has stoutly maintained ever since the days of Benjamin Franklin . It should be made a cardinal point in our international policy . Whatever weight this nation may have in the settlement of the present war ought to be thrown into the scales on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England as well as Germany will be desirous of cultivating the most friendly relations with the United States when the war is over . It should be made clear to English statesmen that they could take no step better calculated to cement American friendship than by an undertaking to abandon forever some of their naval practices during this war , and to enter with other nations into the fullest guarantees of the safety of private property at sea . THE CONQUEST OF NEW YORK . A conscientious scrutiny of Mr. Roosevelt 's remarks on life and literature before the Academy of Arts and Letters last Thursday impels one to the conclusion that the speaker is still quite angry with the people of the West because of what happened on November 7 . Art and literature , we are told , are not worth while unless they are the expression of the valor of the soul , which comes before beauty , and there is no valor in a nation if it is too proud to fight . This obviously means that no serious literature or art can come out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of cubist patriotism , or out of Ohio , or out of New Hampshire , which sacrificed its opportunity to become a cradle for serious art by a plurality of 69 in a total vote of 87,000 . More than ever the fatal results of Mr. Hughes 's failure to shake hands with Gov . Johnson leap to the eyes . For it now appears that the omitted hand-clasp did more than lose a Presidency and work a political revolution . It destroyed all chance of a national literature springing up in California , Washington , Idaho , Kansas , Utah , and New Mexico for at least four years to come . But out West they are apt to feel about it just the other way . It will be odd if the political conquest of New York and New England is not followed across the Mississippi by a declaration of independence against the spiritual domination of Manhattan and Boston . Such independence , as a matter of fact , the West has asserted before this , but always with an aggressiveness which indicated that the West was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York provincial , and thereby acknowledged New York 's preeminence . When it came to specific argument , the West , with its ally , the South , could make out a very good case for itself in this matter of the spiritual and intellectual life of the nation . Of the three American writers in whom foreign opinion has found the most authentic expression of the national genius , two , Mark Twain and Poe , belong to the great hinterland , and the third , Walt Whitman , is of the East only by accident of birth . In spirit he belongs somewhere near the Mississippi . Now that Henry James is dead , there is only one figure of eminence which the East can claim , Edith Wharton . To the West belong William Dean Howells and the great majority of the younger writers with the truly national touch ? Mr. Dooley and George Ade and Jack London . From the West have come Augustus Thomas and David Belasco . From the West have come a brilliant group of newspaper writers and artists , drawn hither by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mass of young talent across the continent , or by the lure of New York . Yet it has been with these individual conquerors of New York as with the rude and valorous conquerors of every Babylon in history . The victor has ultimately been enslaved by the vanquished . The city has cast upon them the spell of decadence . The young Goths have lost their pristine valor amidst a servile population . Young giants of finance have carved a place for themselves in Wall Street only to be absorbed in the mass of plutocracy . Writers and artists have put their foot upon the neck of New York only to succumb to the appeal of Broadway . It may not show in the superficial character of their work , which has retained in large measure the touch of the open country . The habits and thought and slang of the West are still popular in the magazines and books published in New York . But that serious art for which Mr. Roosevelt calls has not developed in proportion to the raw talent invested , and this is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against sincere and significant expression . It is with the writer who has received the approval of New York as with the actress who after years of struggle reaches the goal of Broadway . Her artistic development stops ; she is henceforth a star and condemned to a splendid state of petrifaction . The writer is henceforth the manufacturer of the kind of book which New York has decided he must produce for ever after , Capua has him in its wiles . He may go back West for a new supply of raw material . But he works it up after the New York pattern . The process has hitherto seemed an inevitable one because everywhere and at all times the political capital of a nation sets the fashion for literature , art , theatre , clothes , breakfast foods , drug-stores , and safety razors . Now that the political hegemony of the East , and particularly of New York , has been shattered , will the West earnestly set out to vindicate its own ideals of American civilization ? A revolt has been under way for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City and San Francisco by the booking offices on the Great White Way . In Chicago , in Los Angeles , the attempt has been made to set up independent producing centres under the auspices of drama leagues or enterprising commercial managers . But hitherto the pull of New York has been too strong It has been regarded as failure if a play produced in Los Angeles or Chicago has failed to receive the baccalaureate degree , of Times Square . Will the self-conscious West now be encouraged to leave New York altogether out of the reckoning ? If the country west of the Alleghanies should succeed in emancipating itself from the New ' York best-seller , from the second and third company sent out by the Syndicate , from the comic supplement of Park Row , from the " ' varsity clothes " imposed by the manufacturers of lower Fifth Avenue on . the sturdy manhood of Toledo and Seattle , it may yet turn out that the most significant thing - which happened on November 7 was not the reelection of Mr. Wilson or even the conversion of Kansas . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creditable part America has played in astronomical science . It was Prof. Asaph . Hall who first descried the moons of Mars at Washington in 1877 , Prof. E. E. Barnard who discovered the small inner satellite of Jupiter in 1892 , and Prof. W. H. Pickering who tracked out the ninth and tenth moons of Saturn . In the field of mathematical astronomy there is no higher name than Simon Newcomb 's . In the photometry of stars Prof. E. C. Pickering , as director of the Harvard Observatory , long ago took place with the best European scientists ; in some fields of stellar astronomy no one is better known than Prof. George Hale , of the Mt . Wilson Observatory , and the study of the sun spots has perhaps gone farthest in this country . Even in the making of achromatic lenses , the two Clarks of Cambridgeport have rivalled the Germans . Professor Lowell 's place in astronomical history is not easy to fix , but he will not be held much the more lightly because he rode one doubtful theory to the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views obtained was due not only to their sensational implications , but to his ability in presenting them in interesting language and with a background of general scientific fact illuminating and making them plausible . In such books as " Mars as the Abode of Life " he sets out with his theory of the essentially " cosmic " character of life  --  something that nature strives to produce everywhere , under the most unfavorable circumstances . To his mind , any planet that could furnish a combination of carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , phosphorus , and sulphur under suitable conditions of temperature was more likely than not to bring forth some kind of life . A half century ago the impossibility of life in the ocean-depths had been postulated on the tremendous pressure of the water there , the absence of light , and other unfavorable conditions ; and science mistaken in this instance ought not to assert rashly the impossibility of life on the planet next outside the earth . Our present knowledge of Mars is due in large measure to Lowell . Schiaparelli , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iong before that the planet had certain widely extended dark areas miscalled " oceans , " and polar caps that showed the annual deposit and melting of snow , ice , or frost . With the results of observations begun at Flagstaff in 1894 , Lowell set out to prove that conditions on Mars were indeed favorable to life , that there were outer evidences of the work of reasoning inhabitants , and that from terrestrial premises we might reasonably argue life existent there . With a certain basis of sound astronomical discovery he combined a superstructure of general scientific knowledge in a romantically conjectural whole . It was something to make the world think more of Mars than of sun or moon , and produce works with the interest of H. G. Wells 's excursions into planetary space ; it was , more to raise questions concerning the glaciation of the other planet , its atmosphere , its crusts , and the trustworthiness of optical observation of it . Some of Lowell 's important generalizations upon Mars are open to little question . His argument for the existence of vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , a very faint green or brown at the other , the hemispheres changing in turn . The changes follow the melting of the polar caps . There is evidence also for an atmosphere closely resembling ours , but thinner , and for appearance of cloud or haze at the melting season . His attempted refutation of the argument that the temperature was prohibitive to life has been strengthened by recent measurements of the surface-heat of the moon , which may also have very thin air . His account of the physical characteristics of the planet , older than the earth , singularly without by deserts , seems correct in every particular . But this is not to demonstrate Martian life , and all his other conclusions are denied . He reasoned that the canals so plainly seen from Flagstaff are really the borders of vegetation upon water-channels leading from the polar cap all over the globe . Many of the six hundred that he listed are thousands of miles in length ; they follow regular arcs with perfect geometrical design , and they fit into centres to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun may melt the snow or ice-caps , under Mars 's low barometric pressure evaporation would at once ensue , that the moisture around the poles is very small , and that at least the finer canals are probably an optical delusion , due to light and shaded areas . Lowell was at pains to explain what he thought was gained by launching his discoveries concerning Mars behind a claim for the existence of life there ; and , of course , the attraction of public interest was not a motive . He believed it the function of science first to marshal circumstantial evidence and then find a motive . Merely to gather facts without attention to a purpose behind them seemed to him fruitless . But granting all that may be said for the necessity of theorizing as a means of advancing science , it is plain that no scientist should formulate theories upon hasty evidence . It is one tribute to the underlying scientific ability of the man that his apparent extravagance of thesis did not lessen the real respect paid him .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
