txt With the acceptance last night by the Board of Governors of the Aero Club of America of the ruling of the Federation Aeronautique Internationale , awarding to Count de Lesseps the $10,000 Statue of Liberty prize offered by Thomas Fortune Ryan for the-fastest aeroplane flight around the statue from Belmont Park , the scene of the second international aviation tournament last October , the controversy raised by Claude GrahameWhite , the English aviator , over the awarding of the prize , was brought to a close . The ruling of the Federation Aeronautique Internationale disqualifies Mr. White as well as the late John B. Moisant , who was popularly acclaimed the winner when it became known that his was the fastest time made by any of the three contestants . Mr : Moisant was disqualified by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale for having failed to accomplish a continuous flight of one hour 's duration prior to his entry in the Statue of Liberty flight . Mr , White was disqualified because a wing up of his Bldriot monoplane fouled pylon No. 5 as he was settling to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesseps is accredited the winner , therefore , although the elapsed time of his flight was longer than that of either Mr. Moisant or Mr. White . The controversy has been one which threatened to disrupt the friendly relations between the local aero governing body and the Federation Internationale . It has aroused more interest in aviation circles than any previous incident of aviation tournaments , and despite the acceptance by the Aero Club of America of the ruling of the international body there remain many aeronauts and folk interested in laeronautics who believe the prize should have gone to John B. Moisant . That a controversy arose at all over the awarding of the prize was due to the conditions under which the race was flown . It is because they feel that these conditions have not been appreciated by the international body that many aeronauts express dissatisfaction with the verdict which gives the prize to Count de Lesseps . One condition of the race was that each contestant qualify by making a preliminary flight of at least one hour 's duration . Claude Grahame-White and Count de Lesseps made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Belmont Park who had announced an intention of competing for the Statue of Liberty prize these two alone fulfilled this stipulation . Inclement weather prevented continued flying by any one except on the occasions seized by Grahame-White and Count de Lesseps . Others , unprepared to fly at that time , found the days slipping by without an opportunity to qualify . The day for the statue flight came and went with no attempt on the part of any one to compete for the $10,000 prize , so inclement was the weather . Although the postponement of the event had not been provided for in the conditions governing it , it was agreed , nevertheless , to permit a contest for the prize at a later and more favorable day , and at the same time it was understood generally that the clause requiring an hour 's sustained flight would be waived in view of the continued bad weather . It was under these conditions that the race was flown and won by John B. Moisant , who started last and whose reappearance after all hope of a victory by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . excitement . With the understanding that the sustained flight requirement had been waived , the Judges of the meet at Belmont Park awarded the prize to Moisant . He was accepted everywhere as the winner , and had been acclaimed as such ' when Grahame-White entered protest with the Aero Club of America . Previously Mr. White had demanded another chance to make better time around the Statue , and had proposed that both he and ? Molsant make the trial again , he in his 100 horse power Bldriot , Moisant in the Bldriot of only fifty horse power , in which he never even had sat . until he started on the flight around The Statue . When these proposals were rejected Grandane-White formally protested against the awarding of the prize to Molsant . The Aero Club referred his claims to the international body . ' Moisant said not a word . Up to the time of his death on Dec. 31 , when he - was crushed at New Orleans , he left his interests in the hands of the Aero Club , confident that the tacit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the international body . That the Federation Aeronautique Internationale has ignored this detail of the flights was declared by Moisant 's friends last night to be a keen disappointment to them . " There is just one source of satisfaction in the whole affair , " declared an amateur a.erbonaut last night . " Grahame-White , whose proposals immediately after the flight were considered unsportsmanlike , to say the least , will not receive the prize . It would be interesting to know what he will think of the decision which his own protest called forth .
