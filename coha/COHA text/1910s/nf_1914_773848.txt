txt // came Jonas Webb , who lived north of London , at Babraham , near the city of Cambridge . Ile was also one of the greatest English breeders . II is Southdowns had more size and were a still better mutton sheep than were Ellman 's . As a mutton sheep , the Southdown has occupied a most important place for a century or more , being still considered the model sheep for that purpose . It has been used to help improve more breeds than has any other . Southdowns were first imported into America about 1800 , and since then many others have been brought here . The Southdown has been noted for its short , neat head , which is more or less covered with wool down over the reddish-brown face . It has a short , thick neck , broad chest , wide back , thick meaty leg of mutton , and short red-brown legs . No other breed matures earlier , and it is not lacking in hardiness . Southdowns are well suited to grazing on the better class of pastures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor pastures as are some others . The flesh is very fine of grain and is not inclined to be overfat . Butchers especially admire this sheep because it kills out so well , with small amount of loss . The Southdown , or sheep with more or less of Southdown blood , have won more prizes in fat-stock shows where the carcasses were considered , than has any other breed . At our great International Live Stock Exposition , the Southdown has usually won the grand-championship on the dressed carcass exhibit . Mature rams weigh about 175 pounds , and the ewes 135 pounds . These sheep have been criticised as being too small for the American farmer . The average fleece is short and light of weight , though of fine quality , and this has also made the breed generally unpopular in America , although it is looked upon with more favor in the Southern states . In spite of these criticisms , the S2 BEGINNINGS IN ANIMAL HUSBANDRY breed commands universal respect , and flocks of Southdowns are found all over the civilized world . The Shropshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about the county of that name in western England . This is a rather hilly region , with many fine pastures , and is well suited to these animals . A number of different men were interested in the improvement of the Shropshire , prominent among whom were Messrs . Meire and Adney . Some of the early sheep were very coarse and had horns , and Mr. Meire worked to improve the quality , to get rid of the horns , and to develop a better mutton sheep . In this he succeeded . Shropshires became somewhat prominent in England about 1853 , when they were first exhibited at the Royal Agricultural Society Show . About // 1880 much attention was given the breed , and large exhibitions were made at English shows . These sheep were first imported into America in 1860 , by Samuel Sutton , of Maryland . Twenty years later they were imported in larger numbers , and since then thousands have been brought to the United States , where this is the most popular of all the mutton breeds . In size the Shropshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ewes about 160 pounds . The head often has a covering of wool , or " cap , " down to the nose , which is covered with dark brown or nearly black hair . The back is broad , the leg of mutton very good , and the body is usually deep , showing good feeding capacity . The legs are dark brown in color like the face , and are covered with wool to the knees in front and to the ankles behind . The quality of mutton is most excellent , being second to the Southdown only . The fleece is usually about 3% inches long , and is of very good quality . A twelve months ' growth from fair specimens of the breed weighs about 9 or 10 pounds . The combination of good size of body and weight of fleece has done much to make this breed popular with American farmers , as a great general-purpose sheep . Besides this , Shropshires are the most prolific breed we have , many ewes having twin , lambs . Flocks are very common all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east of the Mississippi and in Canada . The American Shropshire Sheep Association is the largest organization of its kind in the world , and has done much to promote the breed . The Oxford Down sheep comes from the county of Oxford , in south-central England . It is a beautiful rolling country , with good pastures , and where wheat and small grains thrive . This is one of our youngest breeds of sheep , and comes from a combination of Cotswold and Hampshire blood . About // 1833 a man named Druce began to breed these sheep , and finally produced one of the largest English mutton breeds . For a long time the wool , though abundant , was rather inferior , but the size and the mutton quality of the sheep made it popular . A few of these sheep were brought to Delaware in 1846 , and since then the breed has been much improved and has been gaining in popularity in America . As already stated , it is a large breed , the rams at maturity often weighing 275 pounds or more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair on the face , ears , and legs is a very dark brown , quite like the Shropshire . Oxfords are not so heavily wooled over the head , and often the face is rather free of wool , and the ears incline to be rather smooth and large . Typical specimens have quite wide backs , fairly good legs of mutton , and deep bodies . During recent years the breed has been much improved , the flesh growing // finer in quality , and the fat being laid on more smoothly . The fleece , which frequently weighs 12 pounds , is longer , more open , and coarser , than that of the Shropshire . This is a breed that has made a favorable impression on farmers in the states of the Middle West , where fairly early maturity , size , and heavy fleece are wanted . The ewes are quite prolific , and though not equalling the Shropshires , make a very good showing . The Oxford may be regarded as one of the most promising breeds for future development . Recently flocks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of these sheep in Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , and Wisconsin than elsewhere in America . The Hampshire Down sheep , like the Southdown and Oxford Down breeds , originated in southern England and under much the same conditions of climate and soil . Their ancestors were of two kinds , one with white faces and horns , and the other with dark faces and horns . Southdown blood was mingled with these two , from which came the more improved Hampshire , without horns and with an almost black face , ears , and legs . A man named Humphrey was the most important early improver of these sheep , and later , James Rawlence did much for them . The Hampshire is one of the largest breeds , mature rams often weighing 250 pounds , and ewes nearly 200 pounds . The head is one of the strik-ing features of the breed . The nostrils , lips , and face are // quite black ; the nose is very strong , or Roman in character ; and the ears are dark , very large , and incline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the forehead . The body is large , and the form is of the usual mutton type . Hampshire sheep often seem somewhat coarse of bone and large of limb . The fleece is about 4 inches long , inclines to be coarse and open , and usually does not shear much above 7 pounds with 12 months ' growth . Hampshires have long been popular for early or spring lambs , which are considered of excellent quality . The breed is undoubtedly growing in favor , and during the past few years large importations have been brought to the United States . In the more fertile sections where feed is abundant , the Hampshire makes an excellent showing , as it does in its native home in England . The breed is widely distributed in North and South America ; in Europe and Australia . In the United States , the important flocks are kept mostly in the Northern states east of the Mississippi . The Dorset Horn sheep receives its name from the county of Dorset , in southern England , where it has long been bred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white-faced breeds found in Dorset and Somerset counties . The modern Dorset Horn belongs to the middle-wool class , and is of medium to large size , rains weighing about 225 pounds and ewes 165 . Both sexes have horns , those of the ram at maturity being large and having spiral turns , while those of the ewes are small , and bend in a simple curve around toward the face . The head , ears , and legs have a covering of white hair , and the nostrils are of flesh color . The neck is often short , the back wide , and the body of large capacity , with a fair leg of mutton . Dorsets are popular as lambs , and for mutton , although the quality of the mutton is not of the best . The lambs feed well and lay on flesh // rapidly . As wool producers , this is a breed that should do better . The fleece tends to be short and the weight light , ranging around 6 pounds for average animals . These sheep were first brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Eastern states , the breed can hardly be called popular as yet . The Cheviot sheep comes from the Cheviot Hills in the border country between England and Scotland . Here the land rises into high grass-topped mountains nearly 4000 // feet above the sea . Grass is the universal crop , and here this breed of sheep has been raised for long beyond a century , and gradually improved ( luring the passing years . Today the Cheviot is a med um-wool , fair-sized sheep , the rains weighing around 200 pounds at maturity , and the ewes 150 pounds . This is one of our most beautiful breeds . The head is entirely free of wool , and the face and ears are covered with white hair , with black specks occasionally occurring . The nostrils are black , the nose tends to be a bit Roman , the eye is large and prominent , and the erect ear is usually pricked up as though listening . The Cheviot inclines to be somewhat narrow of back , with a moderate depth of body and fair leg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved . The fleece covers the body to the back of the ears and down to the knees and hocks , the rest of the leg being covered with white hair . The fleece tends to be somewhat open and is usually about 3% inches // long and a year 's growth weighs 6 or 7 pounds . The fiber inclines to be coarser than that of the Shropshire , American breeders using the latter for a standard . Cheviots are very hardy , and in their native home on the mountains rely altogether on grass the entire year . They are active and independent , and do not flock as do other breeds . For this reason the breed has never been suited to the range country . The quality of Cheviot mutton is very superior , having very fine grain , and lacking surplus fat . In mutton carcass contests in the English and Scotch shows , the Cheviot has always held a high place . It is not widely distributed outside of its native home , though found in the United States in New York , Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Suffolk sheep comes from the county after which it is named , in southeastern England . It belongs to the medium-wool class , and is chiefly a mutton breed . The head , ears , and legs of the Suffolk are distinctly black in color . This gives a group of these sheep a very striking appearance . Mature rams weigh about 250 pounds and the ewes 175 pounds . The fleece is not heavy . Suffolks are not extensively bred in England , and but few of them are to be found in America . In fact , they are very rare here , and are not often seen at our sheep shows , neither have they been much advertised in America . The Tunis sheep takes its name from Tunis , in northern Africa , where it is supposed to have originated . In 1799 , General Eaton , United States Consul at Tunis , received a gift of a number of these sheep , two of which survived a voyage to America . Other importations followed this one of General Eaton . These early importations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done to improve them . They are peculiar in having a large , fat // tail , and have often been called " Fat Tailed Sheep . " In recent years , especially since about 1893 , they have been bred in small flocks , in different parts of the country , but especially in Indiana . They are of medium size , with brown , or mottled brown and white faces , and brown legs . The tail is cut off soon after birth , as with other lambs , but the hind parts of the Tunis are somewhat heavier than corresponding parts of other breeds . The Tunis makes an excellent feeder , and lambs of this breed have sold for high prices on the market , and have met with much favor from stock buyers . The fleece is of good quality , averaging about 3 inches long , and frequently containing red or brown fibers . But few of these sheep are to be seen , and fairs generally make no arrangement for them in the premium lists . The Leicester sheep ( pronounced Lester ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here Robert Bakewell , one of the most famous live-stock breeders in English history , developed and improved the native stock into the New Leicester . This was really the first improved breed of sheep known in England , and for a great many years it was extremely popular . Some of these sheep were brought to America , it is said , before the War of the Revolution . In 1800 , New Leicester sheep were known about Philadelphia . In the early part of the nineteenth century , many were imported and sold for high prices . This is a large breed , and belongs to the long , or coarse-wool class . The entire head and ears are covered with white hair , the // wool not growing beyond the back of the head . The ears are large but thin , and are usually carried in an erect position . The nostrils are black , the nose is somewhat prominent , and the eye bold and attractive . The Leicester has a full , wide breast ; broad , flat back ; wide rump ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than deep , and sometimes these sheep appear long of leg . They fatten rapidly , and the rams at maturity weigh around 250 pounds , and the ewes 175 pounds or more . As mutton producers , they are not popular because they lay on too much fat . They require good pastures , and are not the hardiest sheep in the world . This , with their size , accounts for there being so few of them today either in America or elsewhere . The Leicester is the smallest of the long-wool breeds , and has a curly fleece that does not shear very heavily , 7 to 9 pounds being about a year 's growth . Once a popular breed , this is now the least known in America of all the so-called common breeds of sheep . In northern England , in the border country , is an improved form or family known as the Border Leicester , which is the more common type today . This family has a more vigorous constitution and has a clear white face , while the old breed has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its name from the fact that in early times in England these sheep were sheltered in what were called " Cots , " and were pastured on the treeless hills known as " Wolds . " That was in southwest England , where this breed has been kept for centuries . It is written that in 1464 King Edward IV gave permission to transport some Cotswold sheep to Spain . About 100 years or more ago , Cotswold and Leicester flocks were mixed a great deal in blood , by which it is said the former was improved . These sheep were brought to America as early as 1832 , and at one time were very popular , especially in the states east of // Illinois and north of Tennessee . This is a large , long-wooled breed , larger than the Leicester , mature rams weighing from 250 to 275 pounds , and ewes 200 to 225 pounds . The head is somewhat large , and is usually white , though it may be gray or brown in tint . The nose is rather prominent , and the ears incline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forehead of the Cotswold is protected , long curly locks of wool hang down in front , often hiding the eyes . This breed has a broad breast , wide , flat back and broad rump , and shows a greater width than depth of body in the best specimens . While the Cotswold feeds very well , if on good pasture and under favorable conditions , it is not a breed suited to scant pastures . The well-fattened carcass is too large , coarse , and fat for the present demand . The fleece is coarser and the curly locks larger than with the Leicester . Good Cotswold wool is noted for its lustre , having a shiny , glistening quality , rather peculiar to this and the Lincoln breed , and is much valued by the English breeders . A twelve months ' fleece is usually from 8 to 10 inches long , and weighs about . 10 pounds . There are not many Cotswold flocks in the United States , and the breed is more popular in Canada than here . The demands for a smaller sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this breed to become popular in America . // The Lincoln sheep comes from the county of that name on the east coast of England . This is a very old breed , and its improvement began while Bakewell was improving the Leicester . Some Lincoln sheep were brought to America before 1800 , and they have been imported in a small way ever since . This is a large breed , being somewhat larger than the Cotswold , and having much in common with the latter . The head is large , and is gray or white in color , or gray mixed with white . The wool does not cover the entire head , but frequently a small tuft of short locks extends over the forehead . The ears are large and usually have no wool on them . The body form is much like that of the Cotswold , though perhaps deeper of rib . These sheep fatten easily ; but the carcasses get too heavy and have too much external fat for the present-day trade , and so the mutton is not popular . The Lincoln requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too heavy for the hill country . The Lincoln produces a fleece // in long , wavy locks , not so curly but with the same lustre as the Cotswold . A year-old fleece is usually 8 inches long , and may weigh 10 pounds . Lincoln sheep have grown in popularity in their native home on account of the demand for them in the Argentine , where large numbers are kept . Very high prices have been paid for them in England , and in 1906 a ram sold for $7600 , the highest sum on record for the breed . In the United States , Lincolns have gained in favor somewhat , although they can not be regarded as popular . The Romney Marsh or Kent sheep originated in southeast England , in the county of Kent , on the marshes after which the breed is named . The soil here is low , rich , and marshy . These sheep seem especially suited to the local conditions , not suffering from foot rot as do other breeds . The head and legs are white , the back is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These sheep fatten very well on rather limited areas , and make a fair grade of mutton . The fleece weighs about 8 pounds , after a year 's growth , and is in good demand . Large numbers of Romney Marsh sheep are now found in the Argentine , and importations to America on a small scale have just begun , an association for promoting them having been organized at Chicago in December , 1911 . Since it is almost an unknown , untried breed in America , its merits for our conditions remain to be shown . This breed belongs to the middle-wool class . The Black Faced Highland sheep has long been known in the highlands of Scotland , where it grazes on the grass and heather on the highest mountains . In this breed , as in the Dorset , both sexes have horns , those of the ram being spiral and very large and showy at maturity . Highland sheep have black or mottled black and white faces , with no wool beyond the forehead . While these sheep , which are from small to medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their native pastures , they are slow growers , and can not be ranked as feeders , as we view sheep in America . Their chief value lies in their adaptability to rough , hardy conditions , enabling them to live through winters when most other breeds would perish . The fleece is very coarse , long , and open , falling from the body in wavy locks . Some Black Faced Highlanders have extremely coarse wool , with more or less hair about the lower thighs . In disposition they are wild and not so easily handled as other breeds . A few of these sheep have been brought to America , but they are not likely to meet with general favor . The Angora goat derives its name from the district of Angora , in Asia . These goats were first brought to America in 1849 , when the Sultan of Turkey presented some to Dr. J. B. Davis , of South Carolina . Large numbers are found today in the United States , especially in the far Western and Southwestern states . This breed is smaller than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds . The color is pure white . The head has a pair of horns which slope backward and curve widely outward , with some twist in those of the buck , but none in the doe 's . The ears are large , often six inches long or more , and droop downward slightly . The Angora makes very good mutton , but is not valued for this as much as for its fleece , commercially known as mohair . In fair specimens this covers the body in silky , wavy ringlets , which in a year // // should become about 10 inches long . The fleece ought to show a curl quite to the skin . An average weight is about 3 pounds . The better grade of goats produces a mohair that is highly valued for making certain kinds of dress goods , plushes for upholstering work , etc . Angoras have been regarded with favor by some for clearing land of underbrush . They eat the tender twigs and bark , and thus gradually kill the bushes . Goats have been used for this purpose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milch goats are found not only among different breeds developed for milk production , but also among the common goats we are all acquainted with , some of which produce large amounts of milk . There are several breeds in Europe that have been especially developed for milk production . These include the Maltese goat on the island of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea ; the Toggenburg , raised in a valley // by that name in Switzerland ; the Saanan , also a Swiss breed ; and several others . The Maltese is one of the best milkers , and may produce three or four quarts a day . This is a hornless goat , usually white in color . The Toggenburg is rated highly as a milker , often producing four or five quarts a day . This breed is medium brown in color , with white stripes down the face . The Saanan is a white or creamy-colored goat , and is noted for yielding equally well with the Toggenburg . In Europe goats are milked about six months before drying off . There is some demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with invalids and children . In regions outside of America where poor people live in large numbers , goats are commonly kept as a source of milk . The people of these countries value them highly , and they mean as much to them as milch cows mean to us . SOME THINGS YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ABOUT SHEEP The three classes or groups .

CHAPTER V THE BREEDS OF SWINE The wild hog , or wild boar , as it is usually called , of which there are different forms , is found in widely separated parts of the world . The common wild boar from which the improved breeds of today are descended , has been known in Europe since early historical times . This boar was common in England until the time of Henry II , about 1250 . Boar hunting was a. favorite pastime not only with the Romans , but even in the present day , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal sport . In India these animals are hunted extensively by men on horseback , in a sport called " pig sticking : , The wild hog is larger than the domestic one , and is very swift and strong . It is grayish-black in color . The rough skin is covered with short , wooly hair , over which are laid stiff , coarse bristles , especially along the spine . When the boar is angry or excited , these bristles usually stand erect . The head is rather large , long , and rough , and the older animals have short , heavy tusks that curve backward and away from the snout , and which are used in fighting . The wild hog is native to marshy forests . // The early forms of the domestic hog were found among the people of several countries , but more especially Great Britain , southern Europe , and China . Domestic swine were kept in herds in England as far back as 863 years before Christ . It is said that in Greece large droves were cared for by swineherds perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been valued , and the blueskinned , thin-haired , long-legged Neapolitan hog of that country was imported into England perhaps two centuries ago to improve the Berkshire and the coarse white hogs of Great Britain . The Chinese produced a class of white pigs that American and British sailors bought on their travels and brought home , which were used to improve the native stock . Red hogs bred on the west coast of Africa were also brought to America over a century ago , and their blood mingled with our common stock . From this ancestry , after long years of careful breeding , in Great Britain and the United States , have come our present highly improved domestic breeds of swine , of which the following are of interest . The Berkshire hog is a native of England , and receives its name because of its early development in the county of Berks . This is a region of mild temperature in south-central England , well suited to live stock . The Berkshire was known as a breed late in the eighteenth century . Then it was black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had large ears hanging down in front . It was small boned and fattened easily for those times , and frequently weighed over a thousand pounds . It was improved by the use of Neapolitan and Chinese blood in particular . In the middle of the nineteenth century , when it was considered the best breed in England , the Berkshire was still reddish or sandy-colored , with more or less black spots , but was not so large and coarse as those of the previous century . In the // early days , Richard Astly and Lord Barrington did much to improve the Berkshire . This hog was first brought to America in 1823 by an English farmer who lived in New Jersey . Soon after others were imported , and since then large numbers of these pigs have been brought to the United States and Canada . The following are some of the most important features of the Berkshire today . The color is black , with more or less white on the face , feet , and tail . When all four legs , the face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " six white points . " The head is fairly short , the nose slightly curved up or the head " dish faced , " as it is termed , and the ears are erect and pointing slightly forward . The head of the Berkshire is one of its most important breed characters . The size is medium to large , mature boars often weighing 500 pounds , and sows about 400 . Occasionally a boar in show flesh weighs from 700 to 800 pounds . The Berkshire should have a wide , strong back , but not much arched , and // have a thick , full ham . He should have good legs and bone , and should stand well on his feet . The sows farrow medium-sized litters , averaging about eight pigs . Berkshires are fair feeders , and mature just moderately well under ordinary conditions . If not fed too much corn , they make a grade of pork that is unsurpassed . In the corn belt of America , with the feed and care given by Western farmers , the Berkshire may be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain , with corn only a moderate part of the ration , it makes a superior bacon . It has always been a popular breed of swine in England and America , but is not today as extensively kept as the Poland-China or Duroc-Jersey . Yet its merits have long been recognized among the critics of high-class pork . The breed is more widely distributed than any other in North America , being found in about every state and in Canada , and thrives under a wide range of conditions . It is the most popular breed in the East and South . In the West it is in less favor than the Poland-China or Duroc-Jersey . The Poland-China is an American breed of swine that originated in southwestern Ohio in Butler and Warren counties . This is a rolling country , and produces extensive fields of corn , wheat , and grass . There is no better region in America in which to raise hogs . In that section the early settlers kept large numbers of hogs , fed off their corn , and drove the hogs overland to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the Russian , Byfield , Big China , Irish Grazier , and Berkshire , the latter being taken to the state in 1835 . From this mixture , in time came the Poland-China . At first this was a big , coarse , spotted hog , which was rated as a good feeder . The coarse ness was gradually reduced , no doubt the Berkshire blood bringing a very great improvement . // The prominent early breeders of the Poland-China were the Shakers and other farmers in Warren County . John Harkrader did much to improve them , and following him D. M. Magie , of Butler County , no doubt did much for the breed . Pigs of his breeding were widely known at one time as " Magie hogs . " During the last half of the nineteenth century there were many noted herds in Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois . Although the Poland-China was long a black and white spotted breed , a change took place in this respect , and black , with a small amount of white , especially on face and feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color markings the Poland-China much resembles the Berkshire . The head is of medium length , and rather straight in the face ; the ears , which should be somewhat thin , point forward and then break over to form what is called a lop ear . A good head lacks coarseness , and inclines to be wide between the eyes , and is somewhat short , but is never dished . The body form of this breed is quite // distinctly its own , the neck being short , the back wide and frequently strongly arched , and the hams highly developed . These features of head , arch of back , and thickness of hams are Poland-China characteristics . The legs are often fine of bone , and incline to be moderately short , the pigs standing just fairly well on their feet . Mature boars often weigh around 500 pounds , and sows 400 pounds . A boar weighing 700 pounds is of large size . The Poland-China is distinctly of the lard type , and as it puts on fat easily , is noted as a feeder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , and is popular with butchers . The pigs often mature too rapidly , not getting as much growth as they should have for their age . Poland-China sows average smaller litters than any of the other common breeds . This has caused considerable unfavorable comment among farmers . It is an excellent grazing breed and will do well on clover or other succulent green pasture . At the present time there is much discussion among Poland-China breeders regarding type , one group preferring a medium-sized , rather fine-boned , tidy type ; while another set of men demand what they call " big Polands , " which mature into large animals having strong , heavy bone , and make good feeders . The Poland-China has been one of America 's most popular breeds , but at the present day it is not in such universal favor . This is due to lack of size or growthfulness , and to the small size of litter . Where well developed , it is one of our most important breeds for the corn belt . The Duroc-Jersey is a red or sandy-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markings from the coarse red hog brought from Africa , and from sandy or reddish English hogs , such as the Tamworth and sandy Berkshire . Daniel Webster , of Massachusetts , the famous // statesman , imported some red hogs from Portugal in 1852 , which reached America about the time of his death . In New Jersey large red hogs had been grown for many years , where they became known as Jersey Reds . In New York State another variety of red pigs developed that were called Durocs . They were smaller and finer in bone than the Jersey Reds . The blood of these two families was mingled together , from which was developed what we now call the Duroc-Jersey . The present-day Duroc-Jersey is red in color , of which there are various shades , ranging from sandy or light red to a cherry color or dark red . A medium red shade is the most popular . The head has a straight face , and the ears lop over forward . The back is usually slightly arched and the ribs are well sprung . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but are likely to be of good size . The legs carry more bone than do most other breeds , and the hogs stand very well on the feet . The Duroe-Jerseys of a few years ago were inclined to be rather rough , and were frequently heavy of shoulder and had creases more // or less along the sides . They have been greatly improved , however , in recent years . As to size , the boars easily weigh 600 pounds , and the sows 450 . Duroc-Jerseys mature fairly early , and finish off in fattening at 200 to 250 pounds , at six months of age . The breed has not thus far made much of a showing in carcass test competition . The sows seem capable of having large litters , this being the most prolific of the lard-type breeds . Duroc-Jerseys are produced more especially in the Middle-western states where corn is abundant and where they are very popular . Many herds of Poland-China have given way to the Duroc-Jersey . Ohio , Illinois , and Iowa have more of this breed than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets its name from Chester County , Pennsylvania , where it has been bred for a great many years . Claims have been made that the early colonists brought over coarse white pigs to Pennsylvania . In 1820 a Captain Jeffries , of Westchester , Pennsylvania , brought from England some white hogs . Others of the same color also found their way into that section . White hogs were brought to Ohio at an early date , and the Todd family in that state became noted for developing what is known as Todd 's Improved Chester White . During the latter part of the nineteenth century , Mr. L. B. Silver , of Ohio , developed a strain of this breed , which is now known as the Ohio Improved Chester White . This is frequently called the O. I. C. hog . All these different families or blood lines , however , represent the same breed , and differ only in minor details . The Chester White , as its name indicates , is white . Occasionally , small , black spots occur on the skin . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The head rather resembles that of the Poland-China , in that the face is straight and the ears lopped over . The Chester // White is a true lard type of hog . It is a splendid feeder , and when well fattened , carries a very broad , arched back and an excellent ham . The quality of bone in the legs is frequently too fine , and mature animals often stand badly on their feet . The quality of pork is excellent , if one does not object to the large amount of fat . This is one of the large breeds , the O. I. C. hogs weighing very heavy . The usual run of mature boars will weigh around 600 pounds , and the sows 450 pounds . The sows farrow good-sized litters , the breed ranking close to the Duroc-Jersey in this respect . Sows commonly have nine pigs to the litter . Chester Whites are widely distrib uted as a breed in the North , and especially east of the Mississippi . In the South any white breed is unpopular on account of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red or black ones . Ohio and Indiana have many Chester White herds . 08 BEGINNINGS IN ANIMAL HUSBANDRY The Large Yorkshire , called in England the " Large White , " is one of the oldest breeds of swine . Large , coarse , white hogs were bred in eastern and northeastern England before distinctions of types and breeds were known . English writers of over a century ago refer to these large , slowmaturing , narrow-backed coarse white hogs . They were improved by selection and breeding , and this work was done in part by factory hands and laborers in the middle of the last century . Joseph Tuley was prominent in this work . The Large Yorkshire belongs to the bacon class . As grown today , it is the largest of the breeds . Boars at maturity often weigh 700 pounds or more , and sows 500 pounds . The head inclines to be a trifle long , from an American point of view , and is sometimes slightly dished . The ears should be carried erect , but with age they usually // incline forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length and have smooth deep sides , from which bacon may be cut to the best advantage . The back lacks the width and the ham the thickness of the lard type . The legs often appear long for the depth of body . Large Yorkshires do not mature early nor fatten and finish off so readily as do hogs of the lard type . They rather tend to continue their growth until they have attained considerable size before laying on much fat . Even then they will never fatten like our lard hogs , although they will gain as much or more in weight per day . This hog is well adapted for grazing on clover and other green feeds . The quality of the meat is of the very best . More prime bacon is made in Great Britain and Denmark from the Large Yorkshire than from any other breed . The Danes make bacon production a great industry , and they rely on the Large Yorkshire or its grades for this purpose . Large Yorkshire sows are noted for farrowing many pigs in a litter , this being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the leading breed in Great Britain and Denmark . In America , these hogs have been bred for a great many years , but have never been popular in comparison with the hogs of the lard type . They are bred in different sections of the North , especially in Canada , and in the Northwestern states . The Hampshire is a breed of swine that until quite recently was known in sections of the United States as the " Thin Rind . " Where the breed came from originally , no one knows . It did not come from Hampshire , England , as the American Hampshire Association has claimed , for the English people already have a black breed with this name , while the American Hampshire is black , with a white band about the body . For many years " Thin Rind " hogs were bred in a limited way in Kentucky , southern Indiana , and // southern Illinois , and these were of the bacon type . Finally the breed was taken up by men in the corn section of Illinois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thicker kind , more nearly of the lard type . This shows what a corn diet will do in changing the form of an animal . Hampshire swine have straight , aiul rather long faces , and the ears vary from erect to leaning forward . The back is of medium width and the body is usually very smooth along the sides . The hams lack fullness , and the legs tend to be somewhat long . The Hampshire is a good feeder , maturing just fairly early , and is gaining in popularity on account of the favor it has with the butcher . In carcass contests , hogs of this breed or its crosses have usually made an excellent showing . The sows also farrow good-sized litters , a much approved characteristic . This is not a large breed , mature boars weighing around 500 pounds , and sows about 300 . The most notable herds are in Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , and Kentucky . The Tamworth is an old English breed of extreme bacon type . Its native home is central England , where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red or chestnut in color and of varying shades from very light to dark . In size it is large , the boars often weighing 600 pounds and the sows 450 . The head of the Tamworth is undesirably long and straight . The ears at maturity are large and coarse , and lean heavily forward . The body is narrow , the depth of rib is short , the hams lack thickness , and the neck and legs are long . The Tamworth does not fatten easily , and is slow to mature , but produces an excellent grade of bacon . The sows are prolific , having large litters . There are but few of this breed in either England or America , for it is not at all popular on either side of the water . There are a few herds // in the Mississippi Valley , but not enough to attract attention at present . The Cheshire is a medium-sized , white breed of the lard type , mostly bred in New York State , the place of its origin . The breed originated about 1855 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parentage . The Cheshire resembles to quite an extent what the Englishman calls the Middle White , which is really a more compact , broaderbacked , heavier hammed , lardier type than the Large Yorkshire . The Cheshire has a fair size , weighs well , matures early , and feeds and fattens to advantage . The sows farrow good-sized litters in comparison with other breeds . This is one of the least known of American hogs . The Victoria is a white breed of swine , of which there have been two families , one of New York and the other of Indiana origin . The latter , developed by a Mr. Dyer , is the only one at all known today , and but very few herds of this family are in existence . It is a breed quite comparable in appearance // to the Cheshire , and is of the lard type . The few herds kept are mainly for show purposes , to win prizes offered at certain fairs where money can be secured without competition . The Essex is a black breed that originated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fattens very well into an excellent grade of pork . Its principal breed features are the black color , small size , short , slightly dished face , and fine , erect ears . Today the Essex is almost unknown in America , although at one time it met with a fair amount of favor . The Small Yorkshire , known in England as the " Small White , " is of English origin . It was developed early in the nineteenth century , when certain men wished a small , very fat type of pig . This is distinctly a small breed , weighing at maturity about 200 pounds . The head is often short and extremely dished , so much so that easy feeding is impossible . In fancy specimens the head is almost distorted , the ears are erect , the neck short , back very wide , hams short and thick , and legs short . The Small Yorkshire matures early and fattens easily for its size , making a very fat type of pork . The sows are not prolific . The breed has been getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today in America . In fact there is no demand , of commercial importance for it either in this country or abroad . DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT 1 . The appearance of the wild boar ? 2 .

CHAPTER VI ANIMAL TYPE AND ITS IMPORTANCE Farm animals in early days in America were usually eery inferior . The settlers of New England and the older states did not give much attention to live stock . Until we had large cities we had no important live-stock markets . The farmers produced but little more than was needed for the local home sales . In 1830 the first railway was built in America . Before that , people drove live stock long distances to market . As early as 1804 , cattle were driven overland from Ohio to Baltimore to find buyers . West of the Mississippi , large herds of cattle and sheep developed with the settlement of the country . There were great drives of cattle and sheep overland to Kansas City , St. Louis , and other places . It was not till 1865 that the Union Stock Yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest live-stock market in the world . The study of animal form in a large way really began with the selling of stock in the market . At first people were not very particular . An increase in population , however , increased the demand for meat . Then men began to buy from the farmer and to sell animals in the markets . These sellers naturally saw certain differences in their stock . They saw that some beasts served a given purpose better than others , and that some were really worth more than others for the same purpose . So the men who sold in the markets began to use special words to indicate the kind of stock they were talking about . // At first it was only a " good " animal , or a " poor " one . Then other words came into use to show still finer differences . If one looks over the market quotations in the early num bers of the oldest agricultural papers , he will find just such words used in references to the stock . In the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differed in type . The word type , as applied to live stock refers to the special form or purpose of an animal . For example , we say that a horse is of the draft type . This means that he is large and strong , and especially formed to haul heavy loads . As stockmen use this word , however , it does not mean that the animal referred to is perfect . It is simply an expression that the horse or cow or whatever it may be , belongs to a special group in which we find others of various degrees of merit . The word type has not been used many years by stockmen . At the present time , however , all our farm ani mals may be separated into fairly distinct , well-known types . The more simple classifications are as follows : All of our farm animals may be sorted , and each one placed in a group representing one of these types . Each of our breeds of live stock , also , has one or more types . Where there is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of different lines of breeding . At the present time we hear more or less about the American type and the Island type of Jer sey ; the American type being somewhat larger , coarser , plainer-headed , and less symmetrical in udder than the // Island type . Some of the more important features that apply to each of the commonly recognized types are briefly stated in the following descriptions . More might be added to each description , but this is not essential at this time . The draft horse type is massive , showing great power for hauling loads . A horse of this kind should have a large head ; thick , strong neck ; very broad back ; large , deep body ; a long , heavily-muscled hind part ; a set of four strong-boned , muscular legs , and large , well-formed feet . From a front view , such a horse appears thick through from the breast to the tail . From one side he appears short , deep , and compact of body . The smaller sized draft horse is often termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this type weigh from 1500 pounds upwards . The coach or carriage horse type lacks the large size of the drafter , and is of more refined appearance . This horse should have a lean , attractive head ; a long , graceful neck ; a body of medium width and depth , round and nicely turned ; long , smooth , well filled out hind parts ; and a set of wellmuscled , smooth-boned legs , and first class feet . Good form in this type should show some length and smoothness of outline . Coach horses are valued for their ability to walk or trot with a strong , high-acting gait . Horses of this type should weigh 1250 pounds , though many excellent ones weigh more and some less . The light harness or speed horse type is well represented in a medium-sized trotting horse . He shows a small , neatlooking head ; rather thin , moderately long neck ; a narrowness above the shoulders ; the body narrow on top , though it should be of good depth ; the hind end rather muscular ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The entire form shows a muscular development and lightness of limb // that suggests speed . There is much difference in the size of horses of this type , and weights of 900 to 1100 pounds are common . The pony type is really that of a small-sized horse . A pony must not stand over 58 inches high . If he does , he is placed in the horse class . There are a number of different kinds of ponies , and among these may be found types corresponding to those of horses already described . Beef cattle type is rather comparable to the draft type in horses . Cattle of this kind have short , thick necks ; very broad backs ; deep bodies ; long , wide , thick hind parts ; and short legs . The breast is wide , the body thick and deep , and the entire form is compact and smoothly covered with flesh , and well filled out before and behind . Meat production is easily seen to be a feature of this type . Dairy cattle type is the opposite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and muscular neck ; the body is narrow over the shoulders ; the back is not wide but the body has depth ; the hind parts are lean , long , and lacking in flesh ; and the legs are small and thinly muscular . Considerable length and narrowness of body ; a distinct lack of flesh , making for angularity of form ; and a well-developed udder on the female , are special features of this type . The dual or general-purpose cattle type has certain features between the beef and dairy types . The entire body should be less thick and beefy than the beef form , but yet with a fair amount of thickness . The fact is , if a beef cow has a large , fine , shapely udder , and milks well , she may be classed as a dual-purpose animal , because she combines important features of the other two types . Comparing the males , the dual-purpose type is usually longer and narrower of body and more muscular , and not so thick of outline in front or behind , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compared to the draft horse and beef cattle types . It is short and thick of neck ; wide and level of back ; broad and full at chest and at the hind end , and with short , fine-boned legs . A mutton sheep , when fat , is smooth and plump of body , although this smoothness is not usually seen , the body being covered with wool . The fine-wool sheep or Merino type has been compared to the light harness horse and the dairy cow . Its principal purpose is to produce wool . Therefore , we expect to find the body narrow throughout , especially along over the top of the shoulders . This type is muscular , and is rather narrow in front and behind , with thin thighs , lacking the meaty form of the mutton sheep . A fine fleece of wool covered on the outside with more or less dirty brown grease , is seen on this type during much of the year . There // are some fine-wooled sheep that might properly be classed as dual-purpose in type , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . The lard hog type is the one most familiar to Americans . In fair condition of flesh , this hog is noticeable for his compact form , width of back , depth of body , and thickness from breast to hams . Fattened heavily , these hogs sometimes cause one to wonder how such a weight and wealth of flesh can be supported on four small legs . From this broad , smooth , deeply-covered back may be taken thick layers of fat , from which lard is made . This feature of heavy fat production explains why this is called the lard type . The bacon hog type impresses one as having considerable length of body , with a narrowness all through , quite in contrast with the lardy sort . This type should have a long , smooth , deep side to the body , for it is from this part that bacon is obtained . As this hog does not fatten so heavily as the lard type , it produces the best kind of meat for bacon , hence is called the bacon type . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the final result of the development of the modern live-stock trade . As the population grew , the demand for variety and for special purposes increased as never before . There were new uses for horses , and meat animals were sold for a much greater variety of needs than used to be thought possible . So today , we find in the big markets that all types of live stock are grouped into different commercial classes , and then each class is graded according to its merit . For example , here we have the beef type , and within this a number of different classes . One class , known in the larger stock yards as beef cattle , is considered fattened and finished for the butcher , being ready for killing . Another class , known as stockers and feeders , is sold to go back to the farms for // further feeding and fattening . Another class , called butcher stock , consists of fat cows and heifers . Then there are various other classes of stock , such as calves , butcher hogs , Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are included in the different types described . The market grades of live stock are also important . Each class is divided into different grades . Beginning with the best and grading toward the poorest. , t hose grades with meat stock in general , in each class , are as follows : prime , choice , good , medium , common , inferior . Sonic other terms are often used , such as extra prime , good to medium , etc . These words or terms of course are used to express the relative values of animals of the same general class . A prime steer , for example , is one with the largest amount of high-priced meat that the butcher thinks will cut out to the best advanANIMAL // tage . So in the prime animal the buyer looks for a wide back , deep body , thick , meaty hind quarters , and a frame entirely covered with a smooth , thick layer of flesh that will cut up well with as little offal as possible . To ensure-small waste , an animal must be what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone . As one goes down the line of grades , each of these desirable features is less to be seen . Thus an inferior steer would show a small percentage of high-priced cuts , would lack in condition and quality of flesh , and show much waste at slaughter . These grades have the same relative importance in live stock as similar terms have in grading corn or wheat . For comparison , we have dent corn for one type and sugar corn for another . Dent corn we classify into white and yellow , and then grade each of these as No. 1 , No. 2 , No. 3 , etc. , the best being No. 1 , comparable to the term prime in live stock . Put in the form // of a simple diagram , the relation of classes and grades may be shown as follows : All markets do not have exactly the same classes and grades of stock . The larger a market , the more the dealers divide animals into classes and grades , for the widest demand for different kinds here exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the details of class ; but the dealers are quick to recognize the merits of a grade . In some markets we find the people more interested in one kind of stock than another . St. Louis is a noted horse market , Buffalo has long been famous for sheep , and Chicago is the great hog center . These large markets , to a certain extent , require other markets , through a live-stock exchange , to classify and grade animals so that selling values are fairly comparable . In small towns without regular markets , merit in an animal is easily seen by men who buy if they have a fair knowledge of type and its meaning . A knowledge of animal type is necessary if one wishes to understand why some animals serve one purpose and some another . There is a distinct relation of the form of the animal to its special use . The race horse is light of body , narrow but deep of chest , has splendid lung capacity , has slender but strong legs , is very muscular , and is built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the American trotter each has these features well marked , if he is a good specimen of the type . The less he has of these // qualities , the poorer he is as a race horse . A Merino sheep of the A type is rather narrow of back , long of rib , has short , fine legs , is very muscular , and its entire body , including head and legs , is heavily covered in folds with a fine , oily fleece . This type of sheep is formed to produce wool , and it has very little value for meat . The Merino sheep of Spain , of Austraha , or Ohio , if of the A type , are all much the same kind , and each pro-duces wool of the finest sort . The more the inclination to mutton development , the less fine and heavy is the fleece . The hog best suited to lard production has a short neck , wide back , deep sides , large hams , and short legs ; and when well fattened , his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of hog has been bred in America to produce fat in the extreme . The narrower his back , the longer his head , neck , and legs , the less fat meat will he produce . The race horse , the Merino , and the lard type hog , each has been bred to serve its special purpose . The intelligent stockman can tell at a glance whether the animal he is looking at // with the thought of purchase is of a desirable type , whether it will command a high place in the market for value , or if its merits are such as to attract no special interest . The animals which most nearly represent the type are fewest in numbers , and bring the highest prices . One reason why we do not have more animals of the better kind is because farmers and stockmen themselves do not know the importance of type . Before one is capable of becoming a highclass breeder or feeder of live stock , he must understand this subject . He must know the relation of animal form to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KEEP IN MIND 1 .

CHAPTER VII REASONS AND METHODS IN JUDGING LIVE STOCK The study of the relationship of the form of an animal to purpose or function , is a most important duty of the live-stock student who would know farm animals . The word conformation is used in a general reference to the arrangement of the parts of the form to one another . When one says an animal has a good conformation , he simply means that the different parts are well balanced and in harmony with one another . Scientific study has shown that all animals , no matter how odd they may seem , have conformations best suited to their needs and conditions of life . The giraffe , with excessively long neck , feeds on the twigs and leaves of the trees overhead ; the lion , with cat-like form , slyly creeps up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its flesh by means of its powerful jaws and teeth ; the deer , light and most graceful of form , grazes on the grass and tender twigs , and bounds away to safety like a flash , when an enemy appears . Form , size and color , all have their special purposes . Our domestic animals have developed under artificial conditions , over which man has had large control , and this has resulted in our horses , cattle , sheep , and swine becoming creatures of special purpose to a very unusual degree . The great speed of the Thoroughbred , the massive size of the Shire , the excessive milk development of the Holstein-Friesian , and the heavy fleece of the Merino , are all fine examples of this specialpurpose development . The most efficient judge is a student of animal form who at all times can see and understand clearly this re126 BEGINNINGS IN ANIMAL HUSBANDRY lationship of form to purpose . The qualified judge obtains his knowledge in two ways : first , by environment or his home surroundings ; and second , by education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , and is usually a good judge of a beast , and his children inherit the same characteristics . It is second nature for him to measure up in a logical way the weak and strong points in an animal and judge their values . Yet one may become a capable , efficient judge by combination of a natural admiration for animals , with systematic training in judging conformation . The judge at all times should be able to compare the animal before him with what he knows to be the ideal or perfect one . The ability to compare differs in degree . Beginners are not supposed to be as proficient as experienced men , yet time and experience add to one 's qualifications . Even if one lacks to some extent the desirable qualities to be found in a successful judge , he yet may be qualified to pass // in judgment on many occasions where the responsibilities are not the greatest . The judgment of the farmer or stockman should enable him to buy , and to develop his own herd with intelligence . No man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not know the difference in the values of the goods he handles . Then why should not the man who owns stock on the farm be capable of judging relative values among his animals ? A large number of herds of dairy cattle in the United States have been shown to be unprofitable . This is not as a rule due to the kind and amount of food given , but rather to the kind of animals kept . The man who knows how to select the right kind of dairy cows to build up a herd , will find his knowledge a source of profit rather than loss , if he makes good use of the same . Without doubt , hundreds of thousands of dairy cows are unprofitable to their owners . This in itself is a good reason why one should study the relation of form to production . Some animals have important defects that will be noticed only by men who are capable judges . The man who knows nothing of a horse and desires to purchase , if he depends on his own judgment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A side bone or a spavin may be a little thing to see , but its presence on the horse is a distinct imperfection , as one will quickly learn if he tries to sell such an animal . A good judge will discover these imperfections and let another be the purchaser . On every hand men who have given no serious study to qualify themselves for this work are engaged in buying live stock . Some experts make a specialty of buying immature or green animals that give promise of great development . Such men are keen students of animal form . It is not difficult to pass on the merits of a mature horse that stands // before one in perfect condition , ready for the show ring . It is not so easy a matter , however , to go into the pasture and select the best prospect from a bunch of thin yearlings that have had no special care during the warm , dry summer days . The man who goes to the stock-yards to buy a lot of steers for feeding is at the mercy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only to know what kind of cattle he wants , but how to sort them out . The ability to select wisely the green , untrained colt or promising heifer has enabled more than one man to find what we sometimes call " a diamond in the rough . " The greater the number of qualified judges in a community , the better will be the general average of the animals there , and the more valuable from a commercial standpoint . An example of this is seen in England , where good judges of stock are comparatively common . It is interesting to observe , not only that the flocks and herds of that country are much superior to those of any other country , but that the people of the rest of the world for generations have been sending their gold to England to exchange for superior stock . Most of our improved breeds came from Great Britain , and we sent there for them because their merit was seen and appreciated . Suppose the people of Minnesota , for example , were to give special attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of animal form became popular , what would result ? Would there not be a great improvement in the live stock of the state , and would not the wealth of Minnesota be thereby greatly increased ? It most certainly would . A natural interest in farm animals and a love for them are also good reasons for making a careful study of them . The greater the intelligence with which one can look an animal over , the more pleasure he will find in the occupaTHE // tion . No business that offers no incentive to greater effort profits a man much . The production of beautiful and useful animals can not but bring out the best there is in a man 's character ; while at the same time he is rendering a service to his fellow man by producing something that adds to the wealth of the community . We call a man a great artist who paints on canvas a beautiful picture of a magnificent horse , but what shall we say of the man who bred and raised this horse to his perfect state ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The use of the scale of points , or score card , as it is often called , is a first step in the systematic education of the person who desires to learn how to judge live stock . The scale of points was first originated in 1834 , on the Island of Jersey , as has been stated in the Jersey section of the chapter on cattle . Some of the people on the island felt that something should be done to improve their cattle . So they selected two cows , one of which they thought had the nearest perfect form in the front half of the body , while the other was considered to have a perfect rear half . Then they placed a numerical value on each of these best halves of the body , using these two cows to furnish a standard or model with which to judge other cows . They also selected two bulls , and made a score card for the males by the same process . As a result of this unique method , " A scale of points for Jersey cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 points ; and another scale gave the bulls , and the heifers not in milk , 25 points . The people on Jersey made a practical application of the use of the scale by comparing their cattle with these standards . The people derived much benefit from this method of judging , and their cattle were gradually improved . They revised this scale on several occasions , and among other things finally adopted a uniform standard of 100 points for each sex . // Since that time score cards have been much used by men interested in other kinds of stock , and scales of points have been adopted for many of our improved breeds . Not only that , but score cards that apply only to types of stock , such as the draft horse , etc. , are commonly used in agricultural schools and colleges . The following is a copy of a score card for Dorset Horn sheep , that was adopted many years ago . It is given here on account of its concise form and simplicity of expression . An example of the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dorset will serve our purpose . Under " Points scored , " it will be seen that there are ten things to which attention is directed . Each of these ten is given a brief description and a number , which represents what the stockman calls " points . " The number 20 in the column named " Perfect score " means that a Dorset sheep that would exactly answer to the description of general appearance there given would score 20 , or would be perfect in this one respect . If in scoring a sheep one found that in his opinion each part was perfect , then he should give the ful : value in the blank space for " score of animal . " In such a // case the sheep would score 100 , and hence by the scale of points would be perfect . But we have no such animal . It is rarely that one will score 90 points or above , and but few grade as high even as 80 . Suppose you were scoring a Dorset ram . As you examine the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some points . He may carry his head perfectly , the eye may be above criticism , but you may find good reason to criticise the way he stands on his feet . He may not be bad in this respect ; so you give him 17 points for general appearance instead of 20 . Narrow chests are very common , and our Dorset may show by the close way his front legs are placed together , that he lacks a broad , full chest ; so after consideration you give him 7.5 points for this part , which you think is all the credit he should receive . Thus one goes through the list of points and examines the animal systematically and critically , putting down the score from part to part , finally adding the column made , and so getting the total points scored for comparison with the perfect Dorset . The value of the score card lesson is seen in several ways . It trains the student to examine the animal systematically , and impresses on the mind the things that should be considered in studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal as a whole , when character is considered , as it can be studied at no better time , and then the different parts in proper order are carefully examined and rated . So one learns to make first a general examination , to get the balance of parts , the breed character , the size , quality , and condition , and thus measure up the entire animal from the standpoint of appearance . Then comes the detailed study of the head , next the neck , then the breast , and so on . The relationship of each part to the other must be considered so as to get a fair idea of the strong and weak points in the // conformation . Thus systematic study becomes a feature in the use of score cards . The relative value of the parts is also shown in the use of the score card . When a specimen of a breed is being studied , we must remember that we are using a scale of points that has probably been adopted , after much careful study and comparison , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus we get the best measure possible of this breed , and in the scale we learn what parts are most highly regarded , and which least . If we are using a score card such as relates to a fat hog , where breed is not considered , such as is in common use in the agricultural schools , then we find that experts have made this up so as to give the proper values to the different parts of the body . No matter what kind of score card we are using , we may be quite sure that it will give a recognized place and value to each part or group of parts . The various breeds of live stock of much the same type have scales of points that place similar values on what may be called their most important characters . For example , all the dairy cattle score cards give many points to udder , etc. , while those of beef cattle give special credit for breadth and thickness of back . In the use of figures in scoring , it is not well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose the ear is given one point . When so small a number is used to indicate perfection , grades of .25 or .50 or .75 may be used to express the score for that part , and .25 of one per cent is small enough to enable one to express reasonably accurate valuation of the ear . In any event , decimals should be used , and the person scoring should have his column of figures properly arranged , with the decimal points in line . When common fractions // are used , the column of figures do not stand out so clearly in contrast as when decimal fractions are used . The number of points cut is an expression sometimes used when referring to the number of points deducted from perfection . If a part in the perfect score is credited with 10 , and one gives the animal in question 7 points , then we say it has been cut 3 points . Some young judges often write the 3 on the card , instead of the 7 . This is wrong . The points cut should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal should not be regarded too highly . The chief importance of the score card lies in the first lessons in judging , in which the different parts of the animal , their location and relative value are impressed on the mind . However , it is difficult to score an animal satisfactorily under the varying conditions of living flesh . Today we may score an animal 75 , and tomorrow perhaps 71 . The horse we scored yesterday may show more character and style today than he did 24 hours ago . We do not know how to express in cold figures these things we see in the beast before us . We can tell what we see , and if we have two or more animals before us for judgment , it may be an easy thing to place them in their relative order of merit , and with good reasons . Yet these reasons can not be so clearly shown by a column of figures on a score card . On various occasions efforts have been made to judge animals on the basis of the scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan has been carefully tried by many of our best judges , and has very generally proved unsatisfactory , and for the reason given . Today the scoring method is generally discarded , except at poultry shows , and here it has given such dissatisfaction that it has been abolished in many cases . In spite of this criticism , we must not lose // sight of the value of the scale of points as a standard , and what , it may teach . Judging by comparison is the next step to be taken after a few lessons with the score card . This means keeping in one 's mind the essential features of the scale of points , and then studying one or more animals of a kind and placing mental values on the subject or subjects examined . A per-son should make himself familiar with the different types or breeds that he is interested in , and at every opportunity give personal study to individual animals . In a matter of com-parison , it is necessary to keep in mind the important features to be considered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In judging by comparison , it is custom-ary to line up the horses or cattle or sheep side by side , so that they will face in the same direction . Hogs are usually examined in small groups , being kept together with the help of hurdles. * The front feet should stand slightly higher than the hind feet , and there should be space enough for the judge to pass easily between the animals to make his inspec-tion . The center of an open space , with a firm , clean floor , is most desirable . When the heads are lined up , the other parts are in the best positions for inspection . The judge then begins his comparison , first walking around the line of animals and noting from different points of view the general comparison of one with another . The judge must necessarily place first in rank the animal that shows the most breed or type char-acter , that has the most complete balance of parts , the most perfection in various details , and the least number of faults . Emphasis , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under consideration , as weight in heavy draft // horses , udder development with dairy cows , or character of fleece with Merino sheep . For example , most of the scales of points of the breeds of dairy cattle devote about of the total scale emphasizing the size , form , etc. , of the udder , teats , milk veins , and wells . Such special features must be kept in mind . In placing the animals , it becomes a question of prompt decision in sorting out and getting the individuals in one , two , threo order of relativo merit . In large rings at live stock shows , judges often divide the animals into two groups , those that they consider worthy candidates for the prize list , and those that are not . The former group is frequently referred to as " the short feet , " a British expression for the choicer individuals . After the short legit is selected , the other group is usually sent to the stalls . In most compara tive rings , it is not difficult to find quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock farther clown the line , // it becomes necessary to decide on the relative demerits ' rather than the merits of each , and to place highest those that show the fewest undesirable features , a matter in which judges sometimes differ quite a bit . Naturally we do not all see things alike ; and so the judge who does his work carefully and comes to a decision independently of the views of others , is assuming his responsibility in the right way . Keeping notes on animals under comparison is a very good plan . It is customary in classes of stock judged by students , to give each animal a number or letter . These marks may be written on common gummed paper labels , and stuck on the rump . Then on a small card or folded slip of paper , one may give space to each animal under its number , and make brief notes of certain features of importance . These notes are often instructive and suggestive , and aid the young . judge in keeping things in mind . In the student 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take notes in this way , and use them for reference up to the time of appearing before the judges to give their reasons . In discussing an animal being judged , it is desirable to do so briefly and clearly , emphasizing the important things , such as character , general conformation , quality , back , body capacity , chest development , or hind quarters . Much , of course , will depend on the special case in hand . Then if one is describing an animal , or is comparing two or more , the frequent use of such expressions as " he has a good back , " or " she has the best quality , " are to be discouraged . The words good or best in these cases really convey no specific information . Instead , if one says , " He has a long , wide , muscular back ; " or " She excels the other in quality , as seen in a fine , silky coat of hair and a mellow , elastic skin , " then the reasons given will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " best . " // The decision of the judge is always open to criticism . Being only human , we see things from different points of view ; so why should we not differ ? The courts do not all agree ; as is often seen , one court reversing the decision of another . Two things , however , on the part of a judge are most important , one is honesty ; the other is knowledge of his business . If one has these qualifications , and then comes to his decisions with independence , regardless of what anyone else thinks , his work as a judge will as a rule be satisfactory and his judgments will command respect .

CHAPTER VIII THE POINTS OF THE HORSE The exterior parts of the horse are referred to by horsemen in terms not familiar to all . In order to judge intelligently and to use the score card , one should know the location and importance of these special parts . The accompanying illustration makes the location of many of these clear . Without going into too much detail , the following is given regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine and not large for the animal , and be moderately close together . They should be carried in an alert , pleasing manner , indicating good disposition . The poll is the top of the skull just back of the ears . The forehead is the space below the ears and above the eyes . A prominent forehead indicates intelligence . The cheek is the large flat side of the lower jaw . The nose is the more prominent part between eyes and nostrils . A wide nose goes with full breathing capacity . The muzzle includes the nostrils and mouth . Good feeders and animals of strong constitution usually have comparatively large muzzles . The lower jaw should be wide and strong . A narrow jaw bespeaks a weak conformation and inferior feeding character . The crest is the curved line of the neck from the poll to the withers . Males should show some crest , but on the females this feature is not prominent . Stallions frequently have a thick , muscular neck , with a strong crest . This is a sign of masculinity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part where the head and neck join on the lower side . Fullness and heaviness here are objectionable , indicating lack of freedom in breathing . The shoulders extend from the side of the breast , sloping nearly to the top of the back . The upper portion of the // shoulder blade is wide and flat , and should be smoothly laid into the body . Muscles are attached to the shoulder blades and play an important part in ease of motion . A long , sloping , well laid-in shoulder gives the easiest and fastest motion . The withers , the crested , bony prominence between the shoulder tops , is the name given to the spine at this point . The arm is the wider , more muscular part just below the shoulder . The width and covering of muscle indicate its strength . The forearm lies just below the arm and extends to the knee , and should be long and broadly muscular . A thin , narrow forearm is a weak conformation . The knee should be broad in front , straight in position as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be well supported below . // The cannon bone reaches to the joint above the foot , and consists of a round-fronted bone , with two small bones back of it . There are two tendons lying directly back of the cannon bone . The correct shape for the cannon bone is short and somewhat flat , an important feature of a strong conformation . It is especially desirable that the bone below the knee be wide , furnishing a strong support for the knee . The fetlock joint connects with the lower end of the cannon bone . This joint should be straight , deep through , and smooth . The pastern is in the main a combination of two short bones , and should stand at an incline , because it plays an important part in breaking the concussion which takes place when the horse is in motion . The shorter and more upright the pastern the more liable is the horse to have bone diseases and a hard gait . Carriage horses should have the pastern show a slope of about 45 degrees . Drafters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastern is sometimes too long , and lacks the strength to support the body correctly . The foot consists of several parts . The hoof proper is a very tough , horny bone , and in form should be rather round , although the hind foot is never as round as is the one in front . The top of the hoof should not be narrow and small , but should have some fullness compared with the lower part . The back part of the hoof makes a sudden turn forward underneath , forming a V-shaped portion known as the frog . This frog is somewhat elastic , and acts as a buffer on the surface of the ground , which under natural conditions it should just touch . The frog should never be pared by the blacksmith , excepting to remove tag ends or parts grown out of shape . A good frog saves the foot hard punishment on the road . The sole of the foot is the part between the outer // wall of the hoof and the frog . This part is slightly concave or arched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heel , and this should be neither low nor high , having only enough height above the ground to give the foot strength and protection . The heel should have about the same slope as the front part of the hoof , which is about 45 to 50 degrees . The hoof should be free of cracks and not be brittle , defects that are all too common . Most people prefer a dark-col-ored hoof , believing it tougher and less liable to break than a white one . The heart girth or chest is the circumference of the body just back of the shoulders . A deep , full chest indicates vigor and constitution . A de-pression back of t he shoulders shows lack of room for those vital or-gans , the heart and lungs . The back should be straight and short , with the ribs widely arched . A considerable depression or sag of the back is a sign of weakness . The back extends from the lower end of the // withers to a wide , somewhat level part called the loin . The loin is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the last rib and the point of the hips . The strength of back lies in the loin , which should be short , wide , and heavily muscled . A long , narrow loin is a sign of weakness and inability to stand up under severe work . The coupling is the space between the point of hip and the last rib . A short coupling indicates endurance . The hip is seen as a point more or less prominent on each side , just back of the coupling . The hips on mature females are usually more prominent than on the males . Symmetry of form calls for the hip to be nicely laid in , with a smooth covering of flesh . There are other good reasons for not having a wide placing of the points of the hips , which need not be discussed here . The croup , or rump , is the long , muscular development from the point of the hips to the setting on of tail . Great power and strength exist here , and so it is important that this part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep rump is unsightly , and a narrow one has less muscle than a wide one equally long . Length here is also desirable as affecting speed . The thigh extends from the rump down to the large joint below , known as the hock . This part should be very muscular , and wide from the lower side of the croup to a joint below called the stifle . The upper part of the thigh is wide , while the lower portion , often termed the gaskin , is long , narrow , and very muscular . From the point of the hip to the hock one should look for considerable length . The stifle joint is located in the front part of the thigh close to the body . This is comparable to the knee in the human skeleton . Some of the strongest muscles of the upper thigh are connected with this joint by means of tendons. // The flanks refer to the parts where the legs join with the body . The front flank is just back of the arm , while the hind flank is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A low , full flank goes with large body capacity and constitutional vigor . Horses high in the flanks usually appear long of leg . The hock is the large joint about half way down the hind leg . This is a very important part , and should be wide in front , deep through from front to rear , and should be lean rather than fleshy . Large , heavy horses tend to have what are known as thick , meaty hocks . There are small bones in this joint , and they are most important in reducing the concussion which comes from the severe use thrown on the hind legs when in action . The general features of the cannon , fetlock joint , pastern , and foot in the front legs are essentially the same as those behind . However , the rear cannon bone is flatter and deeper from front to rear , and usually shows somewhat more length . The hind pasterns also are usually less sloping than those in front . The position of the horse at rest should show the feet squarely placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated by the position of the cannon bones . Horses ' legs may take a variety of positions . Sometimes they toe in , or perhaps toe out . In such cases the legs are not straight . If the hocks nearly touch , then the hind feet usually point out ; while if there is considerable width between the hocks , then the toes point in . A wide or bowed hock shows a very weak conformation , worse than one that is too close . Horsemen prefer the hocks to come close together rather than to be spread wide apart , for the closer position gives a better hock action . // The horse at the walk should follow a straight line on being led , not swinging the body to one side . The feet should be raised with snap , and carried forward and upward , and the knee and hock flexed , as it is termed . In this flexing movement , the foot describes a half circle before it strikes the ground . Heavy horses tend to swing the feet to one side , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the feet in motion come too close together , the horse is said to " interfere , " that is , the hoof of one foot will strike the ankle of another and may cause lameness . As the foot is raised , a person standing behind a horse in motion should be able to see the glisten of the shoe and note the carriage of the foot . // The movement of the feet in the trot is such that diagonally opposite ones are moved in the same direction ; that is , the front right and left hind feet move forward together . The trot is known as a diagonal gait . The movement of the feet in the pace shows the two legs on one side of the body in like motion at the same time . The pace is a side gait , and pacing horses are sometimes called " side-wheelers . " The action of the horse is highly valued . A heavy draft horse that has a rapid and true walk will accomplish much more work than will the horse of slow movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but when moving faster than a walk , a horse should carry his legs with spirit and ease . A premium is always placed on the action of the carriage horse for the city coach trade , high knee and hock action being especially valued . The roadster or trotter of first class must have a long , active , true stride , such as always goes with superior speed . Quality in the horse is shown in the hair , the skin and bone , and in the general appearance . A fine , silky coat of hair ; a thin , mellow skin ; and fineness of bone , are features that show refinement , or quality . Coarseness of head ; large ears for the size of the body ; wiry , heavy hair ; and coarseness of bone , indicate lack of endurance and weakness of constitution . A large , coarse bone is more porous and less strong in proportion than one that is finer and smaller . Fineness and softness of skin is an indication of good secretions and healthy internal organs . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamina , or power of endurance . The disposition of the horse is usually seen in the prominence and character of the eye and the carriage of the ears . If the eye is prominent and the whites clear , and the expresTHE // sion pleasant , the disposition will probably be good . A small , sunken eye indicates a bad temper . Ears that are carried erect ' or that point forward rather than backward show a good temper . If the ears lop about , there is evidence of laziness . The height of the horse is usually expressed in " hands , " a hand being equal to 4 inches . The height is measured in a vertical line from the ground to the top of the withers . A horse 16 hands high would stand 64 inches from the ground . The weight of the horse , in a degree , indicates to what class he belongs . A mature horse weighing 2000 pounds would naturally be a heavy draft animal . If weighing 1000 pounds , it might be one of sev-eral types . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight is looked upon as of the most importance . The age of the horse is estimated by an examination of the teeth . It requires some experience to be quick in recognizing the age , which may be determined with fair accuracy up to eight years , after which it becomes a matter of guess work . The following items are the important guides to age . The colt 's teeth . Seven or eight days after birth , two incisor teeth appear at the front and middle of both upper and lower jaws . In the course of five or six weeks , two more teeth appear in each jaw , one tooth coming in on either side of the two already present . // Some time between the sixth and ninth month , two more ap-pear , one by the side of each outer tooth . These six pairs are called nippers . They are the milk teeth , and are only tern-porary . They are not all equally level with one another at first , but in the course of 12 months or so they become uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very hard , white enamel . This covers a hard , ivory-like bone , while at the center is a soft , bony substance which more easily wears away , but is constantly renewed . The ends of the teeth have a ridged cutting surface , forming at the centers small depressions , or " cups , " marks by which the age is determined . The cups in the central pair of nippers at first are dark of center ; in the second year they begin to wear light in color , and these cups become smaller than those of the other four . Similar changes follow in order in the other pairs . At three years of age , per-inanent incisors or nippers be-gin to appear . These teeth are larger than the first ones , which were small but suited to the mouth of the colt . The first or // central pair of temporary teeth is pushed out or aside by a pair of larger , permanent ones . At four years , the second pair of nippers in each jaw of the colt gives way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last pair of colt 's teeth in each jaw is re-placed by permanent teeth . At this age , what are called tusks appear in the mouth of the male . These teeth have roundish points , and there are two in each jaw , one on a side , a short distance back of the front teeth . After the fifth year the age of the horse is de-termined by the appearance of the wearing surface of the teeth , each tooth having its age sur-face . At six years , the cups of the two central teeth are worn off . At seven , the second pair shows the worn surface ; and At eight , all the teeth have been worn about level , and the mouth mark loses its value . The six permanent teeth in each jaw at first meet each other in much the same position , the ends of the teeth coming full head on . As age increases , the teeth gradually take a more inclined or slanting out position in each jaw , so that they come together at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn off at the surface , and are longer than the younger teeth . In horses from 12 to 16 years of age , the ends of the teeth become somewhat three-sided . The following unique poem may assist some in keeping clear in mind the changes which take place in the mouth , by which the age of the horse may be decided . THE AGE OF THIE HORSE IN VERSE. * Two middle nippers you behold Before the colt is two weeks old ; Before eight weeks two more will come ; Eight months , the " corners " cut the gum . The outside grooves will disappear From middle two in just one year ; In two years , from the second pair ; In three , the " corners , " too , are bare . At two , the middle nippers drop ; At three , the second pair ca n't stop ; When four years old the third pair goes ; At five , a full new set he shows . The deep black spots will pass from view , At six years , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; At eight , the spots each " corner " clears . From middle nippers , upper jaw , At nine the black spots will withdraw ; The second pair at ten are white ; Eleven finds the " corners " light . // As time goes on the horsemen know The oval teeth three-sided grow ; They longer get , project before Till twenty , when we know no more . The soundness of the horse is regarded as very important . Many unsound horses are bought by men who think them sound . Then when these men attempt to sell , these horses often show a great loss on the purchase price . Therefore , if one is to be a capable judge , he must be able to distinguish cases of unsoundness . This is not always easily done . Some forms are not clearly apparent until well established . If the respiration is not good , this is brought out in some form of work , such as trotting , hauling a load , etc . In the sale markets , horses are hitched to wagons with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite an exertion in moving along . Heaves is an unsoundness or trouble of the lungs which is brought on through dusty feed , bad ventilation , or indigestion . Broken wind or asthma is apparently much the same thing . When the horse expels wind from the chest , he lacks the muscular contraction of the lungs that attains with the sound animal , and makes a wheezing noise , which is sometimes very loud . Roaring is another disease in which the horse makes a loud noise during breathing . The larynx is affected , but not the lungs . This is a paralysis of the nerves and muscles of the parts , which results in the noise in breathing . Roaring is manifested during exertion , yet a horse may be a roarer and be driven some distance without making much if any noise . The disease is one of progression , and gradually becomes worse . Roaring has always been considered incurable until recently . Dr. Williams of Cornell University // discovered a method of operating by which the roaring may be cured , and what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in America and Europe . Spavin , also frequently called bone spavin , is usually found at the lower part of the hock joint , on the inside of the leg . It is caused by a strain or injury , and consists of an accumulation of bony matter at the joint . This is shown in a more or less thickening of the part , as compared with the sound hock . The occurrence of the spavin is most easily seen by standing directly back of the horse and viewing the parts from the rear . The spavin causes lameness and a stiff gait , and is regarded as a serious unsoundness . It greatly damages the sale value and is more common on light than on heavy horses . Curb is also an unsoundness of the hock . When sound , the back of the hock , slightly below the point , has rather a perpendicular or straight edge . If a curb exists , there is a bulging or outward curve a short distance below the point , that may be seen by standing opposite the hind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tend to round out at this part of the leg , are said to have a curby conformation . Curbs // are due to strains , and while an unsoundness , are not of the more serious kind . Bog spavin is a small , round form of tumor , located in the front and inner side of the hock . If pressed , it may appear on the outside and rear part of the hock . Thoroughpin is a swelling in the rear part of the hock at its thinnest point . Here , under ordinary conditions , the hock is curved to form grace ful outlines with a pronounced depression . If thoroughpin occurs , a swelling will be no ticeable on each side of the hock at this point . Bog spav ins , thoroughpins , or a puffed condition about the hocks , are seen most frequently on large , heavy horses that have what are called thick , meaty hocks . Horse dealers are inclined to refer to these as little puffs that will disappear with work , and so minimize their import- anc e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stable , frequently swell in the lower half of the legs , a condition that exercise removes , but bogs . and thoroughpins are distinct unsoundnesses that exercise will not drive away , and that injure the sale value of the horse . Sidebone is found in the rear part of the front foot on the coffin bone at the crown or top of the hoof. it is clue to the hardening of cartilages , whereby they take on a bony character , which causes lameness . In well-defined cases , the sidebones appear as hard projections just beneath the skin , and can be plainly seen or felt . In their early stages , sidebones are not so easily discovered , and one may buy a horse that appears sound , yet in a short time the trouble will become noticeable . Sidebones are most common on draft horses , and on those used on hard roads or pavements . This unsoundness is severely discriminated against a n d shrewd men will not buy horses that have sidebones . Ring bone is a bony deposit which in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the pastern . On old horses this bony enlargement sometimes becomes very conspicuous . It may be due to hard labor , strains , bruises , etc. , and if well developed , causes serious lameness. // Splint is a bony projection or roughness usually found on the inside of the splint bone , which lies close in with the cannon bone of the front leg , and is commonly regarded as the cannon . This is not considered a distinct unsoundness , although very common and referred to quite frequently . Splints sometimes appear on young horses and then disappear with the mature development of the animals . Splints may be easily seen while standing in front and looking at the inside of the legs . Quarter-crack is a splitting or cracking of the bony part of the hoof , usually of the front foot . This crack may extend the entire length of the hoof , and be so bad as to require fastening the parts with metal clamps or nails to keep the cracks from extending or widening . Horses with brittle or soft hoofs are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to break through the lower part of the foot and cause serious injury and lameness . Toe-crack is similar to quarter-crack , but is usually on the hind foot , in the front part , and often extends the length of the hoof . Founder , or laminitis , as the veterinarian calls it , is an unsoundness of the feet . It is due to an inflammation of the delicate tissues within the hoof , and is usually found in the front feet . It is caused by a variety of conditions , such as overwork , overfeeding , exposure , etc . If well established it is incurable and causes the horse much suffering . The common symptom of this trouble is lameness , which is // often very severe . When standing , the horse as a rule reaches the feet somewhat forward , resting the weight upon the heel . The hind feet , which carry most of the weight , are placed well under the body . The more perfect . the foot , the less liable the horse is to suffer from founder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoof walls , or a foot that is quite contracted , is liable to be affected with this trouble . Navicular disease is an inflammation that also occurs in the foot , affecting the sesamoid sheath and the navicular bone . This occurs most commonly with race horses , and those having great knee action . Usually but one forefoot suffers from the disease , which is caused by concussion and shock to the affected parts . The early stages of the disease are not commonly noticed . Attention is first directed to the " pointing " of the foot , which is extended forward , the weight resting on the toe , and as the trouble develops , lameness is noticed , which increases with use of the horse . But few cases of navicular disease recover . Cocked ankle , or knuckling , is a partial dislocation of the pastern or fetlock joint , in which case the pastern becomes more perpendicular than usual , throwing the joint forward out of natural position . This is not always an unsoundness , but is a defect , in that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of unsoundness that are not especially common . There are also some diseases that become chronic as external features , such as fistula and poll evil . These two are manifested by swellings and finally running sores at the withers or poll , as the case may be . The unsoundnesses described , however , are those of common occurrence , and are most likely to attract attention . IN DISCUSSING THE POINTS OF THE HORSE 1 .
