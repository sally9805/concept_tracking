THE year 1880-81 was marked for me by three other events , each quite different in character : Monsieur Renan 's visit to Oxford , my husband 's acceptance of a post on the staff of the Time ' , and a visit that we paid to the W. E. Forsters in Ireland , in December , 188o , at almost the blackest moment of the Irish land war . Of Renan 's visit I have mingled memories ? all pleasant , but some touched with comedy . Gentle Madame Renan came with her famous husband and soon won all hearts . Oxford in mid-April was then , as always , a dream of gardens just coming into leaf , enchasing buildings of a silvery gray , and full to the brim of the old walls with the early blossom ? almond , or cherry , or flowering currant . M. Renan was delivering the Hibbert Lectures in London , and came down to stay for a long week-end with our neighbors , the Max Mufflers . Doctor Hatch was then preaching the Bampton Lectures , that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Latin organization , and M. Renan attended one of them . He had himself just published Marc Aurile , and Doctor Hatch 's subject was closely akin to that of his own Hibbert Lectures . I remember seeing him emerge from the porch of St. Mary 's , his strange , triangular face pleasantly dreamy . You were interested ? " said some one at his elbow . " Mais oui ! " said M. Renan , smiling . He might have given my lecture , and I might have preached his sermon ! ( Nous aurions ( 112 changer de cahiers ! ) " Renan in the pulpit of Pusey , Newman , and Burgon would indeed have been a spectacle of horror to the ecclesiastical mind . But in truth , Renan , personally , was not the enemy of any Church , least of allof the great Church which had trained his youth . He was a born scholar and thinker , in temper extremely gentle and scrupulous , and with a sense of humor , or rather irony , not unlike that of Anatole France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course a streak in him of that French paradox , that impish trifling with things fundamental , which the English temperament dislikes and resents ; as when he wrote the Abbesse de Jouarre , or threw out the whimsical doubt in a passing sentence of one of his latest books , whether , after all , his life of labor and self-denial had been worth white , and whether , if he had lived the life of an Epicurean , like Theophile Gautier , he might not have got more out of existence . " He was really a good and great man , " said Jowett , writing after his death . But " I regret that he wrote at the end of his life that strange drama about the Reign of Terror . " There are probably few of M. Renan 's English admirers who do not share the regret . At the same time , there , for all to see , is the long life as it was lived ? of the ever-toiling scholar and thinker , the devoted husband and brother , the admirable friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Renan was at his best . He was in love ? apparently ! ? with Oxford , and his charm , his gaiety , played over all that we presented to him . I recall him in Wadham Gardens , wandering in a kind of happy dream ? " Ah , if one had only such places as this to work in , in France ! What pages ? and how perfect ! ? one might write here ! " Or again , in a different scene , at luncheon in our little home in the parks , when Oxford was showing , even more than usual , its piteous inability to talk decently to the great man in his own tongue . It is true that he neither understood ours in conversa-tion ? nor spoke a word of it . But that did not at all mitigate our own shame ? and surprise ! For at that time , in the Oxford world proper , everybody , probably , read French habitually , and many of us thought we spoke it . But a mocking spirit suggested to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical tutor ? the wish to enlighten M. Renan as to how the university was governed , the intricacies of Convocation , and Congregation , the Hebdomadal Council , and all the rest . The other persons present fell at first breathlessly silent , watching the gallant but quite hopeless adventure . Then , in sheer sympathy with a good man in trouble , one after another , we rushed in to help , till the constitution of the university must have seemed indeed a thing of Bedlam to our smiling but much-puzzled guest ; and all our cheeks were red . But M. Renan cut the knot . Since he could not understand , and we could not explain , what the constitution of Oxford University was , he suavely took up his parable as to what it should be . He drew the ideal university , as it were , in the clouds ; clothing his notion , as he went on , in so much fun and so much charm , that his English hosts more than forgot their own defeat in his success . The little scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French genius for conversation . Throw what obstacles in the way you please ; it will surmount them all . To judge , however , from M. Renan 's letter to his friend , M. Berthelot , written from Oxford on this occasion , he was not as much pleased as we thought he was , or as we were with him . He says : " Oxford is the strangest relic of the past , the type of living death . Each of its colleges is a terrestrial paradise , but a deserted Paradise . " ( I see from the date that the visit took place in the Easter vacation ! ) And he describes the education given as " purely humanist and clerical , " administered to " a gilded youth that comes to chapel in surplices . There is an almost total absence of the scientific spirit . " And the letter further contains a mild gibe at All Souls , for its absentee Fellows . " The lawns are admirable , and the Fellows eat up the college revenues , hunting andshooting up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind host , Max Midler . " At that moment the list of the Fellows of All Souls contained the names of men who have since rendered high service to England ; and M. Renan was probably not aware that the drastic reforms introduced by the great University Commission of the sixties had made the sarcastic picture he drew for his friend not a little absurd . No doubt a French intellectual will always feel that the mind-life of England is running at a slower pace than that of his own country . But if Renan had worked for a year in Oxford , the old priestly training in him , based so solidly on the moral discipline of St. Nicholas and St. Sulpice , would have become aware of much else . I like to think that he would have echoed the verdict on the Oxford undergraduate of a young and brilliant Frenchman , who spent much time at Oxford , fifteen years later . " There is no intellectual e'lite here so strong as ours ( i.e. , among French students ) , " says M. Jacques Bardoux ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a much rarer thing , a moral elite . . . What an environment !  - -  and how full is this education of moral stimulus and force ! " Has not every word of this been justified to the letter by the experience of the war ? After the present cataclysm , we know very well that we shall have to improve and extend our higher education . Only , in building up the new , let us not lose grip upon the irreplaceable things of the old ! It was not long after M. Renan 's visit that , just as we were starting for a walk on a May afternoon , the second post brought my husband a letter which changed our lives . It contained a suggestion that my husband should take work on the Times as a member of the editorial staff . We read it in amazement , and walked on to Port Meadow . It was a fine day . The river was alive with boats ; in the distance rose the towers and domes of the beautiful city ; and the Oxford magic blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the dear Oxford life ! All the drawbacks and difficulties of the new proposal presented themselves ; hardly any of the advantages . As for me , I was convinced we must and should refuse , and I went to sleep in that conviction . But the mind travels far ? and mysteriously ? in sleep . With the first words that my husband and I exchanged in the morning , we knew that the die was cast and that our Oxford days were over . The rest of the year was spent in preparation for the change ; and in the Christmas vacation of 1880-81 my husband wrote his first " leaders " for the paper . But before that we went for a week to Dublin to stay with the William Forsters , at the Chief Secretary 's lodge . A visit I shall never forget ! It was the first of the two terrible winters my uncle spent in Dublin as Chief Secretary , and the struggle with the Land League was at its height . Boycotting , murder , and outrage filled the news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to renew the Peace Preservation Act when they took office in 188o ? a disastrous but perhaps intelligible mistake ? the Chief Secretary , when we reached Dublin , was facing an agrarian and political revolt of the most determined character , with nothing but the ordinary law , resting on juries and evidence as his instrument ? an instrument which the Irish Land League had taken good care to shatter in his hands . Threatening letters were flowing in upon both himself and my godmother ; and the tragedy of 1882 , with the revelations , as to the various murder plots of the time , to which it led , were soon to show how terrible was the state of the country , and how real the danger in which he personally stood . But none the less social life had to he carried on ; entertainments had to be given ; and we went over , if I remember right , for the two Christmas halls to be given by the Chief Secretary and the Viceroy . On myself , fresh from the quiet Oxford life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , produced an overwhelming impression . And the dancing , the visits and dinner parties , the keeping up of a brave social show ? quite necessary and right under the circumstanceslbegan to seem to me , after only twenty-four hours , like some pageant seen under a thunder-cloud . Mr. Forster had then little more than five years to live . He was on the threshold of the second year of his Chief-Secretaryship . During the first year he had faced the difficulties of the position in Ireland , and the perpetual attacks of the Irish Members in Parliament , with a physical nerve and power still intact . I can recall my hot sympathy with him during 188o , while with one hand he was fighting the Land League , and with the other ? a fact never sufficiently recognized ? giving all the help he could to the preparation of Mr. Gladstone 's second Land Act . The position then was hard , sometimes heart-breaking ; but it was not beyond his strength . The second year wore him out . The unlucky Protection Act ? an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , Mr. Bright and Mr. Chamberlain , were every whit as responsible as himself ? imposed a personal responsibility on him , for every case out of the many hundreds of prisoners made under the Act , which was in itself intolerable . And while he tried in front to dam back the flood of Irish outrage , English Radicalism at his heels was making the task impossible . What he was doing satisfied nobody , least of all himself . The official and land-owning classes in Ireland , the Tories in England , raged because , in spite of the Act , outrage continued ; the Radical party in the country which had always disliked the Protection Act , and the Radical press were on the lookout for every sign of failure ; while the daily struggle in the House with the Irish Members while Parliament was sitting , in addition to all the rest , exhausted a man on whose devotion important executive acts , dealing really with a state of revolution , were always depending . All through the second year , as it seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous and inso ? uhle problem , to which no one , through nearly another forty years ? not Mr. Gladstone with his Home Rule Acts , as we were soon to see , nor Mr. Balfour 's wonderful brain-power sustained by a unique temperament ? was to find the true key . It is not found , yet twenty years of Tory government practically solved the Land Question , and agricultural Ireland has begun to be rich . But a recent year has seen an Irish rebellion ; a Home Rule Act has at last , after thirty years , been passed , and is dead before its birth ; while an Irish Convention has been sitting . Thirty-six. years have gone since my husband and I walked with William Forster through the Phenix Park , over the spot where , a year later , Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke were murdered . And still the ) Eschylean " curse " goes on , from life to life , from Government to Government . When will the Furies of the past become the " kind goddesses " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shrine of reconciliation ? With such thoughts one looks back over the past . Amid its darkness I shall always see the pathetic figure of William Forster , the man of Quaker training , at grips with murder and anarchy ; the man of sensitive , affectionate spirit , weighed down under the weight of rival appeals , now from the side of democracy , now from the side of authority ; bitterly conscious , as an English Radical , of his breach with Radicalism ; still more keenly sensitive , as a man responsible for the executive government of a country in which the foundations had given way , to that atmosphere of cruelty and wrong in which the Land League moved , and to the hideous instances poured every day into his ears . He bore it for more than a year after we saw him in Ireland at his thankless work . It was our first year in London , and we were near enough to watch closely the progress of his fight . But it was a fight not to he won . The spring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May 6th by the Phoenix Park murders and the long and gradual disintegration of the powerful Ministry of 188o , culminating in the Home Rule disaster of 1886 . Mr. Churchill in his Life of his father , Lord Randolph , says of Mr. Forster 's resignation , " he passed out of the Ministry to become during the rest of Parliament one of its most dangerous and vigilant opponents . " The physical change indeed , caused by the Irish struggle , whichwas for a time painfully evident to the House of Commons , seemed to pass away with rest and travel . The famous attack he made on Parnell in the spring of 1883 , as the responsible promoter of outrage in Ireland , showed certainly no lack of power ? rather an increase . I happened to be in the House the following day , to hear Parnell 's reply . I remember my uncle 's taking me down with him to the House , and begging a seat for me in Lady Brand 's gallery . The figure of Parnell ? the speech , nonchalant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind ? his hands in the pockets of his coat , and the tense silence of the crowded House , remain vividly with me . Afterward my uncle came upstairs for me , and we descended toward Palace Yard through various side passages . Suddenly a door , communicating with the House itself , opened in front of us , and Parnell came out . My uncle pressed my arm and we held back while Parnell passed by , somberly absorbed , without betraying by the smallest movement or gesture any recognition of my uncle 's identity . In other matters ? Gordon , Imperial Federation , the chairmanship of the Manchester Ship Canal , and the rest ? William Forster showed , up till 1885 , what his friends fondly hoped was the promise of renewed and successful work . But in reality he never recovered from Ireland . The mark of those two years had gone too deep . He died in April , 1886 , just before the introduction of the Home Rule bill , and I have always on the retina of the inward eye the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the funeral service . The flower-heaped coffin had gone through . My aunt and her adopted children followed it . After them came Mr. Gladstone , with other members of the Cabinet . At the threshold Mr. Gladstone moved forward and took my aunt 's hand , bending over it bareheaded . Then she went with the dead , and he turned away , toward the House of Commons . To those of us who remembered what the relations of the dead and the living had once been , and how they had parted , there was a peculiar pathos in the little scene . A few days later Mr. Gladstone brought in the Home Rule bill , and the two stormy months followed , which ended in the Liberal Unionist split , and the defeat of the bill on June 7th by 3o votes , and were the prelude to the twenty years of Tory Government . If William Forster had lived , there is no doubt that he must have played a leading part in the struggles of that and subsequent sessions. in 1888 Mr. Balfour said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part played by Forster in those two terrible years : " Forster 's loss was irreparable to us ( i.e. , to the Unionist party ) . If he and Fawcett had lived , Gladstone could not have made head . " It has been , I think , widely recognized by men of all parties in recent years that personally William Forster bore the worst of the Irish day , whatever men may think of his policy . But , after all , it is not for this , primarily , that England remembers him . His monument is everywhere ? in the schools that have covered the land since 1870 , when his great Act was passed . And if I have caught a little picture from the moment when death forestalled that imminent parting between himself and the great leader he had so long admired and followed which life could only have broadened , let me match it by an earlier and happier one , borrowed from a letter of my own , written to my father when I was eighteen , and describing the bringing in of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . Gladstone pulled him down with a sore of hug of delight . It is certain that he is very much pleased with the bill , and , what is of great consequence , that he thinks the Government has throughout been treated with great consideration in it . After the debate he said to Uncle F. , " Well , I think our pair of ponies will run through together ! " Gladstone 's " pony " was of course the Land Act of 1870 . The few recollections of William Forster that I have put together in a preceding chapter lead naturally , perhaps , to some account of my friendship and working relations at this time with Forster 's most formidable critic in the political press -- Mr . John Morley , now Lord Morley . It was in the late seventies , I think , that I first saw Mr. Morley . I sat next him at the Master 's dinner-table , and the impression he made upon me was immediate and lasting . I trust that a great man , to whom I owed much , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary comradeship which followed ? My husband and I on the way home compared notes . We felt that we had just been in contact with a singular personal power combined with a moral atmosphere which had in it both the bracing and the charm that , physically , are the gift of the heights . The " austere " Radical , indeed , was there . With regard to certain vices and corruptions of our life and politics , my uncle might as well have used Mr. NIorley 's name as that of Mr. Frederic Harrison , when he presented us in " Friendship 's Garland " with Mr. Harrison setting up a guillotine in his back garden . There was something ? there always has been something ? of the somber intensity of the prophet in Mr. Morley . Burke drew , as we all remember , an ineffaceable picture of Marie Antoinette 's young beauty as he saw it in 1774 , contrasting it with the " abominable scenes " amid which she perished . Mr. Morley 's comment is : But did not the protracted agonies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paine asked , were men to weep over the plumage and forget the dying bird ? . . It was no idle abstraction , no metaphysical right of man , for which the French cried , but only the practical right of being permitted , by their own toil , to save themselves and the little ones about their knees from hunger and cruel death . The cry of the poor , indeed , against the rich and tyrannous , the cry of the persecuted Liberal , whether in politics or religion , against his oppressors ? it used to seem to me , in the eighties , when , to my pleasure and profit , I was often associated with Mr. Morley , that in his passionate response to this double appeal lay the driving impulse of his life and the secret of his power over others . While we were still at Oxford he had brought out most of his books : ? On Compromise ? the fierce and famous manifesto of 1874 ? and the well-known volumes on the encyclopedists , Voltaire , Rousseau , Diderot . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pattison 's college and a follower of John Stuart Mill . The will to look the grim-mest facts of life and destiny in the face , without flinching , and the resolve to accept no " anodyne " from religion or philosophy , combined with a ceaseless interest in the human fate and the human story , and a natural , inbred sympathy for the many against the few , for the unfortunate against the prosperous : ? it was these ardors and the burning sincerity with which he felt them , which made him so great a power among us his juniors by half a generation . I shall never lose the impression that Compromise , with its almost savage appeal for sincerity in word and deed , made upon me ? an impression which had its share in Robert Elsmere . But together with this tragic strenuousness there was always that which winged it and gave it power ? charm . Mr. Morley has known all through his life what it was to he courted , by men and women alike , for the mere pleasure of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and I knew well ? Sir Alfred Lyall . It is well known that Mr. Gladstone was fascinated by the combination in his future biographer of the Puritan , the man of iron conviction , and the delightful man of letters . And in my own small sphere I realized both aspects of Mr. Morley during the eighties . Just before we left Oxford I had begun to write reviews and occasional notes for the Pall Mall , which he was then editing ; after we settled in London , and he had become also editor of Macmillan , he asked me , to my no little conceit , to write a monthly causerie on a hook or books for that magazine . I never succeeded in writing nearly so many ; but in two years I contributed perhaps eight or ten papers ? until I became absorbed in Robert Elsmere and Mr:Morley gave up journalism for politics . During that time my pleasant task brought me into frequent contact with my editor . Nothing could have been kinder than his letters ; at the same time there was scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some touch of the critical goad , invaluable to the recipient . I wrote him a letter of wailing when he gave up the editorship and literature , and became member for Newcxxxvri ? No. 817. - 12castle . Such a fall it seemed to me then ! But Mr Morley took it patiently . " Do not lament over your friend , but pray for him ! " As , indeed , one might well do , in the case of one who for a few brief months ? in 1886 ? was to be Chief Secretary for Ireland , and again in 1892-95 . It was , indeed , in connection with Ireland that I became keenly and personally aware of that other side of Mr. Morley 's character ? the side which showed him the intransigent supporter of liberty at all costs and all hazards . It was , I suppose , the brilliant and pitiless attacks in the Pall Mall on Mr. Forster 's Chief-Secretaryship , which , as much as anything else , and together with what they reflected in the Cabinet , weakened my uncle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1882 . Many of Mr. Forster 's friends and kinsfolk resented them bitterly ; and among the kinsfolk , one of them , I have reason to believe , made a strong private protest . If so , Mr. Morley 's attitude in reply could only have been that which is well expressed by a sentence of Darmesteter 's about Renan : " So pliant in appearance , so courteous in manner , he became a bar of iron as soon as one sought to wrest from him an act or word contrary to the intimate sense of his conscience . " But no man has a monopoly of conscience . The tragedy was that here were two men , both democrats , both humanitarians , but that an executive office , in a time of hideous difficulty , had been imposed upon the one , from which the other ? his critic ? was free . Ten years later , when Mr. Morley was Chief Secretary , it was pointed out that the same statesman who had so sincerely and vehemently protested in the case of William Forster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the suppression of public meetings , had himself been obliged to put " obsolete " statutes in operation sixteen times , and to prohibit twenty-six public meetings . These , however , are the whirligigs of politics , and no politician escapes them . I will add one other recollection of this early time ? i.e. , that in 1881 the re-viewing of Mr. Morley 's Cobden in the Times fell to my husband , and as those were the days of many-column reviews , and as the time given for the review was exceedingly short , it could only be done at all by a division of labor . We cut up the proof copy , and we just finished in time to let my husband rush off to Printing House Square and correct the proofs as they went through the press for the morning 's issue . In those days , as is well known , the Times went to press much later than now , and a leader-writer rarely got home before 4 ? and sometimes 5-A.M . I find it extremely difficult , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of those early years in London . They were extraordinarily stimulating to us both , and years of great happiness . At home our children were growing up ; our own lives were branching out into new activities , and bringing us always new friends , and a more interesting share in that " great mundane movement " which Mr. Bottles believed would perish without him . Our connection with the Times and with the Forsters , and the many new acquaintances and friends we made at this time in that happy meeting-ground of men and causes Mrs. Jeune 's drawing-room ? opened to us the world of politicians ; while my husband 's four volumes on The English Poets , published just as we left Oxford , volumes to which all the most prominent writers of the day had contributed , together with the ever-delightful fact that Matthew Arnold was my uncle , brought us the welcome of those of our own m ? tier and way of life ; and when in ' 84 my husband became art critic of the paper , a function which he filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened on the already crowded scene , and fresh figures stepped in . The setting of it all was twofold ? in the first place , our dear old house in Russell Square , and , in the next , the farm on Rodhorough Common , four miles from Godalming , where , amid a beauty of gorse and heather that filled every sense on a summer day with the mere joy of breathing and looking , our children and we spent the holiday hours of seven goodly years . The Russell Square house has been , so to speak , twice demolished , and twice buried , since we lived in it . Some of its stones must still lie deep under the big hotel which now towers on its site . That it does not still exist somewhere I can hardly believe . The westerly sun seems to me still to be pouring into the beautiful little hall , built and decorated about 175o , with its panels of free scrollwork in blue and white , and to be still glancing through the drawing-rooms to the little powder-closet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketched the plan of Robert Elsmere for my sister , Julia Huxley , and where after three years I wrote the last words . If I open the door of the back drawing- room , there , to the right , is the children 's school-room . I see them at their lessons , and the fine plane-trees that look in at the window . And up-stairs there are the pleasant bedrooms and the nurseries . It was born , the old house , in the year of the Young Pretender , and after serving six generations , perhaps , as faithfully as it served us , it " fell on sleep . " There should be a special Elysium surely for the houses where the fates have been kind and where people have been happy , and a special " Tartarus for those ? of ? Edipus or Atreus ? in which " old , unhappy , far-off things " seem to be always poisoning the present . As to Borough Farm ? now the headquarters of the vast camp which stretches to Hindhead ? it stood then in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we called " the sandy tracks ' from the main Portsmouth road , with no neighbors for miles but a few scattered cottages . Its fate has been harder than that of 61 Russell Square . The old London house has gone clean out of sight , translated , whole and fair , into a world of memory . But Borough and the common are still here ? as war has made them . Only ? may I never see them again It was in 1882 , the year of Tel-elKebir , when we took Peperharrow Rectory ( the Murewell Vicarage of Robert Elsmere ) for the summer , that we first came across Borough Farm . We left it in 1889 . I did a great deal of work , there and in London , in those seven years . The Macmillan papers I have already spoken of . They were on many subjects ? Tennyson 's " Becket , " Mr. Pater 's " Marius , " " The Literature of Introspection , " Jane Austen , Keats , Gustavo Becquer , and various others . I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice examined ? in 1882 and 1888 ? for the Taylorian scholarship in Spanish at Oxford ; our old friend , Doctor Kitchin , afterward Dean of Durham , writing to me with glee that I should he " making history , " as " the first woman examiner of men at either university . " My colleague on the first occasion was the old Spanish scholar , Don Pascual de Gayangos , to whom the calendaring of the Spanish MSS. in the British Museum had been largely intrusted ; and the second time , Mr. York Powell of Christ Church -- I suppose one of the most admirable Romance scholars of the time ? was associated with me . But if I remember right , I set the papers almost entirely , and wrote the report on both occasions . It gave me a feeling of safety in 1888 , when my knowledge , such as it was , had grown very rusty , that Mr. York Powell overlooked the papers , seeing that to set scholarship questions for post-graduate candidates is not easy for one who has never been through any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactorily , and in 1888 we appointed as Taylorian Scholar a man to whom for years I confidently looked for the history of Spain ? combining both the Spanish and the Arabic sources ? so admirable had his work been in the examination . But slack ! that great hook has still to be written . For Mr. Butler Clarke died prematurely in 1904 , and the hope died with him . For the Times I wrote a good many long , separate articles before 1884 , on " Spanish Novels , " " American Novels , " and so forth ; the " leader " on the death of Anthony Trollope ; and various elaborate reviews of books on Christian origins , a subject on which I was perpetually reading , always with the same vision before me , growing in clearness as the years passed . But my first steps toward its realization were to begin with the short story of Miss Bretherton published in 1884 , and then the translation of Amiels ' Journal Intime which appeared in 1885 . Miss Bretherton was suggested to me by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controversy with regard to her acting ? as distinct from her delightful beauty , and her attractive personality ? which arose between the fastidious few and the enchanted many . I maintained then , and am quite sure now , that Isabel Bretherton was in no sense a portrait of Miss Anderson . She was to me a being so distinct from the living actress that I offered her to the world with an entire good faith , which seems to myself now , perhaps , thirty years later , hardly less surprising than it did to the readers of the time . For undoubtedly the situation in the novel was developed out of the current dramatic debate . But it became to me just a situation ? a problem . It was really not far removed from Diderot 's problem in the " Paradoxe sur le Comedien . " What is the relation of the actor to the part represented ? One actress is plain ? Rachel ; another actress is beautiful , and more than beautiful , delightful ? Miss Anderson . But all the time , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these considerations count for nothing in comparison with certain others ? Is there a dramatic art exacting , difficult , supreme ? or is there not ? The choice of the subject , at that time , was ? it may be confessed ? a piece of naivete , and the book itself was young and naive throughout . But something in it has kept it in circulation all this time ; and for me it marks with a white stone the year in which it appeared . For it brought me my first critical letter from Henry James ; it was the first landmark in our long friendship . Beloved Henry James ! It seems to me that my original meeting with him was at the Andrew Langs ' in 1882 . He was then forty-two , in the prime of his working life , and young enough to he still " Henry James , Junior , " to many . I can not remember anything else of the Langs ' dinner party except that we were also invited to meet Thomas Guthrie ( F. Anstey ) the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I wrote to my mother ? " the best thing of its kind since Dickens . " But shortly after that , Mr. James came to see us in Russell Square , and a little incident happened which stamped itself for good on a still plastic memory . It was a very hot day ; the western sun was beating on the drawing-room windows , though the room within was comparatively dark and cool . The children were languid with the heat , and the youngest , Janet , then five , stole into the drawing-room and stood looking at Mr. James . He put out a half-conscious hand to her ; she came nearer , while we talked on . Presently she climbed on his knee . I suppose I made a maternal protest . He took no notice , and folded his arm round her . We talked on ; and presently the abnormal stillness of Janet recalled her to me and made me look closely through the dark of the room . She was fast asleep , her pale little face on the young man 's shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet was a most independent and critical mortal , no indiscriminate " climber up of knees " ; far from it . Nor was Mr. James an indis-criminate lover of children ; he was nut normally much at home with them , though always good to them . But the childish instinct had in fact divined the profound tenderness and chivalry which were the very root of his nature ; and he was touched and pleased , as one is pleased when a robin perches on one 's hand . From that time , as the precious bundle of his letters shows , he became the friend of all of us ? myself , my husband , and the children , though with an increased intimacy from the nineties onward . In a subsequent chapter I will try and summarize the general mark left on me by his fruitful and stainless life . His letter to me about Miss Bretherton is dated December 9 , 1884 . He had already come to see me about it , and there was never any critical discussion like his , for its suggestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights , its witness to the depth and richness of his own artistic knowledge . The whole thing is delicate and distinguished ( he wrote me and the reader has the pleasure and security of feeling that he is with a woman ( distinctly a woman ! ) who knows how ( rare bird ! ) to write . I think your idea , your situation interesting in a high degree ? But and then comes a series of most convincing " buts " ! He objects strongly to the happy ending . I wish that your actress had been carried away from Kendal her critical lover , who worships herself , but despises her art altogether , carried away by the current of her artistic life , the sudden growth of her power , and the excitement , the ferocity and egotism ( those of the artist realizing success , I mean ; I allude merely to the normal dose of those elements ) which the effort to create , to " arrive " ( once she had had a glimpse of her possible successes ) would have brought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Isabel you describe , has too much to spare for Kendal ? Kendal being what he is ; and one does n't fee her , see her , enough , as the pushing actress , the tabotinel She lapses toward him as if she were a failure , whereas you make her out a great success . No ! ? she would n't have thought so much of him at such a time as that ? though very possibly she would have come back to him later . The whole letter indeed is full of admi r-able criticism , sprung from a knowledge of life , which seemed to me , his junior by twelve years , unapproachably rich and full . But hov+. grateful I was to him for the criticism ! ? how gracious and chivalrous was his whole attitude toward the writer and the book ! Indeed , as I look over the bundle of letters which concern this first novel of mine , I am struck by the good fortune which brought me such mingled chastening and praise , in such long letters , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pater , John Morley , " Mr. Creighton " ( then Emmanuel Professor at Cambridge ) , Cotter Morrison , Sir Henry Taylor , Edmond Scherer ? they - are all there . Besides the renewal of the old throb of pleasure as one reads them , one feels a sort of belated remorse that so much trouble was taken for so slight a cause ! Are there similar friends nowadays to help the first steps of a writer ? Or is there no leisure left in this choked life of ours ? The decisive criticism , perhaps , of ail , is that of Mr. Creighton : ? " I find myself carried away by the delicate feeling with which the development of character is traced . " But ? " You wrote this book as a critic , not as a creator . It is a sketch of the possible worth of criticism in an unregenerate world . This was worth doing once ; but if you are going on with novels you must throw criticism overboard and let yourself go , as a partner of    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
