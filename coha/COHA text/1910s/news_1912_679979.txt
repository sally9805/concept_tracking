txt Some of our newspaper Neighbors neighbors apparently do with a not share the public 's Grievance . satisfaction with the accounts of the Titania disaster which have been printed in Tam TVAIVS . What those neighbors see , apparently , is not the very obvious excellence of those narratives , but their constant superiority to their own accounts and the frequency with which they contained features of the very greatest Importance not to be found in any of the other papers  --  till next day . That these peculiarities should cause some humiliation , and even some Irritation , in journalistic minds can be easily understood , but that these emotions should have led even those who felt them most into the delusion that there is something reprehensible in printing exclusive news  --  that they should have put Pao similes thereof on their front pages and called thereto the attention of all and sundry , including their own readers and the Senatorial investigators  --  is something which is , so far as we know , quite new in the history of the press . But we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complain that our successes and our good fortune should thus be loudly  --  gratultously  --  proclaimed , and In the hope that fhe Senators may be moved to keep up the good work we inform them of our cordial  --  no , eager ? readiness to supply all the documents and information they want on the subject . Moreover , if the Senators desire , we would give them full details as to how dozens of other pieces of exclusive news were obtained , and also submit to them circulation figures that would deeply Interest any student of comparative statistics . Of course , to do this will be , in effect , giving a course of lectures on how to get the news and how to handle it , and it will enable our neighbors to get out better papers than they do now . But even though an element of strength be added in this manner to their rivalry , we wo n't mind .

Neededthe suffrage parade last Is year can have forgotten , or if frank and honest will deny , that the long line of marchers affected public sentiment to a very considerable degree . This it did in two ways  --  on the one hand , the readiness of so many women to ' Make a Pubila demonstration of their faith and their hopes gave warmth and activity to the friends of an extended franchise who had hitherto been cool and languid ; on the other , it gave those opposed to removing the sex bar a realization , previously lacking , of the seriousness with which the question has been raised .

What , therefore , are the many women who do not want to vote themselves , or to let their misguided sisters do it , planning as a manifestation in rebuttal ?

Should they refuse this or a like testimony to the truth that is in them , only too many will assert that , in spite of their claim to have a vast majority of women on their aide , they fear to make possible a comparison as to the amount of sincerity and devotion in the two camps . For some time past men have been compelled to admit that a good many women want the ballot ; they have not yet received evidence as absolutely convincing as a great parade gives that a good many more women , instead of being merely irnorant or indifferent , are resolute in defense of their right not to vote . The chance offers to clear the question and It should be utilized .

Both Government and private aid has been generously extended to these sufferers , but their needs are of the kind that temporary help does not adequately relieve . They must have care and assistance for months , and this they should get , less as charity than in recognition of a debt owed by the whole country to workers living in the central valley , whence it draws so much of its sustenance and wealth . We can not afford to let them get discouraged and move away , for the abandonment of any considerable portion of that valley or decreased cultivation of its richest  --  and most often flooded  --  acres would be a National loss if not a National disaster . The flood sufferers are particularly unfortunate in that their woes have culminated at a time when so much of public attention has concentrated on another disaster , but they , too , are our own people ; they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The mingled cries , he said , sounded like the barking of dogs in a kennel at feeding time ! A sensitive person , even though he had noticed such a resemblance , would not have mentioned It to others , and yet , now that it has been mentioned , one can hardly deny the probability of its marvelous accuracy . Almost certainly those last cries were quite inarticulate , as utter despair always is , and for a moment they rose and fell , a lugubrious ululation .
