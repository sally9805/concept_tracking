A ROOM of a suite in an apartment hotel . Through the large windows at the right , which probably overlook a park , the brilliant sun pours , touching vividly the usual furniture resting in the usual way . The reflected gleam upon the telephone calls attention to the long table at the left upon which it rests , and a deep chair near it yawns invitingly . Another smaller table close to the window holds the magazines of the day and some flowers of the season . The couch , a few stray chairs and what-nots appropriately fill their mission . Two doorways , each half concealed through short hallways , lead off : one at the right in back , which apparently serves as entrance from the house elevators without ; the other , down at the left , which obviously opens into the more intimate living quarters . At the back , at the left , the curtained alcove does not completely conceal the outlines of another room which proves to be the library . There is little which is either very personal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on closer inspection , the more or less temporary resting place of adequate means and position . The curtain rises with CLAIRE and VOLNEY seated as though there had been a long pause in their talking . CLAIRE PIERCE has just passed thirty ; from the settled expression of her face , with its high forehead and firm mouth , one deduces great strength of determination , and in the steady , large blue eyes is discovered a latent spirituality . But one can not brush aside the thin veil which seems to hang upon the outlines as though she has passed through some indelible experience . While she sits watching her husband a restlessness tinges her words and actions . VOLNEY PIERCE would easily attract attention anywhere because of his sheer virility . The gaunt , deeplined , middle-aged countenance , with its large , facilelipped mouth and small , sunken black eyes , conveys the impression of deep living and thought . Yet there is , too , in his manner an instinctive appreciation for subtleties usually foreign to his type . His voice is resonant and contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and during it he has again picked up his newspaper and begun glancing casually through it . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE I 'm afraid , Claire , there is nothing more to be said . p. 3 CLAIRE In spite of my appeal , you feel you must do it ? SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Yes ; your reasons are sentimental , dear . I 've thought it over carefully . It means my Senatorship another time  --  sure . ( Significantly ) You can never know how much I need the excitement of my career . CLAIRE For ten years your career has been my one thought . I do n't want you to do anything dishonest now . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE It 's politics , Claire . Addison controls the State legislature ; he simply agrees to re-elect me for certain considerations . It 's done every day . CLAIRE But never before by you . You must n't do it . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Rising , going to her , and patting her tenderly ) There , there , Claire . CLAIRE You wo n't listen to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Addison ' phones me , let me know at once . I 'm afraid I intend to consent to his conditions . ( He goes out , leaving CLAIRE alone . ) CLAIRE It 's not honest ; but , perhaps , I do n't understand . ( She rises and crosses to the window , slowly pulling the curtains aside and looking thoughtfully away . She sighs , not hearing the telephone until its ring is repeated . Then she goes and takes down the receiver . ) Is this Mr. Add  --  Oh , Miss Shannon  --  Miss Judith Shannon ? Tell her to come right up . ( She replaces the receiver and goes to call VOLNEY , but , on second thought , hesitates and walks off in back . There is a sound of greeting without , then she and JUDITH SHANNON enter . JUDITH SHANNON , past her first youth , too , with her auburn hair crowning an exceedingly mobile face and nervous black eyes , gives at first glance an impression of sex and temperament . But it is seen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooled and controlled her impulses beneath a cultivated mentality . She is a strong personality and immediately inspires confidence . One notices , however , that while she is evidently fond of CLAIRE , she is not quite at ease throughout. ) p. 4 JUDITH SHANNON I 'm so glad I found you . CLAIRE What a stranger for an old friend , Judith ; it 's nearly six months since  --  JUDITH SHANNON I know ; but horrid business difficulties with my publishers and  --  CLAIRE You 'll stay with us now , of course ? JUDITH SHANNON No ; I only ran over between trains . I 'm sailing next Saturday . CLAIRE ( Surprised ) Abroad ? Another of your sudden impulses ? JUDITH SHANNON I simply ca n't write here ; I need sunlight and the sea . I 'm going to a little island in the Mediterranean to finish my novel . CLAIRE How wonderful ! I wish I were going along Volney 'll be so surprised , too ; we 'll both miss you I 'll call him . JUDITH SHANNON ( Slightly agitated ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he 'd be at the Senate  --  that we might be alone . CLAIRE No ; he 's waiting a ' phone call . He 'll be so glad to see you . JUDITH SHANNON ( Stopping CLAIRE as she starts to the door ) Claire , do n't call Volney  --  just yet . I  --  I did n't come over only to say good-by  --  p. 5 CLAIRE ( Her manner changing : her voice drops to a whisper ; she does not conceal her excitement ) Judith , you have some word from  --  ? JUDITH SHANNON Yes . CLAIRE ( Anxiously ) Has anything happened to him ? JUDITH SHANNON I have a letter for you . CLAIRE Give it to me . Wait . ( While JUDITH takes the letter from her bag she watches CLAIRE half with pity and criticism as she goes first to the door , left , and then to the library and back . After convincing herself that they ca n't be heard she comes down to JUDITH . ) Volney must have stepped into his own room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the letter , and hesitating ) A friend who was with him sent it to me with the details . He must have given my address . It 's not very good news , I 'm afraid . ( CLAIRE is awed , and apprehensively takes the letter slowly from JUDITH 'S reluctant fingers . She looks at JUDITH , seeming to divine the truth , then sits by table , and hastily tears the letter open . JUDITH silently watches her read what is apparently a short note . CLAIRE betrays nothing . She puts it down softly and bows her head . There is a long pause. ) p. 6 JUDITH SHANNON ( Softly , as she refers to the other letter in her hand ) His last words were of you , Claire . His lips were whispering your name when  --  They have buried him on the hillside overlooking the blue waters . They put violets  --  ( CLAIRE winces audibly , and JUDITH places her hand sympathetically on the bended shoulders . ) Perhaps , Claire , you 'd better read this yourself  --  later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . ) CLAIRE He blames me , Judith . He loved me to the end  --  yet blames me . JUDITH SHANNON He must have suffered  --  and you here ( Glancing toward VOLNEY 'S room ) in his house . CLAIRE Dead ! Silence between us for seven years and then this  --  to blame me . And I loved him every moment . I loved him . ( She places her hands to her eyes ; then she speaks in a strange voice . ) Judith , why do n't the tears come ? There are no tears ; I ca n't even give him tears . He 's dead ! And they put violets  --  ( She bows again with one long sob  --  trembling . JUDITH stands by embarrassed at her own constrained sympathy . Some moments pass in silence. ) p. 7 JUDITH SHANNON Perhaps I did wrong to tell you , since it can not alter matters here . CLAIRE You did right ; a last wish is sacred and  --  and it will make a difference here . ( Though she glances toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . ) Volney owes me something he can never repay . I 've lived here with him and sent the other away . Yet all the man I love sends me from his deathbed is blame for living in my husband 's house . Oh ! JUDITH SHANNON That is natural , Claire . It 's hard  --  bitter hard . CLAIRE But I 've suffered , too . He should have seen I was doing my duty . Was it easy to give up all he was to me in spite of myself ? You knew at the time why I kept my husband ignorant . And besides , Judith , Volney loved me . JUDITH SHANNON ( Controlling herself with difficulty ) Yes , Volney loved you . But I 'd  --  I 'd better leave you alone . Is there anything I can do ? CLAIRE He is dead , Judith . What can you do ? ( Taking her hand affectionately ) You 've been so good . You bring all things back each time I see you ; for you alone knew what terrible days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never would have staggered through them without Volney 's discovering , if it had n't been for you . p. 8 JUDITH SHANNON No , Claire , I did nothing . CLAIRE You protected each of us from the other . If you had n't been with him so much working on the articles together  --  Do you remember those articles ? ( Vaguely ) What were they about ? JUDITH SHANNON ( Struggling ) I forget  --  I  --  CLAIRE Oh , Judith , each time when things became too hard later , you were always ready to help me . My strength has faltered so often but I kept on . Judith ! Judith ! Can I ever forget your goodness to me and to Volney ? JUDITH SHANNON ( Impulsively ) Claire ! Stop ! Stop ! I ca n't stand it . Let me go . I 'm not a hypocrite ; it is n't in my blood . CLAIRE Judith ! JUDITH SHANNON ( Almost fiercely ) I ca n't take your thanks . I do n't want you ever to speak of this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I have n't been here lately , why I 'm going far away for good . Your confidences have been a burning temptation to me . I ca n't bear them any more , do you hear ? I ca n't live in this lie between you and Volney ; it 's crushing all that 's decent in me . I can't. p. 9 CLAIRE ( In an intuitive flash ) Judith , you love my husband ! JUDITH SHANNON ( Openly ) Yes . CLAIRE ( Quickly ) Does Volney know ? JUDITH SHANNON Nothing . ( As CLAIRE turns away relieved . ) Though I knew you did n't love him as he thinks . I have n't been disloyal . ( Impulsively ) But I tell you , Claire , if he had loved me I would n't have been the coward  --  CLAIRE  --  that I was ? You mean that ? JUDITH SHANNON You 've wrecked a man 's life . CLAIRE ( Firmly ) I did my duty by Volney . JUDITH SHANNON ( Fiercely ) Did you ? CLAIRE Yes . What he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine ; his integrity  --  ( She suddenly recalls the dishonest deed her husband is contemplating . The force of her words fails her , and she sinks into the chair , looking toward his room . ) I tell you , Judith , I did right ; of course , I did right . p. 10 JUDITH SHANNON And the other man ? CLAIRE Judith , this is terrible of you . JUDITH SHANNON ( Realizing her cruelty and going to CLAIRE more tenderly ) Little Claire , forgive me . I was a beast to add to your pain in this moment . Neither one of us is herself . Of course , Volney is your justification . He loves you ; you need fear nothing from me . Forgive me . Only love means something different to me than you have made it . That 's all . This is good-by . Oh , do n't be sorry for me . But see that you never let him weaken for your own sake  --  if not his . ( The telephone rings . ) CLAIRE Addison ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impatient ring is repeated . ) SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Outside ) Is that for me , Claire ? CLAIRE ( To herself as she slowly walks toward the telephone ) Addison ! SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( As he enters ) See who it is ! ( Sees JUDITH . ) Why , Judith , I did n't know  --  JUDITH SHANNON ( Self-defensively throughout as they shake hands ) I 've only come to shake your hand . Claire will explain where I 'm off to . p. 11 SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Off ? CLAIRE ( Having taken down receiver ) It 's for you , Volney . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Tell them to hold the wire . ( CLAIRE does so , mechanically putting the receiver down on the table , yet scarcely watching them . ) You must n't run away like this without  --  JUDITH SHANNON I know it 's horrid of me , but I did n't realize how long I was talking to Claire . Goodness ! I am late for my train now . My cab 's waiting . Good-by . SENATOR VOLNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One must n't keep a Senator 's ' phone and business of state waiting . I 've said good-by to Claire . And now to you . Good luck , Volney , and happiness . ( She shakes hands again honestly , concealing everything , and goes out quickly . ) SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Why , how strange of her . I wonder why  --  ( He stands a second perplexed and then goes off back to close the door . CLAIRE is alone . ) CLAIRE " Never let him weaken . " ( Suddenly a determined look leaps into her face ; she takes up the receiver , not noting VOLNEY has re-entered , and hears . ) Is this Mr. Addison ? Well , wo n't you ring up later ? Senator Pierce is not here . He 'll be back soon . p. 12 SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Coming to her ) Claire ! CLAIRE ( Hangs up the receiver and faces him ) Volney , you sha n't make this deal . I ca n't let you at any cost  --  now . SENATOR VOLNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time . I beg of you not to do this . Ca n't your love for me without question do as I ask ? SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Losing patience ) It 's absurd to put it that way . CLAIRE ( Preventing him as he reaches toward the telephone ) This touches something deep between ourselves , Volney . I ca n't let you cheapen my ideal of you ; I ca n't let you do one single thing that 's dishonest  --  now . I 'd rather lose your love , rather topple over whatever happiness and joy you have found in me than let you do this . I 'm desperate , Volney . Give this up . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Claire , you 're ridiculously capricious to-day . What 's back of this wild mood ? Why should this be so abnormally important to you ? I have said it 's only a risk . CLAIRE It 's your willingness to take it . p. 13 SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE What 's the hidden reason that touches something deep between ourselves ? Why should I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Volney , for my justification . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Mystified ) Justification ? CLAIRE Yes . You owe me a great debt , Volney . You never knew . You must repay me now by keeping yourself the man I thought you . By keeping your career and integrity clean . That can be my only justification for what I 've done . Oh ! ( Her hand accidentally touches the letter she has placed in her bosom ; she breaks a bit . ) You must justify me  --  you must . I see that ; and nothing else  --  otherwise  --  oh , the horror , the grimness , the irony ! ( He stands looking at her as she is shuddering . Then he half turns her toward him , forcing her to look into his eyes . ) SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE What is it , Claire ? CLAIRE ( without flinching ) There 's been another man in my life for seven years and I gave him up . ( They stand some moments ; then VOLNEY , very quiet , slowly takes his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . She still stands where she was without turning toward him . ) Help me . Help me , Volney. p. 14 SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Go on . CLAIRE There is n't much . I knew him before  --  before you , and I  --  but I did n't realize till  --  till afterwards that the touch of his hand  --  Oh , I ca n't put it into words . But he loved me , too . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Why did n't he come to me ? CLAIRE He wanted to . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE You prevented ? CLAIRE Yes . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Then why did n't you tell me ? CLAIRE I did n't want you to know . I sent him away almost as soon as we both realized . We have n't seen each other since . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Why ? CLAIRE ( Turning toward him for the first time ) For your sake . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE For me ? CLAIRE I could n't allow any blow like that to halt the development of your character ; it was struggling between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strong and firm and  --  SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Incredulously ) My development ! p. 15 CLAIRE And besides , I could n't let any scandal hurt your career . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE How could that  --  ? CLAIRE You were a coming man ; no matter how little you might be to blame , the voters would never have supported you . You would n't divorce me ; you were too  --  too decent , and there was no cause save just I loved him . And I could n't get the divorce by paltry connivance , for you never would have been able to explain to the public that it was for my happiness . So I  --  I sent him away  --  that , in the stress of public life , your character might grow even stronger with the woman you loved standing by and that you might not be smirched with a family scandal . Your career , your honor , your integrity have been everything to me . That 's why you mus n't do this thing . For God , do n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have done will be terrible ; for I 've just learned that  --  that he could n't forget me , that his life has been wrecked , and that he has n't been strong enough to stand what I asked of him . And it 's mainly my fault . Volney , Volney , you owe me something , for I gave up what the world calls happiness for your sake . Now you know , Volney ; now you know  --  everything . Do n't be ice . ( She bows her head . VOLNEY 'S face has been inscrutably calm until , after she finishes , he slowly grasps the entire significance of her confession . There is a tense silence. ) p. 16 SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Slowly ) My career built with the wreckage of another life ! ( CLAIRE watches him in suspense as he rises and after a moment 's hesitation goes to the telephone . ) CLAIRE ( In a hushed voice ) You 'll give this deal up ? SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( At the telephone ) Hello ! Give me Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Ignoring her ) Hello ! Is Mr. Addison there ? Yes ; Senator Pierce . Thank you . ( Pause . ) Hello , Addison . I 've been thinking that little matter over and I 've decided I ca n't accept . ( CLAIRE gives a cry of joy . ) No . Under no considerations . Personal reasons . Wait . ( Deliberately ) This is for your private ear . I 'm also sending my resignation by the next mail to the Governor . Yes , resignation . No , I sha n't even fill my unexpired term . Personal reasons again . I thought I 'd tell you so that you could see " the old man " before it gets out . Irrevocably . Good-by . ( He hangs up the receiver ; they stare at each other. ) p. 17 CLAIRE What have you done ? SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE You heard . CLAIRE Given up everything ? SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE I can accept nothing at that price , nor keep what I gained by it . ( She is completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , deliberate manner . ) Was that your idea of my character ? My love in those days ? My strength ? Did you think , at the test , I could not , as a man , stand alone ? CLAIRE I only thought you needed me . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE I did your strength and love , but not your pity . CLAIRE You did not know what it was I gave you  --  the effect was the same . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE At the time , perhaps ; but your own lie has killed its offspring ; now everything 's sunk down . The foundations have fallen because they were soaked to rottenness in a woman 's tears . CLAIRE I gave them willingly for you . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE You expect me to receive them proudly like most men ? Is that the sort of man you think me ? To be proud when a woman sacrificed herself and the man she loved , fearing I would otherwise fall ? That I could n't rise above talk ? Proud ? It 's an insult to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely by this unexpected reaction ) Insult ? SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Yes . Not to have had the chance to offer you happiness even with your poor weak fool . CLAIRE ( Defensively ) You would have given everything , I knew ; if I had asked . But that would n't have altered the other facts . I did what I thought was honorable by you . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Scornfully ) Honorable ? You thought what you did honorable ? You quibble with me because I was about to accept Addison 's questionable offer ; you are shocked by that ; yet , with your flexible logic and feminine ideas of moral obligations for seven years you can see nothing despicable in living a lie in my house . Honorable ? Ha , ha ! CLAIRE I suffered for it . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE That was sufficient excuse , I suppose , for the deceit and the hypocrisy . You acted well ; played your part splendidly ; tricked even my instincts  --  for I never suspected . CLAIRE ( With a certain desperate strength and sincerity ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a half-gift had I brought you daily tears and a sad smile . There would have been no sacrifice had I given you a broken reed for your constant care and pity . What if I have hid every sigh , every tear , every dull leaden empty hour ? You blame me for the lie ; credit me with my consideration and sincerity as I saw it . p. 19 SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Sincerity ? And you lived with me all these years as my wife , and I never knew . Actress ! ( Hitting himself . ) Fool ! CLAIRE I accepted your name , your roof , your protection . There can be no half ways . I had to give if I took . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Revolted ) Wanton ! CLAIRE No ! SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE I understand now . Wanton ! With your passive pleasures , taking lips that meant his , embraces that touched other memories into fire ! And his name ! How was it you never gasped his name ? CLAIRE Do n't phrase those hours , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with all my woman 's strength what I saw was right by you , and you 're pulling everything down upon me . I 've shown to save your integrity I was willing to risk your love , by telling you what I have . But there are some things your tongue sha n't touch . You think I did wrong , but I never stole one hour with him . I tell you I played straight that way . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE How do I know ? How can I ever know ? CLAIRE My word . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Your word ? When you lived this lie for seven years  --  when in not one single act have you changed toward me since I first brought you to my house . You 've given everything just the same ; yet it was a lie , all of it a lie . How can I believe in the truth of one single thing in the present or in the past ? How can I , just because you 've given your word  --  your word ? ( She sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute uselessness of future words overwhelms her . He has halted , controlled himself , and stands looking long out of the window . The sunlight lessens. ) p. 20 CLAIRE ( In a dull , dead voice ) That 's true . It 's over  --  finished . We ca n't live together any longer . What irony ! Yet I had the courage to speak at last as I had the courage to live . You wo n't do the dishonest thing now . But what irony to have killed your love to save you from the other ! SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Turning , questions himself a second , then after a pause , speaks with calmness ) Claire , my love for you has been dead for some time . CLAIRE ( Silenced at first , not grasping it ) It was dead before this ? I did not kill it ? SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE No , it just passed . CLAIRE ( Smiling cynically ) Even that . Then now it was your vanity and not your heart I hurt . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but I guess we 'd better face the truth between us for once . CLAIRE Yes , it would be best at the end . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE I considered this deal because I had n't the moral courage to fight as I used to ; for back of me here in my home I knew my own deception . That 's why I could n't play straight outside ; why I needed the mere excitement to  --  to get away from things . p. 21 CLAIRE ( Bitterly ) So the man , too , could live with his wife when love was dead ! SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE It 's different somehow . CLAIRE Everything is different with a man . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Yes , the tolerance of you women has made it so . ( He starts toward the door . ) CLAIRE ( To herself ) Even that . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE I think that is all . CLAIRE What are you going to do ? SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE I 'll arrange things . Then I 'll begin new work and mold something apart from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up my writing again perhaps . When matters are settled I 'll go abroad . CLAIRE Abroad ? ( She recalls . ) Wait , Volney . ( Directly ) Is it Judith Shannon ? SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Turning surprised ) Judith ? CLAIRE We do not always know one love is dead until another comes . Do you love her ? p. 22 SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE No , certainly not . I 've had enough of love . CLAIRE ( Slowly ) Go to her , Volney . When you are free , go to her . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE There never has been one word  --  CLAIRE I know ; she told me . She loves you . Go to her . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( To himself ) Judith ! CLAIRE That is the one last thing from me you can believe ; my " dishonesty " can not touch that . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE Judith ! CLAIRE She also knew about me and the other one . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( With admiration ) And she never told me ? How splendid of her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ) Go to her . SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE I suppose we all deserve a little happiness out of this tangle . I 'll arrange things quietly . I 'll leave the house to-night . CLAIRE Yes ; to-night . ( With a despairing emotional note ) And what 's to become of me ? p. 23 SENATOR VOLNEY PIERCE ( Kindly ) Why , you must go to him , of course . Go to the man you love ! ( He goes out quietly , closing the door . She stands dumb at his words . Then she fingers the letter which JUDITH has placed on the table . She stares before her while the day fades )
