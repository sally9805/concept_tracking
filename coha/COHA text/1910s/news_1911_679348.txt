txt For the first time since the institution of the much mistrusted cold storage warehouse the people who profit by its influence on current market prices felt called upon yesterday to take the public into their confidence . Here are some of their confessions , as they were voiced to a TIMES retorter from around the large mahogany table in the Directors ' room Cf the New York Mercantile Exchange . That they have sadly overplayed the market , and held it to prices it could not support . That cheaper  --  much cheaper  --  butter , eggs , and poultry is the Immediate result . That they want this cheapness to reach the consumer instantly , because a strongly Stimulated market is the only thing that can save the warehouse men from large and permanent losses . That the little red hen , Industriously laying eggs in all the Southern and Western States from Texas to Missouri , is the most disturbing force in the present market , and that the big corn crop , Insuring cheap corn , Is a guarantee that the hen will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Monday , when the jobbers call for stored eggs , poultry , and butter , they will get these products at prices lower than have prevailed in seven years . That they want the public to know this , and to abandon all thought of oleomargarine substitutes and scanty , eggless breakfasts . Of six wholesale dealers who joined in . these statements , several were afraid that the retailers would not be prompt in taking the consumer into theit " cOnfidence , and that as a result the amount of consumption would not increase at the rate the wholesalers find imperative if they are to be saved from loss . For that reason there were some hard words for the retailers . It was charged that when some retailers buy ten cases of third-rate eggs and two cases of first-rate eggs , they invariably retail twelve cases of " perfectly good eggs " at fancy prices . It was also charged that 00 per cent . of the stored and frozen poultry passing over the retail counters is sold as " strictly fresh "  --  a practice which hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since buyers could not know that the eggs and poultry , fancily priced , were really out of the refrigerator , and had been sold at wholesale to the retailers ranch below the " fresh killed " and " fresh laid " articles . For the first open meeting of the produce men representatives of the press were summoned by telephone , with the special inducement that news of " a sensational drop in the price of butter was to be announced . " W. W. E/zea rapped for order as the thirty or more wholesalers seated themselves about the table in the Directors ' room , and then called upon Charles P. Droste , a wholesale butter and egg dealer of 177 Duane Street , to tell what he knew of present conditions . Mr. Droste talked about supply and demand and theories of prices , and at the end made this confession : " When the last season opened , in March and April , prices ruled higher than ever before in the history of the business . Operators thought the fact that the people had used up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1910 . That was their theory . What it was they overlooked I do not know . " But I do know that our warehouses are ftll of goods , and there is no market for them , and that we are facing a new season . That means tha : .. - we must sell and sell quickly and sell in quantity . In the face of such conditions theories must go to smash . " We played for higher prices , and the whirligig of tune has caught us . High prices enticed people to raise hens , and taught consumers to do with less food . When the prices started up there were many consumers and few sources of supply . Now it has changed , and there are many more eggs and chickens than there are buyers to take them off our hands . " We did not make the money . The farmers made it . For our gains in a - rising market have been swept away from us in its decline . " " Will you definitely announce that for the coming season there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hold tire market high from the outset ? " Mr. Droste was asked by one 10f the retorters . " Certainly you earvmake such an announcement . We have learned our lesson from last season , and we shall open the next on a much more conservative basis . " Mr. Droste l'oen explained that he was talking wholly from an " economical standpoint , " and that the Exchange , as such , knew nothing of price fixing . Asked how much surplus there is on hand , he said he would not cafe to state mere definitely than that it was a " burdensome " amount . " I was looking over our price lists today , " he said , and I had to go back seven years to " find quotations equally cheap . Our offerings to-day are from S to 10 cents lower than a year ago on butter , and from 12 to 15 cents less on fresh eggs , with a drop of from 4 to 5 cents on storage eggs . Who , under the conditions , is justified in continuing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the eggs and butter and poultry they eat are from storage warehouses I am sure that the prevailing unnatural . prejudice against cold storage would be dissipated . " Mr. Dowse went on to deplore the popular tendency to berate cold storage warehouses and to agitate for more laws to regulate them . He had gone to Washington , he said , Ao discuss warehouse regulation , and had urged that the real harm done by the warehouses was in advancing money on goods placed in them by commission merchants , so that speculators could often operate on borrowed capital to produce false market conditions , from which a rebound was sooner or later bound to come . " We want the public to know , " ho said , " that eggs simply can not be kept In storage over one season and that butter and poultry so kept is invariably kept at a loss . The public notion of turkeys several seasons old ' is a sad and harmful myth . The minds of the masses have been poisoned by the periodicals . " , What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion , is a market for the great middle class products  --  not " the extra grades put up for millionaires who do n't care what they pay , " but the goods that are " sweet and wholesome , " and are clogging an overstocked market at the . season 's end with the fresh'supply already crowding in . By Monday their lower rates should strike the retail market , they insisted , and by Wednesday they sliatild control it entirely .
