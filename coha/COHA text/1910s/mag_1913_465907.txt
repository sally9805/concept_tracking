AT two o'clock on the afternoon of a March day a young man peered across New York Harbor from the shelter of the ridge of a power - house roof . His hard , weather - bitten eyes roved ceaselessly across the corrugated horizon . Small wind-riven clouds thrust constantly up from the southwest , and were as constantly hurried across the city by the weight of a gale that had been blowing since morning . These he marked casually till they merged in the blur of gray smoke that was whipping viciously from the throats of the great stacks around him . The huge buildings beneath him vibrated delicately , and , mingled with the roar of traffic , he could distinguish a rhythmic drone , as of some enormous and contented animal housed within them . Suddenly a black cloud thrust a ragged rim over the tail of Staten Island , twenty miles away . Mounting rapidly , it hurried into the vision of the weather-bitten eyes that caught its approach ere the on-coming shadow had fallen on the wrinkled surface of the bay . Simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof ridge . His lips had hardly left the transmitter before the smoke increased in volume , and tier on tier of boilers flung out vast exhalations of gas and vapor as though clearing their gigantic lungs for a corning battle . The lookout , again at his post , noted the swift advance of midday gloom . Again and again he reached for the telephone . At his first message another young man , with a long chin and hawklike face , who received it impassively , had stretched out a lean , nervous hand and pressed two buttons . A hundred feet below , in the chiaroscuro of the boiler-house , a number sprang into light . The system operator had demanded that number of boilers for instant use . Two stokers raced down the concrete aisle and depressed six levers . In three sec-onds the forced draught was doubled . In twelve more the sharp pop of lifting safety-valves told their story . But these twelve seconds were very precious to the system operator . In adjoining rooms , on either side , were two great double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power that vitalized every invisible artery of the whole system ; and like a master intelligence the system operator held the switchboards in the hollow of his band . Swifter than from brain to muscle sped his imperative call . Along glittering , marble curves men stood with eyes glued to dials whose trembling needles pulsed with the myriad demands of millions of invisible clients . From beneath them stretched viewless filaments carrying the mysterious current , which in turn itself governed the titanic engines that produced it . A maze of wires , battalions of switches , a confusion of multicolored lamps , a medley of indicators , blended and linked , fused and welded , into one masterful and harmonious instrument . The turbines were lords of the engine-room . Half the weight and a quarter the size of the vertical engines , they produced five times the power . Theirs was the song of progress ? a high note that told of a rim speed of six miles a minute , and cut sharply into the lower pitch of the plunging verticals . And it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud was near Manhattan Island , and there was peering across the bay and a scamper for shelter from Battery Park . The deep shade stole swiftly northward , and lapped the lower fringe of the city . Instantly a thousand hands stretched to a thousand switches , demanding light . They got it . The midday darkness swept on . In five minutes it engulfed the human hive , from Wall Street to Madison Square , from the Hudson to the East River . Millions of all , only the expression of his characteristics . Now , if a power-house were the work of one man , it would infallibly reflect his personal modulations to an uncomfortable and unworkable degree . So it is that the modern power-house is the complex aggregation of the individual simplicities of many men . It is remarkable for what is not there . Sir Oliver Lodge has profoundly remarked that " all we can accomplish in the physical world is to move things into desired positions and allow them to act on one another . " That is what we call invention . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly moved into new and desired positions . The mechanical triumph of to-day is the engineering relic of to-morrow . And when it is all over , and the millions are spent , and the latest device installed , there is generally only a safer , more economical , and more flexible way of doing very much the same thing . That is the peculiar property of the mysterious fluid ? electricity . It continually presents some new phase and demands some new treatment . Efficiency is a matter of debit and credit , plus a balance - sheet . In the power-house the question is first broached to a coal-pile and a chemist . A pound of coal should contain thirteen thousand five hundred heat units . Does it ? The facts are worth knowing where seven hundred thousand tons of coal a year are involved . The efficiency of the hundred and fifty boilers that swallow the coal is a large matter . They are mechanically debited with what they consume ; they are mechanically credited with the steam they produce . Should the gases roaring up the stacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should the ash contain undue and unconsumed carbon , there is no escape from the test . For a. pound of coal the boiler should produce ten pounds of steam . Does it And in the whirring orbit of the thirty-thousand horse-power turbines efficiency is the master word . It is a far cry to the measured plunge of the primal pumping-engine that Watt devised to drain a Lancashire coal-pit , or even to the seesaw walking-beam of the Fulton as she headed for Albany at nearly five miles an hour . The turbine blades snore along at five hundred feet a second ; but the difference is , after all , one of efficiency . A turbine-driven generator should produce a horse - power for eleven pounds of steam . Does it ? So with transformers , cables , converters ? all the multiphase subdivisions that contribute to the service . They must answer the question or be superseded . As a. type of human efficiency consider the system operator ? this modern and impassive Jove , distributing benignant thunderbolts . His position is the near-. est thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government From boilers to substations his sway is supreme . He manipulates his hundreds of thousands of horse-power with a touch of delicate finger-tips . The whole cobweb of distribution is an open book . Not a boiler can be repaired , not an engine Cut in or out , not a main re-laid or a manhole remodeled without his sanction . He is the load-despatcher and magnetic monarch . Turn now from what the public does not see to the human network by which the Electricity Supply Corporation is linked to the public . It is at once evident that an organization of every possible temperamental variety is essential to deal successfully with that most elusive element -- a metropolitan population . The selling end must acceptably reflect whatever it finds in its clientele . The agent who gets business on the East Side knows little of the area north of Forty-second Street . The assembling of such a cohort is no less vital than the power-house itself . And in the background looms large that sense of personal disadvantage which many people experience when dealing with a corporation . Its very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ulterior motive . As to the agent himself , it is a matter of selection , plus survival . He applies as a boy for employment ; and forthwith his home record , his personality , and even his home influences , become matters of scrutiny . The sky being clear , he is taken in hand and encouraged and mentally fed up and physically developed , and in a business way pushed ahead , just as fast as he can assimilate progress . And , forging along , he will , first of all ( if he is to face the public and ask for business ) , hear a lecture on " the value of right thinking , " which is a good start for any aspirant . And after that he hears others on courtesy and efficiency and confidence and self-development , and various technical subjects . He will commercially graduate on a diet of " The Human Element in Business " and " Helps to Better Health " and " The Psychology of the Twentieth - Century Man " and " Applied Psychology " ? all by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects they discourse upon . And , what is more , he will be paid for the time spent at these lectures . All the while lie is being card-indexed , , and a faithful record made of his services , and the good old debit-andcredit system kept in force ; so that when the next man ahead moves up it is perfectly clear whether our young aspirant is the right one for the bigger job . If he does not get it , he is entitled to ask for his progress record ; and , if be sees fit , demand the appointment of another board to pass upon his claims for promotion . Now , all this is very much calculated to produce somewhat more than merely a person with power for Sale . So that if you are a man of importance ? and all customers , whether prospective or secured , come under this categmy ? you will be approached by a personable agent , who is perfectly ready and willing to talk to you intelligently and acceptably on almost any subject from golf to vegetarianism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind to do what you know perfectly well you will ultimately do . If , on the other hand , you have a grievance about a bill which is absolutely extortionate , another personable young man ( they are all young ) will call upon you and at once sympathetically agree that , on the face of it , the amount seems high ? if what you say is correct . Curiously enough , he will know nothing whatever about the construction or operation of a meter . He is not supposed to . The knowledge would put him and keep him subjectively on the meter 's side . of it . But he will know that he is backed by a mass of scientific facts all going to prove that the modern meter is an instrument of extraordinary accuracy ? which indeed it is . So , when you have had your say , and lean back with that defiant , impregnable air , he will consult your contract card , and inoffensively point out that you had four lamps and an electric ' neater installed within the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerhouse shows that the duration of sunlight last month was only half of that in the month before . If , then , your house was lighted to your satisfaction , you must have used the current . A good deal of all this is pure and applied psychology . It is formative of the attitude that it is desired the mind of the customer should take . And that , after all , spells the standing of the corporation ? the mental attitude of the customer . What a field for analysis , what a hinterland to explore and cultivate 1 It is a question whether any more human and graphic commercial records exist than may be found in the card indexes of an Electricity Supply Corporation . There is , first of all , full information of all property sales , and a geographical presentation of every building in the areas served by the company . Add to this further records of rentals , leases , and sub-leases , through which may be followed the wanderings of every peripatetic customer , be he ever so insignificant . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , filed and numbered . His lamps , his motors , all his appliances ? are they not written ? His complaints ? are they not remembered ? His defalcations ? do they not still live ? Twist as he will through the city swarm , he is never invisible to the X-ray . And that , perhaps , is the first rule of the successful corporation . It never regards its customers en masse . It is a safe assumption that many a man is more of an entity to the Power Company than he is at home . Of the making of rates there is no end . One New York power company testified that the small retail customer is served at a loss : the outlay necessary for his equipment was not covered in the amounts paid for current used . In this case the company spoke feelingly . It had experienced a diminution of revenue of a million and a quarter dollars in twelve months , seventy per cent . of which was by reason of a reduction in rates to small users . The deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where the daily , steady , comforting manufacturing load cuts into the rapidly mounting evening lighting load . In winter-time this is about three o'clock . By five the output is doubled and the peak is reached . By seven the peak has vanished . It is the doubly loaded period between 3 and 6 P.m. that fixes the rates . A certain total generating power is absolutely necessary to carry the peak . Two-thirds of it is absolutely unproductive during the rest of the twenty-four hours . In other words , the power-factory has an average winter load-factor of about thirty-five per cent , and the earning power of one-third of the total investment must make a profit for the whole gigantic aggregation . Lord Eldon defined the good-will of a-business as " the probability that the old customer will return to the old shop . " He does , to the power-factory , millions of him , with paralyzing unanimity at exactly the same time every day . And , to ease the burden of that unproductive two-thirds of his plant , the manager is striving to cultivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak . Flatirons will lighten his cares . Fans will cool him . Electric trucks and cars are hailed as gilded gods . Vacuum - cleaners are a benison . Anything and everything , provided that it does not attempt to scale the precipitous side of his peak load . On December 20th of last year the output of one New York power-house varied as follows , in thousands of horsepower : At 5 4.14. , 50 . By nine o'clock , 150 ; carried smoothly till noon , when it dropped to a mere 107 . At 3 PAC. , back to 150 ; thence giddily to 280 , the five-o'clock peak . where a toboggan - slide started and swooped down to a negligible 00 at midnight . As to individual users . A big hotel produces a curve that has only one noticeable hump ? which about synchronizes with the hour when the orchestra plays the first dinner piece ; and the location of its hump makes it a welcome customer . Likewise the apartment-house . The peaks of department stores and office buildings come at the crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the refrigerating plant , the turning of whose wheels knows neither change nor rest . So much for winter . In summer the characteristics change , and nearly all peak loads are morning loads ? that is , if there are any peaks at all . The general summer - load line is full of long , easy undulations , from which practically all the abrupt jumps have been smoothed by benignant atmospheric influences ; while the Sunday eurve is a lake of serenity that lifts itself into a communicative reading-lamp swell about 7 P.M. Now , take . all the curves . and superimpose them one on top of the other ; and the result is an extraordinarily graphic representation that reflects , with absolute and mechanical accuracy , every economic condition of community life . And this is the basis of the making of rates . It is perfectly evident that if a large body of highly trained , ambitious , and cultivated men devote themselves exclusively to one conjoined pursuit , from which everything that is irrelevant is excised , and iu which everything that is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present for the formation of an enormously powerful aggregation . It is this element of corporate power that vitally concerns the public . And the most interesting developments of to-day are those through which the public has expressed itself on this subject . There are three principal limitations to corporate power : the mental attitude of the man in the street , inventive genius , and legislation . Of the first we have spoken . As to invention , who shall say that the sum of human knowledge may not be multiplied a thousandfold in one flash of revelation ? To-day the best endeavors of the best engineers have only made it possible to extract and turn into power one-fifth of the total heat value of coal . Refinements in the use of steam , high-speed turbines , and various internal-combustion engines have contributed something . But the astonishing waste still bears an abnormal ratio to the progress made . Thirty years ago two hundred people in the city of New York used three thousand electric lamps . To-day one hundred and twenty-five thousand customers use five million . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of labor performed , is infinitely higher than that of the greatest creations of the same man 's brain . But inventive genius can not be cornered , and one inspired touch may open the door to astounding potentialities . And as to legislation , there is the Public .. Service Commission . It is a question whether any controlling medium has been better named . It is poised in unprejudiced freedom between the man in the street and the corporate company . Its functions are advisory rather than arbitrary , because the right of court appeal applies to its findings ; but it is seldom in the interest of either party to appeal . It is legislation humanized , and without cost . For the Public Service Companies it has made a deal of work . Stock issues , construction , rates , regulations , safeguards , methods of accounting , all come under the direction of the commission . " Would you be without it ? " was asked the manager of one of the largest of them all . " On no account whatever . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the courts . We do n't as a rule appeal from the decisions of the commission . I was at a sitting yesterday ? took eight of our representatives to meet the complaint of an East Side tailor because we would not put in a service without a deposit . We showed why to the commission 's satisfaction . It cost about five hundred dollars in time ? money well spent . We proved that we were fair , and that 's what we wanted . " And , after all , can any commission perform a higher duty than to prove or disprove the fairness of things ? " Power factor " is a potent term to an electrician . It signifies , in brief , the relation between the actual amount of current a machine consumes and the effective amount of work it turns out . And from . a brief survey of the Public Service Commission it appears to be an ideal tribunal before which , whether the                    @
