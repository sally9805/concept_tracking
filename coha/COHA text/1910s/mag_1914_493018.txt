Norman Hapgood I 4 OGIC , an elementary course given twenty- eight years ago by Professor Royce , that was the setting in which I first saw Norman Hapgood . Of course we were n't acquainted then , having been in the same class at Harvard for only two years . The shape of his head was striking , but not so striking as his expression . In a flock of students who looked dutifully attentive or bored or conscientiously acute , Hapgood 's expression was egregious . He looked amused . You would have guessed he found the detection of fallacy about the most amusing game he had ever played , and you would have been right . In those days he liked logic quite as well as baseball . None of his contemporaries could split the hair with nicer hand . As a nice yet humorously ruthless detective of fallacy he gained his earliest reputation at Harvard . Five or six years later I had my second good look at him . Although the law was not his first choice , he was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard Law School , and had emerged in a Chicago law office . I do n't know how his mind lived its life by day . His real mental life began after dinner , when he and his friends would start an evening-long talk about Maletesta , or when he would stretch himself on a sofa , in his boardinghouse bedroom , and read French for hours on end ? Madame du Deffand , Merimee , Stendhal . At this epoch he used to write in The Yellow Book , among other things about ennui , of which he has all his life had no first-hand knowledge . These essays , with the slightly later articles on Balfour , Rosebery and John Morley which appeared in The Contemporary Review , were more " written " than anything he has done in the last ten years . There was a time when it irritated him to be told that they were also written better . Even now , though the subject does n't interest him , you can make him a little tired by asking why he no longer writes as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant shift from books to men , from past to present , from the splittable hair to the big brush . To his next , his early New York period , belong those solid , acute , documented lives of Lincoln and Washington which scarcely read like the improvisations they really were . They tell you more about Lincoln and Washington than about the evolution of Norman Hapgood . For documents upon Hap-good as he then was you had better consult the dramatic criticism he contributed to the old Commercial Advertiser , now the Globe . He had almost all the qualifications of a dramatic critic except taste . There was a healthy pugnacity in his articles . Plays and acting and management and the theatrical trust gave him things to say which he cared prodigiously to get said . He made his readers care , made them realize the importance of taking sides , of taking the right side . Among managers he discriminated the sheep from the goats . He belabored the goats until some of them tried to butt him off his job . Then he came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper . His manner of writing could not help changing . Once you might have supposed his aim was to make subtleties clear to the subtle . Now he began to write as if he wanted the deaf to hear . By taking sides , and by wishing other people to take sides , he was learning to talk at a mark , his audience . At the end of this period he was ready for the rest of his life work . Henceforth he would address his contemporaries through a megaphone . His association with Collier 's started from an accident . F. P. Dunne , who was writing the Collier editorials , happened to be going away for a week or so , and asked Hapgood to fill in . The owners of the paper liked his work so well that later , when Dunne wanted to resign , they cabled an offer of his place to Hapgood , who was then sunning himself on the Italian Riviera , writing a few meditative essays that he has never been willing to print . Since that spring morning in 1903 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has renounced meditation . For the last ten years his thinking has been rapid and controversial . Believing that too much of our editorial writing has been done by men who do nothing except sit at desks , and who read nothing except print , Hapgood has gone everywhere , met everybody , served on committees , made speeches , copiously conferred . His subjects are what every one is talking about or what everyone is on the point of talking about . It is in talk and in the news of the day that he gets the topics which serve him best . His mind seizes these topics and does things to them . It digs into them until it strikes a layer of helpful truth , which must not lie too far below the surface to be exposed to average eyes . Unconsciously he has almost ceased to believe that a truth can be important if four or five hundred words can not make it clear to the average . According to Walter Pater , the first requisite of a good prose style is a complicated subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good journalistic style is a subject matter which Norman Hap-good can make clear to you before you get off your suburban train . The second requisite is punch , which is most accurately known by counting those who feel it . A few steps toward knowledge of it may nevertheless be taken along other ways . Punch is something which Arthur Brisbane has , and Sam Adams and Dean Swift , and which Walter Bagehot and Max Beerbohm have n't . So far I can follow Hapgood , at a respectful distance , not understanding very well , getting a little muddled . Beyond this point I am lost , though I cling to the guiding doctrine that there can be no punch without emotion , that light without heat does n't interest our readers , that dry light makes dry reading . Adherents of this creed , confined to matter which punch and repetition can make clear and interesting to an audience of several hundred thousand , are further restricted by the fear of getting in wrong , of occupying positions that can not be defended . It is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt these restrictions less than they , that he has been free to choose so many things to fight for and to fight against . His courage has often put him in exposed positions , which he has defended so stoutly , and from which he has made such destructive sorties , that his readers have come over to his side . Armed with the goods , which he certainly had on Secretary Ballinger and President Taft , Hapgood literally did not care how many enemies he made . His moral ardor led him even into boring many readers not so morally ardent , but he lost neither head nor heart nor patience . He gained his end . His successful campaign was a sky-high warning to men who wanted their friends to grab our national resources . He put an inferior Secretary of the Interior out of business . It was a solid piece of work that Hapgood did for conservation in Collier 's . And he did it , such are the pleasant oddities of journalism , without ever mastering , as a scholar masters all the diseases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glavis-Ballinger-Pinchot row . Both as an editorial writer and as a maker of speeches he is most damaging when he retorts . In his answers to opponents the old dialectitian re-fines the worshipper of punch . When he is talking to a friend this old dialectitian is still very much alive . And in talk his interest is almost as dirigible as of old . At the end of a long summer afternoon , walking home from a ball game , he is quite ready to choose , from the men and women of all epochs , the dozen who would be most agreeable together at dinner . He has time enough for all your interests , time enough to destroy , with friendly hand , a few of your fallacies . He does this without impatience , as if you and he were playing a game . These pools of leisure , in the hurrying stream of his life , are less frequent than they used to be , but they are just as quiet . To find him in leisurely mood you must find him almost alone , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has grown to four or five adults his mood becomes a little journalistic , a little impatiently controversial , a little contemptuous of the taste which rejects popular idols and of the mind which dozes over the very newest thought . As the size of his company increases , so his desire for victory in talk increases , and his wish to explore other men 's minds grows less . No , it is when you are alone with him that this successful journalist is most attractive and leastjournalistic . His gentleness and his humor appear , he loses his desire to impose his will , his judgment , his taste . And in talk you are secure against anything resembling his printed enormities ? his disquisitions on breakfast or Shakespeare , his obituary paragraphs beginning " Whistler is dead " or " McKim is dead , " and reading like plaster casts of an emotion . His queer preferences in verse , for example , which irritate one in print , because they there sound as if he thought them important , are in talk only the quaint idiosyncrasies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson seems like a man of this world . His loyalty to the President is as ubiquitous and combative as it is in print , but it does n't make me dislike that image of him , half saint and half trustee and all great man , which forms itself in my mind as I read Harper 's Weekly . When Hapgood is talking instead of writing , he does n't impose trusting the President upon me as a disagreeable duty . P. L.
