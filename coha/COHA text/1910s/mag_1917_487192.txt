THE Nation Index for July-December , which heretofore has been sent out with the first issue in January , will this year be printed in a small edition and mailed only to libraries on our subscription list and to such other subscribers as apprise us of their desire for it . " ORMAN PRINCE : An American Who Died for the NCause He Loved , " with a memoir , by George F. Babbitt , is announced for publication in the near future by Houghton Mifflin Company . Little , Brown &; Company will publish early in January the following volumes : " Cabin Fever , " by B. M. Bower ; " The Wolf-Cub , " by Patrick and Terence Casey ; " Pawns of War , " a play , by Bosworth Crocker ; " A Yankee in the Trenches , " by Corporal R. Derby Holmes , and " Letters of a Canadian Stretcher Bearer , " by " R. A. L. " Henry Holt &; Company will publish in the new year " Some Modern Novelists , " by Helen Thomas Follett and Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Everett . gcH ONE ST ABE : A Study in Integrity , " by Alonzo Rothschild ( Houghton Mifflin ; $2 ) , is a fragment , the narrative having been completed , at the author 's death , only to the time of Lincoln 's election to Congress . So far as it goes , however , the work is an admirable presentation of the human , everyday side of Lincoln 's early career , enriched with the wealth of good stories which , for men and women as well as for boys and girls , bear telling again and again . Mr. John Rothschild has added a memoir of his father ; and there is a considerable bibliography as well as an appendix of useful notes . I T would be difficult within the limited compass of thirty ' small pages to give a more comprehensive outline of Russian economic and political conditions than is done by Professor Vinogradoff in " The Russian Problem " ( Dutton ; 75 cents net ) . As a Russian liberal , who a score of years ago had to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his opinions , and who since then has been the distinguished successor of Bishop Stubbs at Oxford , Professor Vinogradoff speaks with historical sense and with authority . As his pamphlet was written many months before the Russian revolution ( of which he had no inkling ) , it does not deal with the immediate problem of the Maximalists and their doings . But in its account of the peasants , zemstvos , and Duma , and their shortcomings , it does furnish a good background and give some clue to the forces which have brought Russia to the present abyss . TWENTTWENTY-TWO former students , of whom twenty-one Y-TWO professors and instructors of philosophy in as many colleges and universities , have united in producing a volume of " Philosophical Essays in Honor of James Edwin Creighton " ( Macmillan ; $2 ) , of the Sage School of Philosophy of Cornell University , in commemoration of twenty-five years of service as teacher and scholar . Professor Creighton 's services to the study of philosophy in America have been of a very solid kind . Besides his large share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of philosophy , and a textbook of logic which has been widely used , he has been for twenty-five years editor of the Philosophical Review , the chief representative in America of the classical and scholarly tradition in philosophy . In view of the idealistic leanings of the master , it is interesting to note the matured views of the pupils . Seven of the twenty-two essays are historical ; of the others twelve or more reflect in various ways the presence in the philosophical world of the school of pragmatism ; while only one essay is concerned with the " new realism . " Of Professor Creighton 's pupils only one appears to be a fully converted pragmatist , though two or three others are ready to compromise . The more general attitude , to be sure , is one of hostile criticism ; and in several cases the criticism is searching and fundamental , showing that the attack upon pragmatism has developed new bases along with the development of pragmatic theory . But the criticism is not unaccompanied by admissions ; and what the volume seems to show is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoned with by idealism to-day , but an issue which is able to bring about some revision of the idealistic philosophy . A NEW volume listed among the publications of the A den Society of England is always noteworthy , especially when it is an addition to the Year Book Series . Since the British Government has given up the issue of these old law reports , the burden of publishing them has fallen upon the shoulders of this private organization , which has thus far issued eleven volumes , the latest of which , from the hand of the learned and judicious William Craddock Bolland , covers a part of the years 1311-1312 , the fifth year of Edward II ( London : Bernard Quaritch ) . Mr. Bolland 's introduction , according to the plan of the series , discusses many of the important points raised in the course of the arguments and endeavors to make clear the more difficult technical features of the cases tried ; the most interesting is that which concerns the Statute De donis , or Statute of Entails , as it is commonly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the court as to the effect of the law : the serjeants or barristers arguing that only the one first receiving the land was bound by the entail , while the justice presiding at the trial held that the restraint extended to the fourth generation . The view usually presented in our textbooks of English law is that the entail was permanent , a view which apparently has no contemporary support . In this volume , we also get an interesting picture of the apprentices of the law , corresponding to our law students of to-day , standing in their " cribs " or stalls , gathering what instruction they could from the arguments of the serjeants and the opinions of the justices : an instance of " case-law " teaching in its earliest and simplest form . Not only did the young students listen to and make notes of what was said and done , but they also had the privilege of interrupting the serjeant if they deemed his presentation of the case unwise or otherwise open to criticism . Mr. Bolland thinks that some of the Year Books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a suggestion that is of value in view of the obscurity surrounding the authorship of these reports . As usual , the cases throw considerable light upon provincial life and manners in medieval England . A T the age of eighty-seven , Henry Vignaud , " President de la Societe des Americanistes , Conseiller Honoraire de l'Ambassade Americaine , Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres ( prix Loubat , 1916 ) . " is publishing a substantial volume from his lifetime study of the Discovery of America , which he shared with faithful service in the American Embassy of Paris . This American , who modestly describes himself as of " old Creole family " ? it came to Louisiana with Bienville more than two hundred years ago  --  was already teaching in his native city of New Orleans in 1852 . His very complete books on the history of Columbus down to the discovery of America have been published in French for reasons of wider diffusion among scholars  --  for they are the books of special scholars . Until now , they furnish the fullest repertory and analysis of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learned French Academy rewarded with its prize , is carried on by this new work , " Americ Vespuce-1451-1512 ? bibliography , life , voyages , discoveries , attribution of name to America , his authentic and contested relations " ( Paris : E. Leroux ) . The book , of more than 400 pages , was in press a year ago , but war has delayed its publication long enough for its author to appreciate in a kind note recent documentary studies published at Princeton University by Professor Northup . The ghost of Vespucius will not down . T HE extent of the work may be judged by those familiar with Vignaud 's analytical method of documentary exposition from a brief indication of the contents . A first part has seven chapters ( over 100 pages ) of critical bibliography of Sources . The second part ( nearly as long ) devotes thirteen chapters to the study of the life and voyages of Vespucius . The third part ( not much shorter ) studies the attribution of the name of Vespucius to America , first South and then North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to universal acceptance . The fourth and last part ( of equal length ) reprints the texts of the authentic writings in which Vespucius gave account of his voyages and of those which are merely attributed to him with more or less foundation . There is the usual complete index of subjects , names , and authors cited . Mr. Vignaud has written a " vindication of Vespucius . " What this is likely to be those who have read the volumes on Columbus may easily gather from the following paragraph : We may say without any exaggeration that the greater part , if not all , the criticisms made against the work of Vespucius were inspired most of all by the chimerical fear that , if the discoveries which he claimed were veritable , Columbus would be diminished by just so much . Nothing is less true . Vespucius landed on the American mainland before Columbus , but no importance is to be attached to this fact , which was due to the hazard of circumstances and was only a consequence of the first discoveries of the great Genoese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his sureness of judgment , his critical clearsightedness , his knowledge of older geography . These made him the first to see and to maintain that the world discovered by Columbus was a New World entirely distinct from Asia . With this indisputable fact we may ask if the great honor ( of naming America ) which the Gymnasium of the Vosges bestowed on Vespucius is undeserved . W E are reminded of the mildew that always attacks books in India during the monsoon season in taking up C. F. Monkshood 's " The Less Familiar Kipling and Kiplingana " ( E. P. Dutton ; $2 net ) . Somehow there is a pathetic feeling lurking among these pages that Mr. Monkshood had grown impatient of the long-awaited time when the halcyon days that marked the first decade of our century could be recalled : then it was that editors laid betswith each other , and perpetually lost , in order to keep the magic name of Rudyard Kipling out of the " copy . " But the present generation of readers has never known the taste we once had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of the Saxon race governing half the savage world , and yet finding , as a Victorian Viceroy once put it , time to drink their tea . None could write a more effective " Envoi " on the passing of this taste , perhaps like his clever lines on the " three-decker " novel , than Rudyard Kipling himself , and somehow Mr. Monkshood 's meagre collection of literary trivialities misses the opportunity . For Kipling lovers of the first or Indian period , there is a minimum of interest contained in these pages ; and the enthusiast will miss , as we did , the lines that Kipling addressed to his lecture-manager , Major Pond , when the American tour was suddenly abandoned at Buffalo , or the better known verses to the late Admiral Robley Evans , or among the newspaper gleanings the clever Canadian verses celebrating Kipling 's recovery from illness and his honorary doctorate from McGill University . On the whole , we regret to remind Mr. Monkshood of the fatal fickleness of public taste , that his little book of salvage is twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to " The Inn of Dis- ... enchantment " ( Houghton Mifflin ; $1.25 ) , by Lisa Ysaye ? a bitter sweet flavor that leaves one 's palate questioning to the end . Each essay is intended to be cynical , but so slyly and gently that the result is , in the main , pleasure . All the little misunderstandings of life , all the egoistic failures in insight into others ' moods and motives , all the errings and waywardnesses and disharmonies and disenchantments are here fondled by the author and made acceptable to the reader . Many of these little essays are sombre , but none are bitter  --  though a trace of bitterness lurks in several , such as " The New Leaf , " a wild acorn flavor that lingers . The personal essay always tends to be " well bred . " These essays are avowedly so , with their old-fashioned formalities and their staid characters , the Gentleman in Gray and the Lady in Blue . W E have heard of Wordsworth as a lost leader , we heard lamentations over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a counterweight it is pleasant to read Dr. A. V. Dicey 's essay on " The Statesmanship of Wordsworth " ( Oxford University Press ; $1.80 net ) . Dr. Dicey professes to have had in mind the circumstances of the present crisis while studying the poet 's ideas during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period . Naturally . But his essay is no mere tract for the times . His measured judgment of the Revolution is in itself a piece of extraordinarily sound and lucid writing , and , though he makes no pretence to literary criticism , his whole treatment of Words-worth 's prose and verse is , in the larger sense , critical writing of a high order . His thesis is to minimize the supposed break in the poet 's social convictions , and to show how sound and wide was his general understanding of international politics . I N " The Top of the Wine-Jar " ( Sherman , French ; $1.50 ) , Livingston Stebbins has made a book out of extremely short selections  --  averaging less than half a page  --  from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is arranged under a dozen heads , on such topics as God , Religion , and Immortality ; Oracles and Counsels ; Civics , Patriotism , and Heroism ; Kindness to Animals ; Music , Art , and Beauty . After the author 's warning , in one of the selections , that the critic is " a nuisance , " one hesitates to pass from the haven of exposition to the perilous seas of criticism , but the fact is that the reviewer does not share with Mr. Stebbins the ardent admiration expressed in the Introduction . Dr. Marvin , once a physician and a Congregational minister , and the author of a dozen books on various themes , is , one can not but feel , an admirable character of a type all too rare in our democracy , our land of " glorified mobrule , " as Dr. Marvin chooses to call it ; but one can scarcely say more than that . Here are enthusiasm , idealism , moral energy , but not a commanding point of view , not unusual insight . The best things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout , such as the sentence , " Unconditioned loyalty to any country is treason to mankind , " and a few of the poems , such as " A New England Housewife , " which is somewhat doubtfully classified under " Wit and Humor " : Through all her life ' t was dust and only dust her thought engaged ; Some dust was real , but more her nimble mind supplied ; The poet 's art she scorned , the painter 's skill despised ; For dust she lived , and , dying , " Dust to dust ! " she cried . P ROF . H. T. Fowler , the author of an admirable work on the literature of ancient Israel , has written an excellent primer for Bible classes under the title " The Origin and Growth of the Hebrew Religion " ( University of Chicago Press ; $1 ) . He follows strictly the line of recent critical discussion of the religion of the Old Testament , and his arrangement of the material is clear and interesting . His discrimination between the higher and lower sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy with the better thought of the prophets and psalmists , and so to guide the student into an intelligent view of the development of the Israelitish conscience . While avoiding unnecessary details he gives references to standard works on the subjects discussed by means of which the scholar may follow fuller investigation in the nature of this remarkable religious evolution .
