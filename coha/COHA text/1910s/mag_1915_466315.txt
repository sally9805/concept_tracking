THE writer of fiction may be said , with only a pardonable exaggeration , to put himself in the place of the Almighty . Venturing to create a man , he shapes the character of his creature , molds and refines his brain , and prepares a living instrument by which events and circumstances can be controlled or directed toward a reasonable destiny . if he is a bad writer the results deceive only children . But if he is modest enough to study life and imitate it , then he shares the mysterious power of creative evolution and earns his tribute of respect . The teacher also feels ? at least in his remote subconsciousness ? that he shares or should share this power . He , too , must make character , brains , efficiency ; and if the part he plays is relatively small , at least when he labors over a boy in whom the man is still uncrcated , he is engaged in no work of the imagination merely . Except for the parent he is the only professional on the job ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the result . The praise usually goes to the amateur elements in the task ? friends , college spirit , the rigors of athletics , and environment ; the blame falls upon the professional educators ? the parents and himself . I am not much concerned with the justice or the injustice of his claim for services rendered . This is one of the questions that must go up to the Supreme Court of the Last Judgment , for no sublunary arbitrator can disentangle the evidence . I merely wish to explain the earnestness with which each college professor accepts his responsibility , and asks , as he looks over his entering classes , " Who among you shall be saved ? " He means , of course , " Who among you shall be educated ? " ? that he identifies salvation and education is due to VOL . CXXXL ? No. 753. - 53 his professional bias , and may be taken for what it is worth . When a college education became fashionable , when the little file of the sons of ministers and lawyers entering the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sons ? rich , poor , stupid , brilliant , ambitious , and the opposite ? his question first became acute . Now it is burning . Shall the colleges spend their abundant energies and their great , if not too effective , powers upon the few fit , or upon the mass , the multitude of the mediocre. ? Shall we seek quality or quantity ? I know that . the question has been answered a hundred times in history ; but it has not been answered for twentieth - century America . For America just now provides the greatest exhibit the world has ever seen of successful mediocrity . There are no contented poor on this side of the Atlantic except in the backwaters of the East . There is no single class content to recognize the intellectual or material superiority of the rest . Every one is pushing onward and upward . The poor man , as we are told every day , may be rich to-morrow ; the ignorant goes to night-school and will learn ; the drummer hopes to run the business for which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as that he plows ; the clerk will be a partner in the firm . Even in the universities no institutions like the fellowships of Oxford and Cambridge can exist . In America not even the scholar is willing to stop at such a position . He must go on ? or try to go on ? as far as the rest . Never before has a nation exhibited so complete a spectacle of millions of insects all swarming upward toward the light . This view may be optimism . / do not think so . For in nine hundred cases out of a thousand the goal of all this striving is mediocrity . Your son nowadays does not hope to be President . He climbs toward a much lower round in the ladder . The laborer wishes to reach the middle class . The middle class wishes to be richer . The upper class ? if we have one hopes to make sure of its perch . Our cities reflect the spirit . They rise like the wind from the empty prairie or the dense forest into a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Chicago , and then stick at a level of ugliness which is not the less ugly for being metropolitan . Our homes show it . A semi-colonial with porcelain tubs and hardwood floors hounds the imagination of all but the artistic temperament or the millionaire . Our literature shows it most distinctly of all . American newspapers and magazines maintain a higher average of composition than is to be found elsewhere , perhaps , and seldom rise above that average . We show it ourselves ; for consider how much the speech of one American business man resembles that of another . You can sojourn for days in smoking-cars , hotel corridors , or cafes without encountering an idea which descends to the na ? ve ignorance of the peasant or rises above mediocrity . Even our multimillionaires , the characteristic " great men " of America , although in the manipulation of natural resources they have risen above the ordinary , seem to be mediocre as personalities . The newspapers are generous of space to every episode in their domestic history ; yet what could be flatter than their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile ; what less illuminating than their comments on success in life ; what less interesting than their lives when once the millions have been made ? As a nation we are mediocre . This may be pessimism . I do not think so . It is the very essence of the American experiment that a vast body of men and women should he raised as a whole to a level of comfort , of intelligence , of happiness , which , if far below the best , should he also far above the worst . And this involves , this requires an enormous increase in the total amount of mediocrity . Democracy and free immigration combined inevitably make for such a result . It had to come ; and our day 's work is still to bring more andmore of the illiterate , the incapable , the unfortunate up to the level of the mediocre , even though the burden weighs us down , and the result seems to point toward a future that is drab and dull and commonplace . No race can escape from its circumstances , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance of inheritance in a rich and undeveloped continent , are ours . I would not dear so freely in generalizations if I did not feel that they were self-evident ; nor would I write of this subject at all if I did not believe that it lay on the very heart of the American colleges . I do not suppose that the college is more vital in American life than any one of a dozen agencies committed by nature to idealism and usefulness . But I think that no individual confronts more inevitably the problem of the mediocre than the professor in an American college . For see the mass of undergraduates that , drawn from all the social classes , but chiefly from those that have already attained mediocrity , are flung at his head . Among them , to be sure , are a few of the brilliantly ambitious who will use more than can he given to them ; but in far greater numbers are the brilliant and unambitious who will use nothing unless it is forced upon them , the stupid but well-meaning who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unmeaning who must be cudgeled along after the rest . Where shall the bewildered teacher apply his goad ? Whom shall he permit to fall behind ? How shall he keep pace with the leaders without scattering the herd ? There can be no question as to personal choice . I have heard more than one man of experience remark that there is no pleasure in teaching an undergraduate whose grade is below seventy-five per cent. ; and , while I do not believe it , I have seldom heard the statement contradicted . Indeed , in the universities , the best scholars on the faculty , unless they love teaching for itself or are controlled by necessity or circumstance , gravitate generally toward small and selected classes or graduate work . And it would be easy and pleasant for all of us to concentrate upon the exceptional students ? to educate them , even if the rest should go unwashed by the waters of knowledge , When circumstances are favorable , the forcing of a needle into soft iron is not more difficult than to push one really new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfavorable , if there are thirty brains of all ranges of capability to be manipulated , the difficulty is multiplied . can give one or two men with good minds and a good environment behind them . can give them , if they want it , a comprehension of the strange and moving literary force called romanticism , which , springing from obscure reactions in the psychology of a race , spreads through thought and speech and action until it transmutes into literature and becomes a rosy semblance of the life men would desire to lead in a world shaped by their imagination . Or I can try to give the same conception to all , knowing that half the minds will be as blank as before , that most of the remainder will return confused and broken images of the truth perhaps less valuable than blankness , and that the few fit will profit less , because , of necessity , less has been given them . The literal-minded will probably reply , " Do n't try to teach romanticism . " Well , I do not ? to elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem ? the solution will be the same . It would be easiest , it would be pleasantest , it would seem to be most efficient in the American colleges , to sacrifice the mediocre to the able , to dismiss quantity and hold fast to quality . And yet every one knows that this is precisely what we do not do . Every one knows , or can find out for the asking , that in our schools and all our undergraduate departments nine-tenths of our labor is spent upon those least able or least likely to profit by the results . The cynic will remark that our perversity is due to the attitude of the powers that be , who , in the contemporary college , are almost as sensitive to the merits of quantity as the " boosters " of a Western town . The cynic would be partly right . We are still in the pioneering stage in the college world ? or think that we are ? where sheer numbers seem necessary in order to hold down the investment . And yet the pressure sup posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes large is so much Jess ? at least in colleges of a high rank ? than is popularly supposed , that I am inclined to think this motive unimportant in the problem . It is not a crude desire to keep the college " big " ; nor is it weak human nature , hesitating to eliminate a nuisance when that nuisance is a friendly , fresh-spirited boy ; it is the American passion for democracy that makes us lavish our energies upon the multitude of the mediocre . For a belief that the right to an education is as universal as freedom is ingrained in the American mind . The college professor may never have recognized this as the cause of his perverse devotion to the mediocre . He may never have said , he may never have thought , " If the republic is to be saved it is by raising the average of intelligence : But his actions prove that somewhere in his subconsciousness this belief is stirring . it is this hidden passion that manifests itself in the attitude I have called perverse . This passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable quality in our whole educational system , When I glimpse its subterranean motives I know why my heart is sore if the ninety-and-nine average men are unmoved by my teaching , even though the hundredth man has responded beyond my hopes . But when I calculate its effects I realize that it is responsible for some of the difficulties in which American education flounders . It is the quintessence of a noble idealism ; but we have followed it blindly ; and sometimes it has led us into the mire . Everywhere but in so-called graduate work , and in some measure even there , this desire to do something for every one has made us neglect the exceptional man and actually favor the mediocre . There is no question , I think , as to the fact , and a comparison of the best products of English and Continental training-schools with our own graduates will bring it home . They permit fewer men to call themselves educated ; but these men are more highly trained , more efficient intellectually , than ours . In science , in scholarship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the past our deficiencies were due to inferior equipment and less extensive resources . But now we can offer neithee poverty nor immaturity as an excuse . Our failure to provide the best possible education for the best men can be attributed only to our desire to give everyman his equal chance , a desire which , more deeply interpreted , means that we have preferred universal mediocrity to an aristocracy of brains and a commonalty of ignorance . We educate a class , not individuals . We boast of the type , of the average our colleges produce . In my own university one hears far less of Jonathan Edwards , of Evans , of Calhoun , or of Stedman than of the " Yale man . " This indirect evidence , I think , is even more significant than the results of matching Harvard with Oxford or Columbia with Berlin . Are we wrong ? Am I absurd when I feel that my class must come forward as a body ? the lazy millionaire 's son , the earnest child of an uncouth immigrant , the able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them , or the year 's work is not well done ? I do not think so ? for I believe in the American experiment . I believe in the passion for democracy ? even when misguided , even when blind . But it is blind . That is the chief criticism one has to offer . The French of the Revolution were so afraid of aristocracy that in the new republic they reduced all titles to " citizen . " We have been so afraid of slighting the democracy that in the colleges we have reduced all education to an average . The needless folly of limiting ourselves to such a programme is manifest . We have energy enough and to spare , and money to make the mare go faster and farther than any one has yet driven her . It is perfectly possible to give signal ability its proper opportunity without failing in our duty to the multitudinous mediocre . This is not an argument for aristocracy in education . It is common sense . For we need leaders in the American experiment quite as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of development we shall need them more . The establishment of " honor " schools and " honor " courses is a tardy and so far rather imperfect recognition of this fact . I have no programme to propose fol their development . The details must be worked out in the class-room , not in an essay . But when we see that our admirable loyalty to the democratic idea ! has held us back at the same time that it has kept us true to destiny , we shall put more intelligence into our reforms . The college must continue to be an institution for the increase of mediocrity , for mediocrity is infinitely preferable to ignorance ; but it must also provide the exceptional man with the training by which he alone can profit . Like the Yankee contrivance which can be used for both ladder and chair , it must perform both the functions demanded of it , even at the risk of being less than best in one of them . The worst fault , however , into which our age-long service of mediocrity has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The college has borrowed the vice from every-day American life . For example , the most deadly weapon in the yellow journalist 's armory is the term " high-brow . " A politician may be called " grafter , " " boss , " or even " muckraker , " and escape unscratched ; but if he is denounced as a " high-brow , " and the label sticks , his career is ended . A playwright or a novelist may be written down as " cheap , " he may he said to plagiarize , he may be shown to be vicious or unclean , without serious damage to his reputation ; but let him be proved a " high- brow " and the public will fly from him as if he were a book-agent . Now the widespread American belief that knowledge makes a man impractical is responsible for some of this curious odium ; but far more is due to our servile deference to mediocrity . The weight of public opinion is usually against the expert , the specialist , the thinker , the exceptional man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is always mediocre ; and there arc few among us who do not in this respect yield somehow , somewhere , to public opinion . The doctor distrusts the advanced political theorist , the politician distrusts the advanced dramatist , the dramatist sneers at the innovations of science . We are all made timid by the enormous majorities which uphold mediocrity . The college is like a salt-pool on the ocean shore , where young sea-things are growing in the gentle wash of waves that come from the world without . There is a public opinion in college which is as like the public opinion without as a micro-cosm can be to a macrocosm . And just as the public opinion without favors mediocrity in everything but making money , so thispublic opinion encourages i mediocrity in everything but athletics and social advance . No need to dwell upon this . The fact is better known than the gradual change which has come over college ideals in the last decade , until now the minority in favor of culture , knowledge , mental keenness , and other attributes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists , and its burden weighs heavily . It is curiously difficult for a teacher who is no mental machine , but human , to estimate at his true intellectual value a fine young fellow who already possesses the push " and the " punch " which are still sufficient for a reasonable financial success in America . It is enormously difficult to insist upon standards of intellectual accomplishment above the mediocre level with which the public is content . Let the graduate be deficient in some category that even mediocrity has mastered ? say , spelling , or letter-writing , or punctuation ? and opinion howls him down ; but in the higher departments of theoretical knowledge the world outside is quite content with a fifty or sixty per cent . efficiency , and deprecates more as an accumulation of material not readily transmutable into cash . II All this the teacher feels , and as his class become personalities to him , he inclines further and further toward their own opinion , the college world 's opinion , everybody 's opinion of what a student should do and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unrecognized pas ; span for democracy , the subconscious feeling that it his ditty to raise this dead-weight as much as may be permitted ' Ium , enters to complicate the situation . He begins to overestimate mediocrity , knowing that he must serve it . His pride dictates , " The results , all things considered , are not so bad . " He blames himself for a meticulous idealism . He makes the fatal error of assenting to mediocrity , and thereby ends his career as an agent for raising it . Or he violently reacts against the service required of him , antagonizes his class , and becomes equally valueless , except for graduate work . Here is a familiar college tragedy . It is easy enough to fulminate from without against the " low standards " of the colleges . Try to raise them and you will find that America is on the other end of the lever . It is difficult to meet such a situation without truckling to mediocrity ; it is very difficult to fight the mediocre while loving democracy . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less if those chiefly concerned ? the faculty , the undergraduates , and the parents ? could see the situation for what it is , and , so far as weak human nature permits , direct themselves accordingly . The faculty , unfortunately , are not exempt from the circumstances of the age in America . If you prick a college professor he will show mediocrity as frequently as his fellow-Christian . But he has this advantage ? his profession must bear the brunt of the struggle to attain that comfortable average of intelligence which the American experiment demands . His profession must also sweat and toil to train the leaders without whom that experiment must fail . If responsibility breeds strength . then he can not remain mediocre . But it is nc : : of his occasional mediocrity that I complain ; it is of his frequent and unnecessary lack of vision , his failure to see that both of these ends must be sought . As a class , the teaching profession is most reprehensible for the first of the two errors of democracy which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional man . Those faculty meetings whose rumblings echoed in our undergraduate world present to the philosophic mind a spectacle of earnest scholars anguishing through precious evening hours over Reilley 's deficiencies in history , or the hopeless befuddlement of Jenkinson in the presence of untranslated French . The capable undergraduate who is doing his work , and beginning to profit by his education , has little place in their deliberations , which , to paraphrase Dog-berry , seem often to have for text , " If a man can learn , let him alone lest he learn more ; but if he can learn nothing , let him be taught . " And yet beneath this haze of cross-purposes there lies , as I have tried to show , an intuitive perception of a great service . They have pledged themselves , these scholars , to the democracy , and nobly , if sometimes blindly , they aft laboring in its behalf . When their vision clears they will spend not more , perhaps , but certainly as much energy upon the intellectually predestined as upon the mentally unregenerate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty under the second count of the general indictment . They cater to mediocrity . As I talk to the loyal , energetic undergraduate outside of the classroom , where he is not afraid to be himself , and as I meet his parents in the course of every-day life , I am convinced that here again the difficulty is quite as much a defect of vision as the pressure of unescapable circumstance . If the undergraduate could see the situation as it is , what would happen ? If he could see what the time spirit sees , that he has consented to he part of the dead-weight of crude Americanism , to be raised with infinite pains to an intellectual level only a little higher , where he may view the world only a little more broadly , with but a trifle more of truth ! Would he be content with his part ? I doubt it . For if there is one thing experience in an American university teaches it is this , that the undergraduate ( who , after all , is a picked man , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he seems ? is not nearly so mediocre as the education he seems to desire . And the parents ! ? if they could glimpse what even the college sees : that when they send us their children with injunctions to think well , but not too well , they are bowing down to the leaden calf of mediocrity . If only they could realize that their boys are held back by such influence , are caught fast in the sands of mediocrity ! If they could know that the college which loves their sons and daughters fears them often enough , as counterweights in the slow uplift to which it is pledged ! If they saw all this , would they be content with their part in American education ? More than one encouraging experience makes me sure of the response . And we need their aid ? the aid of the parents and the aid of the undergraduates ; for , until democracy reaches the level of its opportunities , or is proved a failure , the problem of mediocrity will continue to exist . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not solve it by slighting the able . We can not escape it by pretending that mediocrity is good enough . We must bear the burden . But as we push on toward a distant and uncertain victory a clearer sight of the path we have chosen would save us from stumbling blindly and stupidly beneath its weight .
