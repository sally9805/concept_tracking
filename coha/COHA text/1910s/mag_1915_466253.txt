HAVING served in the American Legations at Paris , Vienna , and Ma , drid , John Hay came home in the autumn of 1870 , to try his luck on the staff of a Chicago new spaper. hilst stopping in New York , however , Whitelaw Reid induced him to write a leader for the Tribune , and Horace Greeley said of it that of the million editorials he had read this was the most brilliant . For four years Hay worked on the Tribune , and although his articles , being anonymous , were seldom recognized as his by the larger public , they gave him a high reputation in the inner circle of journalism . But he published two books ? Pike County Ballads and the delightful volume , Castilian Days ? which carried his name through the country . Having married Miss Clara Stone in 1875 , he removed to Cleveland , Ohio , where her father was a prosperous financier , and there he passed several years , often hampered for months at a time by ill-health . In 1879 , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Assistant Secretary of State , which he held until Garfield 's administration was organized . Then he took charge of the New York Tribune during Whitelaw Reid 's absence , and finally settled down to compile , with John G. Nicolay , the monumental biography of Lincoln . For a change , he amused himself by writing novels without disclosing his name . The Bread-Winners , which appeared at first as a serial achieved great popularity . Democracy ? which I have good reason to believe was by him , although actual proof is lacking had success , both in America and in Eng-land , among more exacting readers . From 1885 on , Hay made Washington his home , building there the great redhouse which looks across Lafayette Square to the White House . As a spectator from outside , he watched public affairs closely . Many persons wondered i why it was that , in spite of his rich experience and his many attainments , not to speak of his personal charm and tact , no administration had the wit to enlist him . The reasons were clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supporters , no newspaper organs ; and he shrank from pushing himself forward , believing that it was only decent to wait to be asked . Nevertheless , he was a stanch party man . From his youth up he accepted the Republican doctrines zealously , insisting that the badness of individual Republicans did not affect the goodness of the doctrines themselves . He contributed liberally to the party funds ; he spoke as a matter of duty in behalf of the presidential candidates . In private , his sense of humor played with the inconsistencies of the high tariff which his party had made their idol , but he recognized that every great institution , no matter how beneficent , can be viewed satirically . In 1896 Mr. Hanna secured Major McKinley 's nomination at the Republican Convention . Into the feuds of the Ohio Republicans which preceded the nomination Hay had not entered , for he was never a factional partisan . Indeed , he went abroad in May ? perhaps on purpose to escape from the wrangling ? and spent two months in travel . During his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlighten the British public as to McKinley 's prospects and deserts , and i he used his personal influence to renew the friendly relations between England and the linked States which had been wrenched by President Cleveland 's Message on the Venezuela Boundary dispute . On June 7 , 1896 , Hay writes from Paris to his wife in Washington an account of his brief stay in London . At a dinner-party , he says : E. was placed between Joseph Chamberlain and Sir William Harcourt , and had a very merry time . Old Sir W. flirted with her in his most elephantine manner , and occasionally he and C. would fight across her , On polities , in a very savage though courteous manner . It was a chance that a girl of her age rarely gets to see the greatest politicians of the time in their hours of ease . After dinner , in the smoking-room , I sat between Lord C. and Chamberlain , and had some very interesting talk with each of them . My talk with Chamberlain was especially important . I was urging him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he said they were doing all they could , but that Venezuela would not treat separately now that she had been encouraged so by the United States . Ile hopes that both countries may agree to arbitration . My letter to the Times appears to have been read more than anything I ever wrote . Everybody I meet speaks of it ? most with approval , but some thinking I am wrong in being so sure of McKinley 's nomination . S. and the Herald have greatly influenced people 's minds against McKinley . But next week will show them . In fact , the little Herald of this morning virtually gives it up . The Chronicle was after me for several days for an interview . I fought it off till the last day , and then concluded I might as well say a good word for McKinley . I inclose it to you . It is wrong in many particulars , but the general impression is all right . I did it to reach the immense Radical constituency of the Chronicle . It is Henry Norman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the latest political news from home . In a letter to Mr. Henry Adams , to whom he always wrote most intimately , he says , on July z6th : One more human being I have seen , if it is proper to call an argento-maniac human . Moreton Frewent bore down on me in St. James 's Street , looking very well and prosperous , and grasped me by the hand , and told me to put all my money on Bryan ; that it was a walk-over ; that betting on Bryan was simply picking up money . The cause of his rapture was that he had just read that the Goldbug Democrats were going to nominate another candidate . It is a good working theory , I suppose , that the more candi- , At that time the most conspicuous British advocate of bimetallism.dates a party has , the surer it is to win , but I am too old and feeble to follow the argument . . . All right ! I have lived under many sorts of Presidents in my time , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can show a left hind foot of a snow-white rabbit killed in the dark of the moon by a black dog I am not going to waste my money betting on him . To Mrs. Hay , on July 31st , he sent further news of his last days in London : Monday I called at the Embassy . Mr. Bayard was away , and Robert Roosevelt asked me if I would like to go to the House of Commons , where he had an engagement to meet General G. I accepted with alacrity , and went down at once . He got us excellent seats in the front row of the gallery . We heard the questions and answers , and then heard speeches by Lab , uchere , Curzon , and Harcourt on the Uganda Bill , which were extremely interesting . Roosevelt then told me Sir Wm . Harcourt and Balfour both wanted to see us . So we went to Harcourt 's room ( he has a room to himself as leader of the Opposition ) and saw him and Balfour for a few minutes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( not knowing him ) , but both were anxious to talk to me about McKinley and Venezuela . I had a talk with Balfour , and Sir Wm. made an appointment with me at B. 's For the next day . He went at once into the matter . Balfour had told him nearly every word I had said , and he had remembered it all . These English public men have wonderful memories . We had a talk of an hour of great interest and importance . He thinks the Venezuela matter ought to he settled now . He asked me to say to Chamberlain and Curzon what I had said to him . He thought it would do a great deal of good . In urging British public men to settle the Venezuela dispute as soon as possible , Hay was performing a patriotic duty ; for he warned them not to expect that a Republican administration would disavow President Cleveland 's stand in the matter . From the steamer , he wrote the following amusing letter to Mr. Henry Adams , with whom he loved to chaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporter : The days have been gray and muggy ; the air clasps you like an affectionate devil-fish . The boat is filled with highly respectable ' Mr. Balfour was then First Lord of the Treasury . New York Democrats who say they are going to vote for McKinley , and then go below and are sick at the thought of it . Poor things ! I am sorry for them ? I , who would die for McKinley and the Old Flag . Why ca n't they vote for him and like it ? . . At the Embassy in London there was the same wail of despair . Bayard was away , but R. and W. and C. were howling for McKinley , at the same time feeling that they were periling their souls ' salvation by it . Mr. Bryan has much to answer for , driving so many great and good people into the support of Anti-Christ . On the other hand , whisper it soft and low , a good many worthy Republicans are scared blue , along of the Baby Orator of the Platte . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him in London . I am still cheerful , but even in my dauntless ear there murmurs the fragment of an old Saga which says : " In politics the appeal to the lower motives is generally for the moment successful .

I talked with Hanna and some of the Executive Committee , and while there is nothing like dread of defeat , there is a clear comprehension that Bryan will get the votes of a good many others of his kind , and that it will require more work than we thought necessary last spring to beat him . But the work will be done and he will drop into congenial oblivion next November . I had a long and serious talk with Sir William Harcourt by his own appointment , the day before I left , in which he referred , as you do , to the idea the government seem to have , of the advisability of delay . I assured him , almost in your very words , that it was a great mistake : that McKinley couldnot yield on such a position taken by Cleveland . Until the end of the summer the Republicans imagined that they could win with ease . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of speeches made and the distances traveled by the candidate , was beginning to cause alarm by September 8th , when Hay wrote to Mr. Adams : What a dull and serious campaign we are having ! The Boy Orator makes only one speech ? but he makes it twice a day . There is no fun in it . He simply reiterates the unquestioned truths that every man who has a clean shirt is a thief and ought to he hanged ; that there is no goodness or wisdom except among the illiterate and criminal classes ; that gold is vile ; that silver is lovely and holy ; in short , very much such speeches as you would make if you were here . He has succeeded in scaring the Goldbugs out of their five wits ; if he had scared them a little , they would have come down handsome to Hanna . But he has scared them so blue that they think they had better keep what they have got left in their pockets against the evil day . Your friend George Fred Williams weeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appear to get reconciled to the kicks which they are giving him . He is , so far as I know , the only blossom of the Mugwump garden who has gone wrong this year . On October 4th Hay writes again in his bantering vein : What you say about the Majah is all I could ask , but the way you say it pains me . Your head is right , as usual ; but how about your heart ? Is it up to the G. test ? Would you die for the Majah ? If you will do that , and send a certificate , you will he all right . We really can not admit any less rigorous test .

A fortnight later ( October 2oth ) , writing from Cleveland , Hay sends this significant letter . He had taken the stump for the Republican ticket , and had conIFI . C. Lodge . ferred , by invitation , with Major McKinley , who , throughout the campaign , stayed at his home in Canton , Ohio , and there received visiting delegations and individuals on his lawn : The days succeed and resemble each other considerably . Cleveland has ceased the ennobling pursuit of the dollar ( 3704 grains fine ) , and has given itself over to two weeks ' debauch of politics . No business is done in the mart . We roughen our throats all night shouting for the Majah . The ante-election scare which I have observed with more or less detachment for twenty years has set in with unusual vigor . Most of my friends think Bryan will be elected and we shall all be hanged to the lampions of Euclid Avenue . I have not yet made up my mind to this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to placate the mob by saying I am next-door neighbor to your brother Brooks 's brother . I spent yesterday with the Majah . I had been dreading it for a month , thinking it would be like talking in a boiler-factory . But he met me at the station , gave me meat , and . calmly leaving his shouting worshipers in the front yard , took me up-stairs and talked for two hours as calmly and serenely as if we were summer boarders in Bethlehem at a loss for means to kill time . I was more struck than ever with his mask . It is a genuine Italian ecclesiastical face of the fifteenth century . And there are idiots who think Mark Hanna will run him ! You are making the mistake of your life in not reading my speech . There is good stuff in it ? to live and to die by . If you read it in a reverent and prayerful spirit , it might make you a postmaster . You are not interested in political news . If you were , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and do n't you forget it . The Republicans won the election , but the popular vote was close enough to justify the anxiety which the Democratic candidate had inspired . Mr. McKinley had great difficulty in forming his Cabinet ? so many conflicting interests had to be satisfied . In their conversation at Canton the appointment of John Hay as Secretary of State was frankly discussed , and it seems certain that McKinley wished to make it . Hay had not been identified with any of the Republican factions ; he was experienced ; he would be classed among the statesmen rather than among the politicians ; and he was personally attractive to the President- elect . The exigencies of Ohio politics , however , tied his hands . He insisted on giving Mark Hanna , to whom he owed everything , a Cabinet portfolio , but as Mr. Hanna declined this , it was decided to appoint John Sherman Secretary of State , and to transfer his seat in the Senate to Hanna . To John Hay was allotted the ranking ambassadorship ? that to the Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had many friends , pleased Hay . On April 6 , 1897 , he writes Mr. Henry White , the First Secretary of the London Embassy : I see by to-day 's papers you have arrived , and have already taken over the Embassy . I see also that Mr. Bayard ' is booked for an ovation on the 7th of May . I do not know quite what that means , or how long he is to he in London before he gets his loving-cup . But all this can be left until I see you . I have already declined four public dinners and speeches . I hope , if you are consulted in regard to any invitations to such functions , that you will , where it is practicable , dissuade our kind friends from sending such invitations . I do not intend to begin a campaign of speech-making the moment I land , and I should much prefer not to be asked .

From a letter to Senator Lodge we get this glimpse of his landing : If you had been at Southampton , you would not have had the pleasure of seeing Oom Flendrik2 gloating over my sufferings . He so thoroughly disapproved of the whole proceeding that he fled to the innermost recesses of the ship ? some authorities say to the coal-bunkers ? out of sight and sound of the whole revolving exchange of compliments . Henry James stood by , and heard it all , and then asked , in his mild , philosophical way , " What impression does it make on your mind to have these insects creeping about and saving things to you ? " . . I have declined twenty-six invitations to Senator Thomas F. Bayard , United States Minister to Great Britain , 1893-97. 2Hay 's nickname for Mr. Adams . eat dinner and make speeches .

The Jubilee is gone like a Welsh-rabbit dream . It was an explosion of loyalty that amazed John Bull himself . What a curious thing it is , that there has been no king in England since Elizabeth of special distinction ? most of them far worse than mediocre ? only the foreigner , William III. , of any merit ? and yet the monarchical religion has grown day by day till the Queen is worshiped as more than mortal , and the Prince will be more popular still when he accedes . . .. I see nobody but everybody , and that is a diet of husks . Several important questions were pending between the United States and Great Britain . The dispute over the Bering Sea fisheries ; the attempt to pacify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bimetallism ; the conclusion of the arbitration in the Venezuela affair ; and the passage of the Dingley Tariff Bill , by which the Republicans reaffirmed their devotion to high protection , all gave the Ambassador work which called for two qualities in which he abounded ? tact and geniality .

Later he speaks of several prominent Americans as resting from the slaughter of grouse , and marking down their pajamas to get them under the Stoo limit . You can go home as a Polynesian prince and pay no duties he adds . Although he was a protectionist , he saw the humor of the almost prohibitive tariff , which limited travelers ' untaxed Vox ..

Before he returned to London in March , the Maine had been blown up in Havana harbor and fire-eaters in the United States were clamoring for war with Spain . The Ambassador set himself to work to propitiate English opinion . His formal instructions came , of course , from Washington ; but it depended largely on his tact whether the British government looked favorably on them or not . At the outbreak of the war , the Continental governments took no pains to disguise their hostility to the United States . The then recent brusque affirmation of the Monroe Doctrine quite naturally exasperated them . On April 5 , 1898 , Hay wrote privately to one of the most influential members of the American Senate : 1 do not know whether you especially value the friendship and sympathy of this country ' England . I think it important and desirable in the present state of things , as it is the only European country whose sympathies are not openly against us . We will not waste time in discussing whether the origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence is beyond question . I find it wherever I go ? not only in the press , but in private conversation .

If we wanted it ? which , of course , we do not ? we could have the practical assistance of the British Navy ? on die do la des principle , naturally . I think , in the near future , this sentiment , even if it amounts to nothing more , is valuable to us . You may think " it is none of my Lula business , " but I think the Senate Committee 's allusion to England in the Hawaii report was not of sufficient use at home to compensate for the jar it gave over here .

You may imagine what it is to me , absolutely without light or instruction , compelled to act from day to day on my own judgment , and at no moment sure of the wishes'of the Department . What I should have done , if the feeling here had been unfriendly instead of cordially sympathetic , it is hard to say . The commonest phrase is here : " I wish you would take Cuba at once . We would n't have stood it this long . " And of course no power on earth would have shown such patience and such scrupulous regard for law . Events now hurried on apace .

I think it an excellent idea . . . . We are all very happy over Dewey 's splendid Sunday 's work at Manila , and anxiously waiting news from Sampson and Schley . If we can carry off one more serious sea-fight , I hope we can then see daylight . 1 detest war , and had hoped I might never see another , but this was as necessary as it was righteous . I have not for two years seen any other issue . How Dewey did wallop them ! he writes to Mr. Adams on May 9th . His luck was so monstrous that it really detracts from his glory .

On May z5th hay sends Senator Lodge the following important report on the situation : Your letter gave me the most gratifying and the most authentic account of the feeling among the leading men in America that 1 Editor of the New York : or voLL'ng Past . I have got from any source . It is is moment of immense importance , not only for the present , but for all the future .

Among the political leaders on both sides I find not only sympathy , but a somewhat eager desire that " the other fellows " shall not seem the more friendly . Chamberlain 's startling speech was partly due to a conversation I had with him , in which I hoped he would not let the opposition have a monopoly of expressions of good-will to America . He is greatly pleased with the reception his speech met with on our side , and says he " do n't care a hang what they say about it on the Continent . " I spend the great part of my time declining invitations to dine and speak . But on the rare occasions when I do go to big public dinners the warmth of the welcome leaves nothing to be desired .

I do not so much mind my friends going into battle , but the fever is a grisly thing to encounter . The next letter to Mr. Adams is dated May 27th . The Ambassador is already looking forward to the end of the war . I have found no trace of the draft of the " little project " which he mentions . I have your yesterday 's letter , and it was a great balm to my self-conceit to know that I held the same views you express as to terms of peace .

In reviewing the war , the American public already recognized how much the United States owed to the good will of Great Britain , and those who were on the inside knew how much the securing of that good will was due to John Hay . To one correspondent who wrote to congratulate him , he re-plied : August 22 , 1898 . Mr DEAR CARNECIE , -I thank you for the Skibo grouse and also for your kind letter .

When Hay wrote this note he was already preparing to go back to Wash- The North American Review , August , ISO . " Distant Possessions ? The Parting of the Ways . " ington to be more than Ambassador . Late in April , John Sherman , Secretary of State , was obliged , owing to the rapid enfeebling of his powers , to resign his office . Hay thus reports the matter in his letter to Mr. Adams of May 9th : Judge Day= is Secretary of State . He did not want it , and the Major McKinley ' had other views . But the crisis was precipitated by a lapse of memory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature that the President had to put in Day without an instant 's delay ? I need nut tell you how much to my relief . Judge Day served throughout the trying summer of the Spanish War . It was commonly understood that , as he found the duties uncongenial , his service was only provisional . So the President appointed him chairman of the United States Peace Commissioners at Paris , and recalled Hay to succeed him in the State Department . The following letters refer to Hay 's leave-takings in England . The first is addressed to his old friend Sir John Clark : OSBORNE , August 30,1898 . ?

I hope , after I am installed in Mr. Mullett 's masterpiece , ' I may count on the same kindness and indulgence for all my shortcomings that you have hitherto shown .

You will understand I have no time to write a letter . I am looking forward to many a long talk with you in the future , with Hay unto Lodge uttering speech , and Lodge unto Hay showing knowledge . To his old chief in the days of the Paris Legation , John Bigelow , who wrote to congratulate him , Hay replied : LONDON September 5 , 1898. -1 am SO tossed about and worried by these unexpected changes in my fortunes that I need a Mr. Speaker to tell me where I am at .

You used to be a little my senior ; 3 now you arc ages younger and stronger than I am . And yet I am going to be Secretary of State for a little while ! Hay 's reluctance was not feigned . He understood not only the volume but the intricacy and ticklishness of the work before him . Some of his intimate friends predicted that he would die or resign within six months ; but his sense of patriotic duty bade him go to the new post , whatever its perils . The last letter I quote is dated London , September 14 , 1898 , and is addressed to Whitelaw Reid , who was just leaving New York to attend the Peace Conference at Paris : We are to cross each other at sea , it appears , and I have been so worried by every wind of destiny since I got your long and delightful letter that I have not answered it , and now the carriage waits to take me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no time to talk to you .
