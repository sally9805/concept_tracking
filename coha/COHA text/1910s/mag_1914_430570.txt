I N each of the nations now engaged in the European conflict , a large number of people of all classes ? the vast majority of people of all classes ? did not want war , and would have done all in their power to avert it : for they knew , more or less completely , the price of war ; and they knew also , more or less completely , in spite of the inadequacy of all the churches through all the centuries , that war can not possibly be reconciled with Christianity , with civilization , with humanity , decency , and the most rudimentary common sense . But when hostilities had actu ally been commenced , each of the nations was practically a unit with regard to the prosecution of the war to its final and terrible conclusion . With the exception of a few professional agitators or eccentric fanatics , who have gleaned scant sympathy for their antics , every citizen or subject of each country has placed implicit faith in the justice of the nation 's cause and has been prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Canada , Australia , South Africa , India , and all the great and small oversea commonwealths , colonies and dominions of Great Britain have come forward in the time of stress to offer new strength to the United Kingdom and new pledges of a United Empire . In the Fatherland , every man and woman has accepted the issue as inevitable , has held the cause of Kaiser and country as sacred and supreme , and has shrunk from no sacrifice to ensure the fulfilment of the long-cherished dream of victory , security and expansion . In France , where the ghosts of the dead that von 1Ioltke required have not yet ceased to walk o ' nights , ( they will  |p473  have new companionship now ) , there is no doubt in the mind of man , woman or child that la Patrie is waging a holy war for liberty and honor against the ruthless aggression of an arrogant and pitiless foe . In Russia , Austria , Servia , and whatever countries may have been dragged into the vortex week by week , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national cause and the calculated injustice of the enemy 's plans . And in Belgium , always the victim of her unneighborly neighbors ' feuds , a people dedicated to peace has been flung into the hell of butchery and flames . Verily , Macbeth hath murther 'd sleep ! In these United States , there has been little attempt to transcend race-limitations , so far as concerns the aliens within our borders , and those hyphenated-Americans who have rushed with virulence into a wordy warfare , intent , not on establishing the truth , but on giving publicity , ad nauseam , to their own special , and specially obnoxious , prejudices . The American nation , and every individual in it , has a clear right to hold and express a definite opinion : but it must be an opinion formed in conformity with the American character and the American freedom from entanglements of inherited and unreasoned bias . No other opinion is worth , here and now , a moment 's consideration ; and no other opinion should dare to voice itself in this country , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ties of blood and friendship , but not of bloodshed and hysteria . America alone , of the great Powers of the world , is in a position to exercise free and calm reflection and to form a free and just judgment . The value of her decision has already been made manifest , through the efforts of every country involved in the war to influence American sentiment and gain American good will . A peculiar responsibility therefore rests upon us to avoid the banalities of the various special pleaders , and to form our judgment soberly and in good faith , nothing extenuating , and setting down naught in malice . And one of the first thoughts that should occur to us , one of the most significant and pregnant thoughts , is that which I have . expressed in my first paragraph . Europe is a house divided against itself : but each nation in Europe has proclaimed the sanctity of its cause ; each nation conceives that it has , or is entitled to have , the special protcction  |p474  of Providence ; each nation is sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its women . What does this mean ? Is there such little sense of logic in the world that it is impossible to distinguish right from wrong , so that nation may rise against nation , each convinced of its own probity , and each unable to attribute anything but evil motives to its adversaries ? Can self-delusion be carried so far that black and white exchange values according to the chances of birth and environment ? Have Christianity and civilization achieved this re markable result , that the peoples of the world are like quarrelsome children in a disorderly nursery ? It is very clear that the world 's sense of logic must rank with the world 's sense of humor , when presumably learned pro fessors , unchecked and unridiculed , take nationalism and egoism as the premises of their argument and from them deduce , with great skill , obvious nonsense . The lesson of incompetence and shallowness is driven home when baseless rumors from one half of Europe are countered with fantastic inventions fabricated by our alien patriots for the purpose of influencing public opinion . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stupidity , and the American public will not greatly appreciate ' the poor compliment that has been paid to it . As an aid to impartiality and quiet thinking , let us first retrace the immediate and superficial causes of the war . Austria , dis mayed and incensed by the murder of the heir to the throne at Serajevo on June 28 , and considering the murder as the culmination of long-continued Servian scheming and enmity , delivered to Servia an ultimatum so framed that no nation , however small in territory or in courage , could possibly have accepted it without reservations . The Servian reply , went to the extreme limits of concession , and an understanding should easily have been reached on that basis . Austria , however , was apparently resolved upon Servia 's abject submission , or upon war . She refused to accept the reply as in any way satisfactory , and opened hostilities . It is clear , then , that Austria was primarily responsible for the actual commencement of the conflagration . Undoubtedly she had provocation , of the kind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is less easily understood in its full intensity by those at a distance . But the point that should be particularly noticed is that a country which was temporarily excited beyond all self-control should have been able to take the initiative and plunge Europe into war . And it should be remetn bered that Austria 's resentment toward Servia was scarcely greater than the resentment of the Serbs toward the nation that had violated the Treaty of Berlin and permanently appropriated Bosnia-Herzegovina . Yet , in rebuttal , Austria might well assert that she had a vested interest in the provinces to which , in a score or so of years , she had given prosperity unsurpassed in southeastern Europe , in place of the anarchy and ruin entailed by four centuries of misrule , and civil and religious faction-conflicts . The first step taken , the next was assured . Austria knew perfectly well that Russia , the protagonist in that drama of PanSlavism of which several scenes have already been presented , would take immediate steps in accordance with her role , and repeat her lines so sonorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dual Monarchy , wounded and embittered , did not care : she could see before her , at the worst , no harsher fate than she would have to face , without external war , in a few years , or perhaps months . Only war , it seemed , could save the dynasty from destruction and the aggregation of races from dis solution . Relying upon the immediate help of Germany , and the ultimate assistance of Italy ( her traditional foe , but tech nical ally ) , she refused to draw back or to temporise . In discussing the attitude of Germany , and the action of the Kaiser , it is necessary to make full allowance for the strength and sincerity of the German foreboding , for many a year , that the clash between Slav and Teuton was bound to come sooner or later . The Russian forces were being massed ostensibly to prevent Austria from coercing Servia . As Austria had provoked the outbreak of hostilities , should she have been left to take the consequences ? Would Russia , after eliminating Franz Josef 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's help in the congenial task of humbling Germany ? The situation was not without its subtleties , after Austria had made the first decisive move.But under what circumstances did  |p476  Austria make that move ? Was she encouraged by the assur ance of German cooperation ? The point to be particularly noted is that Germany , as the ally of Austria , was entitled to full warning of any step that would make war inevitable . Did Austria give that warning ? If not , why not ? Is the Kaiser a weakling , to be ordered hither and thither at the whim of Franz Josef ? The assumption will find few supporters . Yet it is quite clear that the Kaiser either knew and approved of the substance and purpose of Austria 's ultimatum , or ? mirabile dicta ? was willing to forgive the incred ible slight of being totally ignored , and commit his country and his army to the support of an act of aggression with regard to which he had not even been consulted . Carefully leaving the horns of this dilemma for the selfimpalement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , we pass on to France , compelled , by the terms of her understanding with Russia , to take her place in the firing line . Without entering into the ultra-refinements of politics and discussing the question whether France , or any other country , would have paid for present neutrality and the violation of solemn engagements by subsequently being devoured in detail , or reduced to vassalage , by a victory-swollen Germany , we may point out that an alliance entered into primarily to safeguard the peace of Europe and the balance of power has been the means of dragging France into a war with which she had no direct concern . Such is the irony of protective diplomacy ! Great Britain has rested her case on the publication , without comment , of the whole of the diplomatic exchanges that preceded her own intervention after the violation of the neutrality of Belgium . Her claim that she exerted her influence until the final moment in the interests of peace is sustained beyond cavil : but the point to be remembered particularly is whether a more decisive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferable . Germany would then have had no doubt as to Great Britain 's final alignment , and with a kindly word from Italy that neutrality was the best that could he expected from her , a reconsideration of the Nvholc position might  |p477  have been forced before the final , fatal moments had passed , and were irrevocable . It is unnecessary to prolong this cursory review of immediate causes and conditions , nor does it greatly matter how the posi tions of the different countries have been stated . The mood of a moment may add or subtract a little coloring , without changing the fundamental facts . But is it possible for any man , however impartial he may desire to be , to state those facts now , accu rately , clearly , and in such relation and sequence that only one inevitable conclusion can be drawn ? It may be possible , though it would be difficult : but it would not be worth while . For the war has not been due to , and does not depend upon , recent events ; and however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of importance is the one already emphasized : that every nation which has been drawn into the conflict counts its cause just and its conscience clear . In the face of such unanimity of national feeling , it is absurd to discuss superficial conditions only , or to assume that they are of any real importance , For , apart from neutral America , and the few hundreds of really educated and intelligent men and women in each country who constitute the brains and conserve the manners of their nation , it is impossible to find any just basis for criticism and judgment . The average national is concerned with presenting an ex parse statement ( in which , perhaps , he believes implicitly ) rather than with discovering the actual truth , whosoever may be vindicated or discredited . The average national may therefore be disregarded , and the supreme appeal be made , not to the common folly of the nations , but to the common sense of those who have risen beyond national limita tions and national littlenesses . In the first place , that much-quoted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right or wrong , first , last and all the time , " may well be relegated , ? first , last and for whatever time may remain before a kindly Providence blots out this incredible little world of seething passions and ceaseless pain and cruelty , ? to the limbo of antique curiosities . Nothing can be sillier , and more contemptible , than such pseudo-patriotism , based on utter selfishness , utter ignorance , and abysmal stupidity .  |p478  The country which commits a crime , or makes a grave mistake , is in the position of an individual who commits a crime or makes a grave mistake ; and no fanfare of trumpets or hypnotism of marching automata , helmeted and plumed , should confuse the issue and vitiate judgment . Mere nationalism , unregulated by intelligence , is simply one of the most irritating and blatant forms of egoism . Nationality itself depends upon so many complex conditions that the ordinary semi-intelligent man can scarcely unravel the niceties of history and discover to whom his heartfelt allegiance is really due . He therefore accepts the untutored sen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cial , not patriotic . Alsace and Lorraine , with their various vicissitudes , may profitably be studied by the curious , in this connection . Until provincialism , of the type which has been so prominent in recent controversies , can be eliminated or controlled , the settle ment of the more tragic issues of the time must be undertaken boldly by those who have indubitably grown up , forsaking leading strings and the nursery , the toys of childhood and the irrespon sibility of childhood . All the Governments of Europe , in which a few brilliant men are undoubtedly enrolled , have failed now , as they have failed repeatedly before , to perform their elemen tary duties and save their countries from the horrors of unneces sary war . Generation after generation , the peoples of Europe have been carefully led by their Governments into successive orgies of slaughter , in which the allies of one campaign have been the enemies of the next . The whole course of European history during the last hundred years ( we need not go further back : we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject for Olympian laughter . What has been achieved by the unending succession of wars , with all their attendant miser ies and deadly consequences ? Merely the necessity for increased armaments , constant watchfulness , perpetual strain ? and more war . Could there be a clearer proof of the futility of war ? The Governments of Europe have failed because each , in greater or less degree , has embodied the provincialism of its own section of the armed and suspicious world . There have been a few notable exceptions to the general rule of conventional medi/ ocrity : but where have we found the statesman who could break away altogether from the old stupid methods , and by the sheer force of character and principle inaugurate a new era of civilized diplomacy , as Bismarck inaugurated a new era of veneered barbarism ? In America , we are beginning to see the value and the fruits of government based on fairness to all nations and justice to all individuals : but neither here , nor in Europe , has the significance of the new statesmanship yet been fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a little suspicion , contempt , and imperfectly concealed condescension : it has heard and seen Roosevelt , unfortunately , and the lingering impressions of crudity have not been weakened . Will it listen to us now , and realize that the New World has in verity something to offer to the Old in its time of special tribulation ? For Wilson , not Roosevelt , stands for the spirit of America , the voice of America , and her chosen contribution to the civilization of the Twentieth Century . It seems strange , perhaps , to talk of civilization in these dark days , when primitive passions and primitive methods have flung an ineradicable stain of blood across a whole continent . Yet only the coward will bend to temporary defeat , or ridicule , or pessimism . It is the task of the strong to turn disaster into triumph , and to frame a new international polity built on sure foundations . The diplomacy based on national antipathies must be made impossible by the new understanding of the criminal folly of provincialism , the new comprehension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present war can not be discovered in mere incidents of July and August . They go further back , and are rooted in ignorance , misconception , prejudice , selfishness . I do not wish to accuse or exonerate any of the countries that have turned Europe into a stage for the rehearsal of Christianity 's masterpiece , the rollicking farce Hell on Earth . There have been enough already to inflame racial resentments and flood the press with taunts and recriminations . Ours is a bigger and worthier task : to assuage , not to incense ; to re-create order from chaos ; to prepare the way for peace , and for what must follow peace .  |p480  Recrimination is so useless now . We have to face the future : we can not undo the past . We have learnt our lesson , surely , once for all : shall the spectre of militarism again loom devilishly through such a nightmare as Europe has endured for the last decade ? Animosities and jealousies may die out : France has forgotten Fashoda , England has forgiven Russia for the blunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the prepara tion for war , the whole habit and incidence of militarism , must lead sooner or later to the clash . If the guns were not ready , if the nations had to be drilled and armed before they could be hurled at each others ' throats , there would be time , for reflec tion , for the subsidence of passions , for the revival of dignity and decency . Militarism damns both the menacer and the menaced . All the nations have suffered from that curse , Ger many , perhaps , the worst of all . The world has not yet forgotten Bismarck 's gospel of blood and iron , so relentlessly preached and practised . The inevitable results of the blood and-iron doctrine , modernized as the dogma of the " mailed fist , " can be seen to-day in the cataclysm that has swept Europe . The pity of it , and the shame of it , that all the skill of all the statesmen of the great Powers could produce no better result than a continent divided into two armed camps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for Russia , and the assumed Slavonic menace , one must tread somewhat diffidently where George Bernard Shaw has rushed in with characteristic Shavian impetuosity . The world owes to Mr. Shaw the discovery of a new nationality ? himself ; and it is impossible for any citizen of the world to ignore the obligation . But even if Russia achieves her never-forgotten dream of Constantinople and a purified St. Sophia , Europe and civilization will not necessarily stand aghast , trembling at each rumor of Cossack brutalities . Tennyson , who foresaw the aerial navies " grappling in the central blue , " indeed proclaimed , in one of the most execrable of his sonnets , that ? " . . . . The heart of Poland bath not ceased To quiver , though her sacred blood doth drown The fields , and out of every smouldering town fries to " Thee , lest brute power be increased  |p481  Till that o'ergrown barbarian in the East Transgress his ample bounds to some new crown : Cries to Thee , Lord , how long shall these things be , How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " ( I quote from memory , deprecating caustic correction ) . But , in spite of anti-Semitic atrocities ( are the hands of other nations so clean now ? They were foul once ) , and in spite of the blun ders of a rigid bureaucracy , the Russian nation is not necessarily a menace to civilization : it has within it the elements of a won derful idealism , and whether autocracy may remain , or may not remain , as the outward and visible form of government , the spirit of democracy is leavening the people , and " Holy Russia " has in truth already been sanctified by the blood of her innumer able martyrs ? sometimes , perhaps , misguided and mistaken ; but offering to the world an example of idealism and self-sacrifice that should surely dispel the nightmare of Russian brutishness . I may record here , quite irrelevantly , my own fervent wish ( irrevocably established at the immature , age of twelve years ) that Poland , with few of her limbs amputated , should be replaced upon the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was one of my earliest dreams that I should be awakened at the dawn of a wintry day , and urged by a delegation of Polish magnates to accept the one throne of Europe that had been , and still should be , open to conspicuous ( and electoral ) merit . That wish has not yet been gratified , and candor compels me to attribute it to the delightful influence of the elder I ) uuiiias , from whom I derived also my most enduring impressions of St. Bartholomew , Catherine de Medici , Mazarin , Louis X I I I , Richelieu , Buckingham , Louis XIV , Louise de la Vallicre , d'Artagnan , Athos , Aramis , Porthos , and other innnof talc India , I confess , held me equally spellbound : for many months I hesitated between the succession to Aurungzebe ( why should I now spell the name differently ? ) and the crown of Stanisl.ius . That hesitation has been fatal : I am still throneless . Others may be throneless ( the Mills of God grind steadily before final peace comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their various Nays , and will reap the ripe  |p482  harvests . But how long shall the childish quarrel of country with country be permitted and encouraged by those who should have learnt a little wisdom , in this twentieth century of per petual miracles ? Let us have done , once for all , with petty jealousies and absurd misunderstandings . Let us blot out , withnut regret and without the least compassion , the evil records and results of insincerity and manufactured hatred . Let us ex tinguish , finally and irresuscitably , those fires of malice and fla grant nonsense that have been fed assiduously by the fools and knaves of the world . Nowhere will you find a decent man , emancipated from the leading-strings of prejudice and unafraid of the bludgeonings of militarist authority , who does not condemn the present war , and all wars , as useless , damnable , anachronistic and inexcusable . We have learnt so much , in these later years ; we have adventured in strange ways , and silently borne strange reproaches . We have come very near to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inconsistencies of the prophets and filling in the gaps left blank by the poets . And shall we still be bound by the gibes and gyves of the mediaevalists ? The Middle Ages served their purpose : but why extend them to the confusion of modern chronology ? We have seen God , as no generation before has seen Him . Let us then live , and not die , until the grave be digged , and the night overshadow us at last .  |p483
