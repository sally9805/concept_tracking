The Judge who sentenced him for forgery  --  Lee had signed a railroad man 's name to a check for $400 ? said : " You will be confined in State prison for from two to fourteen years . " That was In 1904 and Lee was only 33 years old . He made up his mind he would be free when he should be 33 . He found a cellmate when he entered prison , for the place was crowded , and Lee told him what " his bit " was and what he had done . " i3ut I 'll be out in two years , " he added . Already he had determined to be an exemplary prisoner . His cellmate laughed . " You 'll be out in Just fourteen years . " he told him , with pride in his superior knowledge and scorn for the other 's ignorance in his voice . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the two worst places in the world . No matter what they tell you , you 'll serve your whole term . You never get out from here . " Leo laughed , too . He did n't believe him . For two years he did n't believe him , and then he began to doubt . Presently the doubt became a conviction that his cellmate knew , and then Lee stopped trying to be good . He tried instead to escape . His cellmate laughed again . You could n't escape , he told him . No one ever did . All there was for it was to make up your mind to stick it out . That was all . Sought Chance to Escape . And ai days accumulated into weeks . and week into months , and the latter into year . until twelve of them had slipped behind him , Lee dreaded that again his cellmate was right . But he never lost his hope nor his courage and at last they put hint to work on a road gang . He was a trusty for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never made the effort and failed . Only he and the nazi who shared his cell knew his purpose . It was a day last March that his chance came . Night came early and fast , and it overtook the road ; ; ang , still ar work outside the prison wall . The men put away their tools in a big box . They doffed overalls In which they were permitted to work , and marched back to prison . Lee hid behind the tool box . Ile got out a pair of overalls and dressed in these . Then he fled , Hegot work with a farmer only a few miles out in the country , and for a month he worked in constant terror that he would be found . nut no one interfered with him , and with his wages at the end of the month he left the neighborhood for Dayton , Ohio . He got work there and saved every penny until he had enough to bring him to ? this city , and he landed here three or four months ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since his prison days . He was ruddy where he had been pale . and he had taken on weight and musille with much work out of doors . He doubted that any one would recognize him . He got work in a storage warehouse in West Street , near Liberty Street , and went to live in a furnished room . He called himself by another name , and for the first time in twelve years he began to feel happy and at ease . Reeogatzeu otd Cellmate . So the shock came with redoubled vigor when some one called after him Friday morning : " Hello , Lee , what are you doing here ? " lie was entering the warehouse , but he swung abuut and faced the man . He recogni , ed him instantly . He was Edward Hogan , his celimate in Michigan City . Lee was all of a tremble . but he gathered courage as Hogan told how his own term had expired and how he had started for New York to reform and get on his feet again , for , Hogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lee had been dropped . " And now I 'm - hungry . Ed , " ' went on Hogan . " I Just got in . I ought to have a shave and a bath . Help a fellow out . will You ' ' ? Lee turned out his pockets . He had only a few cents . The next day was pay day . nut he wanted to help Hogan , and he offered to see if he could get his pay in advance . They gave him $3.70 and agreed to let him have Friday and yesterday off on his plea that he had some private business to attend to . He took Hogan where he could bathe and he shaved and bought him a meal . Then he took him to Staten Island . Hogan might get work with some farmer in the interior of the island , he thought , and besides , he would be glad to have him as far away as possible . They had been good friends but Hogan recalled too much Lee wanted to forget and he seemed to sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved unsuccessful , for occasionally he remarked : " They 'd be glad to see you back there , Lee . Remember what I told you . They never get away . Why , they 'd probably make you do fdurteen years more to pay you . " Lee shuddered and Hogan laughed . He demanded drinks , and Lee . protesting first . bought liquor with what was left of his small funds . By nightfall the money was gone and they slept in a field under some trees . " Afraid to take me home with you ! " Hogan demanded and because that , was just his fear Lee protested he had no room for him , only a tiny room , and they 'd be more comfortable in the fields under the trees . Morning came and Hogan , uncomfortable after his night in the open , was sulky . He did n't want farm work . He would return to the city with Lee . So they crossed the ferry . It took the last cent And Hogan wanted food . " Get some money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get some . What are you going to do ? Let a fellow starve ? " Threatened With Arrest . Lee said he could n't . No more money was coming to him until he worked again . He was broke . Hogan grew indignant . " You 're a fine friend . " he sneered . " You 'd like to see me starve . You wish I had n't showed up anyway . I know you . And I could send you back to jail in a minute just by calling that policeman there . " Lee begged him to he quiet . They were In Battery Park and many persons were about . Hogan laughed . He taunted Lee , called him a jail-bird , a fugitive , an-escaped convict . Lee pleaded with him , recalled the awful life In a cell , begged him not to give him up . And Hogan laughed . Then he grew angry and declared he would turn Lee over to the next policeman If he did n't get money . " You 'll have to take care of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't throw Flown another friend , " he shouted . And then a husky person grabbed the : ' : men from behind , swung them about sothey faced him , and demanded ! . " What 's the trouble ; What 's all the noise ? Come on , speak up . I 'm Detective Moriarty of Headquarters . " Lee tried to say that nothing was the matter . He clutched Hogan 's arm and tried to draw him away . Hogan laughed and jerked free . He turned to Morlarity and exclaimed : " If you 're really a cop you ought to grab this fellow . He 's ? an escaped convict from Michigan City ? , Then he walked off leaving Lee white-faced with terr &; and Moris.rity , wondering what he ought to do . Finally he led Leo to Police Headquarters . At first no tried to pretend that Hogan had iced , but at last tie broke dcrwn . " It 's true , " he cried . " Take me back . " Lee was locked up as a fugitive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogan is still free . There is nothing to arrest him for , but he would do well to keep out of the hands of Morlarity or his confreres .
