SIR : The most important source of Poe 's " Raven , " Dickens 's " Barnaby Rudge , " has hitherto been dismissed by biographers and critics , including Ingram , Lauvriere , Woodberry , and H. E. Legler , with scant notice . Such an unconscious conspiracy of silence is not justifiable , however , in view of the noteworthy parallels between the two productions . As Mr. Woodberry declares , the proper starting point is Poe 's review of " Barnaby Rudge , " published in Graham 's Magazine , February , 1842 , in which he made the following suggestion : The raven , intensely amusing as it is , might have been made , more than we now see it , a portion of the conception of the fantastic Barnaby . Its croakings might have been prophetically the italics are Poe 's heard in the course of the drama . Significant words these , when ' we remember that Poe published " The Raven " in January , 1845 , and may have written it considerably earlier . He adopts , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem : " Prophet ! " said I , " thing of evil ! ? prophet still , if bird or devil ! " Poe 's essay , " The Philosophy of Composition " ( 846 ) , purports to explain fully the genesis and composition of " The Raven " ; but in reality , most critics now agree , it does nothing of the sort . It seems to have been in part a deliberate hoax , written in the spirit of Defoe and Swift . In this famous essay he does not mention " Barnaby Rudge , " his only words on the subject of the bird being these- Very naturally , a parrot , in the first instance , suggested itself , but was superseded forthwith by a raven , as equally capable of speech , and infinitely more in keeping with the intended tone the italics are again Poe 's . This , by reason of the fact that the raven is " the bird of ill-omen . " Such failure to acknowledge a debt to Dickens is not proof positive of the absence of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in statement , especially when his vanity was concerned . Mr. Woodberry has emphasized this point with quite sufficient severity . I am aware , indeed , that there seems to be another objection to belief in any close likeness between the two ravens : in the passage from the review of the novel , quoted above , Poe refers to the " intensely amusing " character of the raven in " Barnaby Rudge . " But any one who will take the trouble to examine those portions of the book in which Grip appears will perceive that Poe 's phrase is not applicable to all of them ; there are several important scenes in which the bird moves in a sombre atmosphere . Moreover , the raven is inevitably connected  --  and Poe , as is proved by his review , wished him to be still more closely connected  --  with his master , Barnaby , who , on account of his infirmity of mind , lives ' in a half-supernatural world which Dickens has very powerfully described . Poe himself , in the review mentioned , quotes a passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this American is famous , both in his stories and his poems , it is atmosphere . It is not to be expected , therefore , that so striking an atmosphere as that which surrounds the mad boy and his pet would pass out of the poet 's memory in less than three years . It is questionable whether so salient a detail as the refrain , " Nevermore , " was not suggested by the following , from a gloomy scene in the prison between Barnaby and his mother : " You hope ! Ay , but your hoping will not undo these chains . I hope , but they do n't mind that . Grip hopes , but who cares for Grip ? " The raven ' gave a short , dull , melancholy croak . It said " ' Nobody , " as plainly as a croak could speak . " Who cares for Grip , excepting you and me ? " said Barnaby , smoothing the bird 's rumpled feathers with his hand . " He never speaks in this place ; he never says a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this dark corner , dozing sometimes , and sometimes looking at the light that creeps in through the bars , and shines in his bright eye as if a spark from those great fires had fallen into the room and was burning yet But who cares for Grip ? " The raven croaked again ? " Nobody . " " He never speaks in this place " ? speaks no - word but " Nobody " ; and Poe 's raven speaks no word but " Nevermore . " Moreover , the " fiery eyes " which " burned into the bosom 's core " of the lonely watcher in the chamber are seemingly reminiscent of the peculiar brightness of Grip 's eyes . Is there not some significance , also , as regards the expectant atmosphere of the poem , in the admonition of Barnaby 's mother ? ? " You must not go out to-night . There are ghosts and dreams abroad " ( p , 862 ) . Truly , the ghost , as the villagers think it , of the murderer , Barnaby 's father , continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Such is " The Raven " ; such stuff as dreams are made of . And the ghost of the lost Lenore hovers constantly in the background . None of the foregoing parallels . I hasten to say , shows anything that may be called plagiarism  --  although Poe himself , that literary detective , might have called it such in Longfellow or other poets . Dickens made no charges against his American admirer ; and even " Outis , " who bitterly attacked Poe for his charges of plagiarism against Longfellow , did not mention " Barnaby Rudge . " Certainly " The Raven " possesses sufficient original features , such as the somewhat melodramatic perch of the bird upon a bust of Pallas , the skilful if artificial progress of the poem to a strangely effective climax , and especially the reverie of a lover over the death of a beautiful woman  --  a topic which Poe. in " The Philosophy of Composition , " declares to be " unquestionably the most poetical in the world . " But , finally , is it purely accidental that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been these ? Charles Dickens , in a note now lying before me , alluding to an examination I once made of the mechanism of " Barnaby Rudge , " says , etc . In no better way could Poe have unconsciously acknowledged a debt which extends to much greater detail than has commonly been supposed . HARRY T. BAKER . Rockland , Me. , December 14 . THE QUEST OF THE ULTIMATE . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : - SIR : I have read with interest your article of November 17 on " The Quest of the Ultimate . " You certainly make out an attractive contrast between the seeming uncertainty of the realm of religion and the eternal realm of art and beauty ; and you make certain writers upon religion seem very boastful and ridiculous in their expression of a faith that mankind can ever enjoy such rest and satisfaction in religion as the lovers of beauty have felt in the great works of art . May I raise the Question whether it is necessary , or true . to make this contrast , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion ? Is it not possible that you fail to understand the point which the writers to whom you refer are seeking to make ? It may appear that they are nearer to the main drift of your article than you imagine . I can best express what I mean , first , by quoting the remark of a very learned student of religion ( one of your own valued contributors ) , who said in a conversation , " There has been a vast deal of superstition in the world , but so far there has been very little real religion . " It might be added  --  what every one must agree  --  that there has been a vast deal of discussion about religion , though real religion has always been somewhat rare . Must we not now say very much the same with regard to art ? We have loads of crude art in every town ; we have art schools and endless books on art But the great masterpieces , giving joy and peace , are very rare , and yet they are so real that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the inspiration of these few great pictures , statues , temples , or poems . Would you call it very presumptuous , then , if a lover - of the beautiful masterpieces , writing to express his sincere feeling about them , ventured his faith , or hope , that the world will come to find more and more permanent satisfaction Upon the lines of artistic excellence , already laid by the great artists and poets ; that the beautiful things are the simplest ; that it is useless to strive and strain after effect and sensation ; that to possess a. single object of beauty , yes , if only a flower , - and to love and enjoy it , is better than to fill a palace with bric-a-brac ; that to hold in memory a few stanzas of the masters of verse is happier than to learn the columns of an encyclopaedia ? I can imagine a lover of art saying something like this , with the intent to call people 's attention from the distracting sight of the commonplace , every-where set up in the market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest and satisfy men 's souls as often as they are seen . Now I suggest , I hope without dogmatism , that the lover of religion may try to say the very thing about the great , simple , and everlasting values of religion , at its best , which you have said about art . Is it absurd or boastful to urge that the coming man is likely to be free , to an ever-increasing degree , of the haze of superstitions that have overclouded the sight of true religion ; that he will learn to care more for the painting itself than for any particular style of framing about it ; that he will set his heart on the beautiful teach- , ings which rise like mountain peaks out of the Scriptures of the world , rather than on the monotonous levels in which these great teachings find their base ; that even children and the unlearned may catch the meaning of certain splendid psalms and hymns , which have always rested the souls of good men and women ; that it will be held true to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruits of the spirit " are love , joy , peace , courage , patience , and the rest ; and that the image or ideal of the good life ( let them call it the " Christ-life , " if they please ) , set up in the-shrine of the simplest man 's heart , is more precious than big books of dogmatic discussions about religion ? Now that I have risen to speak , may I be allowed to add a few words which seem to me to have importance , as bearing upon the permanent policy of the Natzonr I may be justified in my interest in the paper , for I became one of its readers , I think , in 1868 . I have highly valued its utterances and have rejoiced often in its vigorous preaching of righteousness . On the other hand , I am one of a large number of its readers who have wished that it might more often have added generosity and humanity to its keen sense of justice and truth . It has seemed to us to suffer from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their danger lies in severity , and in failure of sympathy toward those who differ in the least from themselves . They behave as if truth were a narrow . . line , and they alone were following it . Have you no use for a host of men whose faces may be honestly turned toward the light , but whose view of various subjects is somewhat different from yours ? Of course , you answer , yes , but you often give the contrary impression . For example , I have to assume that the Nation represents a philosophy of optimism , or at least of meliorism , which is surely a form of optimism . Otherwise , what use would there be in publishing a journal of ethical and political reform , if its promoters did not believe that truth and righteousness are the-victorious forces in the world ? If the Nation does not stand , upon the whole , for faith in human progress , we have misread all the best things that it has ever published . Why , then , should you seem to show a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " the wicked " ( if there were ever any persuasiveness in such treatment ) when you deal with the views of other optimists , and especially more hearty or confident optimists , outside of your own editorial rooms ? I should think that you would be pleased to encourage-all the actual friends of your great cause , even though they may not speak with the precise phraseology of your editorial room . I should think that you would like to try to understand them rather than to misunderstand them . Indeed , I should think it might occur to your own brilliant writers that there may be other tenable forms of faith in human progress , besides that cautious and somewhat chilling type which you sometimes affect . Or , do you imagine that the men of faith in religion and in the possibilities of civilization , who dwell outside your own circle , have no eyes to see the great obvious facts of life and death , that they do not measure the inexorable law of cost that1 rules the world , and that their faith and hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the result of serious and thoughtful convictions ? CHARLES F. DOLE . Jamaica Plain , Mass. , December 5 , 1910 . RAILWAY RATES AND CREDIT . To THE EDITOR otr THE NATION : SIR. : A sentence in the interesting letter of Mr. W. D. Hinds ( the Nation , December 15 ) struck me with great force . It reads : " Bearing in mind that the improvement of railroad credit is a matter of vital interest to the public , it would seem contrary to the public 's own interest for the government to prevent increases in rates and thereby obstruct the protection of railroad credit , merely because the railroads have not yet realized an ideal standard of efficiency far behind that realized by well-managed industries in general . " Indeed , why should the government be more reluctant to bestow large favors upon the railways than it is to bestow them upon other great business corporations ? Is it not a cardinal principle of our unwritten Constitution that large interests , regardless of their mismanagement , should be fostered by subsidies , protection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidy or tariff , but are only requesting the privilege of making the public bear the expense of mistakes in management . Surely , if the government is willing to put a premium on poor business methods practised by many other favored industries , it ought at least to allow the railways to recoup themselves without going to the trouble of making , with a view to economy , a detailed analysis of their business and a reform from top to bottom . The people of the country have just given their opinion on the subject of sacrificing the public for the profit of greedy corporations . Industries , pleading their infancy  --  i. e. , their inefficiency  --  as justification for their alleged inability to compete with foreign rivals , persuade Congress to allow them to dig deeper into the pockets of the consumer for their maintenance . But the people have begun to show that they perceive the meaning of these unceasing supplications for public bounty . It is not altogether impossible that when all is done it may be found that an increase of rates would be permissible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railways or any other business enterprise sin against business laws they should repent of their sins before asking for additional assistance . Is not the promotion of efficient business methods itself a matter of " vital interest to the public " ? and would it not certainly " seem contrary to the public 's own interest for the government " to promote increases in rates and thereby obstruct the progress of economy and efficiency in business life ? D. R. ANDERSON . Richmond , Va. , December 17 . THE TARIFF BOARD 'S REPORT . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The Americans are unquestionably an impatient people . They want work done well , and yet done quickly . The keynote of Professor Emery 's recent speech at Chicago was a statement of the fact that we can not remake our tariff quickly and make it well . He states that it is inevitably a laborious task and that time is essential . The many schedules of the Payne-Aldrich bill were encompassed in five months . This haste and the best methods we had at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unsatisfactory to the country , and broke the Republican party . The tariff board was created to put things straight , by a system which after careful investigation should appear to be reliable and efficacious . The chairman of that board now states emphatically that such a system is possible , but to make it operative without arduous labor and sufficient time is impossible . There are many business men in this country who have been and are still in favor of a tariff commission , but it is an anomaly that many of these have been under the impression that an immediate revision of certain schedules is quite practicable . Professor Emery , however , has made it very clear that this can not be expected . He has also proved conclusively that a tariff commission can not be of real value until it is a permanent institution . He has with great frankness discussed the pitfalls and dangers , but he just as frankly states that the ultimate result can be only for the general good . The value of the tariff board can not then be determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five months ' actual work is proof positive that no just tariff rates can be made in that time . This therefore upsets the statement that the existing bill is as good as it should be . It also makes it clear that it is not yet time for revision , and establishes the fact that revision can and should be accomplished ? " one schedule at a time . " Another most important " finding " is the great value to commercial interests which a well-compiled glossary of the facts would have , aside from the making and recommendations of rates of duty . This ' has long been needed in this country , and should prove of inestimable importance . The final conclusion is one , that stands out boldly . This country needs a tariff commission , needs it permanently , and needs the kind of a tariff commission which Professor Emery has so ably advocated . Never mind which political party accomplishes it , let it be accomplished . HENRY T. WILLS , National Tariff Commission Association . New York , December 5 . WAS SAMUEL DANIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIR : In an unpublished record of expenditures ( Public Records Office , Exchequer Accounts , Bd. 433 , No. 8 ) made by Sir David Murray , Keeper of the Privy Purse to Prince Henry , son of James I of England , there occurs the following item : " June 14 , 1609 . To Daniell the Italian . . . 1 li . 10s . " Since the record contains numerous similar payments to noor scholars , artists of all kinds and degrees , and in one case to " an Italian jugler , " this item might be passed over as insignificant , were there not evidence of considerable weight to connect it with the poet Daniel . In the same account book , under the date January 3 , 1608 ( 09 ) , there is a payment " To Mr. Daniell be comand . . . 7 IL " This undoubtedly refers either to the poet or possibly to his brother , John Daniel , the musician , who was later master of the Queen 's choir boys of Bristol ; and itmay be conjectured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that Daniel 's brother and perhaps his father were musicians is in itself significant , since in the time of James I most of the masters of that art ? Ferrabosco . Bassano . Lupo , and others  --  were Italians . The name Daniel , or , as it was usually spelled , Daniell , should cause no difficulty , for it was borne by the Italian mentioned in the payment , and it differs birt slightly from the Italian forms Daniele , Danielli , or Daniello . The poet 's close friendship with the Italian John Florio should also be considered . Two of his sonnets written for Florio 's works are addressed " To my dear friend . , " and a third to " To my deare friend and brother . . . . " Daniel possibly owed his pension and his position in the Queen 's court to the influence of the Italian language-master ; . in the " Accounts of the Queen 's Household , 1615-16 , " his name follows immediately after that of Florio . The latter , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came to England shortly before the reign of Edward VI ; one is tempted to explain the friendship of the two writers on grounds of family intimacy and kindred race That Daniel travelled in Italy in his youth is shown by the headings of two Sonnets in the Delia sequence , " At the Author 's going into Italie " ( sonnet hi ) , and " This Sonnet was made at the Author 's beeing in Italie " ( sonnet liii ) . In Wright 's " Elizabeth and Her Times " ( II , 315 ) , we hear of a Samuel Daniel abroad and in the company of an Italian doctor , Julio Marino . " A Description of Beauty translated out of Marino " ( Daniel 's Works , ed Grosart , I , 263 ) can hardly be connected with the doctor , since the poet 's given name was Giambattista , but It may serve to illustrate Daniel 's knowledge of the Italian language and his interest in Italian literature His first published Work , entitled " Imprese , " was a translation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian historian Paulus Jovius His friendship with the poet Guarini is indicated by the following sonnet addressed to Sir Edward Dimmocic , Daniel 's first patron , on an English translation of Guarini 's " Il Pastor Fido " . I do leioyce learned and worthy Knight , That by the hand of thy kinde Country-man ( This painful and industrious Gentleman ) Thy deareesteem 'd Guarini comes to light : Who in thy love I know tooke great delight As thou in Ms , who now in England can Speake as good English as Italian , And here enjoyes the grace of his owne right . Though I remember he bath oft imbas 'd Unto us both the vertues of the North , Saying our costes were with no measures grac 'd , Nor barbarous tongues could any ve " v bring forth I would he sawe his owne , or knew our store , Whose spirits can yeeld as much , and if not mole . Lines 9-12 of the sonnet refer clearly to conversations with Guarim , and apparently to a personal friendship . Furthermore , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been used by a poet who had every reason to consider the English translator quite as much his own countryman as Dimmock 's . Here , it is true , the point is weakened by the occurrence of our in lines 11 and 13 , though the possessive in these cases indicates residence rather than citizenship . In general the value of the evidence that Daniel , though an Englishman by allegiance and perhaps by birth , was an Italian by parentage , must depend chiefly on its cumulative effect . We have a payment to an Italian named Daniel from the same source and not long after a payment to'the poet . We know that the latter was of a family of musicians in an age when most professional musicians were Italians . We know that he travelled in Italy , translated from Italian writers , spoke the language , was on intimate terms with an Italian poet , and that one of his best friends was of the same stock . In the absence of exact information regarding his birth and parentage , these seem sufficient reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel is that of a writer for whom English was not strictly the mother tongue .

To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : San : Your Pittsburgh correspondent ( the Nation , December 8 ) is excited over wool How great the cry , How little the wool ! Can not the American farmer learn to raise sheep and not be a mere wool grower ' ? With sheep prices where they have been for years , why mention wool at Now I was once a breeder of sheep , and Merinos , too : and I made many a Merino breeder angry because I then said the tariff was robbery . It enabled the few of us to get a greater price for sheep and wool , but for one of us there were hundreds whom we were plundering in the price of clothes , I then sold my Merinos and went to breeding sheep And I bred them all through the nineties when the fool-killer was at home attending to his own business I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep good care , and made excellent profits from them every year . If wool brought ten cents a pound , it was clear gain , for good sheep , with proper care , will pay if they do not produce a pound of wool . Sheep-breeders who call for high tariff remind me of those who bred cattle for their hides Years ago ' I used to know many who sold their cattle-hides in the spring . That was their harvest , but they wanted a tariff on hides , as their cattle paid nothing . Those farmers who to-day are raising sheep for wool are to be pitied in the same manner as we should pity the farmers who raise cattle for their hides , and hogs for their hair J. A BARTHOLOMEW .
