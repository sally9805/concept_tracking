txt What is happening out of Wall Street is often more important than anything which happens in It , especially when Vail Street is in such a hectic mood that it bugs and sells In lots of four or five millions of dollars . The significance of such business is always subject to discount , and seldom means what It appears to . Only the callow can imagine that men having that amount of bona-fide property to sell would sell it in that way . It is more likely that sellers of that calibre would have completed their selling before the common crowd knew that there was any necessity of selling . It is imaginable that , knowing the effect of selling a large volume of stock , such a seller would sell twice as much , in the expectation of buying the surplus back at a profit on the decline . When belated and necessitous sellers appear in the market it is . a benefit to all concerned to have In readiness a , auitable volume of buying orders to prevent a total collapse through the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of the decline . Whether or not any such theory is applicable to present conditions , it is sure that much is happening out of Wall Street of a mord agreeable nature . and not needing any sophisticated explanation to make the cheering side appear . On the very day that the Steel " slump " culminated ? if indeed it has culminated  --  the Controller of the Currency issued his annual ' statement of the deposits in the mutual savings banks of the entire country . Their total resources are $3,762,000,000 , an increase for the year just past of $109 , - 952,000 , including an increase of Inve  --  tments against an increase of a round hundred millions of dollars in the liabilities to depositors . It can not be suggested that the year of reaction among , , eapitalisti has been equally severe among the wage earners who compose the savings bank class . This week also there have been published the figures of foreign trade for August-showing an export of manufactures eight millions of dollars in excess of last Year . Never yet have our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are now running at the rate of  --  a . billion and a half . promising a new record for this billiondollar. country. , The connection between . these , two " cheer : up : items Is obvious . The goods which thus swell our : Tieviosusly swollen our wage-fund , andidespite : the , cost of living the wage earners are showing that they have a. ' surplus . It Is often said that our crops are the backbone of our prosperity , and much trouble has teen borrowed because this year 's crops are not record breakers in the aggregate . Nobody has suggested that they are not a fair average yield , and it is hardly appreciated how much better they will be than present expectations . The collapse* in the cotton market this week gives promise of cheaper cloth . There will be scant sympathy with planters who are " ruined " by the abundance which rewards their labors , and which will bless the country despite the efforts to take back with the hands which run their " pool " the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food grain records it appears that in each of several recent years the actual harvest has surpassed the September indications . The expectation of such improvement of the yield over the estimate is exceptionally encouraging this year because an excessive allowance has been made of deterioration , and because of the fine weather which is Matter of general knowledge . Taking the betterment to be no larger this year than last , there are two hundred million bushels of corn and wheat to be binned which have not been counted . There is even reason to counsel better cheer to the despondent capitalists . Surely they can not be altogether in al bad way when they have millions to spare to foreign borrowers who are willing to pay over 6 per cent . for it . That is an uncommonly long road ? to ruin . it is easy enough to see where the money comes from . Valdes have been mounting while prices have been falling . Income is the test of valise , and the October returns leave no doubt of the substance behind the paper which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbursements of interest and dividends this year are probably a record for October at $130 , - 034,370 . ? It Is sure that they are an increase of $7,415,374 over last year , and there- was no cause for complaint then . There are some decreased payments in the list , . but there are larger additions . The increases in the dividend payments are all the more significant because they are made over an increase of interest obligations which Precede dividends . Actualities , in short , are encouraging . It is only sentimental troubles which are unsettling . In one way political and legal unsettlements are ' hard to deal with , since they can not be estimated exactly by anybody , and are estimated differently by everybody . On the other hand , they are subject to change without notice , and when they are too bad to be true they must change for the better . This would happen over night if it suddenly should occur to those who are thriving as the above facts indicate that the continuance of such prosperity is endangered by every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the country has been traveling lately .
