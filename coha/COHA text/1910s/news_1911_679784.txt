txt PRINCETON WINS ON YALE FIELD Sam White Again the Hero of . an Orange and Black Victory . HIS RUN FOR TOUCHDOWN Great Throng Thrilled When Tiger End Profits by Blue Misplay . PLAYERS COVERED WITH MUD Ells Show Remarkable Reversal of Form In Comparison with Season 's Previous Performances . ** to The Nezr York Times . NEW HAVEN , Nov. 18 . ? A sensational , spectacular run of sixty-five yards by Sammy White , Princeton 's hero end , who picked up a fumbled ball out of the quagmire gridiron , won the football game for the Tigers against Yale this afternoon . It was a glorious finish for Capt . Eddie Hart 's eleven , and was the first time Princeton has beaten Yale since 1903 . The score was 6 to 3 , Yale 's scant 3 points being scored by Capt . Howe when he booted the ball over the crossbar in the second period . Princeton went wild with joy after the victory , and the greatest delegation of Tigers that ever invaded Yale 's bailiwick made the town ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delight . White ? they can him " Long Run " Sammy now  --  did exactly the same thing ; that he did against Harvard . A wretched pass from Ketcham to Dunn in the first period of the game went wild and the alert end , ever watchful for the loose ' ball , snatched it out of the mire and tore down the field with the whole Yale : team scrambling for him like a pack of angry wolves . White outraced them all , but Yale 's Captain , Howe , was after him , and after sixty yards of White 's dash for a goal had been covered Howe in a final desperate jump tackled the Tiger on the five-yard line and the terrific impact sent both of them into the mud and White slid over the goal line on his face . Then the Princeton multitude became delirious , and the great Yale gathering sat stupefied with surprise . Intoxicated with the joy which came after White 's dazzling romp , the ' Princeton team fought Yale savagely tooth and nail for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed for them . Field Ankle Deep in Mud , Hart 's eleven fighting Tigers gave Yale one of the bitterest fights the gridiron has seen in recent years . The game was marred because of a field of mud . The heavy rain left pools of water all over the turf , and in a few minutes after the game started the mud was ankle deep in places . The field had little protection Ifrom the rain and spoiled the contest from a football point of view . Yale fumbled the muddy ball disas ! trously , Capt . Howe being the worst offender . The ball slipped out of his hands time and again , only to give a Tiger a ; chance to pounce upon It . Princeton fa ) . I lowed the loose ball with uncanny skill , ever watchful and ready to scoop it up as it bounded out of some Yale man 's arms . The battle was bitterly fought . Several times during the game the jerseys were I torn from the players ' backs . The physical condition of the players was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clash , which was a valiant ' fight to the bitter end . Capt . Hart of the Tiger team , playing the last game of his college career , battered and buised as he dove head : long into the crush of Yale 's attack , played as great a game as has ever been seen on Yale Field . Joe Duff , guard and red-headed , was almost as worthy a fighter . These two players ripped open the Yale line repeatedly and smeared Yale 's famous Minnesota shift before it got up steam . The versatile Yale attack was torn to shreds . At times it swept I gracefully around the ends when Yale 's I rushes boxed off the Tigers , but White and Dunlap at the extremes of the Tiger line more often wormed their way through the flying interference and nailed the Yale backs in the mud with a viciousness which almost shook the life out of them . Every tackle in this game was fierce . Players were thrown into the mire with terrific force , only to bob up and go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , fight , fight all the time . They never let up . Hart was hammering his men on the back from the first , imploring them to devour the Bulldog . And they did . They showed a spirit that would not eten waver . Doggedly and relentlessly Princeton scratched and threw themselves at Yale until some of the Blues ' heaviest , most seasoned linemen weakened under the grueling . Yale 's Offense Did n't Get Started . The much-vaunted Yale offense , which looked so wonderful against the weak Brown team , did n't get started against this bunch of Princeton fighters . It fell by the wayside time and again , and the toe of Camp was called on to work continually . For Princeton the kicking of De - Witt was a big factor . He outpunted the Yale booters and handled the muddy , slippery ball with remarkable agility . When White had nailed his name forevermore on Princeton 's tablet of fame and the Bulldog snarled and threatened to get back the precious points , De Witt was on the job with his wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career out of Tiger territory . Princeton took no chances . De Witt , untiringly , kept kicking all the time . And the more often he kicked the more often Yale fumbled . Yale simply could not handle the slippery ball . The Tiger ends covered De Witt 's kicks well , and rarely did Howe or Camp get a chance to race tack through the heavy turf with the ball . Princeton 's defense was real ly more rugged and substantial than it was against Harvard . The Tiger linesmen charged like madmen . Duff and Wilson , the guards ; Phillips and Hart , the tackles , and Bluethenthal , the clever centre rush , were up and at the Ells like one man . They worked in unison , tearing into Yale plays like a machine . True it is , perhaps , that they are black and blue to-night . They were physically fit , and took the battering without a whimper . They limped and squirmed in the heat of the fray when their stalwart frames were shaken in the collision with the sturdy line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,000 people that looked down upon this contest from the tiers of wooden seats will never forget the hardest contest that Yale and princeton ever fought . They talk about Tiger luck . It did n't win this game . It was Tiger fight  --  a never-say-die spirit , It was a fine thing to watch , these eleven scrappy , willing athletes , deep in the mud , covered from head to foot , with- Set teeth- and clenched fists , playing- ' with all the courage of ? their strong hearts tor the honor and glork-of Old Nassau . A more courageouis team never came out of the jungle . Princeton men from generation to generation will hand down the tale of Hart 's fighting men , ' , vim waded into the enemy 's country and won Lhe most sensational football victory of recent years . What of Yale ? Yes , the blue was the favorite before the teams lined up . Did n't Tom Shevlin and George Sanford and Ted Coy and an army of coaches whip all the football knowledge that Yale ever knew into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a clean-cut , burly team this Yale eleven . It was fast and knew more new football than the Princeton team . It rushed the ball better and covered more ground by rushing tactics . The Yale interference was more compact and smoother . But with it all Yale could n't win , would n't avoid the Tiger defense , which would not be denied . When Princeton charged the Tale team , the collision hurt . It was a bruising battle . The Tiger scratches dug in deep . and when the Yale team trooped off Yale Field it was tired and a good many of the players limped . And then coming hack to ' Sam White . It was his last football game . His long run beat Harvard , his other long run beat Tale to-day . He can run , White can . He followed the ball like a hound follow the fox . liver ready to scoop it up and run with all the speed in his long , lithe limbs . Once out in front he runs like the wind , looks neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing toward the enemy 's goal his sleets tear up the muddy turf and he runs faster and faster until , the leather tucked under his arm In vise-like grip , he plants it behind the line and wins the game . That 's Sam White .
