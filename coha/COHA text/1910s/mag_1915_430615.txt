SO runs a doggerel poem which is one of a thousand evidences of the impression that Oliver Cromwell made upon his own and following generations . It has been his lot to pass through many changes in reputation . Long an obscure man , he came to the front by sheer native capacity , was the most successful English general of his century , became head of the state , and king in all but title . He was buried with national pomp ? and a few years later his body was dragged from the grave and his head posted at Westminster . To the extremists who worship " Saint Charles the First , " and argue that the people of the United States are still legally under the sovereignty of the Stuart family , Cromwell seems the Judas Iscariot of his time . On the other hand , such writers as John Morley and Theodore Roosevelt are moved to write lives of the great English Puritan . His admirers have erected a statue for him under the shadow of Westminster Hall . Historians hold him to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Noll , " as he was sometimes called , is forever counted among the mighty . Two massive Americans have much resembled Cromwell , ? Abraham Lincoln and John Brown . Lincoln was like him in his homeliness : not only  | the rough-hewn countenances which both great men possessed , but a sense of belonging to the people at large , of representing the common man . They both had a useful enjoyment of the humorous in political life . They both carried their country through a civil war , and brought the rival parties to peace at the end . John Brown shared Oliver Cromwell 's Puritan hardness and disregard of what they thought the wrong side . When Cromwell ordered the massacre of the garrison of Drogheda , he wrote , " This hath been a marvelous great mercy ? I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgmant of ( Tnr1 nnnn these barbarous wretches . " That was the spirit with which John Brown was animated when he led out his little army of eighteen men for the attack on Harper 's Ferry . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him as completely vile . " I knew their hard hearts , " said John Brown . " They had committed murder in their hearts . " And so he became the executioner . When Oliver Cromwell entered the world in 1599 , England was in the midst of that glorious war with Spain in which the defeat of the Invincible Armada was only one of many brilliant victories . When he was four years old Queen Elizabeth died and King James the First came to the throne . Four years later the first permanent English settlement was made in America . Four years thereafter began the struggle between king and Parliament .  | These things all hang together . Elizabeth led England to become a great sea power , and that made the colony of Virginia possible . James the First at once began to tangle himself with the desire of his people to rule themselves , and the Puritans , among whom Cromwell was brought up , got control of Parliament and in the end overthrew the monarchy . In this twentieth century , revolutions grow so stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper . The world may have on its hands at the same time a Turkish revolution , a Portuguese revolution , a Chinese revolution , and a Mexican revolution . Hence to us it seems natural that people who are discontented with their government should practise the game of " Johnny , get your gun and your sword and your pistol . " The seal of the commonwealth of Massachusetts bears a Latin mottc to the effect that " We seek peace and quiet by the sword . " That is the keynote of the earlier part of Cromwell 's public life . He was so eager for peace and quiet that he was willing to pursue his enemies to the uttermost . As the shrewdest and boldest military man in the English civil wars , he became the Man on Horseback , and his army made him almost undisputed ruler of his country . The man was built for his times . He went to school and to the University of Cambridge ; but , like some later students , was " more famous for his exercises in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief matchmakers and players of football , cudgels , or any other boisterous sport or game . " At twenty-nine he entered Parliament and joined the radical party . He all but came over as an emigrant to Massachusetts or Connecticut . Instead of making his career as a pioneer statesman in America , he became one of the Puritans who in 1642 began a war upon their sovereign . Cromwell up to this time had no special training as a soldier : he was a quiet country gentleman . In the first serious battles he was only a captain .  | At once he showed his natural military genius . Within a few months he was made colonel , and began to recruit a new kind of soldiers . " He had a special care to get religious men into his troop , " and he said of them , " My troops increase . I have a lovely company . If you choose godly , honest men to be captains of horse , honest men will follow them . " This was the beginning of the best cavalry corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pays his twelve pence ; if he be drunk , he is set in the storks or worse . " Cromwell fought at the head of his troop at the battle of Marston Moor in 1644 , and virtually won the victory . Prince Rupert , commander of the defeated royal cavalry , dubbed the victors " Ironsides " ; and the name and the toughness which it expressed stuck to them . Lieutenant General Cromwell soon became the most popular leader of the Puritans . At Naseby , in 1645 , again Cromwell 's Ironsides were the deciding force . CROMWELL , THE LEADER The Puritans felt no safety so long as King Charles lived , and Cromwell , through his energy , power to command , and radical spirit , naturally came to the front . The Church of England was for the time put out of service ; but the severe Presbyterians wanted to make theirs the state church . Cromwell was of the same mind as John Winthrop and John Endicott of Massachusetts when they formed an " Independent " church . Throughout the rest of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The quarrel was carried into the army , which accused the Presbyterians not so much of intolerance as of failing to pay their wages . The result was that the army marched to London and compelled Parliament to accept its will . After that the army became the government , and Cromwell became the head and spokesman of the army . The Man on Horseback had arrived ! It was a time when printed papers played a large part in the series  | of revolutions . Whenever they felt like it the officers of the army drew up documents called " The Petition and Advice , " or " The Agreement of the People . " Several of these were little written constitutions , perhaps suggested by the New England Confederation of 1636 ; or by the Fundamental Orders adopted by the people of Connecticut in 1639 . Cromwell 's military successes against the Scots seemed to him the evidence of the approval of the Almighty for still more startling plans . In 1649 came " Pride 's Purge , " when a body of soldiers , with Cromwell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parliament . That left the Independents free to put King Charles on trial for his life ; but constitutional objections were raised , such as that nobody could create a court that could try a king . Cromwell replied , " I tell you we will cut off his head with the crown upon it ! " " THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS " Cromwell thus made a precedent in government and politics . Plenty of earlier kings had been killed by their unloving subjects ; but they were killed to make room for another king . When Parliament put the king on trial for his life it asserted the right of the people , through their elected representatives , to make or to unmake their own government . This new political theory collided with tradition and with religion . Englishmen had been as certain of the " divine right " of a king to rule them as Russians are today . To assassinate a king was a fearful sin ; but to condemn him by a court was a denial once for all that the king of England had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the king had been removed " in a way which Christians in after time will mention with honor and tyrants in the  | world look at with fear . " At any rate the idea that no people were bound to obey a king if they thought him a tyrant bore its natural fruit in the American Revolution , a century and a quarter later . If there was no king of England , what was there ? The House of Lords had ceased to be ; the House of Commons voted that " England shall henceforth be governed as a commonwealth , or a free state , by the supreme authority of this nation , the representatives of the people in Parliament , and by such as they shall appoint and constitute as ministers under them for the good of the people . " Here is the germ of Lincoln 's phrase , " Government of the people , by the people , for the people . " The word " commonwealth " is simply a translation of the word " republic " ; for a republic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much experience of real  | republican government as the people of Portugal today . Just as in the new Chinese republic , the radicals and the conservatives began to quarrel with each other , and the man that had control of the army was bound to decide between them . When the Irish took the royal side and rose against the new system , Cromwell put them down with cruelty and despatch . The cynical letters which he wrote home to Parliament have ever since been justly quoted against him . When the town of Wexford was stormed , though there was very little resistance , Cromwell was sure that " there was lost of the enemy not many less than two thousand , and I believe not twenty of ours killed from first to last of the siege . " CROMWELL DISMISSES PARLIAMENT This kind of Balkan campaigning stamps Cromwell as a man of fierce race and religious prejudices ; but it did not at all interfere with his success as ruler of England . When Parliament tried to defy him in 1653 , he marched into the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are no Parliament ! I will put an end to your sitting . Call them in ! " And at the word of command his soldiers entered , and put an end to the little that was left of the English republic . It is always the despot 's plea that the representatives of the people are not fit to govern themselves or their country . Yet Cromwell provided for a new Parliament , made up , as he said , of men " who had fought  | in the wars and were all of a piece on that account . Why , surely these men will hit it ! " In a few weeks they were hitting him ; and so he turned out that Parliament , and through the army drew up a new constitution , the " Instrument of Government , " with Cromwell as lord protector . From that time to his death Cromwell was the English government ? and in the eyes of foreign nations he was England itself . Under his guidance the Puritans tried to stop horse racing , cock fighting , dueling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They put an end to the favorite sport of bear baiting , as Macaulay put it , " not because it gave pain to the bear , but because it gave pleasure to the spectators . " Cromwell was a Progressive Party in urging reforms and social betterments . It is a singular fact that this man , the very essence of Puritanism , in his soul believed in tolerating differences of religious belief . He tried to grant milder treatment to Catholics and Jews ; he protected the Quakers ; he outran Parliament and his friends in his desire to give people a chance to think their own thoughts . Even the Protector of England , who was himself protected by bayonets , could not have his will at home ; but he was mighty abroad . He built up a great navy and fought the Dutch . His ships captured Jamaica  | from the Spaniards . He sent troops over to join in the wars on the Continent . Throughout Europe he was looked upon as a great sovereign . The unofficial court poet , Waller , thus blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea 's our own ; and now all nations greet , With bending sails , each vessel of our fleet ; Your power resounds as far as winds can blow Or swelling sails upon the globe may go . " Still his own friends and associates were not satisfied with this government by the strong man . " What is it you would have ? " asked the Protector of one of his subjects . " That which we fought for , " was the reply ; " that the nation might be governed by its own consent . " That brave phrase " its own consent " was in many men 's minds ; andThomas Jefferson used it for the Declaration of Independence . Cromwell again dissolved Parliament , because it claimed the right of the nation to rule itself . Many people thought that he was on the point of declaring himself king ; but he was worn out and died in 1658.  | Eight months after Cromwell 's death Charles the Second , son of Charles the First , entered London as king . Apparently Cromwell 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth was never fortten . Cromwell the general , the successful leader , the vigorous man , ld not make head against the will of the English people . Then what ld the easy-going Charles the Second accomplish against them ? His ccessor , James the Second , was overthrown by Parliament ; and every ' ng of England since has bowed to the people 's will . For neither crowned ing nor uncrowned protector , European czar nor president , can get on in this age of the world without " the consent of the governed . "  |
