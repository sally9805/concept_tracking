The publication of these lesson helps takes $12,000,000 a year , when books are included . The lessons are translated into fifty languages . America leads the world in selecting lessons to be studied , in number of members of the International Lesson Committee , and in children studying Bible lessons .

The Zurich convention will be asked to do what it can to prevent outbreaks . There are two parties , one proclaiming scholarship , the other clinging to old methods and forms . The impression seems to be that scholarship is gaining . A second task of the convention Is to impress the churches with the importance of religious instruction of the young . The third task is how to enlarge the Sunday School financial support . CUSTOMS EMPLOYES ANGRY Resent Cuts Made While Money Is Spent on Commission .

Curtis , who is immediately in charge of the Customs Division of the department , the local port administration was called upon to cut annual expenses $64,200 . This economy has made necessary the reduction of the salaries of a large number of employes , the removal of several clerks , and the failure to fill many vacancies . That these places are unfilled is accounted for by the fact that Collector Loeb as long ago as last January refused to fill vacancies in anticipation of the reorganization plan for the beginning of the new fiscal year . Since John Purroy Mitchel took office June 7 no appointments in the regular service have been made , with the exception of a private secretary . Mr. Mitchel has , however , named a commission of eight special employes , who are to make a study of the service with the view of recommending changes designed to promote both efficiency and economy in administration .

A special musical programme has been arranged for each Sunday during these two months . Bishop Gailor in his sermon on " The Eternal Life " said It was easy for people to become discouraged and pessimistic . " It is no wonder there are so many suicides , " said the Bishop .

One gets the fruit , the other the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . And so we hear people say bitterly , ' There is no God . ' But to think this way does n't help us any . It does n't make the world any better for people to say that there Is no God .
