SCENE .  --  A room in a poor class tenement . There is a door centre back with corridor backing , and a fireplace in the right-side wall . The room is very bare of furniture , containing only a decrepit chair , a heap of bedding against the left wall , and a packing-case against the back wall a little to the right of the door . On the packing-case stand a teapot and a cup and saucer . The walls are pasted here and there with pictures from police journals and other lurid publications . BILL JENKS , a dirty , unshaven man , is discovered asleep in the chair by the empty fireplace . He is an invertebrate specimen , a waster of the incorrigible , non-working class . He snores placidly . Presently the door is pushed cautiously ajar and a BOY 'S head appears . Seeing that his father is apparently asleep , the BOY opens the door as softly as possible and creeps down centre , watching BILL to make sure it is not bluff . He carries a bundle of evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is genuine , he tiptoes to the bedding , and , laying his papers down , commences to count his coppers . An incautious chink wakes BILL JENKS . He looks round and sees what is going on . Rising , he tiptoes across the room and seizes the youngster by his shoulder . The urchin starts to his feet . BOY ( struggling ) . Let go ; d'yer ' ear , let go ! p. 3 BILL JENKS Yer did n't think yer farver was at ' ome , did yer ? Come in to ' ide yer money , didn ' yer ? BOY ( stoutly ) . Yus ! BILL JENKS I 'll learn yer to ' ide yer money from yer farver . Come on , ' and it over . BOY Sha n't ! BILL JENKS Oh , yus you will !

( BOY recoils against wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILL turns R. ) Not me ! I 'm fair froze as it is . ( Turning back . ) ' Ave yer got any more money on yer ? BOY No ! BILL JENKS ( advancing ) . Do n't you tell no lies to yer farver what 's brought you hup ! Come ' ere and let me see . ( BOY dodges him round the room and makes for the door , where he collides with SNIPPY , a clean-shaven , close-cropped man of about thirty . He is fairly tidily dressed , though the suit he is wearing is too large for him. ) p. 4 SNIPPY ' Old ' ard ! ' Old ' ard ! BOY Garn ! ( He ducks under SNIPPY 'S arm and vanishes . ) SNIPPY ( advancing L.C. ) . ' Ello , Bill , what wer the gime ? BILL JENKS ( sitting on chair ) . Gime ! Yer do n't call things a gime , do yer ?

No , no ; a bit of honest thievin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool ; if yer went on thievin ' just ordinary , the police ud never cop yer at all .

SNIPPY ( who has worked round L.C. ) . Gawd , Bill , you ai n't been thievin ' ? A BUTCHER Do n't look like it , do it ? SNIPPY ( advancing C. ) . ' E 's a ' ard-workin ' man , sir .

A POLICEMAN Yes , miss ? MISS ORMEROD Look here , do n't you think you 've been off your beat long enough ? I was amazed when I saw you rush into this building ! How do you expect me to stand in the street and sell these papers of mine , if there 's no one there to keep law and order ? A POLICEMAN Sorry , miss  --   --  MISS ORMEROD You know perfectly well you police are told off to stand by us in case we are set on by the crowd . It 's too bad of you leaving me there unprotected !

( To BILL . ) Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? Did n't you know it was wrong to steal a piece of meat ? BILL JENKS What about them ' ouses your sort burnt down ? A POLICEMAN ( confidentially ) . Look here , miss , you take my advice and go and sell them interesting-looking papers of yours . MISS ORMEROD ( haughtily ) . There 's no need for you to be familiar , just because I slapped your face last night . ( SNIPPY laughs to himself . ) A POLICEMAN ( by door ) . Come on , William Jenks ! It 's time we was off .

A POLICEMAN Well , miss , you must n't interfere here . p. 17 MISS ORMEROD Not allowed to interfere ! ( Then ignoring the POLICEMAN and addressing herself to BILL . ) How many children have you ? BILL JENKS What 's that got to do with you ? SNIPPY ( patting BILL on the back ) . There , Bill , do n't take on so . P'raps the lidy 'll look after the little ' uns whilst you 'm in trouble .

I 'm sorry , but I must . ( Furtive joy on BILL 'S part . SNIPPY shakes hands with him . POLICEMAN strolls to the corridor , where he stands looking out. ) p. 20 MISS ORMEROD I believe you refuse me because I am a Suffragette . I 'm sure we 've never done you any harm . A BUTCHER No , miss , that 's true . But then a butcher does n't have any plate-glass windows . MISS ORMEROD ( moving away L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good customers of yours , I think . A BUTCHER Yes , miss , and I see what you 're driving at , but  --   --  MISS ORMEROD ( turning sharply ) . Well , do you want to lose our custom ? A BUTCHER ( moving down to her ) . Oh , of course not . But this is a matter of principle . MISS ORMEROD Not only will you lose our custom , but I 'll personally canvass all my friends , and you 'll lose their custom too . I 'll see justice done . A BUTCHER You do n't call it justice to let a thief off ? SNIPPY ' Ear , ' ear ! MISS ORMEROD ( crushing them ) . I choose to call it justice . Well , you have your choice . A BUTCHER ( uneasily ) . Why do you take his part , miss ? He 's not worth it . He was caught red-handed . He deserves to go to prison . p. 21 BILL JENKS That 's what I say .

A BUTCHER Oh , of course , Miss Ormerod , it 's not right , but if you really ask it  --   --  MISS ORMEROD Oh , I do , Mr. Fletcher , and thank you so much ! I knew you 'd agree ; you have a kind heart . A representative of the R.S.P.C.A. told me you killed your animals most humanely . Now , of course you 'll allow me to pay for that meat . A BUTCHER Oh , thank you , but I really could n't hear of it . I was most happy to oblige you . Besides , I 've got the meat again . I can put it back in the shop . MISS ORMEROD ( horrified ) . What ! You intend to sell a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILL JENKS ( advancing ) . ' Ere , " dirty ruffian ! " You called me comrade just now . ( POLICEMAN comes down a little to stop him in case of need ) . p. 22 MISS ORMEROD ( very haughtily ) . I think you forget to whom you are speaking ! But still I 'm glad it 's all settled . Though I insist on paying for the meat . ( She pays the BUTCHER , whilst the POLICEMAN interests himself in the pictures to the left of the door . BILL and SNIPPY are by the fireplace . ) BILL JENKS ( aside to SNIPPY ) . ' Ere , I ai n't goin ' to prison after all ! SNIPPY Do n't seem like it . BILL JENKS Well , that 's a bit of all right , I do n't think ! SNIPPY Why do n't yer ' it the cop on the jaw ? Then yer 'll ' ave to go . BILL JENKS ' It the cop ! I dursant ! SNIPPY Garn !

Then why did n't you arrest me last night when I struck you ? Come , answer me that !

MISS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights  --  not even to be arrested ! A POLICEMAN ( to BILL , whose left wrist he is holding ) . Come on . Step out . MISS ORMEROD ( getting between him and the door ) . You are not going to bluff out of it like this . I insist on knowing why you arrest this man for striking you and refuse to arrest me for the same offence . ( Moving down L. again dramatically . ) All England shall ring with this injustice . p. 24 A POLICEMAN Well , miss , if you must know , it 's this hunger strike . We have orders not to arrest more of you ladies than we can help . MISS ORMEROD Then justice for all alike , I say . Let the man go . BILL JENKS Do n't you take no notice of what she says , sir .

A POLICEMAN Sorry , miss . I must do my duty . BILL JENKS ( turning ) . Yus , that 's right . You take me to quod . It 's the sifest plice nowadays .

A POLICEMAN Well , miss , I did n't ought  --   --  ( He looks hesitatingly , to see what the BUTCHER 'S attitude in the matter is . ) A BUTCHER ( grinning ) . Do n't you mind me . You act according to your conscience . MISS ORMEROD D' you know , I admire you very much . I 'm sorry I slapped your face last night . You behaved like a gentleman .
