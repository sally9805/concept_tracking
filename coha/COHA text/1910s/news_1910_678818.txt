txt Some months ago Mr. Surma , the Commissioner of Corporations , made a report on speculation in cotton , and at intervals since then he has issued supplements to explain away the Impression which was generally received that he was opposed to speculation . The most recent addendum was published Saturday . in the form of a report to President TAFT regarding proposals to legislate upon the subject . Mr. SMITH thinks that some of the business in futures is legitimate and beneficial , and that other business of the same class is " unquestionably evil . " The difference between them is a " difference of intent , a state of mind . " Necessarily " certain difficulties are obviously involved in applying practically such a distinction . " He will have general sympathy in his desire " to eliminate the evil and retain the good , " but since he does not " presume to say whether this can be done and haw , " after writing several reports about it , the subject remains where he found it . How much more thorough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Legislature making margin dealings a felony for buyer and seller and banker alike . On only one sulliotit has Mr. SMITH fixed convictions . After months of deliberation he repeats that " quotations produced under the fixed difference system  --  that of New York  --  frequently decrease the prices of cotton received by the farmer . " Mr. Sparrsrs ingenuous friends have three remedies against taking too little for their cotton . One is to rig the market in the manner of the wicked gamblers in New York , another is to welch on their bets , and the third is to get the help of politicians to try to enact that their cotton shall sell for more than it is worth . That they are now " working " Congress needs no proof . The pending bills are supported by a lobby which is proud of its activities . They are the representatives of a body said to number 1,500,000 members , which before descending upon Washington is said by a sympathetic Southern newspaper to have " raised $3,500,000 and deposited the cash In  --  a. hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their crops for the ' twenty-cent price they expect to get for it before next Summer . " What they did when the market went against them is described by another generally sympathetic Southern newspaper . They " refused to deliver , " " breaking their contracts deliberately and flagrantly. " and " firms which trusted in their contracts have been forced into bankruptcy . " Two wrongs do not make a right . It is no excuse for bad Exchange speculators that some farmer speculators are bad . The object of the recital is to show that bulls and bears are much alike , and that there is scant excuse for governmental intervention until a case is made out clearer than Commissioner SMITH 'S . It does not seem to us that the Commissioner 's proteges need to be dry nursed by anybody . Neither do we like to read in a governmental report an essay under the Corporation Bureau 's caption , " Psychological Influence of Abnormal Accounts .

But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large an order to trust even to the Bureau of Corporations .
