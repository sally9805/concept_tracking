Mr. Skala was the leader among- the Bohemians of Western Pennsylvania . among whom he had worked for some years in Coraopolis . Last Sunday the Rev. Andrew Kovac , the pastor of the mission . announced that Mr. Skala would preach to-day in his absence , and the little church was crowded to hear him . Mr. Skala spoke of the Christian martyrs and declared his willingness to die for the faith . At any moment that God wants my life . " he said , " I am willing to lay it down . " Rewdicz , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time sat quiet . He greeted Mr. Skala at the beginning and read in his turn from a children 's leaflet . But he took exception to some remarks in the sermon , and , rising , demanded in an angry tone that he be heard . " I will answer your questiops after church and outside the church , " said Mr. Skala . Rewdica sat down , and the preacher appeared to forget all about the incident . When the service was over he left the building.arm-fnarm-with Mr. Gay on the way to the home of one of the parishioners with whom they were to dine . They were passing through the groups of the , congregation who had stopped outside to chat , when Rewdicz forced his way up to them . " What can I do for you , my good friend ? " said Mr. Skala , attempting io take his hand . The Russian began to argue and gesticulate . He planted himself in front of the editor , pulled a revolver from his pocket , and fired . Mr. Skala dropped dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple . and Gay I started to run . He threw up his hand to protect himself , and the first bullet broke his thumb . The second hit his head and he fell , apparently dead . Rewdicz shot him again , and then stepped away with a wild laugh . Panic seized the congregation as the shooting began , and many persons were trampled upon in the wild rush to escape . ' A few stood their ground and threw stones at Rewdicz , who yet had some charges left in his revolver . , He waved it threateningly and backed up the steps into the little Mission church . A crowd of 500 soon collected , but the murderer held them all at bay with his revolver for about thirty minutes . He prevented Scala 's body from being lifted from where it fell , and kept off any assistance from Gay , who showed some signs of life . Nearly all the windows of the church were broken by the shower of shots , but Rewdicz was unhurt . At the end of half an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church , drove the crowd up and down the street , and raced for a street car line at the top of the hill . The crowd chased him , but fell back as he turned and fired at it . At the top of the hill he came up with a suburban farmer named Case in his buggy . He made him alight , took his vehicle , and fled into the country with it . Late in the afternoon the horse was found wandering about some miles from North Pittsburg . The murderer is still at large , and is known to be well supplied with ammunition . Rewdicz , who appears to have been a Russian student of standing , came to America two years ago , and for five weeks has hung about the Pittsburg district . He lodged at the Salvation Army barracks , but was at variance with its teachings . He is thought to have become demented on the question of religion and Russian secret societies , and was noticeable for the curious patches he wore on his ragged clothes . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skala over the policy of his periodical , and volunteered to write some editorials for him . Next day some wild , rambling articles were sent to the editor , and as he did not print them Rewdicz wanted to attack him . An anonymous letter was sent to Mr. Skala warning him he would be shot dead in the pulpit to-day .
