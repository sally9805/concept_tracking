txt // in seeing which could cause the greatest pain , the instrument of torture being microscopic icicles frozen with a temperature at absolute cold . I say the victim might imagine such a carnival of torture taking place in him if it were not that the disease stupefies the mind and renders the victim hopeless , helpless and devoid of poetic inspiration ; and , it is safe to say , if the disease could be continued for life , the mind would not develop . These are the thoughts I have about the disease after an interval of fifty years since experiencing the pain of it , and without allowing my medical knowledge to bias my description . The general aching comes on without any apparent cause , when but a moment before the victim was feeling well ; in fact , he will often be feeling vigorous and in ten minutes there is not heat enough in an orthodox hell to warm him , then in from one to three hours after this frigid state all the ice at the poles will be impotent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profuse sweating , and probably in from six to twelve hours from the beginning , the victim of all this torture will be feeling fine again . I have seen the fever so severe that there would be delirium for two or three hours . The paroxysms are repeated every twenty-four , forty-eight and seventy-two hours ? quotidian , tertian and quartan . I have seen a type recurring every seven days ; another that appeared every thirty-six hours , and still others that anticipated and receded ; that is , came three hours earlier each attack , and finally settled into a continued fever , while another type came three hours later . In malarial countries , every illness partakes of periodicity , and this is the doctors ' keynote ? periodicity spells quinine first , last , and all the time . // As ludicrous and unscientific as it may appear to laymen , in those good old days the prescription was always the same . Be the doctor great or small , old or young , the disease of whatever name , the drug par excellence was quinine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all diseases was malaria , and quinine was and is recognized as the specific for malaria , or , to be more exact , for periodicity , and periodicity was recognized as positive proof that malaria existed as the primary cause . This type of reasoning by the profession is not confined to malaria : Today , if a patient presents symptoms of locomotor ataxia , scientific physicians base their prescriptions upon the established belief that syphilis is the primary cause , even if it is impossible to procure a history of infection . This idea I abandoned twenty years ago , because clinical experience failed to verify it , and today I am in possession of so much evidence to the contrary that the theory is not only absurd , but should be abandoned by all physicians . The truth is , there are as many primary and exciting causes for ataxia as there are kinds of irritations transmitted to the nerve centers , and when I give this particular disease a write-up , I shall show that it is quite as easily cured as any other disease , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place . It is a disease that gives years of warning , and it is a crime to silence the warning voice of nature with drugs . Etiology of Malarial Fever : ? As I stated at the beginning of this article , low lands that are not well drained are the seats of this disease . Every year the malarial influence in this country is growing less . Land drainage is carrying the water away so that the vegetation dries on the ground , instead of decaying as formerly , and this is doing away with miasma ? pollution of air and water . // The people are becoming more intelligent , and are learning that they can not have wet , damp and dank basements in their homes ; that they can not have decaying vegetables in their cellars , or on their premises ; that food must be fresh and properly prepared ; and that their homes and their bodies must be clean . Such knowledge as this and the reclamation of lands by drainage is fast doing away with air pollution , which is another name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plasmodium which is supposed to be the active principle , so to speak , of miasmic blood pollution in those who are suffering from malaria . There are several varieties ; one for the tertian type of the fever , one for the quartan , and one each ( ? ) for other periodicities , all of which may be looked upon as evidence of higher medical science , but to me it is an evidence of how absurd and grotesque so-called ultra-scientific methods are becoming . To give the reader an idea of how far the profession has gone into the research of how malarial fever gains an entrance to the body , I quote from Dr. Osler 's " Practice of Medicine : " The Parasite Within the Body of the Mosquito. ? The brilliant researches of Ross , followed by the work of Grassi , Bastianelli , Bignami , Stephens , Christophers and Daniels , have proved that a certain genus of mosquitoanopheles ? is not only the intermediate host of the malarial parasite , but also the sole source of infection . In the present state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genus anopheles may act as hosts of the parasite . The more common genera of mosquito in temperate climates are culex and anopheles . The different species of culex form the great majority of our ordinary house mosquitoes , and are apparently incapable of acting as hosts of the malarial parasite . All malarial regions , however , which have been investigated contain anopheles . Although this is apparently a positive rule , anopheles may , however , be present without the existence of malaria under two circumstances : First , when the climate is too cold for the development of the malarial parasite ; and , secondly , in a region which has not yet // been infected . So far as is known , the parasite exists only in the mosquito and in man . It is apparently fair to state that regions in which mosquitoes of the genus anopheles are present may become malarious during the warm season . A large number of species of anopheles have been described . In North America , however , only four have been positively recognized : A. pinctipennis ( Say ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wied ) , A. argyritarsis ( Desv . ) . The commonest variety , and that which in all probability is most concerned in the spread of the disease , is A. maculipennis , which is , also , the most important agent in the spread of the disease on the Continent . The palpi in the mature culex are extremely short , only to be seen on careful observation at the base of the proboscis , while in the anopheles they are nearly of equal length with the proboscis , so that , on superficial observation , the insect would appear to have three proboscides . The wings of the common species of culex show no markings beyond the ordinary veins . The wings of all the American species of anopheles show distinct mottling . The culex , when sitting upon the wall or ceiling , holds its posterior pair of legs turned up above its back , while its body lies nearly parallel to the wall . In some instances , when it is full of blood and sitting upon the ceiling , the body may sag down considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling , holds its posterior pair of legs commonly either against the wall or hanging downward , though in some instances they may be lifted above the back . The body , however , instead of lying parallel to the wall or ceiling , protrudes at an angle of 45 ? or more . These simple points are sufficient to permit the ready distinction of species by almost any individual . The culex lays its eggs in sinks , cisterns and any collection of water about or in houses , while anopheles lays its eggs in small shallow puddles or slowly running streams , especially those in which certain forms of algae exist . The culex is essentially a city mosquito , the anopheles a country insect . Evolution in the Body of the Mosquito. ? When a rn , osquito of the genus anopheles bites an individual whose blood contains sex-ripe forms ( gametocytes ) of the malarial parasite , flagellation and fecundation of the female element occurs within the stomach of the insect . The fecundated element then penetrates the wall of the mosquito 's stomach and begins a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after biting there begin to appear small , round , refractive , granular bodies in the stomach wall of the // mosquito , which contain pigment granules clearly identical with those previously contained in the malarial parasite . These develop until , at the end of seven days , they reach a diameter of from 60 to 70 microns . At this period they may be observed to show a delicate radial striation , due to the presence of great numbers of small sporoblasts . The mother oocyst ( zygote ) then bursts , setting free into the body cavity of the mosquito an enormous number of delicate , spindle-shaped sporozoids . These accumulate in the cells of the veneno-salivary glands of the mosquito , and , escaping into the ducts , are inoculated with subsequent bites of the insect . These little spindle-shaped sporozoids develop , after inoculation into the warm-blooded host , into fresh young parasites . The sporozoid which has developed in the oocyst in the stomach wall of the mosquito is then the equivalent of the spore resulting from the asexual segmentation of the full-grown parasite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red blood corpuscle , may give rise to the asexual or sexual cycle . As a rule the first several generations of parasites in the human body pursue the asexual cycle , the sexual forms developing later . These sexual forms , sterile while in the human host , serve as the means of preserving the life of the parasite and spreading infection when the individual is subject to bites of anopheles . Treatment. ? It matters not how many discoveries are made ? how refined the theory of causation ? the treatment remains the same , namely , quinine , always quinine ! I had years of experience in treating the disease in all its forms and I gave quinine in large and small doses ; I gave it when certain of my diagnosis , and when in doubt ; I gave it in every conceivable form and I used every vehicle for disguising its bitter taste . I have produced cinchonism ? quinine poisoning ? in all its phases , and felt justified in doing so , for it must not be forgotten that a physician is criminally negligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best authorities , even if he is convinced that the after effects may be detrimental to the patient . For example : Vaccination may kill and it may produce // duce what Osier calls a " Serum Sickness ; " operations for appendicitis may kill and they may leave adhesions calling for other operations ; every disease known has an authorized and legalized scientific treatment which is capable of doing harm and has been known to have done harm . A physician in indictable if he does not use the treatment , and so are laymen who refuse to take the treatment . The reader can see that , according to medical science and state laws , a physician is justified in producing quinine , aconite , belladonna , strychnine , morphine , arsenic , or any other drug poisoning if he confines his operations within the scope comprehended by a " reasonable medical skill , " and may the God of Wisdom have mercy on the standard and its authors . Dr. Osier says : " Persons going to malarial regions should take about ten grains of quinine daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads me to believe that if a person would remain free of the malarial influence when traveling through malarial sections of country , he should not touch quinine at all . Quinine shocks the nervous system , produces irritation of the stomach , and when used for a few days it lowers the vital resistance . After years of experience in treating malarial fevers , and having been brought up in a malarial country and suffered from the disease in my childhood and more or less until I was grown , it is my belief that the more quinine the inhabitants of malarial countries use , the more they will become confirmed invalids from what is known as malarial poisoning , which in truth is a mixture of chronic cinchonism , malaria and wrong life . Common sense must declare that there is but one immunization to disease and that is good health . A man under the influence of drugs is not in good health , for he is in a state of drug poisoning , and he must have less resistance than when he is not // under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and logical ? if it is not true ? there is no cause and there can be no effect and it is useless to try to formulate a plan of prophylaxis and treatment for disease . If there is any state that man can be put into that will cause him to be less liable to come under disease producing influences than full health , then law and order is not supreme and the world must be the victim of caprice , haphazard and chance . If order rules and is necessary in macrocosmic evolution , it must be true in microcosmic evolution ; then if order rules in evolution it must rule in involution ; hence we must have order in health and disease , and this will give us a fixed point from which to start all our reasoning in regard to health and disease ; and if the balanced physiological state known as health can not be recognized as the unit or starting point from which to measure all states , degrees or varieties of health , then it is nonsense to talk about health , disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , to think of the subject of health and disease in any way . According to my understanding , the profession should not study disease per se , but health should receive constant attention ; the important thing to know is health . The profession has given too much attention to disease ? to the study of pathology ? and not enough to health ? to physiology . We need to know all about health so that we can recognize it when we see it ; then we will be able to recognize deviations from the health standard , be they ever so slight . Then to know what is required to maintain health is to know the only real curing system . Curing disease means improving the health by removing anything and everything that tends to lower the life forces , for when health is up to the proper standard disease-building influences have the least // effect . This is a health knowledge that needs popularizing more than any other , for when laymen know that the very best prevention of all diseases is the intelligent care of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vaccination and drug prevention will not receive recognition . To keep people who live in a malarial country from coming under the malarial influence , they must know how to free their premises from health-destroying influences . They must know how to keep their homes and home environment free from disease-producing influences , and then they must know how to take care of their bodies ? how to eat , sleep , and clothe themselves . If doctors had known as much as they were supposed to know ? if they had known enough to instruct the people into health-building habits , and had preached less of quinine , malaria and mosquitoes , there would have been less malaria and more health , and the A. M. A. would not now find it necessary to appeal to Congress for power to educate the people into health . There is one question that will not down and that is : How are physicians to teach that which they do not know ? Malaria , the same as all other diseases , thrives best where there is ignorance , filth and poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an attribute of either ignorance or d@generation . Poverty of subsistence is not necessary to the success of the diseases coming from ignorance and filth , but frequently it becomes a logical sequence , by using up savings and inhibiting the earning power . Poverty is often referred to as the cause of diseases which are brought on from overeating or the eating of improperly prepared foods , but as this is taking place in well-to-do families , // poverty has n't everything to do with it ; hence , the word poverty is made to take on too much meaning . It has come within the range of my observation that people who are called poor ? those who earn from one to six dollars a day ? are made sick because they are ignorant of domestic economy and health laws , and not because they do not have food enough to eat . I can go to the homes of the well-to-do and find the same types of disease that are found among the so-called poor . I have seen people live in the worst kind of poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family was earning four dollars a day . One extreme case comes to my mind at this moment . I knew this family soon after it started out twenty-five years ago . At that time it consisted of man , wife and baby boy one year old . The man was an expert at his trade , and usually received fifty cents per day more wages than others working with him . The regular wages at that time were six dollars a day , but he received six dollars and fifty cents , or thirty-nine dollars a week for a full week 's work . I lived near them for a few months in their early married life , and knew their habits , for I was employed as their family physician , and I knew of their expenses . When there were father , mother and two children , a boy of three and another of one , the grocery bills were from forty to sixty dollars a month . I never saw such needless and stupid waste before or since . It was impossible to do these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachable . They lived up their earnings so that when a dull season came they were poor indeed , and had to be carried by all who were kind enough to help them . The family grew to five children , two of whom died while young . The wife and mother died twenty years after marriage , during which time she had experienced nothing but poverty and // discomfort , in spite of the good wages received by her husband . The home at the time of her death contained nothing but rags and wreckage ? scarcely a whole article of any description . I saw but little of this family for nearly twenty years , except as their faith in me , as a physician , caused them to send for me to counsel with their neighborhood physicians when death threatened them ; in this way I kept in touch with them . I must say this was one of the most incorrigible families I ever knew . They were ignorant , and their troubles in life were caused by ignorance and nothing else . So far as earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have put them in all the comfort needed , and a little good management would have brought a few conventional luxuries . To contrast with this case , my mind runs back to another family , the bread winner of which never in his life earned to exceed one dollar a day , yet he and his wife paid every dollar they owed , raised seven children to maturity , all of whom are respected , and they own a home and live in comfort . When they had nothing but four walls and a floor , cook stove and bed , everything was immaculately sweet and clean . This was a poor family , but it was clean , honest and healthy , and had all the food really needed , probably not the best food for ideal man building ; yet when I see disease and crime evolving from what the profession calls the eating of good , nourishing food , I am constrained to congratulate those who are too poor to raise children and feed them in a way to fit them for breaking into jails , penitentiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to declare that the poor are sick , because of unfit food ? too poor to buy the proper food . If this is true , // they would still eat food unfit for them if furnished all the money needed , for they do not know what they should eat . A chronic case of malarial poisoning , showing itself in intermittent attacks several times a year , should be treated on the same general principle that I treat all other diseases ; namely , the digestion and assimilation must be looked after and everything done that is necessary to improve them ; the different organs of the body must be brought into a state of normal functioning ; the blood , which is dysemic , and often hydremic , must be put into a normal state . This will be done when the digestion and assimilation are made normal . If the patient is having a chill every day , or every other day , he should be put on a fast until all indications of chills and fever have subsided . During the fast he should drink freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the day , and if there is a craving for lemon juice , it should be given . At the beginning of each chill , these patients should have an enema of warm water , and after the bowels are washed out they should be put into a bath as hot as they can bear it , in which they must remain for a half or three-quarters of an hour , and even longer in cases where it is necessary to relieve aches and pains . The bath should always be prolonged until it brings out perspiration . During the bath the patient can sip frequently of either hot or cold water ? as much and as often as he pleases . If there is no desire for water , he should take a half glassful every ten or fifteen minutes while in the bath . From the bath he should go to his bed and be covered up sufficiently to establish thorough perspiration , and when this is well accomplished the covering must be removed one piece at a time so that the cooling will not be too rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the patient should fast and the enema and bath are to be administered as directed for chills , every night until there ceases to be any need of them ? until the organs of the body are acting normally . The need for them is passed when the tongue is clean , the bowels are thoroughly cleared out , and the general aching that such cases are troubled with has passed away . As soon as the disease is controlled and the patient feels good , the feeding should be about as follows : Breakfast , some kind of fruit , either stewed or cooked . If there is an inclination for constipation , it would be better to have the fruit cooked , adding enough sugar to please the taste . Dinner can be eaten either at noon or at night , and may consist of some kind of fresh meat ? beef not oftener than twice a week . Salted , smoked or canned meats and fish should not be eaten . A plentiful supply of cooked and raw vegetables should be eaten with every dinner . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a slaw , or lettuce , tomatoes and cucumbers . The last three should be made into a salad and dressed with salt , olive oil and lemon juice . For cooking purposes , select from the following list : Turnips , carrots , cauliflower , beets , cabbage , onions , summer squash , parsnips , spinach , tomatoes , green peas , string beans , celery and asparagus . During the season for corn , this with one other vegetable , meat and salad will make as great a variety of food as those who are recuperating from disease should eat . When it is possible to have a salad , it should be eaten daily , for there are no foods so necessary for the complete eradication of the malarial poison and the full restoration of health as the juices of the raw vegetables . Therefore , either a slaw , or a salad , made as suggested above should be eaten every day when it is possible to have it . 1 12 MALARIAL FEVER . In the winter time a salad can be made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw vegetables , such as turnips and carrots , can be run through a vegetable mill and made into a salad with the leaf vegetables . To make a slaw , the cabbage may be cut up fine and dressed with salt , sugar and lemon juice . Vinegar should not be used . So long as there is any malaria in the system , these patients should not eat bread made with yeast . Biscuit , or hot bread , is almost , if not quite synonymous with the South , or the Southern people , and in this matter , the same as in all habits , peculiarities and distinguishing characteristics of peoples , the physiological demand , or cosmic urge , has more to do with causing the people to eat biscuit than education . It has been pretty generally conceded that light bread or bread made with yeast is more wholesome than hot bread or biscuit , whether made with baking powder or sour milk and soda . In spite of this , the South continues to eat hot bread , and when occasion appears to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that they are driven to continue the habit by the great law of self-preservation . The yeast bread favors fermentation , and the biscuit bread does not . There is more inclination for fermentation in the South than in the North . This being true , it would not be strange that the people would unwittingly refuse to take a food that is inclined to the development of stomach diseases . Patients should not have bread more than once a day , and it should be a well-baked biscuit , made as follows : One quart of equal parts of whole wheat and white flour ; salt sufficient ; heaping teaspoonful of baking powder ; one tablespoonful of melted butter . Make into a dough with milk . This can be baked in the form of a loaf . When cool , the loaf should // be sliced and returned to the oven to be baked again into toast or zwieback . If preferred , the dough can be rolled thin and made into biscuit , and baked thoroughly . The biscuit should not be more than an inch thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eaten at noon , the supper should be bread and butter , followed with a glass or two of milk . Buttermilk is preferable , but whole unskimmed sweet milk may be used . Corn bread may be used once a week , but never more than twice , and the biscuits above described are preferable to light bread . Those who are trying to get rid of malaria should bear in mind that they must always avoid overeating . So long as the system is crowded with an oversupply of food , it will be impossible to raise the bodily resistance sufficiently to enable one who has been poisoned with malaria to attain such a physical state of health that he will be able to live in a malarial country without having an attack of malaria every little while . Desserts should never be eaten until full health is restored , and then in moderation . These patients must make up their minds that if they would get rid of malaria and stay rid of it , they must sleep in a thoroughly ventilated bed room , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , and on getting up in the morning , the body should be thoroughly rubbed for five or ten minutes with a coarse towel or flesh brush . One hot cleansing bath a week on retiring at night is all the tub bathing necessary . Everything should be done to raise the health standard . This should be done at all times , but it is especially necessary to overcome chronic malarial poisoning . If the breathing is shallow , deep breathing should be practiced ; everybody should know the necessity of abdominal breathing . When the skin is put in first-class // condition with the night and morning dry rubs , a light weight , open woven cotton or linen undergarment is all that is necessary to wear in coldest weather . When these patients are once fully restored to health , they will have no trouble in retaining it , if they live as well as they know . To break the fever with quinine is not curing ; it is a very poor makeshift at palliation . CHAPTER VII . BILIOUS FEVER . SYMPTOMS ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a rigor that causes the patient to shake . He complains of being very cold . Nothing relieves him . No amount of covering does any good . There is vomiting , and in a few cases a slight running off of the bowels . At first the vomiting is of the contents of the stomach , but after the stomach is empty the vomited matter is bile and mucus . The temperature sometimes runs very high , from 3.5 ? F. to 6 ? F. above normal , The chill lasts from a few minutes to an hour . The fever reaches its highest point in from three to six hours . Within twelve hours after the chill , the fever declines and the patient perspires . At about the same time the chill began the first day , the fever begins to rise the second day . In many cases there is no repetition of the cold stage , this symptom being absent except at the beginning of the disease . In a very small per cent of cases there are chilly sensations for a short time each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually runs about as high on the second day as it does on the first . By the third day there should be a slight decline , the temperature on this day reaching not more than three degrees above normal , and by the fourth or fifth day the disease should come to an end unless it has been complicated , or , // in other words , prevented from ending by officious nursing and medicating . The treatment among physicians is : A cathartic followed by quinine as soon as the fever declines . It is very hard at times to distinguish between what is called bilious fever , intermittent fever , and remittent fever ; the fact is , they are all the same disease with slight variations of symptoms which cause nomenclators to distinguish as above . But separating malarial fever into these three types is really a work of supererogation ? formulating a distinction without a real difference ? except as each patient and his environment stamp their individualizing characteristics . The intermittent fever invariably starts with a chill , and the cold stage is followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires from three to twenty-four hours ? rarely twenty-four ? for the completion of one paroxysm or revolution of the disease . Those that last from twelve to twenty-four hours are not repeated oftener than every other day . Even those types that do not last longer than from three to six hours do not often return more frequently than every other day . Rare cases of the disease are to be seen that return every fourth day . This type of malaria is described more fully in the preceding chapter . The remittent type of fever starts with a chill , vomiting , headache , flushed face , bones aching all over , and then settles into a regular type of periodicity marked by exacerbations and remissions , repeating every twenty-four hours . The fever is not entirely gone at any time , but from three until nine or ten A. M. the temperature ranges as low as from 99 ? to 101 ? F ; while in the afternoon and evening it runs as high as from 102 ? to 103 ? and even 105 ? F. // This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on typhoid symptoms ; this is the fever that is denominated typho malarial fever , when it is forced to take on sepsis by malpractice ? bad nursing and worse medicating . Physicians who believe in drugs , in fact all medical authorities of note , declare that quinine will prove whether this disease is malaria or typhoid fever . If the administration of quinine in large doses fails to control or break the fever , it is alleged that the disease must be typhoid fever . There is positively no truth in this belief . Those cases that are badly nursed and treated are very much inclined to continue , and this favors blood deterioration ? sepsis ? hence any disease that is pro-longed by whatever cause , always tends to take on typhoid symp-toms . This can be seen in all low forms of fevers . I have known of cases of this character being treated heroic-ally , which means that they were given large doses of quinine ? twenty-five to fifty grains ? day after day for one or two weeks before the physicians in attendance decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not malarial fever , but that it was typhoid fever from the start if there had been a way of proving it . Does it take great intelligence to realize that irreparable harm must come to typhoid patients experimented on in this way ? Need I say that this disease is artificial , the real cause being cin chonism , and it could not have an existence without a doctor ? We learn from authorities what malarial fevers are , but it is worth a lot to the practical physician ? the practical man , be he doctor or layman ? to know what the real trouble is with those who are said to have malaria . It is all right for the doctor to know that his patient has malaria , if he really knows what the matter is with his patient . // If the disease that the doctors treat as malaria is really caused by the specific entity known as plasmodium and if it gains entrance to the body by mosquito inoculation , why is it that everyone exposed to the inoculation does not take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of all families , and members of all communities where malaria prevails , who remain free from its influence even when exposed to it in every way , then the so-called malarial poison is not specific and it can not be the cause of the diseases named malarial fevers . The truth about such diseases as this , as I discovered after treating so-called malarial fever for fifteen years , is that most of these patients are in a very bad physical state when they are taken sick . They have much stomach and bowel derangement ? perverted digestion and nutrition ? and it requires considerable time for nature to unload the poison , which is a true autotoxemia even if called malaria . Time has proven what I formerly suspected , namely , these diseases are more of a food poisoning than anything else ; and when they are heroically treated , they are in reality made worse . Where there is a slight toxic derangement , shocking the nervous system with quinine causes a change which is interpreted a cure . In severe cases it is impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of health in two or three days to a week , as the average physician believes it is necessary to do , unless there is something unusual ? typhoid fever ? in the case . To force an ending in the expected time , heroic doses of quinine are given and often these doses are doubled every day for several days which , of course , only causes an increase in all the symptoms and makes the patients very miserable and breaks down their resistance // to such an extent that there is a mortality in malarial typhoid wholly out of keeping with the natural severity of the disease . At the end of a week or ten days of ineffectual efforts at breaking the disease , but not always ineffectual as regards the breaking of the patient , physicians decide to treat these cases from this time on as typhoid fever . The treatment for typhoid fever was not as mild formerly as it is today . Under the very best " regular " treatment these patients go from bad to worse , and the twenty-first day after the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse from 120 to 130 , delirious , and in severe cases the delirium is so violent that it is difficult to keep the patients in bed . From the twenty-first to the forty-second days there is a gradual decline of the symptoms , and the majority make a very slow recovery , varying from three to four to five or even six months . Quite a large number of those who have so long a convalescence develop , in time , tuberculosis or some chronic disease that takes them off a few years afterwards . About twenty-five per cent of all cases of this nature die between the twenty-first and the fortysecond days ; and many of them die from perforation , showing that there is ulceration in the bowels . They all show a septic state of the blood and , in fact , the blood condition is the same as the sepsis of typhoid fever . The treatment of this disease has not changed materially in twenty-five years . If there is not so large a mortality today it is because the type of the disease is lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever because the experience I have had has taught me that they are all one and the same except for the variation that is caused by // the patient 's individuality , domestic environment , nursing , treatment , etc . The severe or fatal type of the disease that I have just described is an artificial disease . It requires complicating with a zealous doctor and heroic treatment . Such a disease is never seen in nature ; it is made by the medical profession . I say that it would be impossible for any such disease to have an existence without the aid of a treatment that breaks down all resistance . In those sections of the country where malarial fever still abounds , the doctors are using quinine to break it . The giving of quinine is a superstition which it will take ages to overcome . It is possible that most of these malarial sections of the country will soon be so highly cultivated from an agricultural point of view , that the malarial influence will be done away with entirely . Labor saving machinery prevents people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago nearly all the harvest workers would break down during the season . As I have said before in my writings : Soil drainage and labor saving machinery have been the most remarkable antidotes for malarial fever that have been developed in the last fifty years . Hence , if labor saving machinery and drainage of lands are antimalarial , what is malaria ? Fifty per cent , or more , is quinine , other drugs , and wrong life , plus a stereotyped cureless treatment . I never was called to a case of so-called malarial fever that did not show evidence of abuse to digestion . The causes of these fevers that prevailed in the part of Illinois in which I lived more than any other class of diseases from 1872 to 1886 , were hot sun , hard work , five hearty meals a day , and a great deal of water between meals . // In many instances this regime was not kept up , during harvest season , for more than a week until the victims were prostrate , and it would be a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of the bowels ; as soon as the system was cleared out and had time for reaction to take place , these patients were out and frequently in a week they were apparently as well as ever . I know that the so-called malaria had nothing to do with these cases . I had been taught from childhood to break the fever with quinine and this my college training confirmed ; hence , in 1872 , when I started in practice I knew ( ? ) how to cure ( ? ) malarial fevers . I had been taught to give heroic doses of the drug as soon as the fever subsided . I succeeded in shocking these malarial cases so that as a rule I was not required to pay more than two or three visits to the ordinary types . During my first year in practice , beginning the first of June , I kept a memorandum of the amount of quinine used and it amounted to ninety-five ounce bottles besides many prescriptions that were filled at drug stores . Fourteen years afterwards , I used less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four or five times as much professional work ; I certainly had better success my fourteenth year than I did the first year . My prescriptions the first year called for three to six doses of quinine of from two to ten grains to be given every two to three hours , beginning as soon as the fever subsided . The small doses were for children over ten years of age and the large doses were for strong men . I stated above that I did n't have to make more than two or three calls in the majority of cases . A few failed to respond to the treatment , and by main strength and awkwardness // I caused these to be in bed for a week or two ; and those that were recognized , or supposed to be recognized , at the start as inclined to typhoid , were treated in a way that permitted them to get well in about twenty-one days . The treatment for the typhoid type of the fever I modified in the course of fifteen to twenty years so that I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I discarded heroic nursing and treatment , the type of disease declined in severity until there were very few cases by the time I left the malarial country that lasted to exceed twelve to fourteen days . Treatment ? Before giving my own treatment I shall quote from Dr. Osier 's Practice of Medicine . It is my intention that the reader shall know the scientific plan as well as my own . In quinine we possess a specific remedy against malarial infection . Experiment has shown that the parasites are most easily destroyed by quinine at the stage when they are free in the circulation ? that is , during and just after segmentation . While in most instances the parasites of the regularly intermittent fevers may be destroyed , even in the intra-corpuscular stage , in aestivoautumnal fever this is much more difficult . It should , then , be our object , if we wish to most effectually eradicate the infection , to have as much quinine in circulation at the time of the paroxysm and shortly before as is possible , for this is the period at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 to 30 grains in divided doses throughout the day will in many instances prevent any fresh paroxysms . If the patient comes under observation shortly before an expected paroxysm , the administration of a good dose of quinine just before its onset may be advisable to obtain the maximum effect upon that group of parasites . The quinine will not prevent the paroxysm , but will destroy the greater part of the group of organisms and prevent its further recurrence . It is safer to give at least 20 to 30 grains daily for the first three days , and then to continue the remedy in smaller doses for the next two or three weeks . In aestivo-autumnal fever larger doses may be necessary , though in relatively few instances is it necessary to give more than 30 to 40 grains in the twenty-four hours . // The quinine should be ordered in solution or in capsules . The pills and compressed tablets are more uncertain , as they may not be dissolved . A question of interest is the efficient dose of quinine necessary to cure the disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times a day will in many cases prevent the paroxysm , but not always with the certainty of the larger doses . In cases of aestivo-autumnal fever with pernicious symptoms it is necessary to get the system under the influence of quinine as rapidly as possible . In these instances the drug should be administered hypodermically as the dihydrochlorate , in 15 to 20 grain doses , every two or three hours . The muriate of quinine and urea is also a good form in which to administer the drug hypodermically ; 10 , 15 or 20 grain doses may be necessary . In the most severe instances some observers advise the intravenous administration of quinine , for which the very soluble bimuriate is well adapted . Fifteen grains with a grain of sodium chloride may be injected in about two drachms of distilled water . For extreme restlessness in these cases opium is indicated , and cardiac stimulants , such as alcohol and strychnine , are necessary . If in the comatose form the internal temperature is raised , the patient should be put into a bath and doused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arsenic are indicated . An interesting question is much discussed , whether quinine does not cause , or at any rate aggravate , the haemoglobinuria . We have not yet seen a case in which this condition has occurred as a result of the use of the drug , and Bastenelli states that it is not seen in the Roman malarial fevers . He recommends that in any case of haemoglobinuria if the blood shows parasites quinine should be administered freely . In the post-malarial forms quinine aggravates the attack . In an active malarial infection the patient runs less risk with the quinine . To those who are not aware of the absolute impotency for cure of the theory and practice of medicine , the foregoing quotation will have the ring of real science ; but there is n't anything in it of a curative nature . Physicians practicing in malarial locations and wedded to the ' use of quinine will not adopt the suggestions that I shall make , but they can not do better when called to see such cases than proscribe // all food and insist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using copious enemas to wash out the bowels , and at the beginning of the chill , put the patient into a hot bath and keep him there until complete relaxation has taken place . The bath room should be furnished with all the fresh air possible by leaving the window and door wide open . Positively no food is to be given until nature has had time to clean house . After the first day if there is a normal color of the tongue and it is rather inclined to be long , or if there is a tendency for redness and a craving for lemon juice , the juice of half a lemon in a glass of water every three hours should represent food and medicine . If the tongue is broad and thick and rather pallid , an alkaline mineral water should be given in place of the lemon , and in lieu of the proper water , ten to fifteen grains of common baking soda should be put into a glass of water and taken every three hours , or a very small quantity can be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient should be encouraged to drink a great deal of water , for there is an inclination in these fevers to perspire , and the bath and the drinking of hot water will aid nature in her clearing out endeavors . After the fever has gone , the patient can be instructed in regard to eating . If such people are willing to confine themselves to fruit for breakfast , a dinner of meat , vegetables and a salad at noon , and nothing more for supper than toasted bread and butter followed with a glass of milk , it is very doubtful if they will have another attack of malarial fever . // These diseases the people force upon themselves in malarial sections of the country with their very harsh style of living . Many of them have meat and bread , fried potatoes and coffee and other such foods for breakfast and the other meals are very largely on the same order , except they have a greater variety . The poor people kill themselves by eating overmuch of mushes , bread and potatoes . The tendency is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods that are adapted to very cold weather ; common sense and reason say that this is conducive to a great deal of harm when indulged in in very warm weather . The farmers , as a general rule , are the ones who suffer most from these fevers , and they , of all classes of people , should have the best food , for they can have all the fresh vegetables of the season on their tables ; but unfortunately the reverse is too often true . They have the foods that are only fit for winter . It can be seen from my quotations that all the investigations in regard to the cause of malaria have not added a tittle to the treatment . Before we knew anything about malaria 's specific entity named plasmodium , and the mosquitoes which are said to hypodermic the poison into the system , the remedy first , last and all the time was quinine . Since we have learned all this about the disease , the remedy still remains the same , first , last and all the time , quinine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine . A continuous investigation causing radical changes in opinion affects not at all the old and established lines of treatment . If quinine is a specific for malaria , what difference should it make in what manner it gains entrance into the system ? // All authorities agree that the best time to get the remedy into the system is just previous to an attack ? just before the exacerbation comes on . If quinine is an antidote according to the law of antidotes , it should not matter when it is administered during the disease . There should be a cessation of the disease if it is caused by malarial poison and quinine is a real specific . The fact of the matter is , it is not a specific , for every first-class physician will declare that there is but one time that is appropriate for the administration of quinine to be effectual in the control of periodicity , and that is within four to six hours preceding the exacerbation of the symptoms , and if the drug is really a specific it should antidote whenever given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into practice , but today it is as plain as A , B , C , that the remedy cures by shock . It produces a shock and as ( according to an old medical philosophy ) two diseases can not exist in the system at the same time , the quinine influence is so much greater than the so-called malarial that the latter temporarily abdicates . Quinine produces such a nervous irritation that it completely eclipses the malarial influence and changes the organic rhythm . The system is so changed by the quinine shock that it takes some time for it to drop back under the rhythmic influence peculiar to malaria . This is called curing malaria , but it is no more a cure than the change which takes place from the use of drugs in other diseases . The rule is that heroic doses of quinine given three hours before the fever begins to manifest will shock the system sufficiently to interrupt the peculiar periodicity characteristic of these diseases . If quinine were a specific it is used to such a tremendous extent in all malarial countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept antidoted for all time in the bodies of the inhabitants of these countries . But this is a mistake , and perhaps only half the truth , for I think it can be proven that those who take the greatest amount of quinine suffer most from the disease , for the drug breaks down their resistance and causes them to be sensitive to disease influences . We see but very little malaria in this western country . I have seen a few attacks of malaria in Colorado , but it is very unusual . We have people visiting our state from malarial sections who bring the disease with them . A short time ago I was consulted by a lady seeking advice for the cure of asthma . In the course of treatment , she showed a state of the nervous system that was out of keeping with the symptoms for which she consulted me . This nervous irritability culminated in occasional sick stomachs , tired , languid feelings , which finally evolved into a masked periodicity which manifested every day . I diagnosed her case as that of malaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowels out with a copious enema , follow this with a bath as hot as can be borne ; stay in the bath until all aches and pains are removed , then go to bed , put a hot jug to the feet and remain in bed , take nothing into the stomach except water . This regime she was to repeat every day at the same time the fever symptoms presented themselves until fully recovered . She did as instructed and inside of a week she was feeling splendid ? better than she had felt for months previously . She not only got rid of the symptoms of asthma , but of this periodicity , and her other symptoms of malarial poisoning entirely disappeared . Any case of malaria , I do n't care how severe , can be controlled satisfactorily in a very reasonable time by adopting this // treatment , and the control is very much more dependable than when brought about by drug action , because when people are shocked with quinine they have irritability of the stomach , besides the system has not had an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug shock to recoil and cease functioning ; the irregularities of improper life have not been dispensed with ; in fact , nothing has been done except to shock the system into an unusual rhythm which is pronounced a cure until the effect is worn off and then the old malarial rhythm ? disease ? is re-established . It was my plan years ago , before I gave up the use of drugs , to give all the quinine I intended giving within six hours preceding the attack , and in this way I was successful in curing ( ? ) the fevers , but the question is : Did I cure these people ? When they were not having malarial fever they were having every little while indications of indigestion , deranged stomach and bowels , for which I gave them the usual prescription ? bitter tonics with pepsin . This dosing always gave relief , but my patients were not cured . When I visited that country something like twenty years after , all those old clients were on the other side of the divide . It was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there read their names on the headstones . The physicians who were my successors had been curing ( ? ) these people in the same manner until they were all dead because of their many cures . Most of these people died in middle life . Why ? Because the doctors of that country did not know how to treat them any better than I did . I was considered about as expert as any of them , but I can say without fear of successful contradiction that I never did cure a case of malaria with drugs , and no other doctor has ever cured a case or ever will with quinine . // Between the so-called malarial attacks and the treatment given , the bodies of these people who live in malarial countries are being gradually undermined and they one and all must die prematurely . And lastly permit me to suggest that if malaria is due to a specific germ , and quinine is antidotal ? a specific for the germ ? and the only known specific for the disease , why is it that the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the drug than when it is used ? If quinine is a specific , why are there so many uncured or chronic cases of malaria that the drug has utterly failed to benefit ? CHAPTER VIII . ANIMAL PARASITES . UNDER this head all text-books on the practice of medicine describe a large number of living entities which inhabit the intestines of a certain portion of the human race . The human animal in its finest physical state ? in an ideal state of health ? furnishes the habitat for innumerable germs and parasites . As hinted time and again in my writings , the inhabitable world is teeming with microscopic life , and under proper conditions ? under normal and physiological adjustments ? the number is in keeping with necessity . The farmer can not raise crops on a soil that is not made mellow and permeable to the air by parasites . Every animal and plant is adjusted to its parasitic environment , and the parasites are as necessary to the animal and plant as the animal and plant are necessary to the parasites . In every environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balancing of interests ? a reciprocity for the benefit of all varieties of life ? and when anything occurs that interferes with the supply of the microscopic life , or vice versa , this lack of adjustment presents itself in imperfect development . The medical profession has evolved a system of bacteriology which is a very badly presented truth regarding a lost equilibrium in the supply and demand of the varieties of germs that are the // subject of this so-called science , and as I have referred to it in describing the diseases which are said to be caused by germs , I shall not allude to it further than to just mention this fact and pass on to a hasty review of . a few of the parasites which are said to be the cause of various diseases classified under the head of parasitic diseases . If the alimentary canal is the habitat for certain germs and parasites ? if it is perfectly natural that this canal be inhabited by living entities ? they can not truthfully be said to be the cause of disease , for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life would be free from them , and it is not . This being true , we must look for some other cause to account for the diseases said to be caused by them . When disease is present there is a larger accumulation of certain germs or parasites than is to be found in health . This will lead to the question : Why are there more parasites in a subject who is diseased than there are in one who is in full health ? The temptation will be great to answer this question , at first blush , by saying that it is the surplus number of parasites that creates disease . But this does not answer the question at all . Why do they accumulate more in one person than in another ? It is due finally to lost resistance , but this does not give a satisfactory answer , for lost resistance must be accounted for . There is a cause for lost resistance , and until it is found , the primary cause of parasitic infestion can not be said to be known . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trees are not supplied with all the elements required by their nutrition , they become the victims of parasites . These enemies to tree life can be controlled to a certain // extent by sprays , but their attacks will continue until the tree is destroyed , unless the elements necessary for perfect tree development be supplied , and if they are , the tree will be able to defend itself . This is true of animal life ; those who are sick have not the power to resist parasitic invasion , but as soon as health returns , parasites disappear . This statement may raise the question : If lost resistance favors parasitic invasion , why are not all people who are broken down troubled with parasites ? This opens the subject of the origin of the different species of parasites , which is full of interest and when fully understood will throw a flood of light on causation . Diseases due to parasites thrive best among the poor ? among those who are unable to supply themselves with the best foods . These people live largely on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans , pork and molasses . And there are people who are not poor who have their foods badly cooked and miserably cared for when left over from one meal to another . This style of eating , along with filthy houses , dirty beds , no ventilation , no care of the body , little bathing , if any , and cleanliness in general an unknown quantity , constitute the principal causes of the malassimilation and degeneration necessary to make parasitic invasion possible . Just what kind will develop depends upon what parasites are peculiar to the locality , the character of the foods , the peculiarities of the eating habits , the climatic conditions , the individual type and the race of people . Those people who eat large quantities of the decidedly starch bearing foods , especially bread made from badly cured grain , with molasses , are troubled with bowel diseases and parasites . It stands // to reason that the species of parasite must be in keeping with those that are peculiar to the locality in which the food is raised . I think it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , causing them to differ in appearance from those infesting the food and water supply , are due to the change wrought by the unusual habitat ? the change brought about by the influence of the intestines , whose environment is unnatural . Imagine what the change would be in man if it were possible for him to live for several generations in the belly of a whale ! It is reasonable to believe that intestinal parasites must be modified types of those that are native to the environments ? the foods and waters in which they are carried into the bowels of those who suffer from parasitic diseases . If this is true , cleanliness and care in the selection and preparation of foods will lessen the intake , and to just that extent conserve the bodily resistance . It is true that there are well-to-do people ? those who have good food and comfortable surroundings ? who are troubled with intestinal parasites , but parasitic diseases are very rare indeed with the educated and well-to-do , and where there is an occasional attack , the victims have brought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gluttonizing . Before parasites can thrive in the intestinal tract there must be a decided letting down in the life forces . Nutrition must be badly impaired ; renewal of tissue slow and imperfect ; the mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels debilitated and ready to undergo degeneration so that the usual exfoliation takes place prematurely , giving rise to a parasitic metamorphosis . Expressed in other words ; because of a lack of the proper elements for a high . // grade of tissue-making , there is a retrogression and man becomes a parasite-builder . There is a great variety of parasites which have been described in medical books , but inasmuch as the general condition that favors their development is the same , it is a waste of time in such a work as mine to describe every variety and speculate in regard to its proper treatment . When the intestinal canal has become inhabited by any form of parasites , it does not require a very vivid imagination to understand how it is possible for these parasites to find their way into the different cavities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very easy matter for them to find their way to the bronchial tubes and lungs , for they certainly can work their way up the esophagus into the pharynx , and the inhaling of air will favor their passage into the bronchial tubes and lungs . Flukes ? Disiomiasis ? There is a pulmonary distomiasis described called the Asiatic lung or bronchial fluke . It is said to be from 8 to 16 mm. in length and 4 to 8 mm. in breadth , of a pinkish or reddish brown color , and to be found extensively in China , Japan and Formosa ; a few cases have also been reported in Europe and America . It has been found among the cats , dogs and hogs of the United States . There is n't any reason why the domestic animals should not have parasites ; the domestication of any animal appears to favor the development of disease . The reason domestic animals are more subject to disease than when in their wild state is because they are fed irregularly and housed unwisely ; sometimes they have no food at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of the proper quality . // Domestic animals enjoy the distinction of having the same kinds of diseases that their masters have , and the reason is because they have much the same habits . When the fluke gains entrance to the lungs it is said to produce cough , brownish sputum and occasional attacks of hemoptysis ? hemorrhage . It is said that these parasites may affect other organs , such as the liver and brain . It is possible for them to pass up through the gall-duct ; it is necessary , however , for the gall to be very imperfect in its constituents , for if the bile were normal it would kill the parasites . This is true of the stomach and intestinal secretions . It is impossible for anyone to be overcharged with parasites who has normal secretions and excretions ; it is when the secretions have lost their normal constituents that they have also lost their anti-parasitic properties . It must not be forgotten that the normal individual is protected by his secretions and excretions , and living a life that perverts the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the secret of the multiplying of germs and parasites in his organism . Those of the readers who would like a description of these parasites should go to any first-class text-book on the practice of medicine . It is generally conceded that they are taken into the body with water and vegetables . That is one reason vegetable eating , up to ten years ago , had almost gone out of fashion , but the STUFFED CLUB 'S teachings have brought back the habit of eating raw vegetables in the past few years so that today it is becoming unusual not to find raw vegetable salads on the tables of the better class of people , the professional calamityhowl of germs on vegetables to the contrary notwithstanding . // The text-book description of the manner in which these parasites get into the system not only prejudiced the profession against the garden vegetables , but the lay people as well , and to such an extent that their consumption , up to a decade ago , became almost nil . The health of many people suffers from the non-use of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important purposes in the animal economy , namely , Tissue Building . It should be remembered by intelligent people that parasites gain entrance into our bodies in thousands of ways , and it is impossible for us to prevent their access . If the human animal desires to make its body inaccessible to germs and parasites , it must be sterilized , placed in a vacuum and there remain . The question of how to prevent the invasion of our bodies by parasites is not as important as how to keep our bodily resistance up to the normal so that when unfriendly germs and parasites gain an entrance they will be killed or made harmless by the body-defenders ? benevolently assimilated as it were . Symptoms ? Dr. Osier says , " As is so often the case with animal parasites , they may cause no inconvenience . " That is exactly in line with what I have been saying , that when the bodily resistance is up to normal the parasites will cause no inconvenience , and if they cause no inconvenience except when the body is impaired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state that it will defend itself against these enemies . In. going on to describe the symptoms , Dr. Osier says , " Irritability of the bladder , dull pain in the perineum and heematuria blood in the urine are the most frequent symptoms . " It is not necessary for me to go to any great length in describing the sympSYMPTOMS. 1 37 toms , because if the bladder is affected by these parasites there will be symptoms of cystitis ; when the rectum is involved there will be straining and bearing down , with the passing of mucus and blood , and where they invade the vagina there will be vaginitis . Dr. Osier gives two pages of history , description and symptoms of the diseases caused by flukes , and his treatment occupies three lines ; I take pleasure in giving them : " We know nothing which can kill the parasites in the blood . Extract of male fern is recommended for the haematuria . The chronic cystitis and proctitis inflammation of the rectum demand the usual measures for these disorders . " That is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students of his text-book ; they certainly will know just exactly how to get rid of flukes . It appears to me , however , that when the student undertakes to apply the treatment he will make a " flunk " of it . Sestodes ( Taeniasis ; Hydatid Disease ) ? commonly called tape-worm . It is said that man harbors the adult parasites in the small intestines , the larval forms in the muscles and solid organs . There are several varieties of this worm , taenia solium , or pork tape-worm , taenia saginata , or beef tape-worm , and several others unnecessary to name . The first variety , or pork tape-worm , according to Osier , is not a common form in North America ; it is much more frequently met with in Europe and Asia . When matured it measures from 6 to 12 feet in length . The head is small , round , not so large as the head of a pin , and provided with four sucking disks and a double row of hooklets . It is recognized as the armed tape-worm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 cm. in length and from 7 to 8 mm. in breadth . There are thousands of ova in each // ripe segment and each ovum consists of a firm shell , inside of which is a little embryo , provided with six hooklets . The segments are continually passed , and if the ova are to attain further development they must be taken into the stomach , either of a pig , or of man himself . The shells are digested , the six-hooked embryos become free , and passing from the stomach reach various parts of the body ( the liver , muscles , brain or eye ) , where they develop into the larvae or cysticerci . A hog , under these circumstances , is said to be measled , and the cysticerci are spoken of as measles or bladder worms . This parasite takes its name of taenia solium because it was thought to exist as a solitary parasite in the bowels , but two or three or even more worms may occur . Taenia Saginata , or beef tape-worm , is the common tapeworm of North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly in western Europe on account of the importation of beef and live stock from the Mediterranean basin . It is 15 to 20 feet long and may attain a greater length . I have heard of instances where it measured from 35 to 60 feet . Fifteen feet is long enough to satisfy the most ambitious , at least while they are compelled to carry it ; after a successful " catch " it is important to have it long enough to make a good story . The width of this parasite is over 2 mm . Symptoms ? It has been found in children as well as in adults , even in suckling children . It was the fashion in the early days ? in our grandfathers ' days ? to have a piece of fat pork put into the mouth of a new born baby . Possibly this is the way the children who have had tape-worm at that age procured the egg . I make this explanation believing that perhaps some of the readers will not be able to imagine how a tape-worm could get // into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it must get in through the eating of pork . It should not be forgotten that children can be born under circumstances that cause them to take on the evolution of disease very early . I saw one child die of sarcoma before it was two weeks old . A child can not develop such formidable symptoms so soon in the line of disease-building unless it has been brought into the world with its tissue formation in a very vulnerable state , causing it to enter into the degenerating process with the slightest provocation . A very common symptom and one that is recognized as being almost indicative of the presence of tape-worm is a longing for food and the consuming of immense quantities without any apparent benefit ? the more these people eat , seemingly , the poorer they get . Some complain of abdominal pains , nausea , and diarrhea . A few subjects I have seen who presented a bloodless appearance . Each victim of the disease will have symptoms in keeping with his temperament . The lymphatic individual will not be troubled with as much nervousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that tape-worm has been the cause of chorea , convulsions or epilepsy . I have never seen a case of the kind . The constitutional derangement that permits of the flourishing of a tapeworm in the intestinal tract is sufficient cause , in certain cases , to develop epilepsy . I should not expect a case of epilepsy to be controlled by simply removing and getting rid of a tape-worm ; the constitutional derangement in all such cases must be corrected before such an important disease as epilepsy can be got rid of permanently . // There is but one positive sign of tape-worm , and that is the passing of a portion of it . Those who have tape-worm will frequently pass links of it . To determine the existence of the worm it is necessary to watch the stools for a week at a time , and if there is a tape-worm pieces of it will be discovered . There is but one way to prevent such a disease , and that is to eat a properly balanced bill of fare and otherwise keep the body in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall first quote from Dr. Osier , and then follow with my own suggestions . For two days prior to the administration of the remedies the patient should take a very light diet and have the bowels moved occasionally by a saline cathartic . The practitioner has the choice of a large number of drugs . As a rule , the male fern acts promptly and well . The ethereal extract , in 2-drachm doses , may be given fasting , and followed in the course of a couple of hours by a brisk purgative . This usually succeeds in bringing away a large portion , but not always the entire worm . A combination of the remedies is sometimes very effective . An infusion is made of pomegranate root , half an ounce ; pumpkin seeds , 1 ounce ; powdered ergot , a drachm ; and boiling water , 10 ounces . To an emulsion of the male fern ( a drachm of ethereal extract ) , made with acacia powder , 2 minims of croton oil are added . The paient should have had a low diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening . The emulsion and infusion are mixed and taken fasting at nine in the morning . The pomegranate root is a very efficient remedy , and may be given as an infusion of the bark , 3 ounces of which may be macerated in 10 ounces of water and then reduced to one-half by evaporation . The entire quantity is then taken in divided doses . It occasionally produces colic , but is a very effective remedy . The active principle of the root , pelletierine , is now much employed . It is given in doses of 6 to 8 or even 10 grains , with a little tannin ( grs. v ) in sweetened water , and is followed in an hour by a purge . Pumpkin seeds are sometimes very efficient . Three or four ounces should be carefully bruised and then macerated for twelve or fourteen hours , and the // entire quantity taken and followed in an hour by a purge . Of other remedies , koosso , turpentine in ounce doses in honey and kamala may be mentioned . Unless the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and within a few months the segments again appear . Some instances are extraordinarily obstinate . Doubtless almost everything depends upon the exposure of the worm . The head and neck may be thoroughly protected beneath the valvulw conniventes , in which case the remedies may not act . Owing to its armature Tmnia solium is more difficult to expel . It is probable that no degree of peristalsis could dislodge the head , and unless the worm is killed it does no let go its extraordinarily firm hold on the mucous membrane . If hot water be put in the commode the worm is less likely to contract and be broken , a practice recommended by Celsus . My treatment for tape-worm is the same as it is for anything and everything else , namely , cure the patient , correct his life , but first of all it is necessary , for psychological reasons , to get rid of the worm . If the patient can see the worm and . know that it has been expelled , then he will get that relief of mind and body which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for expelling the tape-worm is to have the patient fast for three days , then give the juice of a lemon in water every three hours until the worm has passed away , which will take place within twenty-four hours after the administration of the first lemon . It is possible that this may fail in a few instances ? in those cases where there is a large accumulation in the bowels ? hence , to prevent a failure it would be well to use enemas or even resort to a sufficient quantity of laxative spring water , such as pluto or apollinaris , to get a thorough cleaning out during the three days ' fast , then by " handing " the worm a " lemon " he will usually abdicate . After this the real treatment should begin by correcting the life of the patient . If the individual is in the habit of smoking , drinking or using coffee and tea , these habits must // be given up and a correct dietary prescribed . As every reader of my writings should know , every case is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its needs . Taenia Echinococcus of the dog ? These worms are so small that they may be readily overlooked , for they are white and threadlike and closely adherent to the intestinal wall . It is said that the ripe segments contain about 5,000 eggs , which attain their development in the solid organs of the various animals , particularly the dog and ox , more rarely in the horse and sheep . In some countries man is a common intermediate host , owing to the accidental ingestion of the ova . When this occurs and his body becomes infested with the echinococci they develop a cystic form of disease in different parts of the body . This is a parasite that creates hydatids of the liver . For a description of this disease I refer the reader to any of the leading text-books on the practice of medicine . When large cysts are formed in the liver they may discharge through the bowel and the patient recover , but where the constitution is broken , the habits of the patients are bad , and vital resistance exhausted , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for parasitic diseases , the same as all other forms of disease , and the prevention consists of living right , keeping the constitution as near normal as possible , so that when there is an accidental ingestion of such parasites the natural defensive secretions of the stomach and bowels will prevent their development in the organism ? they should be digested . Nematodes ? There are several varieties of parasites coming under the head of nematodes , namely , ascariasis , trichiniasis , ankylostomiasis , filariasis , dracontiasis , and others . // Ascaris Lumbricoides is the most common parasite infesting the human bowel . It is found chiefly in children . The female is from 7 to 12 inches in length and the male from 4 to 8 inches . In form it is cylindrical , pointed at both ends , with a yellowishbrown , sometimes a slightly reddish color . This worm does not look very unlike the common angle worm . The profession has not decided whether or not there is a toxin secreted by these worms which causes nervousness and the usual symptoms said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Peiper and others suggest that the nervous symptoms , sometimes resembling those of meningitis , are due to this poison . Other writers have gone still further and report a remarkable condition of fever , intestinal symptoms , foul breath , and intermittent diarrhea in connection with the presence of these worms , and they have named the disease typho-lumbricosis . The febrile condition may continue for a month or more , but Oster says that the question of toxins produced by intestinal parasites is an open one . He says : " A few parasites may cause no disturbance . In children there are irritative symptoms usually attributed to worms , such as restlessness , irritability , picking at the nose , grinding of the teeth , twitchings , or convulsions . " All of these symptoms can be produced by indigestion . Children that are allowed to eat at any time and anything they wish will have attacks of stomach and bowel derangement , in which any and all the symptoms named above can be found . The disease that some authors are pleased to denominate typholumbricosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gastritis . It is frequently diagnosed typhoid fever , and in malarial countries typho-malarial fever , and again it may be diagnosed continued fever . // I think I am safe in saying that it is impossible to find such symptoms as we have just gone over in children that are fed regularly three times a day , given proper nourishment and supplied with a proper amount of fresh air in their bedrooms . Treatment ? The following I quote from Osler 's Practice of Medicine : " ' Santonin can be given , mixed with sugar , in doses of from one-half to one grain for a child and two to three grains for an adult , followed by a calomel or a saline purge . The dose may be given for three or four days . An unpleasant consequence which sometimes follows the administration of this drug is xanthopsia or yellow vision . " As regards the toxic influence of this drug , I will say that I was called in consultation more than thirty years ago to see a child who was dying from the effects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of intestinal worms . Whether or not the diagnosis was correct I do not know . The child died in a few hours after I saw it . The treatment and its results made a very lasting impression upon me , and was one of the tragedies peculiar to the practice of medicine that helped to force me into drug nihilism . For the past twenty-five years I have ignored the subject of intestinal parasites in treating diseases of children , and I find that all children respond very quickly to a treatment based upon the correcting of the habits of life . There is n't anything that is so gratifying as the response given by children 's constitutions when wrong life is proscribed and correct care of the body and proper feeding are administered . It is a crime to give children drugs . A case comes to my mind just now which will serve to illustrate the general plan of my procedure in the management of the diseases peculiar to children . This particular case was a little girl six years old ; she had // been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been under the care of a most excellent family physician from her birth to the time she came West , but in spite of his best endeavors the child remained sick , and he , in his wisdom , decided that a change of climate was the only thing that would save her life . After the case had remained in Denver for six months , in spite of altitude and the excellent quality of ozone that the Colorado atmosphere furnishes , the child remained the same invalid that she was " back yonder in Ohio . " The mother was induced to bring the child to me . She did so very reluctantly because she did not believe that there was any medical knowledge on earth that could possibly be of any benefit to the child since her family physician had failed ; hence , she turned her child over to my medical care without faith . The symptoms that the case presented were those of chronic irritation of the stomach , indigestion and the nervousness that is peculiar to such cases . My prescription was as simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a very imprudent , indulgent mother . I ordered the child put to bed at a regular hour every night and taken up at a regular hour in the morning ; she was to be given not more than one or two tub baths a week , and in addition enough sponging for cleansing purposes . Her breakfast was to consist of toasted bread and butter , to be eaten dry , and followed with a glass of milk . If she did not eat this breakfast , which the mother assured me she would not , it was to be put away and no food permitted to be eaten between breakfast time and lunch time . At lunch time the same kind of food was to be offered her that was prescribed for her breakfast , and // to be eaten the same way , and if she still had no desire the food was to be removed and the child excused from eating anything until dinner time in the evening ? positively no food of any kind between meals and nothing to drink except water . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening , and if the child had no desire for it she was to be put to bed without anything further being offered her . This routine was to be carried out each day until the patient could take this food with a relish , which the mother assured me she did not believe the child would ever be induced to do . I insisted that this must be the menu for at least one week , and if she had no appetite she was to be permitted to go without anything for the entire week . The mother expressed herself as very much dissatisfied with my prescription , but I told her that if she would follow my instructions the child would get well so quickly that she would be surprised . I succeeded in securing the mother 's promise that she would follow my instructions implicitly for one week , and after that week I would give the child a very much more liberal supply of food . The case was to be reported to me in one week . When the patient appeared at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mother was happy and so was the child ; the former remarked that she believed the child had eaten more in the past week than she had ever eaten in the same length of time in her entire life , and so far as she could see the little girl was about as well as it was possible for her to be . If the eating of toast and butter , and a glass of milk , morning , noon and night , and a regular time to go to bed and get up , are antidotal to intestinal worms , what can possibly be the cause of parasitic infestion of children 's bowels ? // Oxyuris Vermicularis ( Thread-worm ; Pin-worm ) ? This parasite occupies the rectum and colon . They produce great irritation and itching , more particularly at night . Many people imagine that they have itching piles when it is these pin-worms that are disturbing them . They produce great restlessness and irritability , and often sleep is disturbed . They are most common in children , although they are found in people of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected in the faeces . Infection probably takes place through water , or possibly through salads , such as lettuce and tresses . A person the subject of the worms passes ova in large numbers in the faeces , and the possibility of reinfection must be scrupulously guarded against . I presume the reason Iettuce is pointed out as being especially liable to carry all sorts of parasites into the human body is because the human excreta is often used as a fertilizer . All that is necessary to guard against infection from the use of vegetables is to exercise a reasonable amount of care in cleanliness . So far as the vegetables are concerned , if they have had a normal growth and are crisp and healthy , all the germs that infest them can be washed away , and the more of such food that is eaten the less liable consumers are to be troubled with parasitic diseases . I think I am absolutely safe in declaring that the consumption of a reasonable amount of raw vegetables is a better prophylaxis than almost any other measure that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Practice : The treatment is simple , though occasionally there are instances in which all forms of medication are resisted . A case is mentioned of a gentleman , aged forty , who had suffered from childhood and had failed to obtain any benefit from prolonged treatment by many helminthologists . Santonin may be used in small doses , and mild purgatives , particularly rhubarb . Large injections containing carbolic acid , vinegar , quassia , aloes , or turpentine may // be employed . In children the use of cold injections of strong salt and water is usually efficacious . They should be repeated for at least ten days . In giving the injection care should be taken to have the hips well elevated , so that the fluid can be retained as long as possible . For the intense itching and irritation at night , vaseline may be freely used , or belladonna ointment . The ' cat ' ascaris and the ' dog ' ascaris are occasional parasites in man . My treatment consists of correcting any gastric or bowel derangements there may be by a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascariasis or pin-worms I have found to be invariably large consumers of the decidedly starchy foods , especially bread and other forms of cereals . An excellent general prescription for ridding the intestines of these worms is to limit the supply of these foods and in extreme cases proscribe all foods made from cereals , as well as potatoes , the dry beans and peas . These patients should have fruit for their breakfast and lunch . Their dinners should consist of some kind of fresh meat and any of the cooked vegetables except those that are above proscribed . They should also have plenty of salad , which can be made by combining lettuce , tomatoes and cucumbers , or celery can be substituted for the cucumbers . Dress with salt , olive oil and lemon juice . The local use of salt water to relieve the itching can be indulged in as often as necessary to give relief . As soon as the stomach and bowels have been relieved of their oversupply of food , especially the starchy foods , the secretions will regain their normal strength , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the only reason that all human animals are not troubled with intestinal parasites . In a nutshell , when we are normal our digestive secretions are able to digest the ova of all the parasites that man is liable to take into his alimentary canal ; hence , the prescription first , last and all the time is to learn how to have health . CHAPTER IX . RHEUMATISM . RHEUMATIC FEVER. ? The leading medical works define rheumatism as a non-contagious , acute fever , caused by an unknown infective agent . One or many joints may be involved and the inflammation is accompanied by heat , redness , and swelling . Etiology. ? It is a disease that is known all over the world ; it prevails in temperate and humid climates . I have never been able to find any satisfactory cause for this disease given in any of the medical works , and the reason that an exact cause has not been discovered is because it depends for its evolution on a constitutional derangement , a predisposition and one or more exciting causes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stomach and bowels , and this can be induced by anything that will interfere with the nutritive , or metabolic poise . It has been pretty generally believed that meat , more than all the commonly used foods , is the cause of rheumatism . This , however , I have proved to my own satisfaction is not true . It is no uncommon thing to see vegetarians suffering from rheumatism . It is possible for meat to cause rheumatism by creating a septic state of the blood , but the torch of fermentation is usually lit by 1 50 RHEUMATISM . starch . It is true that an excessive intake of proteids will build such a vulnerable state of the body that the slightest shock or overstimulation may precipitate an outbreak of rheumatism . Subacute septic poisoning may develop into a form of rheumatism . Septic inflammations following childbirth , miscarriage or anything that will cause inflammation of the pelvic organs may be followed by symptoms of rheumatism . Where pus is formed in any part of the body , septic or pyemic inflammation is liable to be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some subjects , symptoms of rheumatism . I have known of such cases being carried off within a week after the rheumatic symptoms developed . Frequently such cases terminate fatally , and so hurriedly and with so little warning that the cause is not . discovered . Inflammatory Rheumatism , or Rheumatic Fever , develops very rapidly ; the temperature frequently runs to 105 ? F. , and even to 106 ? F. , with severe involvement of the parts . The inflammation may be confined to one or two joints , or it may affect one joint for twelve hours and then go to another , and drift back and forth , changing its location every day . Severe attacks of this type of the disease are very dangerous , for they frequently involve the heart , and it is no uncommon thing for apparently very robust people to be carried off within one or two weeks from heart involvement . A great many people are recognized as possessed of good health who are on the verge of an outbreak of this disease all the time . They are troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore joints which last for a few days and then pass away . // The recognized medical opinion is that the disease is of septic or germ origin . As I have stated above , a type can be produced by septicemia and pyemia , but the common cause is fermentation in the stomach and bowels . Those who have a predisposition to take on rheumatism will be found to suffer from decomposition in the lower bowels as a habit . Septic absorption following food decomposition , far from presenting itself on all occasions as rheumatism , is at the bottom of diabetes , Bright 's disease , colitis , appendicitis , in fact all forms of disease that can be produced by septic infection . The real or basic cause of all types of rheumatic disease comes from overeating or improper eating . Rheumatic subjects take into their alimentary canals from four to ten times as much food as they can possibly take care of . As I have hinted many , many times in my writings , there is really but one constitutional derangement , and it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over this ground more or less in writing about the cause of catarrh , consumption , and the contagious diseases of children . ( See Vol . I , Criticisms of the Practice of Medicine . ) The truth of the matter is , we can not get away from the one basic lesion , which is autotoxemia ; and the reason all people do not have the same disease is because of the difference in their geographical location , home environments , mode of living , individual habits and temperaments . Those who have acute articular rheumatism are predisposed to it ; they carry high arterial pressure ; they usually incline to the sanguine lymphatic temperament and , as a class , would have excellent health if it were not for their excessive eating habits . 1 52 RHEUMATISM . Symptoms. ? The disease is inclined to set in suddenly , but may be preceded by joint pains or a day or two of feeling uncomfortable ; possibly it may be preceded by sore throat . Those familiar with my writings should remember that tonsillitis is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time in acute attacks of articular rheumatism . Children that are troubled with tonsillitis should be treated for the constitutional derangement on which this symptom depends ; if they are not , rheumatism , heart disease , kidney disease or some other disease must evolve . It is the height of nonsense to remove tonsils with the idea of getting rid of the disease , for enlarged tonsils can not be anything but a symptom or a constitutional derangement . Removing the tonsils only deprives the real disease of an opportunity to manifest as tonsillitis . Often for the first day or two after an attack of rheumatism , there is but one joint affected , then again within twenty-four hours the disease may be fully developed with several joints involved . No disease is more painful . If the fermentation that brought on the attack is simple , such as is developed from an oversupply of starchy foods , the tongue will be broad and pallid with the prints of the teeth on the outer edge of it . If there is septic poisoning , the tongue may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and normal in size . A marked feature of the tongue in all cases of starch poisoning is that it is too thick and has the appearance of being too large , and it is always pallid and often pasty . Where there is a septic state of the blood , there has been an oversupply of meat to which the starch fermentation has extended , causing the animal food to take on decomposition . This change in the meat produces a septic state of the blood , and if it has been // going on for some time , the tongue will be red ; when the nerve center is involved it will be long and pointed . It is impossible for septic absorption to take place for any length of time without having a very serious effect upon the cerebro-spinal center . In those cases where pyemia or septicemia acts as the exciting cause of rheumatism , there is an absence of the acute symptoms found in the simpler forms of rheumatic fever . In rheumatism from pus absorption there may not be a very great elevation of temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is liable to be a decided heart involvement ; any state that can be brought on from thrombosis may develop ; there will be a physical prostration out of keeping with the general symptoms . This irregularity should be looked upon as diagnostic and cause the physician to search diligently for the source of the pus absorption and establish thorough drainage , for life depends upon successfully removing the cause . What can drugs do ? It is criminal ignorance to medicate such a disease . In rheumatic fever the saliva and secretions generally are decidedly acid ; the urine is heavy and of a dark color ; the perspiration has a strong acid odor , often permeating an entire house of several rooms . The odor once experienced will not be forgotten , for it is pungent and nauseatingly disagreeable . Subacute Rheumatism. ? This is the same as rheumatic fever except it is of a very mild form . Complications. ? The most formidable complication in rheumatic fever is the heart involvement , but I am not disposed to believe that the fever has as much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years ago when I gave drugs with the superstitious idea of curing this disease , I succeeded in estab154 RHEUMATISM . lishing a heart involvement in nearly every case . Since I gave up the use of drugs I have seen but little rheumatic heart disease of a serious character , except when consulted by those who have been medicated and improperly nursed . Rheumatic Endocarditis. ? This is quite a common chronic affection , and as stated above , it is frequently the sequel of badly treated cases of rheumatic fever . It depends upon the same constitutional derangement that builds tonsillitis and chronic enlargement of the tonsils , and , like these affections , its subjects may never have been prostrated with the fever . There must be that constitutional derangement , however , causing indispositions of various kinds , which have been medicated more or less ; hence , it is hard to say how much of the heart trouble is due to treatment and how much to the blood intoxications . It is safe to declare that in any case of endocarditis there must be the constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever ; hence , the treatment and general management of such cases must be the same as for the eradication of the constitutional derangement on which rheumatism depends . The pericardium , as well as the heart , may become involved , and when it is we have rheumatic pericarditis . The lungs may become involved and then we may have symptoms ranging from a slight general discomfort to a fully developed case of bronchitis or pneumonia . This may sound heterodoxical if we forget the unity of all things . The nervous complications , as I have suggested before , are to be found in those types of rheumatic fever dominated by a septic complication . // Rheumatic Skin Diseases. ? There are different kinds of skin affections that may be looked upon as symptoms of rheumatism . Purpura is a very common symptom . Occasionally the physician will see cases of this kind in which the blood-red spots in the skin are so thick ? close together ? that it is impossible to put half a dollar on the surface of either lower limb without covering some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional derangement . I desire that my readers shall know the recognized best treatment know to the " regular " school ; hence , I quote from Osier , for , as I have said before , he is recognized as the leading authority on the practice of medicine of the English speaking people . TREATMENT. - The bed should have a smooth , soft , yet elastic mattress . The patient should wear a flannel night-gown , which may be opened all the way down the front and slit along the outer margin of the sleeves . Three or four of these should be made , so as to facilitate the frequent changes required after the sweats . He may wear also a light flannel cape about the shoulders . He should sleep in blankets , not in sheets , so as to reduce the liability to catch cold and obviate the unpleasant clamminess consequent upon heavy sweating . Chambers insisted that the liability to endocarditis and pericarditis was much reduced when the patients were in blankets . Everything should be done to make the patient comfortable . The bed should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but there should not be any flannel or wool touching the body . Cotton or linen and absorbent cotton may be used to envelop the joints and cover the tender points . The body and bed must be clean and the atmosphere pure . I do not believe that blankets prevent the patient from catching cold , but I do believe that bundling with woolen as recommended by the text-books will cause discomfort and prolong the disease . // That blankets will prevent heart complications is an illogical belief . Wool always invites a wet skin by overheating and holding the moisture , besides excluding the air . Milk is the most suitable diet . It may be diluted with alkaline mineral waters . Lemonade and oatmeal or barley water should be freely given . The thirst is usually great and may be fully satisfied . There is no objection to broths and soups if the milk is not well borne . The food should be given at short and stated intervals . As convalescence is established a fuller diet may be allowed , but meat should be used sparingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know of a dietary prescription that would be more likely to build the disease than " lemonade and oatmeal or barley water . " Such a suggestion is positively without the excuse of a reason . It is a guess-work that fits a world of haphazard . Of all diseases , none is more likely to be built by mixing acid and starch than rheumatism . The local treatment is of the greatest importance . It often suffices to wrap the affected joints in cotton . If the pain is severe , hot cloths may be applied , saturated with Fuller 's lotion ( carbonate of soda , 6 drachms ; laudanum , 1 oz. ; glycerine , 2 oz. ; and water , 9 oz . ) . Tincture of aconite or chloral may be employed in an alkaline solution . Chloroform liniment is also a good application . Fixation of the joints is of great service in allaying the pain . I have seen , in a German hospital , the joints enclosed in plaster of Paris , apparently with great relief . Splints , padded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve pain . Friction is rarely well borne in an acutely inflamed joint . Cold compresses are much used in Germany . The application of blisters above and below the joint often relieves the pain . This method , which was used so much a few years ago , is not to be compared with the light application of the Paquelin thermo-cautery . Warmth , either by artificial heat or wrapping with cotton , will bring a certain amount of relief . No special harm can come from the application of drugs externally , unless the anodine lotions with the rubbing cause the disease to change its location . In the // treatment of severe cases of inflammatory rheumatism , according to the orthodox system , I have thought that local applications and rubbing invited a change of location of the local manifestation , and where this was continued there was a strong possibility of its going to the heart . Years ago when I was in the medicating business , I met with several tragic endings which impressed me as having been brought about by this style of treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local applications and rubbing , and trusted to warmth and quiet , and my experience has been that there is not nearly so much tendency for the disease to change from one part to another when treated in the latter fashion . Twenty-five to thirty-five years ago I used aconite and chloral lotions , chloroform liniment , etc. , but I take pleasure in saying that such treatment is absolutely unnecessary . Cures can be brought about in a very much shorter time with the conventional treatment eliminated . That style of treatment has a tendency to cause the disease to evolve in its very worst form , and I do not wonder that physicians unwittingly intensify the disease by trying all sorts of palliations . An exceedingly painful joint intensified by the usual nursing and treatment can be given some relief by fixation . The truth of the matter is , the uncertainty of " regular " treatment forces its advocates into all sorts of schemes for palliation . I should call the dressing of a rheumatic joint with plaster of Paris the acme of scientific nonsense and a surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above quoted paragraph that caps the climax of medical stupidity and links the authors of such 1 58 RHEUMATISM . treatment to barbarism . I refer especially to cauterizing with the thermo-cautery . The drug treatment of acute rheumatism is still far from satisfactory , though the introduction of the salicyl compounds has been a great boon , Pribram 's exhaustive consideration of the question , extending over some 67 pages ( Northnagel 's Handbuch , Bd. v. ) , in which he discusses some 75 drugs and measures , indicates perhaps better than anything else that the therapeutics of the disease are still far from satisfactory . It is some relief to have this great authority declare that the drug treatment of acute rheumatism is far from satisfactory . That same remark can be applied to all drug treatment as applied to all diseases . Strange that good , first-class physicians ca n't see it ! After this acknowledgment Dr. Osier proceeds to give the accepted treatment . I do not care to comment any further , for I think his recommendations are quite capable of suggesting their own criticisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of treatment that is " far from satisfactory " and continue to recommend it and teach it year after year , is beyond my understanding . If the teachers and men of experience are compelled to say that the treatment is unsatisfactory , what may the people expect when this same treatment is applied by novices sent out from our medical institutions ? Is it any wonder that the mortality in all lines of disease is inexcusably high ? I will say before I go any further in regard to the drugs recommended , that there are no other drugs that so disturb digestion as the salicyl compounds . Strange to say , they are recognized by the profession as the sheet-anchor in the treatment of rheumatism , as much so as mercury is for syphilis . Treatment With the Sulky ! Compounds ? Salicin , introduced in 1876 by Maclagan , may be used in doses of 20 grains every hour or two until the pain is relieved . It has the advantage of being less depressing than the salicylate // of soda . It is also perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 to 20 grains , may be given every two hours in acute cases until the pain is relieved . It is best given in capsules . Salicylate of soda , 20-grain doses every two hours , is perhaps the best of the drugs for general use in the acute rheumatism of adults . After the pain has been relieved , the drug should be given every four or five hours until the temperature begins to fall . The potassium bicarbonate may be given with it . Oil of wintergreen , 20 minims every two hours in milk , may be used if the salicylate of soda disagrees . There are many other salicyl compounds introduced of late , but the best results are obtained from the use of one or other of the above-named preparations . There can be no question as to their efficacy in relieving the pain in the disease . A majority of observers agree that they also protect the heart , shorten the course , and render relapse less likely . The All-aline Treatment ? Potassium bicarbonate may be given in halfdrachm doses every three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to give a drachm and a half of the sodium bicarbonate with half a drachm of potassium acetate in three ounces of water , rendered effervescent at the time of administration by half a drachm of citric acid or an ounce of lemon-juice . When the urine is alkaline the amount may be reduced . The heart should be watched carefully during the administration of full doses of the alkalies . A wide-spread popular belief attributes marvellous efficacy to bee-stings in all sorts of rheumatism , and a formic-acid treatment has been introduced . A 2 ? per cent solution is injected in the neighborhood of the painful joints . Ainley Walker has collected ( B. M. J. , October 10 , 1908 ) , an interesting literature on the subject . To allay the pain opium may be given in the form of Dover 's powder , or morphia hypodermically . Antipyrin , antifebrin , and phenacetin are useful sometimes for the purpose . During convalescence iron is indicated in full doses , and quinine is a useful tonic . Of the complications , hyperpyrexia should be treated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of endocarditis and pericarditis and the pulmonary complications will be considered under their respective sections . To prevent and arrest endocarditis Canton urges the use of a series of small blisters along the course of the third , fourth , fifth , and sixth intercostal // nerves of the left side , applied one at a time and repeated at different points . Potassium or sodium iodide is given in addition to the salicylates . The patients are kept in bed for about six weeks . I have more faith in the alkaline treatment than in any other drug treatment , and it is less liable to injure the system . When soda is given with salicylic acid the former removes much of the irritating effect the latter has on the stomach . The bee-sting cure has been used more or less for quite a number of years . This is another link in the chain that leads back to barbarism . ( See bee-sting article . ) There is no excuse at all for opium , morphine and such remedies as antipyrin , antifebrin , and phenacetin , for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , and it should be considered criminal to use them . The " regular " profession is helpless , for it does n't know what to do with its cases of hyperpyrexia . It is unable to understand that in the majority of cases this excessive temperature is brought on by its maltreatment . The recommendation of blisters to control endocarditis is in keeping with the rest of this barbarism . How should a case of inflammatory rheumatism be treated ? Have the patient on as comfortable a bed as possible . The air in the room must be as pure as it can be made by having the windows wide open . Artificial heat must be placed about the feet and extremities . An extra covering may be put over the feet and legs , but the body must be covered as lightly as possible ? the less covering on the body the better . No drugs , no food , absolutely nothing is to go into the mouth except water . The patient may indulge in water , either hot or cold , as often as desired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in sheets of cotton or linen ; absorbent cotton should be placed under the heels and to brace the knees and keep the covering from bearing too heavily on inflamed parts . Absolute quiet must be maintained from the beginning to the end of the sickness ; no company at all . When it is possible for the patient to be put in a hot bath he should be kept in it until all pain has subsided and then he is to be returned to the bath as often as distress makes it necessary . Copious enemas should be used to move the bowels when the patient is not too lame and distressed to be moved . When it is possible the bowels should be washed out from the very first day , and every day . Nothing but water is to be taken until all fever and pain have subsided , and then the feeding can begin . If the tongue is normal in appearance or inclined to be red , the first food to be taken should be fruit ; oranges , California grapes or an apple that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eaten except the Concord . Nothing but fruit should be given for two or three days . If there is any tendency for the soreness to return , the eating must be suspended until comfort is restored , and then the fruit can be given again . After fruit has been given for three days without any return of the symptoms , then the fourth day the breakfast should be fruit ; lunch , a dish of broth , with celery ; the evening meal , glass of buttermilk . If the patient is doing nicely the fruit may be continued for breakfast , the broth may be exchanged for mutton , lamb , chicken , turkey , fish or eggs ( the dark meat of the chicken and turkey ) , and a salad consisting of lettuce , tomatoes , and celery , dressed with salt , olive oil and lemon 1 62 RHEUMATISM . juice . The amount of buttermilk can be doubled for the evening meal . This regimen should be continued for the first week . After that the breakfast should consist of toast and butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fruit . In the evening a dinner of meat , cooked vegetables , such as turnips , carrots , cauliflower , cabbage , beets , onions , spinach , summer squash , parsnips , and a salad . Such cases should be brought to a very satisfactory termination in a very reasonable time , and the convalescence should be free from any discomfort . There should be a gradual increase in strength every day . Cases treated in this way will not have heart complications , and if they are fed properly after they are restored to health they will never have another attack , but when they are treated according to the plan suggested by Dr. Oster , and almost every other authority in the " regular " school , deaths will be frequent , chronic rheumatism common , and heart diseases galore . Arthritis Derorrnans ? Osler says that this is " a chronic disease of the joints of doubtful etiology , characterized by changes in the synovial membranes and per-articular structures , and in some cases by atrophic and hyper-trophic changes in the bones . " Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence the names rheumatic gout and rheumatoid arthritis ) , this close relationship seems now very doubtful , since in the majority of the cases no history of either affection can be determined . By the studies of the Boston orthopedic surgeons ( Bradford , Goldthwaite , and Lovett ) and of Strangeways and his pupils at Cambridge ( England ) we are gradually getting a very accurate knowledge of the anatomical and clinical forms of this common disease . Etiology ? Age ? A majority of the cases are between the ages of thirty and fifty . In A. E. Garrod 's analysis of 500 cases there were only 25 under twenty years of age . In my series of 170 cases studied by T. McCrae , in one-half the onset was before the age of thirty years . Sex ? Among Garrod 's 500 cases there were 411 women . More than half in my series were in males . In James Stewart ' s report of 40 cases from // the Royal Victoria Hospital only 20 were in females . In women its close association with the menopause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , in those who have had ovarian or uterine trouble or who are sterile . Predisposition ? In 216 cases in Garrod 's series there was a family history of joint troubles . About one-third of my series gave a family history of arthritis . Two or three children in a family may be affected . In America the incidence in the negro is much less than in the white . Rheumatism and Gout ? In nearly a third of Garrod 's cases there was a history of gout in the family ; of rheumatism in only 64 cases . Exposure to cold , wet and damp , errors in diet , worry and care , and local injuries are all spoken of as possible exciting causes . At present two chief views prevail as to the etiology of arthritis deformans ? one that it is of nervous origin , the other that it is a chronic infection . Relation of Arthritis Deformans to Diseases of the Nervous System ? Various forms of arthritis may occur with lesions of the spinal cord , and it has been held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous system are the cause of the joint lesions . This does not seem to be supported by recent work , which rather supports the view that the disease is the result of a chronic infection . The rapid muscular atrophy , the associated neuritis , the pain , the increase in the reflexes , and the nutritional disturbances suggest a change in the nervous system , but this may be secondary to an infective or toxic process . Arthritis Deformans as a Chronic Infection ? In recent years this view has been gaining ground , although as yet positive bacteriological evidence is lacking . The infection may be with a specific organism or perhaps with various ones . Bannatyne , Poynton and Payne , Chauffard , and others have obtained organisms from the joints , and suggestive results have followed the injection of the cultures in animals . But no constant association with any organism has been proved . The influence of various infections such as gonorrhoea , influenza , etc. , is important . Some writers have reported a large proportion of cases with a previous history of gonorrhoea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my series . The acute onset with fever , the polyarthritis , the presence of enlarged glands , and the frequent enlargement of the spleen are all suggestive of an infection . In a small number cardiac complications occur . The attack may subside , leaving more or less damage , to recur later with the same features . UNION S HOME // And , lastly , a consideration of the form in children described by Still lends weight to this view , particularly in the wide-spread enlargement of the lymph-glands and the swelling of the spleen . A number of the very best students of the disease , as Baumler , of Freiburg , have accepted the infective theory of origin , which is gaining adherents , though it still lacks demonstration . This form of rheumatism can be said to fossilize the body . In rare instances , it has been known to destroy every joint , rendering its victim as helpless , so far as voluntary motion was concerned , as a stone . It is rightly named , for it is a disease the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh is heir to . Many are left in such a state that death is preferable . The reader can see from my quotation from Osier , that the real cause is very obscure . The reason for this is that , like most other diseases , its causation is multiple . Scientific medicine discovers to all reasoning minds its illogicalness when it persists in endeavoring to discover and show cause to be unitary or a fixed entity . It is just as reasonable to say that warmth , moisture , or earth , causes the grass to grow as to say that infection or a specific nerve derangement causes arthritis deformans . Regular medicine is inclined to settle down and rest its case on the belief that every disease that flesh is heir to is caused by a specific infection . All investigators on the subject of cause ? etiology  --  are more or less blinded in coming to their conclusions , because there is a tacit if not an outspoken belief that a specific germ is necessary to individualize disease . When the profession becomes able to philosophize ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particulars and know their value and relationship to the whole , there will not be quite so much impossible and childish speculation sent out with ex-cathedra unction. // If we can accept the fact that this disease may be evolved by adding one or more of a multiplicity of exciting causes to an existing autotoxemia , we will then be in a position to analyze each and every case on its merits and come to a rational conclusion ? one that will point to the only possible cure . According to my experience , those who are predisposed to this disease are of an emotional nature and inclined to high arterial pressure and to digestive disturbances . They are large cereal and bread consumers , and when lacking in ambition and moral perception , they are liable to develop a destroying sensuality . Their starch eating deranges the stomach and liver ; their lungs and liver are not able to decarbonize the amount of food eaten . The bile and other secretions which have a diastatic ( sugar making ) action on the starches , are gradually weakened , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to digest the decidedly starchy foods . If these unfortunate people could be given one-third to onehalf more breathing power , they would be greatly benefited . By increasing their oxidizing power , they would be relieved and the stress laid on their emotional natures and their minds would cease to be exploited by the whims and caprice which are often the peculiar influence our social and domestic life has on incoordinate minds . This brings us to the real predisposition for taking on this disease ; namely , a moody , jealous , melancholy , pessimistic turn of mind . These subjects always have a faulty liver function ; the type is almost classic . This temperament belongs more to women than to men . Women are more confined to the house , hence less in the open air , and their lives have less of variety , hope , ambition // and realization ; then add the irritations perculiar to the wife and mother and we have enough , with faulty eating and environment , to bankrupt the nervous system . I have now , without intention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay hold of a pronounced symptom , in a medley of symptoms , or causes and effects , may , with plausible excuse , declare to be the cause of rheumatic arthritis . When the constitutional state is favorable for the taking on of this disease , everything that will shock the nervous system is liable to precipitate an attack . Trouble , business worries , disappointments , disillusionments , unrequited love , ungratified passion , sensuality , chronic fear , the sudden removal by death of a near and dear friend , chronic jealousy , a cultivated envy , or any other influence that will decidedly pervert the emotional nature , may give this disease a start . From a dietary standpoint , these subjects are invariably imprudent eaters of the cereal foods , and as faulty elimination grows more pronounced , there is retained in the system enough of the mineral elements to ossify the body . Arteriosclerosis may be recognized as congeneric to arthritis deformans . In the arterial type of ossification , the kidneys fail to drain the mineral elements , and they are retained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the coats of the arteries , while in the arthritic disease what would be inflammatory rheumatism is converted into arthritis deformans , because the joint inflammation , accompanied by the usual influx of blood to the parts , favors the deposit of enough of the mineral elements to obstruct , disorganize and destroy the joint involved . In the arterial disease it is possible to find a history of long supCHILDREN // pressed emotion . I think I would not be very far from the truth if I should say that , under given influences , women will develop arthritis deformans and men will develop arteriosclerosis , because the latter are compelled to keep their troubles to themselves . So far as age is concerned , this is a disease that would not be likely to affect childhood , for children have not arrived at the age of taking on responsibility . Youth is usually the opposite . If a child shows an inclination for the development of this physical state , it would point to a possible reign of fear and unhappy home life . Childhood and its pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character under consideration . After children have settled into manhood and womanhood and taken upon themselves the responsibilities of life , then they may develop very rapidly in this line . I have seen a few people in the twenties who were ruined , so far as their deformities from this disease were concerned , for life . It is a disease that may be expected to develop between twenty and forty-five years of age , for those are the years when the greatest amount of responsibility is assumed , and they are too early for the ameliorating and correcting influence of philosophy ; wisdom comes after experience ; however , sensuality is liable to bring it on at any age . CHAPTER X. DISEASES OF THE STOMACH . ACUTE CATARRHAL GASTRITIS , commonly called Gastritis or Gastric Fever . Causes. ? It is usually brought on from abuse of the stomach by overeating , eating im- proper foods , the drinking of alcohol , tea , coffee and iced drinks , and the use of tobacco and drugs . Those of a nervous temperament are especially disposed to deranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional excitement of either a stimulating or depressing nature inhibit the functions of digestion . Symptoms. ? The symptoms range all the way from a slight discomfort after eating to attacks marked by chills , fever , exces-sive vomiting , headaches , delirium and occasionally diarrhea . Gastritis is the most common disease of childhood . Why not , when it is impossible to find order , or anything but haphazard reigning supreme in most homes ? Children are permitted to eat anything and everything they want and all they want at any time . It is no uncommon thing for mothers to say to me : " I can-not get my child to eat as you direct , and if I do not give it what it wants , it will steal it . " I presume mothers who bring up their children in this way will find fault with the laws of our country for punishing them after they are grown up ? for possibly putting // them in the penitentiary for crimes that they never would have committed if they had been taught self-control in childhood . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they murder their children by forcing them into all sorts of so-called contagious and infectious diseases by encouraging them to eat when they should not , and failing to teach them self-control . Who are the tuberculosis subjects ? Those who have been overindulged , pampered and who have had no self-discipline . Who are the sick people found all over the country ? Those with no self-discipline . It is necessary to start the education in selfcontrol in childhood ? at the breast ? yes , during the gestation period . When children eat three times a day , and are permitted to eat between meals , their systems will take a physiological rest two or three times a year ; the rest comes in the shape of a breakdown ? gastritis , perhaps . If their haphazard lives affect their stomachs most , the type of the disease will surely be gastritis ? or what is sometimes called catarrh or inflammation of the stomach . If , however , they are sent to school where they can not get the proper amount of fresh air , and their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the type of the disease may be pneumonia . If there is much intestinal decomposition and septic infection , plus sewer gas from imperfect plumbing , or an atmospheric state that favors the development of zymotic diseases , then diphtheria , scarlet fever , typhoid and other diseases of this character may be looked for . It can be said that domestic environments , by way of improper discipline and lack of cleanliness , produce states of the mind and body that represent a first cause and on this can be grafted any disease , the type of which , will be contingent on unusual or accidental environmental states as // well as the varying atmospheric states . For example , broken and neglected plumbing , decomposing animal and vegetable matter and unusual weather conditions . Adults are subject to stomach derangements of a catarrhal character which range all the way from a slight chronic irritation to an inflammation that ends in ulceration or cancer . Alcoholic Gastritis is frequently very distressing in the morning . The victim vomits his first two or three drinks of whiskey before enough can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membrane . After a glass of this poison can be kept down for a few moments , the inebriate can then indulge every hour until ten or eleven o'clock at night without any apparent inconvenience except drunkenness . If the poison is withdrawn for a few days or a week , in those who have advanced to this stage of the disease , delirium tremens is liable to appear . Tea Gastritis is known by constipation , a yellow , pallid skin , and a characteristic headache which is often diagnosed migraine . There are not many pronounced stomach symptoms in this disease . A desire for something warm in the stomach , or for a little food may be noticed , but the victim of the poisonous effect of this beverage learns to know that it is tea that is needed , and nothing else will take its place . Tea is one of the most active agents in building gall stones in those who use tea to excess . Neurasthenics are often tea drinkers . Coffee Gastritis. ? This is a common disease but seldom recognized . The symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a gradual wasting of flesh , sluggish liver , constipation and nervousness to the extent of neurasthenia . Those with this disease are much given to the habit of belching . As soon as the stomach is empty the disagreeable feeling begins and will not let // up until food of some kind is taken , but full relief can not be had without taking coffee . The subjects of this disease have the habit of swallowing air for the relief it gives them . They learn to draw or suck air into their stomachs ; they hold it until it is warm and then they expel it by eructating or belching it with a loud explosive noise . To break this habit is difficult , but necessary to a cure of the disease . Coffee drinkers are also heavy bread eaters , and it is hard to say just how much of the sickness is due to bread and how much to coffee ; perhaps it takes both to build all of the symptoms . Tobacco Gastritis is known by a sensitive point just where the ribs come together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This spot is always sensitive to pressure . These subjects are often distressed after a full meal . The heart becomes irregular and palpitates , the throat is sensitive , and in time the nicotine poison brings on great nervousness and emaciation . This stomach disease can not be cured unless the tobacco habit is given up . Acute Catarrhal Gastritis can not always be differentiated from the onset of other diseases . Many of the fevers start with symptoms of gastritis . In spite of our nomenclature to the contrary , it is reasonable to believe that all fevers are gastric or intestinal plus . If the exciting cause happens to be that of ptomaine poisoning , vomiting relieves the stomach , but if the subject is the victim of chronic autotoxemia , the absorbed ptomaine may set up such a constitutional poisoning and hyperpyrexia that the life forces will be snuffed out in a few hours or days , or there may be a low grade of fever set up that will last for weeks . The season of the year , the constitutional peculiarities of the patient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting cause and the environment , all together determine the type of the disease . Toxic Gastritis is caused by swallowing corrosive poisons , accidentally or with suicidal intent . Symptoms. ? Intense pain , burning and vomiting . If the victim recovers , there may be constriction of the throat , esophagus or the stomach . Chronic Gastritis. ? I named the symptoms of the nervous type of this disease when describing the gastritis produced by tea , coffee and tobacco . There is a form in which the patient eructates and spits out a mouthful at a time , until the meal is all spit out ; and another where the food is vomited . The subjects of these diseases are hungry most of the time , and the more they eat the thinner they get . Ulcerative Gastritis. ? In this disease , there is pain three or four hours after eating , and not infrequently the patient vomits . Severe hemorrhage ( hematemesis ) sometimes occurs in a few who suffer from this disease without any very pronounced symptoms preceding . Symptomatic Gastritis. ? The text-books recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lung or liver disease . These symptoms , however , may depend upon one and the same constitutional derangement . Cancer and Stricture of the Pylorus no doubt are the finale of neglected acute gastric catarrh . Symptoms. ? Pain and vomiting . The vomiting may come on every six or twelve hours ; often thirty-six or more hours intervene between the vomitings . It is remarkable what toleration is // deed , I have seen a few unfortunate victims of partial obstruction of the pylorus whose stomachs appeared to have no resentment left ; they would tolerate a half gallon of material that would do credit to the worst slop or the contents of a scavenger 's cart . Treatment. ? Surgery will relieve all but the cancer type ; nothing else will . Washing the stomach will palliate and bring comfort for a time , but the obstruction is the organized cause and there is no real relief except through surgery . General Treatment for All Stomach Diseases. ? The readers of my former writings should know that the key-note of all treatment is to remove the cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overeating , eating improper combinations , or drinking while eating , eating soups that are too hot , the excessive use of tea , coffee , alcoholics , iced drinks , gum chewing , using tobacco , etc. , of course , these habits must be corrected . When the cause is of a mental character due to excess , defect or perversion of the emotions , of course the mind must be righted . Treatment of Acute Gastritis. ? In old or young , stop all food , and so long as there is any nausea or vomiting , no water is to be given by the stomach ; no , not even a little bit to wet the mouth . No human being I have ever met can be trusted to spit out all the water he takes in his mouth " just to wet it , " and those I have n't met are no more trustworthy . Under extreme circumstances , where the irritation is great and the nausea and thirst intense , it is as impossible for the patient to resist swallowing water , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for a sane man to refuse to save his life when death threatens . I have learned by years of experience that there is but one treatment for this disease and that is , abstinence from everything , // and while there is any nausea , positively no water by the mouth . The thirst is to be relieved by warm water enemas . For children use two to four ounces ; for adults four to eight ounces , every six hours or as often as necessary to relieve thirst . The bowels are to be washed out by enemas every day ; twice a day at first , until the offending food is washed away . Adults should have their stomachs washed out the first day of sickness , or as soon as a physician is called . To free the stomach and bowels of the offending decomposed food and then keep everything out of them , as suggested above , is the shortest possible route out of the difficulty . Drugs will add to the disease by inhibiting the return of normal functioning and this is liable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied to the extremities day and night , not in a perfunctory manner , but with a zeal in keeping with the knowledge that if my recommendations are carried out exactly , the patient will be spared unnecessary suffering and restored to health ? not semi-invalidism . Heat , either dry or moist , should be kept on the abdomen . When the temperature runs to 103 ? F. , or over , a towel wet in cold water should be bound loosely on the abdomen and renewed every three hours until the fever drops below 103 ? F. , then the change need not be made oftener than every six hours and hot water may be used in place of cold . The patient 's feelings can safely be consulted in the matter ? either cold or hot ? whichever feels more comfortable . As in all diseases the patient must be kept as quiet as possible . Positively no company and no unnecessary talking are to be allowed , even with members of the family . The air in the room must be as good as the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the patient by relieving him of anxiety and fear . When all signs of disease have passed , a little fruit juice can be given for the first day ? the juice of an orange or freshly made grape juice . The second day , if there have been no signs of the fruit disagreeing , baked apple can be given for breakfast , a half glass of buttermilk for lunch and the same for supper . If all goes well the third day , fruit for breakfast , broth and salad for noon and buttermilk for supper ; and then if everything is going well , a diet of bread and butter followed with milk for breakfast , fruit for lunch and meat and vegetables for dinner ; these foods properly proportioned to suit the case should be followed by good health . Treatment for Chronic Gastritis. ? To job-lot the treatment for chronic inflammation of the stomach , I might say : Appropriately treat all the diseases of the body and the stomach disorder will be cured and vice versa . This statement will be tabooed as rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of coffee , tea , alcoholics , and tobacco . All worry , envy , spite , jealousy , unrighteous ambitions , dishonesty , or practices that pervert the emotional nature , must be controlled and dignity and poise cultivated . Self-control of mind and body must be developed . Full control of appetites and passions is necessary to health . Positively no food is to be taken into the stomach when the subject is feeling bad , and when comfort is established , whatever food is appropriate must be used , and what is appropriate will depend upon the character or type of the pronounced manifestation . If constipation is the most pronounced symptom , it must be treated by removing the cause . CHAPTER XI . CONSTIPATION . CHRONOLOGICALLY speaking , constipa tion can be used as a term synonymous with ' civilization . It is a disease whose father is the cultivated neglect of one of nature 's chief re quirements for health . Causes. ? The causes for this disease are as numerous as the lines of light scintillating from a center . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessary . They can all be classified under two heads , namely , functional derangement and mechanical obstruction . Under func tional derangement may be classed any and all causes whose in fluences pervert the functions of the organs that are principal as well as collateral to digestion . Stomach derangements lead to constipation and these de rangements are many ; but those particularly which produce con stipation come from dietetic errors such as overeating and the use of tea and coffee . Raw vegetables and fruits and the dairy prod ucts except butter produce constipation ; but inasmuch as these foods do not produce it in all who partake of them , it can not be said that they , per se , are constipating , but in suitable cases they prove auxiliary to other causes . Tea and coffee have astringent properties which are consti pating . A few people declare that coffee acts as a regulator of // their bowels . When it does , the caffein probably inhibits , for a time , a slight irritation of the nerve centers which , when not controlled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as a laxative when it relieves the irritation of a spasmodic constriction ; but it would not be true to say that the drug has laxative properties . Some such action is the only excuse that coffee has for being called a laxative ; those who experience such results from its use may be assured that the benefit they think they derive is the hypocrisy of a false friend , for the coffee in all probability is creating the effect that it is temporarily relieving ? creating the constipation that it is relieving . Alcohol builds delirium tremens , and will relieve and keep the disease under check or keep it from manifesting for a time . The excessive use of bread creates a nervous disease that it relieves , and because of this relief the victim believes that bread is the proper food for him . Excessive eating creates disorders that full meals relieve , and the doctors say that the victims of these conditions should be fed " good , nourishing food " and lots of it . Hot Drinks and Hot Foods in time bring on irritation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a degree that normal peristalsis is lost . These subjects complain greatly when their stomachs are empty ; any food or drink that will distend or separate the walls of the stomach will relieve . This distress is interpreted as hunger , or a need for food , and the habit of eating between meals is formed . This nervous state of the stomach can be brought on from swallowing not only hot foods , but iced foods as well . Overeating and the use of tobacco and alcohol create similar derangements . The subjects of this disorder are prone to food poisoning ? toxemia ? for they eat so often and so much that they are seldom free from decomposing 1 78 CONSTIPATION. foods in their intestines , and this admits of continual toxic absorption . Those who overeat keep their bowels so distended that the normal tone is lost , and when the volume of food is cut down from any cause they are left with an inactive state of the bowels that is not far removed from paralysis . Gas from the decomposition in the bowels aids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowels move at all after the distention has temporarily paralyzed the musculature , it is on the order of the sausage mill . After constipation has been brought on in this way , many contract the cathartic or enema habit , both of which relieve for a time , but ultimately confirm the disease . Extreme cases of this . kind become complicated with proctitis , piles , colitis , varicocele , varicosity of the lower limbs , lymphangitis , hernia , diabetes , Bright 's disease , etc . I might run on naming many more diseases , but I am writing about constipation and its causes , and I should not digress too far . Perhaps it is as well to name to the reader a few of the diseases to which constipation is a country cousin . Cathartics are very liable to cause appendicitis when used in these cases . ( See Monograph on Appendicitis . ) If artificial means are to be used , the enema is the least harmful , but it washes away the mucus ? the natural secretions ? and this , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Starch. ? The decidedly starchy foods when taken in excess of the bodily needs , or beyond the digestive capacity , are a common cause of sluggish bowels . Cereals. ? The cereal foods are eaten to excess these days and one of the common effects is distention of the bowels with gas , which results in a sluggish state of the bowels almost equal to paralysis ? inhibition of the normal mechanical motion of the // bowels . When peristalsis is feeble or suspended , it is difficult to procure satisfactory movements from the bowels even when artificial means are used . Enemas do relieve , but with labor and increasing dissatisfaction . The reason for stubborn constipation among starch eaters is not wholly due to gas distention , but to a very sluggish liver action . Starch , sugar and fats when eaten to excess cause torpor of the liver and acid fermentation of the stomach and gas distention . Those afflicted in this way complain of sour stomach or burning in the stomach . A sluggish liver brought on in this way and continued for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inflammation of the rectum , piles , etc . When there is an inflammation of the rectum , the fecal matter dries out quickly , because the moisture is absorbed , leaving it dry . This , of course , is a source of blood poisoning which brings on neuralgia and rheumatism ; lumbago especially is produced by this form of constipation . Backache is very common in these subjects . When this disease runs on in those subjects of a nervous temperament , there is a gradual loss of flesh . Such patients grow thinner and thinner unless the toxic absorption inhibits the kidney function ; in that case there may be a gradual water-logging of the cellular tissues ? an insidious dropsical infiltration ? which will cause them to look plump and rounded when they , in fact , are often carrying ten to fifteen pounds excess water in their tissues . These cases suffer from oxygen starvation because of a shortage of red blood corpuscles . The toxic poisoning that is going on all the time destroys the red corpuscles and the acid fermentation ruins the incoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim may eat enough , very little can be appro-
