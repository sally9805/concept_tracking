txt Suffragettism has invaded the sacred precincts of Buckingham Palace and has caused a small revolution in the royal household . one of the highly placed members of it resigning owing to the ill , feeling that her attitude 6n the question aroused among her colleagues . Queen Mary originally regarded with favor the granting of the vote to isromen , but the policy of the militant suffrag- ' . es of wrecking property , ' assaults on public men , burning letters in mail boxes , and open defiance of the law has completely alienated her Majesty 's sympathy for the suffragette organization . The Queen , or course , is supposed to have no political sympathies of any sort , and she never at any tim publicly avowed her suffrag ( T ? 2W.5 , even in the earlier , more peaceable days of Ithe movement , and now she is particularly careful , since the question has become prominent in contemporary English politics .

First one lady in a minor post in the royal household resigned . She informed the Queen that the forcible feeding of women was in her opinion an outrage , and said she would like to be free to express her opinion on the subject in public . Soon afterward two other ladies of the household of much greater importance expressed sympathy with the suffragettes at the luncheon table . The ladies and gentlemen of the household , by the way , do not , unless specially invited . lunch with their Majesties , but in a separate apartment known . as the household dining room . The remarks of the two women in question caused a somewhat warm discussion on the merits and demerits of the militant suffragettes , most of which was later repeated to her Majesty .

The Queen was intensely annoyed , with the two ladies in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What precisely took place , there no one but the Queen and the two women knows . but almost directly afterward one of the ladies . Lady Shaftesbury , resigned her position in ' the royal household . The other still remains in her post , hut has not been in residence at Buckingham Palace in the last three weeks . There are now in the royal household several women who are avowed supporters of the militants , and though they must not , so long as they are members of the royal establishment , take part in public in the suffragette movement , they can express their views , within the walls of the , Palace except in the royal presence , and this they do at every opportunity , i with the result that heated arguments are continually taking place in the houseold dining room and the drawing room set apart for the ladies in wait-j big . The majority of the ladies at Court , are anti-suffragettes . The Duchess or Devonshire , the Mistress of the Robes , 1 is a strong opponent of the v.-hole feminist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics of the militants ' methods . Between , these and the supporters of the suffragettes has now arisen an antagonism which has Treatly disturbed the at , imsphere r the Court . Recently an incident occurred at Buckingham Palace which further set her llrajesty and the anti-suffragette , opinion of the Court against the militant women . The incident was carefully kept out of The Court Circular . Tried to Get Audiences . The suffragettes made several attempts to get a personal audience of the King , in order to put their case before his Majesty , but this Was peremptorily refused . Then they tried to get an audience of the Queen , but this attempt also tailed . As a matter of fact , it would be quite impossible for the King or Queen to grant an audience to any woman representing any suffragette body , for under . no circumstances can the King or Queen ever grant an audience to any political organization . But the suffragettes are avowedly no respecters of ancient precedents and established custom . They asked audiences of the King and Queen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the royal car by ringing up Buckingham Palace on the telephone and asking for the King . Now , no one is ever put through direct to the King except members of the royal family , and of this rule the suffragettes were apparently aware , for , being asked by the exchange operator at the palace who was speaking , the suffragette at the other end of the line replied " The Duchess of Fife . " This ingenious idea of getting through to the King failed because there is a private number used only by members of the royal family that must be mentioned by any royalty who wants to speak direct to the King . The suffragette did not know this , and when the palace exchange clerk asked for the number she was unable to give it . After having asked twice for the clerk cut her off and duly reported the matter to the sec- I retarial department . A week or so later , however , the suffragettes rang up the palace again , and this time got through to the King , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private number . King George happened to be in his personal writing room when the call was put through , and accounts differ as to how he received it when he discovered that a suffragette was talking to him . The suffragette 's account of the matter is that directly she informed the King who she really was , all his Majesty said was , " I can not I talk to you , " and then he cut off the call . The story comes from the Palace that the King was furious , summoned an equerry , and said to hint : " Some infernal woman has given away the private royal call number . You must find out who she is . " Another story is that his Majesty , took the whole affair as a jest and simply said , " A new private call number must be substituted for the old . " But there is no doubt at all that I when the incident reached Queenl Mary 's ears she was exceedingly I angry . It was obvious that some one of the household had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that she must find out who had committed this unpardonable breach of confidence . Three ladies-in-waiting of suffragette sympathies were questioned on the subject , but they point blank denied that they had done it . Queen Mary believed them . Then suspicion fell on some of the upper servants , but on the advice of Lady Eva Dugdale the Queen decided not to pursue her inquiries further . Lady Eva does not care a rap for the suffragette question . Therefore she is one of the few ladies of the royal household who can now regard the whole affair from an impersonal and unbiased standpoint , and her opinion was ' That the less fuss made over the matter the better . " Take no notice of such things and they will soon cease to occur , " was her advice to her Majesty . and the Queen for the present is following her lady-in-waiting 's counsel . However , her Majesty has made It fairly clear that if any further disturbance occurs in the royal establishment she will make a complete reorganization of the household , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he no difficulty in filling the places with ladies who would cheerfully undertake : to have no opinions on the suffragette , or , indeed , on any other , question for the sake of becoming members of the royal household .
