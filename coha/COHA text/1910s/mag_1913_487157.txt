Prentice having con fessed error in attributing " A : Name to the Sand " to that journalist . This excellent anthology contains many ' poems by minor Southern writers , from sg . George Tucker to living hands , not conveniently to be found elsewhere . We recall a preacher of a generation ago whose method of sermonizing was to choose one of the abstract virtues , such as faith or humility , and illustrate it by a seriatim application to the Biblical characters , beginning always with Adam . By a somewhat similar method , rather popular among the anthropologists , Lewis Leopold has built up a sizable volume on " Prestige , " to which the publishers ( Dutton ) have given an imposing appearance . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , literary , historical , and anthropological ; which makes some of his pages interesting , though more of them are dull , and the book as'a whole seems pointless . To acquire prestige among your fellows you must be ' just above their comprehension . Prestige need not and a gift of pungent expression To these qualities must be added a singularly retentive memory , or , if not that , a habit of painstaking notation of impressions He has little of the reforming zeal of Wells , still less of the romantic fire of ' Locke The commonplace world , as he knows it , is , as he might say in the quotation marks that he finds so useful , " not half bad " There was a time , after " Clayhanger " made its appearance , when one thought of him as of one who held the promise of greatness , but of late years Mr. Bennett has settled down to a good workaday pace . It would be an exaggeration to say that he " adorns all that he touches , " but at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . His method of arresting attention becomes at times a trifle mechanical , as might be expected of one who must turn out an almost incredible number of words per annum The same tricks of style that appear in the novels appear again in " Your United States , " and they crop up with even greater frequency in " Paris Nights " ( Doran ) , his latest book of " impressions of places and peoples " It exhibits all Mr Bennett 's defects , but it exhibits his virtues as well . It is a bulky volume of attractive make-up and excellent type , containing a series of impressions gained in many parts of Europe ; and most of it is very readable . At least half of the volume is devoted to his own land , and it is unquestionable that he writes best of what he knows best , which is the English middle classes After spending a somewhat uninstructive evening with him at the Paris Variet6s , or listening while he endeavors to convince himself that his native canniness is in peril of being overset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real relief to go with him again to the Potteries which he knows so well , to walk by his side along London 's Embankment , or even to spend a day in his company at that North of England holiday inferno , Blackpool Mr Bennett 's genius is domestic , and not the less admirable on that account , and he is at his best when explaining a mystery like the chronic tepidity of the hot water in the establishment of a " Mr Smith , " where the water , being heated by the kitchen range , is at its hottest at midday on Sunday , when nobody wants it , and at its coldest mornings and evenings , when everybody wants it , or when he is philosophizing on the household trials of " Mrs Smith , " and the problems presented by the case of Matilda , the maid-ofall work " Paris Nights " is illustrated by E. A. Rickards , whose clever and spirited sketches add much to the attractiveness of the volume . It is a pleasure to welcome the series of handsome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boston , is publishing in the Humanist 's Library , edited by Lewis Einstein . The last volume to appear is Albrecht Durer 's " Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries , " issued under the editorship of Roger Fry With the appearance of each number we feel tempted to praise at length the quality of paper , printing , and editing . Such care is not wasted when bestowed upon the large figures of the Renaissance who are the subjects of this rich Library , and is indeed no more than replacing ' them in the settings to which they were accustomed in their day . In some respects the letters from Venice , written in 1506 to Wilibald Pirkheimer are the most interesting part of the book . They have a touch of gayety which is lacking in the later journal Durer enjoys the society of the Venetian painters , at least of some of them . Denim " has praised me highly to many gentlemen . He would willingly have something of mine , and came himself to me and asked me to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for it . . He is very old and yet he is the best painter of all . " But some of the artists he calls " faithless , lying , thievish rascals , " who are so jealous of him that they threaten his life . Durer describes his one lesson in dancing and vows that it shall not be repeated , owing to the expense and his ineptness ; he tells of precious stones and Greek books he has collected for Pirkheimer , and twits him on his loves , in the last instance furnishing a humorous drawing . At the time of his journey to the Netherlands , 1520-1521 , Durer enjoyed an assured reputation and was on friendliest terms with Flemish painters Yet we hear all too little of them on the personal side , rather too much space being given to the state of his finances . On one occasion he paid one stiver for a bath , on another he gave an attentive servant ten stivers as a tip , etc There is one glowing passage based on rumors concerning Luther : On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Antwerp that Martin Luther had been treacherously taken prisoner , for he trusted the Emperor Charles 's herald , who had been granted to him with the Imperial safe conduct . . . Immediately there appeared ten knights , who treacherously carried off the pious man , who had been betrayed ; a man enlightened by the Holy Ghost , a follower of Christ and of the true Christian faith , and whether he lives yet or whether they have put him to death , I know not If he has suffered , it is for the sake of Christian truth and because he has fought with the un-Christlike papacy , which strives with its heavy load of human laws against the redemption of Christ He records a , dinner with Erasmus , but without comment . Altogether , the journal gives the impression of a man somewhat conscious of his fame , yet of one who is been done by Rudolph Tombo IV A Dwiggins furnishes an attractive title-page , and Mr Fry 's introduction gives a comprehensive summary of Durer 's artistic achievements The artist who can write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels as charming as his pictures is a rare per . son At last one of his kind has visited the West Coast of South America , and the result is most satisfactory . A couple of years ago Ernest Peixotto took his sketch-book from Panama to Lima , Mollendo , Cuzco , and La Paz ; then , retracing his steps , went up the Pacific Coast via Acapulco to the Golden Gate . The result is a delightful volume called " Pacific Shores from Panama " ( Scribner ) , reminding one of Hopkinson Smith 's ability to acquire accurate information , put it into pleasant English , and illustrate it with charming sketches Mr Peixotto has gone a step further , and , instead of limiting himself to somewhat disconnected travel essays , has told the whole story of his journey in an intimate manner . He makes no pretence at erudition or ' scholarship There is no index , and the map is redolent of the era of the buccaneers His volume is essentially of the gift-book type , and yet it is more than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as interesting and as trustworthy as in the present case There are remalkably few misstatements . The author has succeeded also in catching that elusive will-o ' - the- wisp " atmosphere " To those who are familiar with the West Coast the volume will be welcome , because it contains so many of those fleeting artistic scenes which the traveller 's camera fails to get . While for those to whom the West Coast is still a terra incognita one could not wish a happier fate than that they should be introduced to the hospitable shores of Peru through the delightfully graphic pages of Mr. Peixotto . " Rambles in Autograph Land " ( Putnam ) , by Adrian H Joline , is , as it were , the literary testament of a disappearing type of enthusiast . Autographs  --  meaning , of course , letters or literary manuscripts ; Mr. Jaime scorned the collecting of mere signatures  --  are on the one hand the trophies of a fascinating kind of hunt , on the other the clues to historic personalities . About half the book is given up to general considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mr Joline 's own autograph collections with many facsimiles Here whim rules supreme The writers were so vivid to Mr. Joline that he patted them on the back , abused them , derided them , lauded them to the skies , as the mood demanded . Sometimes the comment is charmingly mellow , again tiresomely lengthy or crudely testy . Altogether it is a readable jumble , and an interesting memorial of a- sturdy personality , but lightness of touch , the saving grace of such abiblla , is absent . One finds oneself reading along chiefly for tidbits like this from Frederick Locker-Larapson to Miss Collins , a poet 's daughter , with a gift of earrings ? " I am very glad you like the earrings How is it that , your father being a poet , you never have had your ears bored7 " On the occasion of the first general meeting of the session of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies , held in the rooms of the Society of Antiquaries , Burlington House , London , Mr. Ellis H. Minns read an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c. , recently found in Western Media Mr Minns explained that the documents  --  three in number  --  were preserved out of a collection from near Avroman . The first and second were in Greek , but the third , which has not yet been deciphered , was probably in Pehlevi . The fact that the first two were written in Greek was interesting , because non-Egyptian was rare . It went to prove , what had been suspected by archmologists for some time past , namely , the existence of a strong element of Hellenism in the most eastern portion of the Seleucid empire With regard to the contents of the documents , they were both conveyances of a vineyard called Dadbakabag . Each is , according to an ancient custom , in duplicate , the " close " version being tied up and sealed by the witnesses to prevent any tampering with it , the " patent " less an important social force ; but " persons of value " should not make prestige an end in itself . It should seem that so lame a conclusion might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-constructed sentences of a kind to suggest that the writer , though a , inan of culture , is not quite at home in the English language Rabindranath Tagore , now of Nobel prize fame , is , if the vulgar image may be permitted . making hay while the sun shines . In the Nation of November 20 his love poems , " The Gardener , " were noticed , and now we have two further volumes from him One of these , " The Crescent Moon " ( Macmillan ) , is a book of " child-poems " prettily rendered into English from the original Bengali by the author himself . This volume has eight illustrations in color . The other new book by Mr. Tagore is of a different character altogether . It is called " Sadhann " ( Macmillan ) , and is a study of the ancient Hindu philosophy of the Upanishads for modern use . We must say frankly that we do not take more pleasure in this adaptation than in most of the others of the same kind , whether they be produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have a passion for reconciling Jesus and Krishna , or by enthusiasts of the Occident who have gone astray in the mazes of the Vedanta . A fair specimen of Mr. Tagore 's philosophy may be found on page 28 To understand anything is to find in it something which is our own , and it is the discovery of ourselves outside us which makes us glad This relation of understanding is partial , but the relation of love is complete In love the sense of difference is obliterated and the human soul fulfils its purpose in perfection , transcending the limits of itself and reaching across the threshold of the infinite . Which is pretty enough gush , though wofully trite It may even have a parallel in some Sanskrit passage of the Upanishads or Brfihmanas , for anything may be found in those books , but it is about as far from their real spirit as the sunset is from the sunrise . We have here merely another illustration of the modern , rather flabby mysticism which is crusading over the world . Most writers of travels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that it is pleasant to find George Hamlin Fitch admitting , in " The Critic in the Occident " ( Elder ) , to a mere journalistic motive As in " The Critic in the Orient , " his sketches are entertaining and clear , but serve their best purpose as the matrix of a wide array of photographs . Greece , Italy , and France are each shown in fifteen well-chosen plates , in sepia , London and New York have between them twenty more , and there are ten photographic inserts of scenes varying from Pompeii to Fifth Avenue . The word " critic " means only , in Mr. Fitch 's words , that in long years as literary editor of the San Francisco Emaniiner he had so developed the " newspaper instinct " that to jot down observations upon his peregrinations was " as the breath of his nostrils . " " Self-Realization " ( Holt ) , by Henry W. Wright , of Lake Forest College , is a fresh attempt to solve the difficult problem of introducing the undergraduate to the significance of moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Green , Professor Wright has steered clear of the Scylla of mere practical moralizing , but he has not escaped the Charybdis of abstractness and remoteness . One reason is that his handling of the ethical problem is not quite rigorous . Especially unsatisfactory is his treatment of the crucial problem of self-sacrifice Does it pay to sacrifice self on behalf of social welfare ? Mr. Wright seeks to prove that it does pay , and even that such a sacrifice would be recommended by an enlightened self-interest . In that case one fails to see why egoistic motives are condemned as inadequate Mr Wright offers no discoveries in the field of ethics He is content to present the conventional morality of the more idealistic sort as final The treatment of the subject is , however , comprehensive and well-ordered , and in these important respects the book is not ill-suited for its purpose as a text . Prof. John AL Gillette 's " Constructive Rural Sociology " ( Sturgis &; Walton ) is a product of the growing interest in country life There are not many essentials of rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often helpful suggestion The author has much to say concerning the types and the advantages and disadvantages of country life He deals extensively with the economics of agricultural Production , the question of the improvement of transportation and communication not being neglected Rural health and sanitation , the task of making farm life attractive , the socialization of country life , each . of these vital subjects is discussed sanely and sympathetically The value of such a work can not be overestimated by any one familiar with rural conditions in America Economists and social philosophers continually preach a " return to the land , " often without reflecting that a return to the land Means the abandonment of much that " exalts and embellishes civilized life " If the conditions of rural life are still such as to repel those who have passed their lives in cities , it is a fair inference that they are unworthy of those who have clung to the land . Doubtless rural conditions are improving in many ways , as Professor Gillette instances ; but that very much remains to be done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easily gleaned from these pages . The author has attempted to give the facts and conditions of country life a broad sociological interpretation , and has achieved no small measure of success We know the termer and his needs better than before . " Louis XI and Charles the Bold " ( Moffat , Yard ) , by Lieut - Col . Andrew C P Haggard , is a Journalesque and disjointed narrative of some 400 pages , based upon secondary accounts and an uncritical reading of Commines and other memoirs It adds nothing to our knowledge of the subject , furnishes no new interpretation of the facts , and is not even a well-told story The author has scarcely understood the odd mixture of qualities which goes by the name of Louis XI , and has done nothing more with him than to present , by means of cheap literary devices , some of the more superficial characteristics of the man . A good life of Louis XI in English would be welcome , but the present book may be safely ignored by serious students , while those who desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoirs " Sirenica " ( Lane ) , by W. Compton Leith , is by turns an apology and an indictment of the man-destroying sisters called Sirens Their lay entices , not as the vulgar believe to sensual pleasure , but to dissent , hatred of common things , high adventure The Sirens are the goddesses of romance , eternally disquieting a world whose interest it is to submit to classic restraint A reasonable and enduring happiness can never come to him who has heard the Sirens sing  --  only a fleeting ecstasy and uncertain Joy . Our author passes in review the course of the world , and finds it an attempt at reason and a quest of happiness ever thwarted by the fact that many of the best will follow instead illusion ( or is it higher realityi ) in the realm the Sirens rule . As might be expected from the author of " Apologia Diffidentis , " the style is distinguished with a preciosity that at times becomes saccharine The publisher has shown a sense of Mr. Leith 's literary models in making the book with ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way an unusual and delightful book for a fastidious reader . A quotation will show that Mr Leith is by no means unqualifiedly the champion of the Sirens , at least , he gives fair warning of their hidden talons Like the rule of some rigid order , the service of the Sirens chills human sympathy ; theirs is a sequestering law , too strange to share with many . Every hour of abandonment , each adventurous escape , enfeebles the hold upon common life ; the colors of love and dislike grow paler , as all is said to pale when a long sickness draws to its end , and the soul is near its passing The surface of the mind dulls like a mirror of silver tarnished , the reflections that once played over it come no more , it is estranged from the old light and the moving images of the world .

There is full information with regard to steamboats , railways , cab tariffs , history , art , local customs , and many other things of interest to the traveller . In the appendix is a list of recommended hotels . Even timetables are given showing the service rendered between principal points , together with the cost of tickets .
