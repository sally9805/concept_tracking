 | EXPERIENCE warns us that a man may while away some six weeks in a foreign country , seize his pen , and dash off some breezy book inflated with cocksure , easy , superficial estimates of the national character , customs , and faults of the people in question . Again , he who has devoted some six months to making an eager and conscientious investigation , is in danger of overloading his pages with countless uncertainties and qualifications , so that his reader , anxious for something definite , loses himself in mists of doubt . But that writer who has spent six years among a foreign people , who has had the opportunity of becoming closely acquainted with many of its various individuals , who has been able to study the succession of events in their action and reaction in the light of the national psychology , and grown intimate not only with character but with the tendency of such character ? that writer will renounce his ambition of writing his projected book . For by that time he will have realized how hopeless is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The foregoing does not , of course , apply to one who happens to belong to the people about whom he writes , and who thus may be said to possess a deep and actual knowledge of his subject . He is able to realize the significance of that past with which he has been in touch and to obtain profound glimpses in certain directions ; for instance , there where the streams of character and history traverse each other . He grows suddenly aware that , had not history given a certain direction to national character , this would have undergone a development essentially different , and , contrariwise , that the same historical happenings would have produced different results in conjunction with a different national character . We must remember that it is necessary to be on our guard as soon as we speak of the " character " of a nation , for inasmuch as this alleged character  | is necessarily composed of innumerable and various individual characters , there is danger of obtaining an impression similar to those composite photographs of Lombroso , in which , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , he sought to obtain the physiognomy of the " ideal murderer , " but succeeded only in creating an utterly uncharacteristic face unlike that of any murderer who had ever lived . Nevertheless , in the case of a nation , the universal ramification of blood-relationship tends to produce a certain homogeneity which is accentuated by the so-called soul of the masses , for through this the individual becomes subject to the influence of the community . For instance , in these days we stand amazed at the tremendous force with which a certain uniformity reveals itself in the character of the German people . For Germany this hour is precisely one of those in which history and character intersect . We are suddenly rewarded by an insight into the inward nature of those things , as by a cross-section , which usually evade the eye by a deceptive surface . And in a similar fashion and at the same moment ? let us hope not with the same uniformity ! ? we receive a clear and significant insight into a cross-section of the English character and English history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with racial shame and horror . No end is served when indignant German publicists declare that the English are now no longer a Germanic people ; their very actions bespeak their Teutonic origin . They are essentially Germans , purer Germans , in fact , than many Germans themselves . And their development during the last two centuries has resulted in a growing accentuation of the Anglo-Saxon , that is to say , the German element , at the expense of the Norman-Frank ? quite apart from the tendency of the latter to be absorbed by the former through cross-breeding . Jewish influences may be disregarded , though the influences of the Jews are considerable in the present English Government , and also among the press , which they have marshalled in the infamous crusade of vilification against Germany . " When a nation rises , the Semite follows but never leads . No , it is necessary to probe more deeply into the past in order to discover those causes of the development of England which have brought her where she stands today . This development was one to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagonal drawn between history and character has here embodied this into a corporate fact .  | When we study the history of nations we are constantly surprised at the far-reaching and at the same time unforeseen influences that ramify from simple incidents and scarcely perceptible ripples of events . It is necessary only to seize upon a single event in the early history of the English people and another which occurred five hundred years later , in order to make clear what might well prove an enigma . In their operation these two facts result in a third ? and from the operation of this specially-conditioned result there naturally follows a certain counter-action , and thus finally , as in the case of all organic life , an infinitely manifold and individual whole is built up whose parts mutually modify one another . The Norman Conquest of the eleventh century which resulted in the subjugation of the Anglo-Saxons is the event I have in mind ; the " turn of affairs " is that by which the agricultural and unseamanlike population of England began to be converted into a sea-faring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain English characteristics , so puzzling to the stranger , may be traced directly to the interfusion of the AngloSaxon state developed by Alfred with the spirit of the Norman conquerers , is sufficiently well-known . But it is no less certain that from the very moment in which the movement towards maritime trade took place , a change made itself felt in the corporate unity of five centuries of growth , and that this was inevitably bound to result in the catastrophe the beginnings of which we experience today . The term " nobility " does not possess the same significance in England as in other lands . It has nothing to do with a privileged title by virtue of which all the members of a family are forever differentiated outwardly , but merely represents membership in a social caste which is inwardly different from the rest of the people . There is a constant falling away from this caste as well as a constant assimiliation of new members . You may recognize an Englishman of the nobility or gentry almost at the first glance , frequently by the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demeanour , the voice , almost invariably by his speech . No one is concerned with the title ? the whole question is one of caste . Titles are frequently refused by the most aristocratic persons , and among the families most highly honoured are such who for centuries have persistently refused to accept all honours . The analogy of the ancien regime in France is not to the point , and would lead to confusion . It is true that the Frankish , Burgundian ,  | and Gothic nobility was , until the days of the Revolution , plainly distinguishable from the rest of the people . Today these fine physiognomies are but rarely seen in France . But in England different conditions prevailed from the very beginning , and they have consequently assumed a different meaning . The Burgundians , Franks , and Goths invaded Gaul in entire tribes . The greater part amalgamated themselves with the earlier inhabitants ? the princes and nobles alone held themselves aloof and were numerous enough to permit of inbreeding for a considerable period . On the other hand , the noble families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few in number ? for which reason this strain , which merely assimilated a few Saxon and Danish families of noble birth , remained entirely segregated from the unmixed masses of the Anglo-Saxon people . From this circumstance evolved that ruling caste which is peculiar to England , and this caste has preserved its language or , more correctly , its pronunciation , to this very day . Its forms of expression include not only special words but special turns of phrase which , like the very accent of this caste , the Englishman of the common classes is incapable of mastering . These conditions gave rise to a cleavage of the people , and this has persisted down to our period , separating the population into two unbridgable parts , an upper and a lower class , a noble and a plebeian . William the Conqueror endeavoured to learn Anglo-Saxon , but in vain . Hobbes tells us that the kings who succeeded him were wont to reply thus to all natives who ventured to complain of the tyranny of the new nobles : " Silence ! thou art but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inasmuch as he refused to learn French . But the same thing ( and in this lies the crux of the matter ) occurred with the upper class who refused to learn Anglo-Saxon . Out of this twofold stubborness there grew a new tongue which we call English . It was born of two antagonistic idioms each of which strove for mastery , but even after a certain fixity had been secured , the battle persisted between the two pronunciations ? the aristocratic and the plebeian . If we will keep this point respecting the language in mind , we shall obtain a deeper insight into English conditions than through the perusal of many books . For instance , a system of schools devoted to higher education such as exists in Germany , France , Italy and other countries , would be impossible in England . Would I be likely to send my son to a school in which  | he would grow accustomed , not only through his comrades but through his very teachers , to saying " ' igh " for " high " and " hiland " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disagreeable nasality which has afflicted the urban populations of England , and in the meanwhile , of America and Australia ? The Gymnasia and Realschulen of Germany are therefore quite impossible for England . There are institutions for the training of the children of the upper classes and others for the training of the children of the lower . The boys do not know one another , they hold no converse in common , and they mutually despise one another . The old universities are , without exception , exclusive , and breed those exquisites , the English scholars who , removed from all common things in the cloisters of their mediaeval colleges , are , for all that , not inexperienced in a worldly sense ? as may be assumed from their belonging to the ruling classes of a ruling nation , enjoying ample leisure for research and travel , and representing in their books and in their persons the perfection of modern culture . Such scholars , to be sure , are mere products of the hot-house . The newer universities , on the other hand , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their staffs , especially chemists , physicists , and engineers , nearly all of whom have studied in Germany . They are , however , in no way able to influence the character of the institutions they serve , since these are devoted exclusively to practical purposes and not to abstract science . One of the main pillars of modern Germany is therefore entirely lacking in England ? the all-uniting common and higher schools whose influence penetrates the national life by a thousand channels and elevates it into a cultural unity . The possibility of building up an army of the people , that tremendous ethical creation of modern Germany which is nothing more nor less than its very spine , is likewise lacking in Great Britain . For the German army would be incapable of the stupendous moral power it exerts were it not the mirror and the focus of all the forces of the entire nation , from the Kaiser at its head to the youngest peasant recruit . It is like one family , each is to each a comrade , united by obedience , duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved and the unity of Germany be developed to its fullest power , it was necessary that a moral and spiritual unity should prevail in order to will and create a host of this kind . This unity is lacking in England . In England the two sections of the people , the greater and the  | less , know nothing of each other . My servant may have waited upon me for twenty years , yet I may know little more about him than about the soul of my walking-stick . The pride of the lower-class Englishman is his unapproachableness . He does not wish to be questioned nor made to speak ; he is loath to say : " Good morning " or " Good evening . " Should he meet his employer upon the street he usually crosses it in order to avoid being forced to salute . What possibility of comradeship between officers and soldiers can there be under such conditions ? What common purpose ? The relationship remains that of a noble who gives orders to beings from another world , and demands obedience through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been of an unwarlike nature . The Plantagenets waged many wars in France and won great renown in the Holy Land , but in England they were able to secure soldiers only from the upper classes . Green , the eminent historian , declares that wars and crusades aroused no interest among the people of England ; the one quality they appreciated in their kings was their ability to secure long periods of peace for the island . And this condition has persisted down to present times , for even to-day the larger part of the regular British army consists of Celtic Irishmen and Celtic Scots ? the real Englishman enlists but seldom . In England 's battles of the past Englishmen may have borne the command , but the armies consisted of foreign mercenaries , chiefly German . The principal wars in India were won not by English but by Indian troops , for here the legal proportion of Englishmen was determined as one-fifth , and most of these " Englishmen , " as already declared , were , in reality , Irish . The amusing description of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Second Part of Henry the Fourth is known to all lovers of the poet . In the letters of Sir Henry Wotton , the English ambassador at Venice during the same period , we find an edifying historical confirmation of this . At the beginning of the year 1617 England wished to array herself on the side of the Republic against Spain . The Doge expresses his willingness to accept the services of a Scottish duke who is bringing soldiers from Scotland and Ireland , but the proffer of English troops he declines with thanks : " I have no very high opinion of them and I know how much their fighting spirit depends upon the three B 's ? Beef , Beer and Bed ! " Van Noorden in his War of the Spanish Succession , declares that in 1708 England was forced to consider the adoption of  | legal measures for meeting the great lack of English recruits . It is always the same old story ? in 1200 , in 1600 , in 1700 , and in 1900 ? I ' night supply dozens of examples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamen ? ) England 's insular position is not sufficient as an explanation , for insular Japan has , under our very eyes , been able to create a formidable army of the people . I am convinced that the real cause is to be sought for in that circumstance of a racial mixture followed by a social cleavage , and then intensified by that " turn of affairs " of which I shall proceed to speak . Moreover , one should not overlook the fact that the theory that England had no use for a larger army and need therefore create none , was supported in practice from the earliest times . No statesman in his day , and perhaps none in ours , has been more highly honoured than Lord Bolingbroke . Long after his death he remained the prophet of the peculiar course which the development of modern England has assumed . In the midst of the victories under Queen Anne , Bolingbroke expresses the opinion that England ought to possess a large fleet , but not a standing army , " for this would bring the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of England to permit the Continental Powers mutually to wage war upon one another without meddling too deeply in their affairs . An army would produce great economic difficulties and dangers . A third point might briefly be touched upon : the entire system of English law ? the State , its constitution and its policy ? is the work of one social element without any real participation of the others . Honest old Hobbes acknowledges this when he states that Parliament has never represented the nation as a whole . The Reformation ought certainly to be considered as the point of departure in English policy , for religion must always operate as the main force in politics ? but what do we find ? Those Englishmen , who in their deep earnestness broke away from Rome , were forced to fly their native country and seek liberty of conscience in the wildernesses of North America . On the other hand , the separation of the State and Church as a purely political measure was carried out by that practically absolute monarch , Henry the Eighth , almost without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Roman Catholics and awoke the next morning as " Anglicans . " Among those fables which have caused me most annoyance I must reckon the so-called " political liberty " of England . From the very beginning it has been nothing more than the  | liberty of a caste . Athens indeed might easily have considered itself " free , " since 400,000 bondmen served some 20,000 free citizens ? and England has been able to indulge itself in the luxury of an alleged free Parliament because this Parliament was entirely under the control of wealthy people to whom government meant happiness and the breath of life . One of the most gifted men to whom England ever gave birth , Thomas de Quincey , proves that the growth of the power and adaptivenes of the House of Commons since 1600 is not to be ascribed to a revival of the popular will , but to the multiplication of the lesser nobility ? that is to say , to the influence of the younger sons of the old families . These by degrees forced the great feudal lords and bishops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain rights for the people , for this strengthened it against the king and gave it authority to execute that monarch who would tolerate no interference by the ruling caste . But no less bloodily has it been able to suppress every longing that the populace manifested for power of its own . Even today , when the right of suffrage has been so extended as to permit a considerable section of the common people to have a voice in the affairs of the nation , the ancient dominating nature of the ruling class still exerts itself . Most readers may recall Dickens 's description of a Parliamentary election in Pickwick . I am myself able to confirm the truth of this from a somewhat later period . On the day of the election the little provincial town in which I was then living was invaded by four hundred roughs who had been brought thither by special train . They were a brutal gang with insolent and criminal physiognomies , hailing from a neighbouring manufacturing town , and were armed with formidable cudgels . They formed a sort of guard engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal interest in the election , but they were there to intimidate the liberal voters , and , in case that was not sufficient , to break their skulls . Fortunately the Liberal Committee had not been idle , and shortly afterward three hundred still more suspicious characters arrived from some other point . There were fights and rows throughout the entire day , the voters were dragged from their vehicles by the feet , and the speakers bombarded with rotten eggs . Surely a peculiar conception of the freedom of political opinion and the right of suffrage ! In the evening I was to experience a little of this in my own person . I was at that time a student at college , and , of the eighty  | scholars of this particular school , the only one who wore the Liberal colours and supported Gladstone . Even the pleadings of my teachers were unable to persuade me to change my political colours and pin those of Disraeli upon the lapel of my coat . I was therefore suddenly assailed by the entire mob , flung to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my assistance . On that day ? almost forty-seven years ago ? I learned more concerning English conceptions of liberty than I did through all my subsequent studies of the works of Hallam and Gneist . Two brutal factors confront each other in English politics ? confront and mutually complete each other : the brutal violence of the ruling class and the basic brutality of the uncultivated mass , sundered completely from all contact with the finer things of life . All these phenomena may be traced back to that event of 1066 , an event of sheer violence which destroyed the fine civilization of the Anglo-Saxon state and created the kingdom of " England . " It is my opinion that England 's rise and England 's decline are both rooted in this . But now as to that remarkable " turn of affairs " without which the general demoralization of all classes which we lament today would never have ensued . In his classic work , The Expansion of England , John Robert Seeley long ago attacked the myth that Englishmen are by nature a race of adventurous sea-rovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite is the case . Much patience and time were required ere Englishmen could be induced to venture upon salt water . Seeley at the same time makes it clear that the English are not , in the full sense of the term , conquerors . They have founded colonies where empty lands awaited them or districts inhabited only by naked savages . They acquired other colonies from Dutchmen , Frenchmen , and Spaniards by means of treaties , or for example , Malta , by the violation of treaties . India was subjugated by Indian troops . England has never by force of arms undertaken wars of conquest ? like the French or Spaniards . No , the English do not , like Alexander or Caesar , wage war for the sake of glory . " For England , " says Seeley , " war is an industry , one of the possible means of acquiring wealth , the most prosperous business , the most remunerative investment . " One may censure this or laud it ; I quote it merely because this trait completes the others . Englishmen are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but are lured across the waters solely by trade ? trade in peace , trade in war . The Army and  | Navy were not created for the strength and defense of the home country , but for the furtherance of a world-wide search for markets and profits ; and , despite their undeniable courage and thoroughness , they are in no sense the expression of a national need or a moral idea . Her insular situation has , of course , long made it necessary for England to import goods of all sorts from other lands . But for many hundreds of years this trade lay entirely in the hands of strangers . Among the successors of William the First , Frenchmen from Normandy and Picardy monopolized English trade . Then the German Hanseatic League began its operations , later the so-called Flemish Hansa ; Venice and Genoa , according to certain agreements , carried on the entire trade with the Mediterranean without the use of a single English ship . Even the fisheries along the English coast were chiefly in the hands of Dutchmen , so that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Company of Merchant Adventurers and create a small navy for their protection , he knew not whence to take his sailors , for seamen did not exist among the English . In order to relieve these deplorable conditions , Henry 's successor , Edward the Sixth , issued a decree in 1549 by which the eating of fish on Fridays and Saturdays and on all days of fasting and penance was made compulsory . Elizabeth increased the stringency of these laws and did all in her power to advance the fishing industry . We thus see that during a period in which Italians , Spaniards and Portugese had already produced a race of gifted and heroic navigators , Englishmen were forced by means of harsh laws to catch herrings and flounders in order to bring them into closer acquaintance with the deep ! ( See Cunningham 's Growth of English Industry and Commerce ) . Now , to be sure , progress was rapid enough , and that very Doge who declined the offer of English troops , gladly accepted the help of certain English war-ships , which were nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the royal navy . For the first time in history seven English men-of-war sailed into the Mediterranean in July , 1518 , as a modest part of a mighty Dutch and Venetian fleet . ( Corbett 's England in the Mediterranean ) . England had now recognized the new conditions of the changing world and the opportunity which offered itself for her special enrichment . All that was problematical had already been solved by others ? the East and West passages had been discovered , the New World had been flung open to the Old ,  | India made accessible , and contact with China established . There was nothing further to do now save to help herself to the prizes ? according to the ethics of Mephistopheles : Why ask me " What ? " instead of " How ? " I should forego my rights by sea : War , Trade and Piracy , I vow , Are one ? a holy trinity . The policy of England which now developed may with absolute accuracy be characterized by these words : War , Trade , and Piracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate immediately springs into being , and its first outburst , oddly enough , is directed against the German Hansa . I refer the reader to Schanz 's English Commercial Policy . And the freebooter instinct also comes into play . Without any declaration of war whatsoever England swoops like a hawk upon the unsuspecting Spanish island of Jamaica and thus establishes her West Indian possessions . For a long time England 's " colonial activities " are confined to the capture of Spanish galleons homeward bound with gold and precious wares . England overtakes all other nations in her commercial lust and waxes stronger and stronger through their destruction . Piracy is the first essential , for piracy produces a flourishing trade ; war is to be waged only when other means are of no avail ? but always with an eye to the island policy of Bolingbroke . England first forms an alliance with Holland in order to destroy the colonial empire of Spain , then with France in order to sever the vital nerve of Holland ; then she perceives how that great Frenchman , Dupleix , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method , and hounds the Hindoos against the French , then Hindoos against other Hindoos , until finally , in Seeley 's words , she has " without conquest " subjugated one of the richest empires of the world . Kant ? who , gentle soul though he was , nevertheless was gifted with an accurate and penetrating vision ? delivers this judgment upon England at the very beginning of the nineteenth century : " England is the most aggressive and war-fomenting of all nations . " Let one example attest how unmoral the people of England had become under the influence of this new spirit . We all know what importance English school histories attach to those battles which Marlborough won with his German soldiers . And what was the real end and issue of these wars ? Nothing  | less than to assure to England a monopoly of the trade in slaves . Lecky declares that , after the Peace of Utrecht in 1713 , the slave-trade became the central feature of all English policy . And this trade was carried on by the English just so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not grown prosperous through its industries but through the capture and sale of millions of unhappy blacks . Green , patriotic historian though he be , gives witness thus : " The horrible cruelties and the ruthlessness of this traffic , the ruin of Africa and the destruction of human dignity , called forth no pity in the hearts of Englishmen . " He goes on , nevertheless , and describes the attempts of a few philanthropists to combat these inhuman wrongs . But for decades these men were unable to accomplish anything ; Parliament remained dumb , the merchants became indignant ? until such time as new conditions produced an unfavorable effect upon this unholy traffic . Then , with the most revolting protestations of humanity and of England 's mission to act as a torch-bearer to other nations , etc. , the slavetrade was at last suspended by law . We are fortunate enough to possess a clear and enduring judgment of Goethe 's upon this very matter : " Everybody is familiar with the declamations of the English against the traffic in slaves , and whilst they endeavour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this matter , we are for all that able to perceive that their real object is one essentially at variance with their pretenses . One might have known this , for Englishmen , as is notorious , never act without ulterior motives . Their great possessions on the West Coast of Africa make it necessary for them to employ these negroes themselves and it is therefore against their interests to transport them elsewhere . They have built up large colonies of negroes in America , and these are very remunerative , amd produce a great annual profit in slaves . These supply the North American demand , and , since the profits of this traffic would be lessened by importing blacks , they now find it to their interest to preach against this inhuman commerce . " It would be impossible within the limits of an article to describe how England 's agricultural life gradually went to ruin through her growing and exclusive devotion to trade , industry , and , above all , the material accumulation of wealth . At the beginning of the nineteenth century English weavers still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens . Today this is a luxury in which only a rich business  | man may indulge , for the products would not pay the cost . In 1769 , with a total population of eight and a half millions , 2,800,000 were occupied with agriculture or sheep-raising ; in 1897 , with a population of 40,000,000 , only 798,000 men and women were thus occupied ( Gibbins , The Industrial History of England ) . A deep-going change of character in the population of both classes is connected with this turn of affairs which has so completely changed the life and soul of the Englishman . The England of old had been able to enjoy the priceless treasure of an absolute immunity against a foe from without , and as already shown , it had waged its wars with alien troops . For this reason agriculture and country life flourished and ? as the old poets sang and modern scientists with their statistics prove ? not only were the proprietors more prosperous than today , but also the small lease-holders and the labourers . England was known throughout all Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveller of the fifteenth century observes that the English are less plagued by hard work than most people ; lead a more refined life and dedicate themselves to spiritual interests . Another praises their incomparable " courtesy . " But all that has changed . As to the " spiritual interests " in the England of today I have something to say in my essay on " German Liberty . " But so far as " merry old England " is concerned ? and who does not love its fine flower as given to us by Shakespeare and Walter Scott from the spacious ages of Henry the Eighth and Queen Elizabeth ? ? this same England began to vanish , at first gradually , then with amazing rapidity , but always in direct proportion to , though in inverse ratio with , the development of its overseas commerce and industry . The novels of the eighteenth century retain this atmosphere in a kind of sultry and eerie afterglow ; the genius of Dickens shows it lighting up the hearts of a few naive and twisted souls wavering towards death ? between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowy destiny . Today the last trace has vanished ; today England has nothing to show of geniality , nor broad , good-natured humor , nor gaiety ? so far as the national life is concerned . All is haste , money , noise , pomp , vulgarity , ostentation , arrogance , envy . Who does not recall the beautiful old English Christmas garnished with palm-branches and mistletoe under which innocent kisses were stolen ? Thirty years ago no Englishman could have been lured from his home on this day ; today the restaurants of London are bespoken  | weeks in advance ; family jostles family at thousands of tables . An orgy of drinking , eating , and noise ensues , until midnight sounds , when there is an outburst in unison of some trivial gutter-song , or the obnoxious and tiresome " For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow . " After which the tables are cleared away and young men and women abandon themselves to violent and promiscuous negro dances , whilst their elders play bridge in adjoining rooms . I believe no sane Englishman will dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry ; we are merry no more . " It is my absolute conviction that this catastrophe , this complete destruction of English gaiety , English wisdom , and English honesty ( for this , too , was once proverbial ) is to be ascribed to the circumstance that a people whose social fabric was thus like a house divided against itself were suddenly abandoned or seduced into a devotion to war , trade , and piracy . All culture ? religion , education , art , arms , law , social customs ? must , if it is to penetrate the entire nation , have as its postulate a unity among the people so that the humblest citizen may share in it . It is needless to point out how fully this condition is fulfilled in Germany . In England we find nothing of the sort . No sooner was the worthy Anglo-Saxon peasant converted into a freebooter , than we behold the " blond beast , " as Nietzsche saw it in his immeasurable dream ; and no sooner had the " refined " nobles of the fifteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after gold , than the heartless slave-dealer stood revealed ? a creature distinguished from the Spanish robber merely through his hypocrisy . There is no human type more brutal than the brutal Englishman , for brutality forms the very basis of his being . He may not be evil at heart ; he may be frank , energetic , and courageous . But he is submerged in an ethiopian ignorance ; he has never undergone the discipline of obedience and reverence ; he knows of no other ideal than that of " fighting his way through . " As is nearly always the case , this crudity has gradually saturated almost the entire nation from the bottom to the very top . Some fifty years ago it was considered infra dig . for a member of the aristocracy to devote himself to manufacture , trade , or finance . Today the head of the oldest and greatest house of Scotland , a brotherin-law of the King himself , is a banker . When sons of dukes or marquises suddenly vanish out of society and their absence elicits inquiry , we receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile . " How , when , or where , is neither explained nor asked .  | In the meantime , however , another variety of vulgarization had seized upon the upper classes ? something far more ominous in a political sense . Despite gentility and good form , the moral compass had begun to waver from the true North ; the temptation of inordinate power based upon unlimited wealth was too strong to be resisted . Right and wrong soon became dubious , almost indiscriminated , terms among the aristocracy and the circles that stood closest to it . The very man whose private life was conducted according to a most scrupulous code was ready to commit any crime in the assumed interests of his country . Our English prophets ? Burke , Carlyle , Ruskin ? have been thundering for more than a hundred years against the terrifying decline of the love of honesty ? once held so sacred in England ! Here , too , I should like to cite an example . The reader will be able to perceive upon what downward paths the feet of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hastings ? As a mere boy he entered the service of the East India Company and attained to the post of governor-general . There is no doubt that England owes its supremacy in India to this man , who , with a cunning that was nothing less than Machiavellian , knew how to incite the various tribes , principalities , and creeds of India one against the other . In addition to an intellect of a high order and an iron will , Warren Hastings was distinguished by the fact that he was fettered by no conscience in the matter of politics . He was forced to deal with tyrants like Tipu Sahib , with criminals risen from the lowest castes to the throne of princes , whence they ruled like wild beasts over the docile Hindoos ; with old titled sorceresses who let their own sons rot in dungeons so that they themselves might wallow a little longer in the blood of their people ? in short , with that horrible mob of dehumanized Asiatics into whose power the hapless land had fallen . Gentle measures , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East India Company or the English Government that stood behind it interfered here with force of arms , noble work might have been nobly completed . But there was no such intention . The Government had no thought of lending assistance with money or soldiers , and the Company did not wish to incur increased expenses but to reap increased profits . Hastings would therefore form a compact first with this Indian prince , than with the other . He was indifferent to all right and wrong , protected the greatest of the criminals on the native thrones so long as he thereby served the interests of his company , and  | through these , as he imagined , those of England . Gold above all things was needed ? how else was he to equip and support an army ? India was to pay for India 's subjugation . Hastings for this reason sought out those native princes who promised him the largest contributions , and these he supported with all the means a European in his position might command . In this fashion he almost doubled the returns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved ? How were these princes enabled to pay such great sums and supply so many soldiers ? By means of cruelties so horrible that the world has never heard their like ? till recently , when the Belgians took possession of the Congo Basin : cruelties which have cast an eternal blot of shame upon all conceptions of humanity ? for no monster could conceive them and no devil perpetrate them upon the innocent . Then Burke arose in 1780 ? Burke already deserving of immortality through this one act ? and by the sheer force of his eloquence forced Parliament to impeach Hastings on the score of having brought infamy upon the name of England . During the trial before the House of Lords , Burke spoke for six consecutive days , confirmed his charges in every single particular , and then concluded with these words : " My Lords , if by conniving at these frauds , you once teach the people of England a concealing , narrow , suspicious , guarded conduct , ? if you teach them qualities directly contrary to those by which they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation of concealers , a nation of dissemblers , a nation of liars , a nation of forgers , ? my Lords , if you , in one word , turn them into a people of banians , the character of England , that character which , more than our arms , and more than our commerce , has made us a great nation , the character of England will be gone and lost . " The day on which Warren Hastings was acquitted , the 23rd of April , 1795 , is one of those days of which I spoke , when history and character intersect and give us a glimpse into the innermost nature of things . The new England which , naturally , had long been in process of evolution from the old , was now revealed as complete . Hastings had not enriched himself personally ; as a private individual he had not robbed other private individuals ; it may be that he had never harmed so much as a fly in the course of his life ; yet in the interests of his country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , he hesitated at no falsehood , no perjury ; he . betrayed what was confided to him ,  | refused his protection to the innocent , raised criminals to thrones , suffered others to commit the most unspeakable cruelties , and cashiered English officials who dared to protest . And , behold ! with modern England we find ready to hand the modern English statesman . For Sir Edward Grey is precisely a man of this calibre . For years he has assumed the chair at conferences for the preservation of peace ? in order that the well-planned war might find no obstacle in its way ; for years he has sought a rapprochement with Germany ? in order that the honourable German statesmen and diplomats might not suspect the war of annihilation that was preparing . The German Emperor had almost succeeded at the last moment in avoiding the danger of war , but Grey , the anointed apostle of peace , knew how to play his cards so that the cataclysm became inevitable . England usually abominated the crime of regicide , but now when the unthinkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who through their own Crown Prince prepare for the assassination of the Crown Prince of a neighboring state , now no word of holy horror is uttered , but England 's mission to " protect the little states " is suddenly discovered by Grey . In " neutral " Belgium the English Government helps to convert Antwerp into the strongest fortress in the world , and sends her ammunition to Maubeuge as early as 1913 . The military " agreements " with France and Belgium for the attack upon Germany from the North are in the pockets of Sir Edward Grey ; all details of transport and disembarkation are there in black and white . And yet he is able to manipulate events in such a fashion that Germany , out of her dire necessity , ? for now all men may perceive how otherwise she would have been utterly lost , ? is forced to violate this alleged neutrality . For the first time in the history of the world the entire English fleet is mobilized ? this at the beginning of July , and ostensibly for a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time arranged for the assassination of Franz Ferdinand , a friendly visit of battle-ships to Kiel is arranged , for other attempts to spy out the defenses of that harbour had not succeeded . Such today is political England ? precisely as Burke had predicted it would become : a nation of dissemblers , forgers , liars and cheats . What of Ruskin 's bitter self-comfort : " Let us not concern ourselves with this England ; in a hundred years it will be numbered among the dead nations " ? I too , have no faith in the unlimited power of England of which we hear so much , for true power lies rooted only in moral strength .  | The individual Englishman may be courageous and even efficient , but the State of England is rotten unto its very marrow . Germany is a country so essentially different that England , the political England of today , has been a riddle to her for many years . Again and again has Germany permitted herself to be deceived , and almost I fear that this may occurr no less in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reason I , an Englishman , must have the courage to attest the truth . We can be saved only by a wise , strong , and victorious Germany .
