In speaking of the efforts of " Our Slow British Cousins " to prevent rich Americans acquiring ancient monuments , you nay , " What puzzles us is why they are so cross about it . " You aye mistaken . They are not in the least cross . They are quietly laughing , and well they may .

' Where did the money come from to save the relic ? Prom his American wife ; for until his marriage he was as poor as the proverbial church mouse .

They are trying to hide their smiles .
