THE opportunities for religious and social work for a girl in these days are so many that she may well rejoice that it is her privilege to be alive in such an age . More and more the vision of both men and women is being broadened ; their sympathies are going out beyond the narrower circle of their own immediate neighborhoods and are embracing the world . This breadth of vision is , in its turn , reacting on the home circle , for the girl who sees the world as a whole sees the importance of her own neighborhood in its relation to the world , and knows that to bring happiness there is to make a very real and definite contribution to the progress of the world . She knows , too , that whether her field be large or small , if she is working in the consciousness of her relation to universal forces , she herself is-bound to become a person of power . Every girl , however , who starts out to do social work is embarrassed by the mere number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social centers , libraries , probation work , settlements and the Young Womens Christian Association are only a few of the great social and religious move- ments that offer to either the professional or the volunteer worker opportunities for constructive and permanent work . Probably no one of them has places for so many different kinds of girls as has the Young Womens Christian Association . A little stenographer once said to me , " If I were only working in a place where I could feel that I was helping to make girls happier , I would n't mind working twice as hard . I know that helping to sell stockings is useful and necessary , but , oh , how much I want the sense of being directly and personally of service . " In the Association the youngest stenographer can have this sense of being an integral part in the work of service , and there is room for innumerable different kinds of gifts and training . Nor does it matter much where a girl lives . The work of the Association , radiating from its center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you should enter with me the beautiful headquarters on Fifty-second Street and Lexington Avenue and should see how extensively and adequately they are equipped and , yet with what simplicity and taste , and should be shown the auditorium and the rows of offices , it would be a revelation to you . Then perhaps you would be given a glimpse of that side of the building where fifty splendid young women are being trained for the leading positions in the Association ? of which , alas , there are over five times as many as we have women fitted to fill them . Finally , when you learned that though the headquarters budget is nearly four hundred thousand dollars the budget of the nationwide association is nearer ten million , you would begin to realize the extent of the work . If you should stand at one of the upper windows and see New York lying below you , or if in the exhibition room you should be shown the charts of our work , you could see all America spread out before you in your mind 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Thousands In the cities you could see thousands of girls pouring into classes all day and all evening : fifteen thousand in physical training classes learning how to have straight backs and a spring in their steps ; sixteen thousand in domestic science classes ; and eighty thousand others studying millinery , sewing , first aid to the injured , . typewriting and anything else that shows a young woman how to be more efficient , to earn more , to  | be healthier , to have a better time and to realize the ever-present love of God . You could see the Traveler 's Aid meeting girls at the trains and boats ? all girls , not merely members of the Association . The gleam of her badge has cheered many a lonely and discouraged girl and guided her to safe-keeping . The thirteen thousand young women who have obtained employment through our employment bureau next pass before your eyes . You could hear the little music student in Boston , who hailed from ' Texas , saying to the secretary , " In all of New England I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You could see boarding homes provided at reasonable rates for young women who are stranded in a strange town , or for homeless working-girls who would otherwise have no safe place in which to stay . You could attend the noon meetings in factories and hear the girl in whose factory there was no club say , " I wish I could belong ; it 's awful nice and stylish . " You could see the Beta Sigmas , as the Association girls in schools are called , giving a party with their Christmas money to poor babies , going for the babies themselves , introducing them to Mr. Santa Claus , showering them with chocolates and goodies , filling their arms with plump stockings and their hearts with love ? and all this on Christmas morning , so that a large part of their own fun-making had to be sacrificed . All through the year these girls send flowers , books , and magazines to settlements and hospitals and at their weekly parties they sew for Christmas boxes . If you are more interested in the problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreter from the international institute of the Young Womens Christian Association on Lenka , who has left her farm in the mountains of Hungary to face America alone , and is now working twelve hours a day as a dishwasher in one of the poorest of the East Side restaurants . Her surprise when you come into her little crowded flat and tell her that her arrival in this dreadful America has been expected , that actually some one has been waiting to welcome her , to show her how she may learn this " so deeficult American language " and how she may train herself for a more efficient and better-paying position , is most touching . Later you may see her studying in one of the English circles with patient eagerness ; still later she may be one of the two hundred girls from all parts of the city who have learned the way to the institute headquarters and are being initiated into all  | the delights of a real American Christmas party . Not only in New York is every immigrant girl who arrives alone visited and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually introduced to the best ? economically , socially , and spiritually ? that America has to offer , but already during this first year of our immigrant work several other cities have made enthusiastic beginnings , and as far away as the Pacific Coast those who had so long looked with a kind of hopelessness at our immigrant problem are beginning to see in this successful experiment of the Young Womens Christian Association a statesmanlike solution of a large part of it . In Trenton , when the immigrant trains come in , arriving in the middle of the night as is the custom of such trains all over the country , and discharge their passengers on a cinder bed outside the station shed , you may imagine the joy of the solitary girls when in that first terrible moment , with shouting cabbies and the darkness adding to their distress and terror , they find a gentle-voiced woman there to meet them , speaking their own tongue , knowing their very names and where they want to go ; offering to accompany them if no friends are there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper surroundings in their new homes . No wonder that such unexpected protection and kindness disarms the natural suspicion of a stranger in a strange land and makes it possible for her ultimately to take part in the greater pleasures and friendships of the Association . But perhaps you are more interested in native American girls . Possibly you are planning to go to college and are wondering what kind of comrades you will meet there and whether this Association spirit of glad friendliness has touched them at all . Indeed , you will find that to be met at the station by an Association girl , who will carry your suitcase and guide you to your new quarters , will be as unexpectedly delightful to you as to the most timid immigrant . At the reception to the new students you will have your first opportunity to meet as a whole that wonderful throng of girls who are to be your companions for so many years . There ,  | too , you may , if you are fortunate , meet and begin to know and love the secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely responsible for the initiating and carrying through of all Association plans . Gradually you will be introduced into Bible and mission classes and to a dozen other activities that will open up hitherto undreamed-of realms of social work and will tend to make your religion vital and living . Finally you will hear the magic words " summer conference . " The Treat of the Year What is a summer conference ? What is this toward which young women in every college are looking forward each year so eagerly ; toward which they are working with so much enthusiasm ; toward which every factory and working-girl club , every gymnasium class , every Beta Sigma and normal school association is saving pennies ; in exchange for which many a girl has given up all thought of any other Christmas present ? It is a gathering of young women for twos weeks or ten days in sonic spot chosen for its beauty and quiet , where , in the peace and joy and leisure for contemplation and communion there provided , they may get some foreshadowing of the heavenly places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load of girls before the hotel and by dint of a skilful use of the megaphone they have all been safely directed to their allotted quarters , the fun begins . Care is cast aside . An atmosphere of kindness and of friendly interest permeates everything . You can make friends as little children do , by merely asking , " What 's your name ? Where do you live ? " A common interest brings out bonds of sympathy . Young women from different parts of the country flock together and discover new points of view . In the morning there is work . Bible classes , mission-study classes and classes in city and immigrant problems , open one 's eyes to the broad fields of opportunity that lie just beyond our college days , or that are touching us on every side if we are city girls . We are brought into contact with the methods that are used elsewhere ; we are given  | glimpses into the thrilling plans for cooperation between this work of women and the great work of the churches everywhere ; we are brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many beautiful paths leading us into ways of service . In the evenings we have the leaders of Christian thought throughout the Union to speak to us and after the meetings we may meet them for intimate and helpful counsel . In the afternoons there is play : water sports in preparation for a grand regatta ; basketball and tennis leading up to championship games in which , amid the cheers of excited onlookers , college against college and city against city struggle for victory . On rainy days there are big open fires , and plenty of floor spact to sit on , and songs or stories . Or , perhaps , at an indoor athletic meet some very close contest in a " standing broad grin " or a " blind man 's obstacle race " will help us to forget the weather . Last of all , there is city or college day , when the opportunities for originality are unending . All kinds of fun at the expense of even the most dignified secretaries , wonderful effects of color contrived with the simplest of materials and songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls to the rest , and to make a beautiful pageant of the whole scene . Silver Bay , Eaglesmere , Lake Geneva , Blue Ridge , Gearhart Park , Hacienda , Monte Ne and Cascade ? how their very names recall the good times we have had there and make us long to go back . A delegate to the Southwestern Conference writes to the National Board treasurer : " I had the money to pay the pledge for the support of the National Board when I left the conference , but I wanted to earn it by my own labors , for I think one enjoys that part of it . In the South one is often without servants during the summer months and our servants went to the cotton patch along with the others . My mother was away for a month , so the burden of the household duties fell upon my shoulders . When she returned home , I continued to do the housework and all the baking . It was by the baking that I made my five dollars . I have always been very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should have done . When I went home from Monte Ne I began life anew and really  | looked for work to do . I shall never forget what the conference did for me and as a . result all my home and school life is much happier , for one is always happier working for others . " With such a spirit there , can you wonder that outsiders who drop in at our conferences should so often remark to us , " What a happy religion yours is ? " Or , with a halfreproachful shake of the head , " What fun you seem to get out of it all ! " As if religion were not for bright days as well as dark ones ! But this combination of fun and thoughtfulness and out-of-door life is not restricted to summer conferences . At Altamont , one of , he Association summer camps , you could have seen last summer nearly eight hundred girls ? telephone , factory and shop girls , housemaids , students and settlementworkers , including six young women from the Far East -- escaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods and enjoying the fun and open-air life of a camp . Hear what one from Japan says : " My heart is with my dear camp tonight . It has meant such a great deal to my life . I realize more clearly than ever that it is possible for us to work for the coming of God 's kingdom , for I witnessed the heaven-like Altamont with my own eyes . Oh , that beautiful atmosphere . I long for it and I will strive to create that kind of spirit wherever I go . Everybody was so kind to me . Altamont shall be my home in America . What a homelike home it is ! " The need for volunteer workers at these camps , to divide the summer 's work among them , is an ever-urgent one . Nor is the country girl , who even in the heat of summer is apt to long for some of the sights and excitements of the city , neglected by the Association . The Young Womens Christian Association is fully in line with the nation-wide awakening of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful experience in country work has been put in charge and the work is forging ahead . The country girl very often begins to realize her advantages only when under the inspiration of an Association leader she learns to observe and to express herself . In Rural Manhood , our secretary tells of a little girl who wrote in her prize essay : " I like to live in the country because I can whistle and sing as loud as I please  | and it does n't bother anyone . I milk three cows each morning before breakfast and it seems to me as though the louder I sing the more milk those cows give . " This child is beginning to see for herself some of the joys of living in the country . The Cry for Workers Yet , in all that you have seen you must not forget the innumerable cities , towns and counties , where the work is still to be begun and where great needs are crying out for enthusiastic and persevering workers . With such opportunities and such needs to face , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an Association secretary . As someone half-laughingly put it , " She must be a housekeeper , a financier , a preacher , a teacher and a social physician , besides being just a nice woman . " Very few such women exist , and yet in a profession that gives such scope to every talent she possesses , and that brings such varied and important affairs daily under her personal supervision and control , a woman bids fair to develop into something very like that high ideal . In three city associations there are several hundred more students enrolled than in Smith College . Girls in the morning , girls in the afternoon , girls at night ; some for this subject , and some for that ? think what it means merely to arrange a schedule for such a crowd . Fight hundred women at a single meal in one lunch-room ; equipment varying from the simplest kind to plants worth half a million , and budgets as large in some cases as one hundred thousand dollars ? all of these things come more or less immediately under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized workers , such as the gymnasium teachers , the religious work directors , the industrial , extension , student and immigration secretaries must have a wide and first-hand knowledge of the whole field if they are to attain their highest efficiency . Higher up are the traveling secretaries of the territorial committees and the national board . What could suggest more to you of romance and hard work combined than to  | hear how our secretary for Indian schools , after a long train journey , steps off at some small station , mounts a horse and with her pistols at her belt rides gayly off to an Indian reservation , across the prairies , alone . Or , who could show more devoted faith and " pluck " than our little secretary for colored schools when , finding herself stranded , through a combination of storm and train wreck , in a village where no decent quarters for colored girls existed , she was forced to trust to the sound of her cultivated voice and to the darkness that hid her feat ures to persuade the white livery man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to her destination . From the youngest local secretary in the smallest outpost of the Association to the executive secretary of the national board , each Association worker is a leader and a pioneer . She aims to be , not a follower and imitator , but one who , with a vision of the fundamental needs of the nation and of her community , initiates and executes suitable plans to meet those needs . Such a woman is honored everywhere . And yet , as one worker expressed it , the characteristic spirit of the Association worker is " a perfect indifference as to who gets the glory provided the thing is done . "  |
