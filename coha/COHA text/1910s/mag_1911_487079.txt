The Interstate Commerce Committee of the United States Senate begins this week its hearings on the general subject of anti-Trust laws . But the country has already begun hearings , on an enormous scale . Everybody has his complaint ; everybody his remedy . No lawyer so insignificant , no business man so humble , but he can tell you all about the mischiefs of the Sherman law ; and no citizen is deterred by previous lack of acquaintance with the matter from offering drafts of new statutes which would at once undo the evils of the old one and make us all rich and happy . As every resident of Boston used to be said to carry a complete new system of the universe under his hat , so every American to-day is ready to stand and deliver , when called upon ( too often , alas , before anybody calls upon him ) , the plan of a perfect anti-Trust law . The authors of these plans do indeed confess frequently that their outline is " crude " or merely " tentative , " but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest confidence . Never was the nation 's multitude of counsellors so great , whether wisdom resides in them or not . Byron woke up to find himself famous , but the Sherman law woke up from its long sleep to find itself infamous . Abuse and dread of it when in effect are far greater than the contempt which was expressed for it while it was " dormant . " From being a thing to point to with pride as the work of great lawyer-Senators like Edmunds and Hoar , and as evidence of party good faith , it has come to be spoken of as something not merely imbecile but well-nigh criminal . It was " prompted by something of a revengeful spirit , " " terror is its keynote , " it " seeks to imprison people for keeping out of debt , " it " belongs to the period of blood-letting in medicine " ? such are a few of the phrases about it to be culled from a single address recently given on the Sherman law . That statute is certainly no longer in danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the most belabored of acts of Congress , and its speedy repeal or radical amendment is confidently predicted . Congress , it is hopefully said , will not deny the petition of the suffering millions of business men . For our part , we would not say one word against all this agitation . If it means the active entrance of business men into politics , for public ends and in the use of honorable methods , we can but hail it . But the real business intellect must deal with facts , not wild imaginings , and the fact that bulks largest before the business world to-day , in connection with this whole affair , is that any Congressional . action looking to the amendment of the Sherman law , except possibly to render it more drastic , is entirely out of the question for at least a Year to come . There will be hearings , and we presume that a flood of bills will be introduced . It is possible that the President may recommend some measure to supplement the Sherman law ? not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporation or a Federal license for large corporations doing an interstate business . But no one who knows the state of mind whether of Congress or of the country , no one who considers the party deadlock and jealousy between the two houses , no one who duly weighs the imminence and significance of the Presidential election , can give to the most despairing business men ? " too quick despairers , " we are tempted to call them  --  the slightest hope that any legislation of the kind they desire , can possibly be enacted in the coming session . Let the agitation for repeal or amendment go on by all means , but let it be clear-sighted enough to see how long and difficult is the path to actual legislative accomplishment . Against such a mental condition of the nation as now exists on the subject of anti-Trust laws , il , is idle to rail , except for the purpose of , , , affording relief to those who are suffering from retained expletives . We may set out to convert the people , but that takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but to conform to the will of the people as already expressed in existing law ? Business men are supposed to be nothing if not matter of fact ; lawyers are our great realists , looking at the thing as it is ; but neither class will live up to its reputation if it does not conclude that , for the present , there is nothing for the Federal authorities to do but to enforce the Sherman law , and nothing for captains of industry and chiefs of great business to do except to adjust themselves to the judicial interpretations of that law as best they can . We do not deny that there is some ground for the lingering complaint of big corporations and their counsel that they do not yet know clearly what they can do under the Sherman law . But the debatable territory has been greatly narrowed by the recent decisions . It was of them that President Taft said in Iowa : " The business community now knows , or ought to know , where it stands . " A citizen of Indiana has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers of New York can not tell corporations what powers they have left , they had better consult a country lawyer who for a fee of $100 would give them all the advice they need  --  which is simply to obey the law . This is Indiana humor . But there can be no suspicion of jesting in the circular letter which the Civic Federation is sending out to 20,000 representative men in business and the professions . This starts off with the blunt assertion that the Sherman law , as now interpreted by the Supreme Court , means that " any combination in restraint of trade with the purpose of controlling prices and stifling competition is unlawful . " Such a lay statement shows at least what combinations can not do . This negative part of the anti-Trust law , at any rate , is now understood ; and it is beyond all the wits of all the differing doctors of that law to change those prohibitions into permissions . CITY GOVERNMENT AND SOCIALISM . The municipal victories of the Sociahst party in New York , Ohio , Wisconsin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While estimates may vary widely in attempting an appraisal , . no open-minded person can doubt that these Socialist votes indicate a rapid growth both in Socialistic sentiment proper and in that feeling of profound dissatisfaction with our existing municipal regimes which has nothing in it that can in any permissible sense be designated as Socialism . In Schenectady , in Milwaukee , in the Ohio towns carried by the Socialists , thousands of votes were cast for their ticket by men who have no idea of attempting to overthrow the existing economic system . But it would be a mistake to suppose that the absence of such intention insures the sterilization of these votes as part of that general socialistic ferment with which , in this country , we shall probably have to reckon more and more seriously year after year . To all the other heavy penalties , therefore , that we have been paying for our notorious failure to master the problem of municipal government there must now be added the strengthening , in a purely adventitious and unnecessary way , of the forces making toward economic revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but we do not see the forest for the trees . Every great American city has been familiar , year after year for generations , with the par- . ticular evils which the system of government either by alternating or continuous party machines brings with it . At almost every municipal election the question in which " the better element " is concerned is how to cut down peculation and incompetence and favoritism and neglect . Everybody knows what it means to have a public-building theft , or padded registrations , or a horde of needless henchmen paid out of the city treasury , or venal and ruffianly police magistrates , or stolen franchises ; and , indeed , it may be said with entire truth that during the past three decades gre  --  at and most gratifying progress has been made in regard to all such abuses . But few people comprehend the terrible price we have been paying for the necessity of devoting to the fight against these evils that ' energy which would otherwise have been free for the procuring of great positive benefits . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters determined on reform have compelled a gradual but steady advance in our municipal standards ; nevertheless to any detached observer , to any person not hardened by use to the spectacle , the public history of our municipalities would make the impression of something very like a nightmare . Instead of turning on large and substantial questions of city policy or city advantage , our municipal campaigns have been in the main fights between opposing party organizations for the possession of the spoils of office ; and the highest ambition of the independent voter has been to reduce the evils of this situation to a minimum . The time seems at last to have come when the number of those American citizens who are tired of " marking time " in this way has reached formidable dimensions . They are helping the Socialists to elect their Mayors and Councilmen because the Socialists , whateverelse they may be after , do look upon the possession of the city government as an opportunity for doing things of real importance to the community Whether they will make good use of their opportunity may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect who , without being Socialists , have put Socialists in power . They vote John Smith , Socialist , into the Mayoralty not because they want him to get the salary or the patronage , but because they want to get better streets , more economical government , more equitable expenditure of the taxes It may be that some of the things that they are after have in them a certain suggestion of Socialistic feeling . But , principally , they are tired of seeing the poorer parts of the city dirty or ill-paved or insufficiently lighted , or the health laws not properly enforced , and simply demand a fair , honest , and enlightened government . A single illustration of the way in which our absorption in fighting abuses has blocked the larger possibilities of municipal life may suffice instead of many . Amendment Number Four , which was Voted on by the people of New York last week , proposes to give the municipalities of the State larger powers than they now possess in making condemnations for public improvements . Nearly a hundred years ago , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to exercise such powers , it was barred by a court decision , declaring the proposed action to be unconstitutional . In the century that has passed since then there has grown up on this island and its adjacent territory , in place of a small pro : vincial town , a vast city , of dazzling wealth and far outstripping in population every city in the world except London . In the course of this stupendous development many things have been done upon which we can look with pride and satisfaction , but many more things have been done , and left undone , the thought of which must fill any reflecting person with profound regret . But in the whole course of that hundred years the question whether it was or was not best for the city to obtain by Constitutional amendment the power which was denied it by that one court decision of long , long ago did not so much as make its appearance . Men were too busy thinking about Fernando Wood , or Tweed , or Platt , or Croker , or Murphy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a question as whether it would be well to strengthen the hands of the city government in dealing with the problems presented in the opening of streets , the creation and enlargement of parks , the clearing up of slums , and the like . The principle of " excess condemnation " may be good or bad ; we think it is good , many respectable people think it is bad . That is not now the point . The point is that this policy , whose importance has long been recognized in European cities , and whose application is obviously of peculiar range and significance in a city of such rapid growth and swift change as New York , has hardly had a moment 's attention at the hands of the community . And what is true of this question is almost equally true of nearly every other of the great questions that ought to be issues in municipal politics . Through - men and women in private life , many great public benefits have been pressed to accomplishment ; but who can point to a single one of themtenement-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , et cetera  --  that has formed the centre of interest in our governmental con- , tests ? In the diversion of civic energy from the ' real interests of the community our monstrous bi-partisan system of city government has inflicted upon American municipalities its deepest wounds . ? MR . BALFOUR 'S RETIREMENT . " I wonder , " wrote Arthur Balfour to the Duke of Devonshire , a dozen years ago , " whether if I should live to the age of seventy-two I should still care for a Cabinet office . I like it so little at fifty-two that I do n't think I should . " Something of that spirit of detachment , and of doing a work against the greater inclination , has marked Mr. Balfour 's leadership of the Conservative party , which he on Wednesday of last week laid down . In his very speech announcing his determination to retire , . there appears the attitude of an introspective philosopher , analyzing his own consciousness and his own powers as well as the political situation , and making his decision on grounds of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . One seems to detect in his remarks a certain zest as of a born student and metaphysician at last permitted to escape from the crushing routine of political life and to return to his- books and brooding studies . In the last number of the Hibbert Journal Mr. Balfour had an acute critique of some of M. Bergson 's philosophical positions , in which he expressed the regret that he had been unable to keep up with the progress of metaphysical speculation in America and in Germany as he had wished . Now one can fancy him happy again , far from the madding crowd and in the still air of delightful studies . Mr. Balfour has the air of a man shaking off the garb of the politician , which he has been forced to wear for so many Years , and going back joyfully to the philosopher 's robe and academe . His resignation we take to be sincere , and not a matter of tactics . His instincts are those of the high-bred gentleman , not of a political manceuvrer . He bases his retirement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known he has suffered in recent years , and which has compelled him to frequent absences from the House of Commons . There has been , of course , a noisy movement to depose him from the Conservative leadership . But by this it is improbable that he has been greatly moved . Even his bitterest enemies ad mitted that he could not be forced out . The writer of an article in the last Fortnightly , which was strongly averse to Balfour 's continuing as leader , concluded that his - retirement must be voluntary . Possibly , the clamor which has been raised against him may have had the effect of making him feel more irked by the duties of his position , but he had no reason to be afraid of his antagonists within the party . They could annoy him , doubtless , but they could not intimidate him and certainly could not oust him . The resulting party situation would have been awkward , but it could not have been nearly so critical or cruel as that which Mr. Balfour had to face in 1903 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping up his galling fire from the outside . Yet in  --  those difficult and even humiliating circumstances Balfour preserved his equanimity and his courage , and kept up a losing fight with extraordinary spirit and an unfailing dialectical resource . - Upon his political career , this is not the time to pass a formal verdict . His record is very long , for a man of his years , and has been distinguished in the important sense that great intellectual distinction has always marked him . As a figure in Parliament , he has won the respect and often the affection of even his opponents . Lloyd George is at the antipodes of Balfour , both in spirit and methods , and the two have had many rude encounters in the Commons ; but when Mr. George introduced Balfour to a great meeting of Welshmen , some months ago , he paid a warm tribute to his abilities and his character , and said that in the House of Commons " we are all proud of him . " Too much , in fact , can not be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or for the intellectual quality which he has displayed in debate . With a mind so subtle as his and a temperament not easily kindled , he has been unable to rise to the highest and most inspiring kind of political leadership ; but he has built up a personal tradition which will not soon be forgotten , and we get a fair measure of the place he has made for himself in the public life of England when we see how hard it is to find anybody to take up his work . In selecting Mr. Bonar Law as leader in his place , the English Conservatives have , in fact , made public confession of the low estate into which their party has fallen . Mr. Law is , no doubt , a man of parts , who has made a specialty of finance , but he has not even been in the Cabinet , and his accession now to the vacant leadership can be thought of as only a makeshift , until he or somebody else develops undisputed ability to head the party . What makes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party has long claimed to be , and has been in large degree , the party of " the intellectuals . " With the Parliamentary representatives of most of the universities in its ranks , and with an undoubted majority of highly cultivated Englishmen on its side , it yet seems to have gone stale . By contrast the position of the despised Liberals appears markedly advantageous . If Mr. Asquith were to retire next week , he could be succeeded by Lloyd George or Mr. Birrell or Sir Edward Grey or Winston Churchill . If the last , by the way , had not crossed the floor of the House of Commons , he would probably by this time have made such a place for himself in the Conservative party , by his dash and popular qualities , that he would have first been turned to when Balfour resigned . " WHAT TO EXPECT OF SHAKE-SPEARE . " It was a happy choice when the British Academy asked M. Jusserand to deliver its first annual Shakespeare lecture , the printed form of which has just reached us . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Ambassador to Washington has expressed his view of the English dramatist . But the special occasion seems to have sharpened his ideas to what we would gladly believe is something like prophetic utterance . If it were not that his lecture shows the profound understanding to be expected of him , one would be tempted to call it a tour de force . The fate of Shakespeare at the hands of other distinguished French critics has too often been disastrous . While recognizing his superb poetry , men steeped in the tradition of Corneille and Racine have naturally found Shakespeare 's art sadly lacking . M. Jusserand , by a supreme act of sympathy , avoids such comparisons as futile , and enters directly into the conditions from which the plays freshly sprang , grasping at the same time the perennial urgency of Shakespeare 's appeal . In M. Jusserand are combined and tempered the two tendencies which comprise the main body of Shakespearean criticism to-day . One forces critics into the attitude of inarticulate wonder . Swmburne was affected in this way , though Mr. Watts-Dunton is perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction - unscholarly minds have pronounced Shakespeare archaic and remote from actual life . The other tendency has the greater number of thoughtful followers . Busied with stage technique in Elizabethan days , with the sources of material , with social and political gossip , and with all the other odds and ends which form the background of a period , they find it easy to explain their master as a natural product of his time . They concede , of course , that he was a genius , but urge little or nothing save the verdict of continued performances to prove that his work is bound to last . Considering the upheaval with which literary standards are threatened , we welcome M. Jusserand 's more penetrating method . He does not accept every line of Shakespeare as inspired . He deprecates his indecencies , haste , and certain scandalous inaccuracies of fact , but discovers in this very method of composition a token of human interest . In addition , he nicely appraises the quality of Shakespeare 's genius and predicts that popular regard for Shakespeare is almost sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral intent has given even his stanch admirers a deal of bother . The fate of Desdemona , of Cordeha , and of Ophelia has seemed to them to transgress a principle essential in drama  --  that virtue shall be rewarded . One helpless critic professes to believe that Desdemona was not spared because of her lie about the handkerchief . Emerson also had his misgivings . Yet Al Jusserand places Shakespeare in this matter much nearer Aristotle than many of Aristotle 's learned followers . " The great philosopher did nothing but sum up the teachings of good serse and adapt them to Greek manners . The great poet did nothing but follow the same teachings , as given him by his own sound nature , and adapt them to English wants . As both were men of genius and both were excellent observers , the one taught and the other acted in similar fashion . " Aristotle had insisted that the rational end of dramatic poetry was not to moralize , but to give pleasure ; and Shakespeare 's attitude was precisely that . The story of innocent victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any moral purpose , but not without moral effect . " It obliges human hearts to melt , it teaches them pity . " " For breaking the crust of inborn egoism , Shakespeare has , among playwrights , no equal . " The fact that his moral effect is got by the way and without conscious striving , places him in that respect with the believers in " art for art 's sake , " yet his almost constant regard for his audience has kept his productions rooted in realities . For convincing skeptics that reality in the plays is thoroughgoing , M. Jusserand is well equipped . It is not merely the fooling which seems real to him , but the vivid portraits as well . The point is worth dwelling on in these days when the principle of artistic emphasis is generally so little understood . Sticklers for realism fail to discern that their own works do not entirely square with their creed . A play , for all its modern stage devices , can never be a literal transcript of what it represents . Time flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly on the stage ; entrances and exits jump with the proper occasion ; and in many other ways it could be shown that a playwright can never escape from the need of illusion . Dialogue itself is never starkly natural : the clever sally within a person 's capability he would often not make at just the given Juncture . Hence the proper rule for a writer becomes a question of degree . M. Jusserand brings out the truth , not by stating , as many have done , that Shakespeare creates characters not as they are , but as they ought to be ; but by insisting that he catches them at their most distinctive moments , and , like the artist at the psychological instant , says , " Look ! " " There are moments when we do not look like ourselVes : such moments are often selected by photographers . " The true artist knows how to bring out that which makes individuals distinct . Because Shakespeare saw deeper into men and women than most writers , his language must be far removed from what constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered instances in a man 's life when he would admit that he had done himself justice before others . Now , this is not saying that young dramatists should at once begin to practise exalted utterance . At times Shakespeare 's influence on mediocrity has produced unmeaning bombast , from which he himself was not wholly free . But there is room for a better understanding of the artistic principle for which he stood . The serious drama of to-day lacks spiritual values , without which life can never appear complete or true . It is reassuring to get from a man like M. Jusserand the prediction that these higher beauties in Shakespeare will be more and more appreciated , even by the masses . PROFESSORIAL WRATH . There is one indictment against our colleges which Mr. Crane of Chicago might have brought forward with real effect : our college professors have forgotten , or never learned , how to quarrel . Outside of politics and baseball we have no art of controversy . We speak glibly enough of the battlefield of ideas , but how often does an abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose his temper and his manners ? And yet , if we look abroad , and back into time , we find that scholarship has never been able to dispense with a certain amount of vituperation . There is a story of a German professor who prayed : " Oh , thou Jehovah , whom that blockhead at Leipzig insists upon calling Jahveh . " He was a true descendant of the age when John Milton and Salmasius showed what extraordinary effects may be obtamed by mixing equal portions of Ciceroman Latin and billingsgate . The joy with which the men of the Renaissance seized upon the rediscovered classic literature must have been due in part to the large number of new words that were rendered available for defamatory purposes . Ideas were very real to men at that time , and were therefore worth fighting for , The scholar and gentleman is a modern - development . We speak with satisfaction of the , growing amenities of life . But it is always necessary to distinguish between true self-restraint and mere indifference . In the days when theology was concerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . quite natural to consign each other to ' perdition . But it would be absurd today for two ministers who differ in their views on boys ' clubs and model employment bureaus to devote each other to a hell in which neither one 1iel/eves . The parents of the little boy in Heine 's Gottingen , who was forbidden with the other little boy who know the genitive of mensa , were not snobs , because they thought an elementary knowledge of Latin as important as the proper way of using one 's knife and fork . In the final scheme of things it is as important that men should quarrel over the use of " It is me " as that they should over the gold standard or the commission form of government . And it is also more justifiable , to the extent that no material interests enter into the problem . When truth itself is at stake , violence ceases to be ignoble . Then it becomes evident that a man who holds erroneous views on the wing structure of the Coleoptera is capable of embezzling other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , it is one way of honoring truth to refuse to sit down at table with the man who differs from you on the use of the subjunctive in Horace . The college professor is not alone in his sin . He is only the one most conspicuously identified with the business
