txt BATTERY PARK . For More Construction and Less Destruction by the Government . To the Editor of The New York Times : The bestowal of the Battery Park on the United States military authorities to house its administrative forces is in keeping with the worst traditions of official action in this respect of this city . There seems to be neither realization nor regret at this step by those whose duty it should be to preserve the few remaining oases in the desert of . lower New York , the choicest of which will be thus obliterated forever . This endowment corresponds in fatuity with the ever to be regretted one , for the benefit also of the Government  --  the act of topographical mayhem by which as a result the Mullett proboscis was grafted upon what was previously the most becoming feature of the City Hall Tat* . In a way this act will compensate for the moment the war obsessed iconoclasts for their failure to make a " No Man 's Land " of a section of Central Park on a similar plea of patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was consummated . Did the careful " survey " of available unoccupied space in this location which we are told preceded this selection include that of the plant of the emigration service on Ellis Island , a form of activity now numbered among the nonessential industries ? Is it not possible that there might have been found available there the 350,000 square feet of floor space required for the Government 's purpose ? le it any reason for not considering this site that less " construction " and no " destruction " would result from its selection ? JOHN P. DAVIN , M. D. New York , Aug. 3 , 1918 . Mr. Bennett and the Golden Rule . To the Editor of The New York Times : Perhaps no part of the general public should blame a professional writer for multiplying words , but it does seem as If Arnold Bennett had been a bit too lavish In this respect , at a time when civilized patriots are supposed to conserve .

Turk , this ethical ( ? ) concern of Mr. Bennett strikes us as untimely , uncalled-for , and downright silly . There is very little danger that the Kaiser worshippers will receive from their enemies any damage commensurate with their criminal deserts as known to have accumulated in Belgium , Armenia , France , Russia , and Italy during the four years of Germany 's abhorrent war-making . It would be rather a matter of some value ? ethical , moral , and Christian  --  if our talented authors would devote in their newspaper contributions their special attention to the needs of the groat populations of invaded and devastated countries , in the interest of unnumbered sufferers there , and leave to the loyal armies of Christian civilization the proper adjustments which happily rest with them .

To the Editor of The New York Times : I should like to call attention to one point which seems to have escaped the attention of officials in dealing with enemy aliens . It is this : Under the existing regulations these enemy aliens , unless they are found guilty of disloyalty or of spreading propaganda , are allowed comparative freedom in their aetiops ; they are permitted to engage in business , to follow their usual occupations , &c.; This means that they are not only exempted from army service , not only do they have their lives spared , not only are they free from restraint in any shape or form , but they are actually permitted to snap tip and till ' ood positions which have been left open by loyal Americahs who have gone to the front . Is this fair ? They are not only exempted from all care and war work but actually have every advantage over Americans who have been forced by the exigencies of- war to give up positions , comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe ! Such an arrangement actually puts a premium upon enemy aliens and permits them to gain every advantage over Americans now in the field . Should not , and can not , something be done to put an end to this outrageous scheme of things ? New York , Aug. 1018 . LOYAL . The Enemy View . To the Editor of The New York Times : Ever since we went to war the Germans have said that Americans are a boorish lot , that they could never fight , they did n't know how , and never could hope , to learn . Now , le voila ! The Teuton Is justified , as he always Is . On every hand the battle fields of France are disgraced with our blundering . In every field , in every road , and forest our men break all the rules of confilaL are too violent , they have neither manner nor manners !

And did you hear of the boat on the Marne ? A nice little canvas boat it was , and a bunch of Germans were traveling to the north shore in it . with an American captive . And what did the fool do ? As sudden as a subway guarl when the fume takes fire and he cries " All out here ! " the American rocked the boat ! Into the water went everybody and back to his shore swam the idiotic Yankee , Gott strafe him ! Have we not always been told that only a fool rooks a boat ?
