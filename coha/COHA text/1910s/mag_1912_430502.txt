A REMINISCENCE of a first visit to Trouville will perhaps be admissible . Several years ago two young gentlemen started from London for a holiday in France . One of them has since become one of England 's most famous novelists ; the other , at least the author of such articles as the present . At that time funds were not too easily come by ; still there was a modest sum in pocket for the trip . The two came to Havre by the night boat from Southampton , and during the morning crossed the blue-gray estuary of the Seine to the most famous of French seaside places , sitting between its sands and its green hillside . It was in our heroes ' minds ? will the reader permit them to be so named ? ? that to Trouville had already gone the two loveliest ladies in the world ; it was their intention before taking the afternoon train to Caen to offer lunch at the Hotel de Paris to these fair creatures in a style befitting the place , the time ? it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depth of the hosts ' admiration . All this was done , yet the story , at its climax , becomes a financial rather than a sentimental one . The impulse of hospitality resulted in a pretty accurate division of the fund for traveling into two equal parts . With half , our friends paid for lunch ? a good lunch for four ? with the other half they met the expenses of a pleasant ten days ' trip through the Normandy towns and villages . Trouville is not , let it be frankly admitted at the outset , a refuge for the economically minded . After all , when you come to think of it , why should Trouville not be dear ? That is its mission in the economy of the world , its contribution to the gaiety of nations . And it has the plausible excuse of the shortest season in the world in which to make its money . Of course the guide-books and the railway-folders will tell you that the season is from June to October , but that is just not so . Doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yellow sands , and the lovely leafy country behind . The people who have villas live in them , the hotels languidly receive a few guests , toward the middle of July the Casino opens in a half-hearted kind of way , the croupiers rub a sleepy eye , the petits cheraux take a preliminary canter on their green baize field , and at the theater they perhaps give , with an indifferent company , " Les Cloches de Corneville . " Till August the season has not come . By September it has gone . The season is all in August , but , of course , it is not all of August ? that would be too absurdly long . Some one has said that Trouville is not so much a watering-place as a racemeeting . And , indeed , the height of its season , the finest frenzy of its elegance , is packed into the Grande Semaine , the grand week of the races . Even then the ultimate chic , the final cry of fashion , is to miss the first day and the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash , the pyrotechnic climax of the French summer . For long , pleasant weeks one might almost call it quiet . Then for its short . butterfly period it becomes the camp of fashion ; it is crowded , sparkling , exuberant the prettiest , gayest , most frivolous , most worldly , most innocently simple , most wisely wicked place in the world . And it is all these things because the ladies of Trouville are pretty , frivolous , and worldly , and not because the air is sparkling and the sky blue and the villas that line the sands and dot the hillside fresh and gay . It is only because women are pretty that the air is sparkling and the sky blue . Because they are adorable , the villas are fresh and gay . Because they wear lovely frocks , the horses race on their green track . Because they like the tang of salt in the air during their morning walk , the breezes blow from the open reaches of the sea . Because they like the cool kiss of water , the waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because they are , Trouville is . And the town itself is feminine , alluring , coquettish , even sometimes a little wanton . To know , to love her , you should perhaps not know her too well nor too long , not take her too seriously . Your visit should be a mere flirtation with la reine des ' doges , the queen of sands . The prettiest first glimpse of the famous plage is the one had by those who arrive by the little boat from Havre . They leave behind them the great port ? they will see it and its white cliffs from Trouville , and by night watch the glitter of its lights and the flash of its phare . The small craft crosses the estuary of the Seine ? apparently by choice in the very trough of the waves , when there are waves : this warning must be given sensitive sea-goers . To the left is the long reach that leads up the river to Rouen and Paris ; in the distance is the ancient port , Honfleur . The coast from Ionfleur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seine to barer sea-coast lands . But all along , in the dips of the hills , in the valleys where small , streams come down , the trees grow to the very water 's edge ; leafy lanes as lush and green as those of Devonshire lead down to the sands or up to the Forest of Touques , which stretches back of the hill-tops for many miles toward Pont l'Eveque ? memorable for cream-cheese . As the coast dips to the mouth of the little river Touques , it suddenly , beyond a group of black rocks ? the well-known Roches Noires ? descends to the broad expanse of line , yellow sands which lies before Trouville , and somehow the broad plage seems more wonderful and delightful for the green country that is behind it . The Touques flows into the sea between two jetties , and divides Deauville on its left from Trouville on its right . If the tide is high , the Havre boat will follow the oddly contrasting yachts and fishingboats into the river 's mouth . Otherwise it disembarks its passengers at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called , perhaps with some subtle irony , the Jetee des Anglais . Whichever landing is made , the arriving visitor , if there has not been , as the French would say , too much " balancing " upon the waves , will enjoy the prettiest view he can have of the twin town of Trouville-Deauville . Deauville , with its villas heavily embowered in their gardens , lies on a long stretch of flat country . Trouville clings on a hillside descending steeply to the place . It is smaller , more concentrated . Beyond the sands , dotted here and there with little , striped white-and-red tents , past the low inclosures of the bathing establishments where the colors of France fly so gaily from dozens of little wooden cupolas , lie the crowded line of villas , the three hotels , and the Casino ? the seafront of Trouville . Beyond , the villas climb the hillside and add to its greenness their red , their blue , their white , and yellow . It constantly happens to the Englishwriting admirer of things Continental that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely embodies the description for which we struggle in dozens taken from our own inadequate tongue . For Trouville , for example , there is one which sounds with great vivacity in our Anglo-Saxon ears . The place is " all that there is of most coquet . " That says it ; it says that it is brisk and gay , and pretty and fresh , and trim and trig , and piquant and adorable.  |p490  It tells about the flowers in the windowboxes , and the red-and-white curtains at the windows , and the bright , golden sands , and the fairest of their sex who bathe there -- it tells , in short , that Trouville is coquet , and it almost convinces one that to be coquet is the whole duty of any watering-place on the ocean 's edge . A little fleet of yachts , with clean , white-painted hulls , spotless sails , shining brass-work , and well-scrubbed decks , is always in summer lying in the small harbor of Trouville . Where better could it be ? Where could a sailing-master or an owner take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greener , crisper vegetables , tenderer chiekens , or prettier women ? And when breezes blow , in what safer , gayer haven could one lie ? Where , if one is forced to put up with them , are the diversions of land-lubbers more diverting ? It is true that the harbor is inadequate and that geographically Trouville is not especially well situated for cruising . But what does that matter ? The little port on the Touques may not be good for yachting ; it is very good for yachts and yachtsmen . The pretty craft are always lying in the bassio . Some fly the tricolor and belong to France . Others are from England , and have crossed the Channel when " Cowes Week " was over . The Union Jack is a friendly flag in France now , and the Stars and Stripes have always floated easily in French breezes . Both flap luxuriously in these soft , fashionable airs . Easy wicker-chairs sit on soft rugs  |p492  beneath gay awnings . Dapper , wise servants move softly to and fro . And pretty women look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said in justification of a yacht at Trou-ville ? It is a pleasure when setting down a sentence in praise of the fair sex to think in what cordial agreement would have been one of the earliest famous figures in the town 's history , the elder Dumas . The familiar story of his arrival of a May afternoon in the ' 30 's is a cheerful anecdote . Laughing loudly , he crossed the Touques , carried on the shoulders of a sturdy Norman peasant , and entered the primitive little inn of those early days with all the clatter and excitement which usually distinguished his movemeats . La mere Oseraie , the good woman who kept told him flatly that she received none but painters ? the Trouville of those days was a tiny fishingvillage which only a few artists had discovered . Dumas promptly alleged that he was a " painter in words , " and even offered to paint ? or write- - her signboard , which the other clients ? ungrateful dogs ? had promised but neglected to do . This handsome though confusing evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive Dumas at the amazing price of two francs a day . lout coinpris . Trouville was indeed then what the French term un petit troa pas cher --  a little hole not dear . " When the painters , friends whom Dumas had come to see in their remote  |p493  corner , returned toward evening from the green woods and glades along the little river 's valley , they found the amiable giant filling the inn with his cries and laughter , and brandishing a great spoon in the kitchen , where he was presiding personally over the preparation of an evening meal which promised to run his bill for extras into figures hitherto unknown in Trouville . There is nothing ' now at Trouville , as there is nothing at Etretat ? another famous artistic foundation ? to suggest these early days of bohemianism , of painters in blouses , of simple country living , of Dumas shouting in loud gaiety as he watched the plump chickens turning on the spit ; nothing but the memories and the lovely country whose loveliness caught and held those first visitors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , few and faint as they are , are worth cherishing . There is romance in the thought that that lovely , unhappy Empress Eugenie fled from France by way of France 's gayest port of the sea . And there is a queer , pathetic note of the grotesque in the figure of the American dentist who made her flight possible . Also for those who would not consider an excursion partly pedestrian too plebeian to he attempted at Trouville , there are other memories of a still earlier day hidden in the green Forest of Touques . Beyond Villerville , clustered beneath its stark Calvaire ; beyond Criquebceuf , with its tiny church hidden beneath an ivy centuries old , a little road to the right leads up a smiling valley of orchards to the deep woods where is the lovely spring they call the Fontaine Virginie . It lies in a crystal pool at the foot of a great tree , upon the trunk of which the young Alfred de Musset and the young Sainte-Benve once carved their names . Near by in a remote , almost mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick rhododendron hedges , is " Le Chalet , " one of the first villas to be built along this coast . It belonged to Tiric Guttinguer . In it Pe Musset often stayed , and he and his host must many times have gone down the hillside to that cool , clear well . Once it had been called La Fontaine Rouge , but they had renamed it Virginie in memory of the adored creature who had been Guttinguer 's wife . May not one imagine that when a young poet in those brave days of the Romantic Revival dramk this limpid water from the hollow of his hand , it was as if he dipped a draught from the Pierian spring ? It is the fashion with the satirists to say that the one thing necessary to the real chic of Trouville is a successful ignoring of the sea , its uses , its very presence You are told that when he sits to observe the crowd on les planches ( the boards laid flat on the sands which make the chief Trouville promenade ) , the truly Parisian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea which persists so impertinently at high tide in creeping up toward the town . He is oblivious , it is asserted , of the blue skies , the soft airs , even of the summer moon . Yet , despite the satirists , Trouville is a bathing-place . Even iii the Church of Notre Dame de Bon Secours the chief ecclesiastical function of the summer is the Grande Messe des Baigneurs ? the Bathers ' Mass . And everywhere in France there is still a lingering note of the days when sea baths were definitely taken for the health . The resorts along the coast announce themselves primarily as bathing-places , and where , in America , one boy asks another on a fine morning if he is going to have a swim , in France he inquires , " Alllez-Loos prendre no bait de vier ? " But if there is at Trouville a certain serious and business-like quality in the phrases concerning the bath , there is happily nothing of that sort in the operation itself . The arrangements for the bathers are primitive and inadequate enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bathing-houses fluttering their flags from their little cupolas look gay and inviting . There are a few odd canvassided eabines de lure which can be wheeled down to the water 's edge , but beyond the pleasure which the words de luxe always give , they have few advantages over the simpler accommodation . The short walk down the sands is pleasant enough , and in any case any outrage to modesty is prevented by the almost inflexible French rule of draping one/ self in a flowing white peignoir for the brief transits to and from the water 's edge . At the water 's edge the rule ceases , and it depends somewhat upon your standards whether you consider that outrage then begins . For many years , at least during the summer , the vogue of the Parisian illustrated papers outside of France has depended largely upon their pictures of the Parisienne disporting herself in the wave . There is something ? at Trouville it can not be denied ? in the way of knotting a kerchief around the head , and of turning a sailor-collar low upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wouldbe frequenter of Continental planes may expect his American eyes at first to be surprised , perhaps a little shocked . But dress is at best largely a convention , a matter of custom and habit , and the eye grows accustomed to any costume . When the tide , either in the sea or in fashionable life , is a little low , there is other business of importance upon the yellow plage . Even the smartest people may have children , and wherever in France children look across the Channel toward that till lately so perfidious Albion , they build castles , moats , dig intrenchments in the sands , and stand ready to repel invasion . And French parents participate with much gravity in this work , supervising and actively aiding in the military operation . Statisticians and theorists always say there are not enough children in France ; they could scarcely pretend there are not enough at the seaside . And those who feel that the light - hearted and wicked race of Parisians are incapable of the ordinary family affections and joys would do well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning a glacis , and building up a bastion from the sands of Trouville for some absurdly small child in a red jersey suit . Sand castles are a very dignified and imposing thing as they are built by competent engineers upon the coasts of France . There is a competition yearly in this art at the Roches Noires end of the Trouville place , and last summer the prize-winner flew the Stars and Stripes from its topmost escarpment ? an international honor gained by American children which must not go uncelebrated . The sands are naturally the resort , too , of such excursionists as come to Trouville for the day . These are mostly from Havre ; the Parisians find the trip so long that they have time to do little more than address picture postcards in some cafe convenient to the station , lunch heavily , and hurriedly regain the train for the return , without as much as catching a glimpse of blue water . The Havrais have more time . They undoubtedly contribute to the picture a bourgeois note . Perhaps the moment has come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one , always , at Trouville is beautiful and of the highest fashion . It may as well be confessed that , for example , in early autumn a strange , inferior race , locally termed les Septembreurs , appears at Trouville , with the ignoble hope of enjoying the great natural advantages of the place at the reduced prices of the arriere saison . All this flecks perhaps the bright perfection of the plane , and yet there are compensations . Any reader who is an amateur of the minor , more humorous joys of life is asked ? what , for example , could be pleasanter to see upon any beach than three French widows , in bonnets and heavy crepe veils , wading gravely with skirts well pulled up above stout , red ankles ? If , as might well be , they were accompanied along the water 's edge by a young priest and his cousin , a soldier ? both sons of the waders ? the picture would be even pleasanter and more French . Much , indeed , might be written of wading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributory not only to pleasure but to health . It must suffice , however , to recall one picture caught soon after sunrise from a hotel window overlooking the sands ? a gaunt , virginal figure , lady perhaps afflicted by that delightfully vague French ill , mal aux pieds , who in the pursuance doubtless of some regime , stood solemnly a half-hour each morning in two inches of water like an ancient and withered crane ; some estimable and overworked governess , perhaps , who presented ibis odd contrast to the frolicsome and idle of her sex who could later claim the plane . If you do not bathe , or even if you  |p496  do , you pass a part of the morning in the rue de Paris . The rue de Paris is the drawing-room , the salon of Trouville . It is a preposterous , unworthy , short little street , lined with tiny shops which have nothing much to recommend them beyond their supreme expensiveness . Still , he jewels are at least fairly good , and it is only right that a gentleman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to stifle it . Perhaps , upon reflection , the shops do serve their purpose . And occasionally they display quite worthy wares ? there was last summer a lap-dog 's kennel of brocade and satin and gold lace which was a very masterpiece of folly . However , any pretext of an errand is enough to bring people for a stroll in the rue de Paris of a morning . As a matter of fact , no pretext is nowadays needed , and the crowd is often so great that the stroll is not possible . The street is filled with cheerful , chattering groups . One talks the scandal of , and makes the arrangements for , the day . And even if you know no scandal , or have no arrangements , it is still possible to be content viewing this singularly animated , singularly French scene . There are plenty of foreigners at Trouville , but the place is intensely French , more so in many ways than Paris itself . The capital is overrun constantly by barbaric hordes , by swiftly passing tourists , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trouville 's foreigners , especially the female barbarians , have purchased their clothes in the rue de la Paix , and have brought them to the rue de Paris because they believe they can wear them as well as Frenchwomen . And the male barbarians are attired in that gout anglais which is now the possession of all gentlemen in the west of Europe . The new cosmopolitanism of fashion and wealth has accomplished wonders in the way of uniformity which are nowhere better to be seen than in this small street ? Englishwomen who look French , and Frenchmen who look English ? the things once thought impossible . Yet the resultant flavor , its " smartness " at any rate , its charm , its chic , are strongly French . Indeed , the final confession which is wrung from the foreign observer of Trou- ville is that France invented " chic , " and that the French , above all races , can give that indefinable note which we recognize at once as the authentic one of fashion . Probably last summer all over the world ladies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat of white felt . But nowhere , it may safely be asserted , was the brim bent just as it was at Trouville , with exactly that hint of feigned rusticity , that sophisticated curve , that shy , false droop over the charming face of the twentieth-century Parisienne playing at villagiatura , arec ce chic , enfin ! Chic is chic ; it is not dependent on anything but chic . The restaurant where you lunch ? early , before going to the racescould not , for example , compare in size or in actual splendor with hundreds along the coasts on both sides of the Atlantic . But there is something in the way it looks out through a glass front upon the forecourt of the hotel , and past a pleasant terrace with wicker chairs and tables under red umbrellas and parterres of flowers , and the inevitable " Bar Americain , " to the sands and the blue-green sea beyond . There is a special polish to the glasses on the tables , an extra whiteness to the linen , and a manner all its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chic in the white canvas of the ceiling , with red designs appliques thereon . There is something about the way waiters swiftly bear the best and most expensive food in the world to the loveliest ladies . There is something in the way that gallant sportsmen and clubmen des plus chic pay the bills and adore the ladies . There is something about it all so smart and so agreeable that it just can not be described . Nor can the races be described . There is the pretty , green course at Deauville , beyond the villas in their leafy gardens , and this side of the course where one plays " le golf-links . ' There is the crowd , the hullabaloo ; there are the fiacres , the motors , the American millionaires , the visiting English milords , the stage celebrities , the princes of the blood of Spain , Portugal , and Bulgaria , the young rajahs and sultans of the East , there are the touts and tipsters and the gentlemen of the pari-inutuel and the totalisateur who take your bets , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lent , brisk races which these good equine creatures run . The racing is good . The secret of Trouville has been hinted at earlier ; the reader already guesses that in the ultimate analysis the sport is good just because the ladies who frequent the races are lovely . The races ? it was confessed earlier that it would be difficult to describe them , but it has possibly been hinted how agreeable they are , and in what a good mood one drives back to sip " le five-o'clock " on the terrace of the Casino while the band plays , and afterward to risk a few louis at the petits chevaux or baccarat before it is time to dress for dinner . It is not time for dinner till well beyond eight . Yet even at a far more advanced hour the Trouville night is still young . Indeed , both by day and night the casinos of French watering-places hope to distract the visitor 's attention from the unsophisticated beauties of the landscape and the sea to an extent which will at least prevent his feeling himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays succeed one another in the theater of the Casino , and the first artists of Paris are pleased to combine business with pleasure by a short Trouville season . Dancing goes on , and in the afternoons an occasional bal d'enfants shows how much more prettily even than French dolls French children may be dressed . A band is generally playing upon the terrasse , and its music gathers a crowd upon les planches and upon the free seats in minor , more ignoble little cafes below , a humbler crowd which is agreeable to gaze down upon from the smart , gay terrace above . And within , in spacious salles de jeu , there are always the little horses . It would be pleasant to write about the tea-shop , so smartly and so comically called Le The Topsy , and to meditate. chuckling , upon the French appreciation of our English . and American customs and our language . It would be more delightful to talk of motor excursions . and tea at the fantastic inn of William the Conqueror at Dives , where the Middle Ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la Paix , and made into a kind of historical annex to the Trouville Casino . It would be agreeable to comment upon " le sport " in its various forms , " le lawn-tennis , " " le golf links , " and " le yachting , " upon " le bridge " as well . But Trouville , after all , is the sands , the promenade , and the Casino . The exclusive villa life may be important , with its five-o'clecks , its garden parties , and its many gaieties . But the throng and bustle of the rue de Paris is more authentically the Trouville note . It is in this informal democratic elegance that the famous plage seems to extend its warmest welcome to the stranger . Most nations of strangers avail themselves of the welcome . Even Germans , who so long have sighed for France , occasionally venture to the Normandy shore . And it is darkly hinted that their emperor 's darling wish is to combine that desired trip to the French capital with a visit to Trouville , to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of universal peace ? and pleasure . Once at least every one in the world should see race-week at Trouville , should lounge along the front between the bluegreen sea and the villas , should see the horses ? big and little ? and should at least have money in his pocket to buy dinner for a fair companion . Every one , after all , should have some pleasure in his life .  |p498
