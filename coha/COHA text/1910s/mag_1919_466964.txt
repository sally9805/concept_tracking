WHEN the question of the " ruthless submarine campaign " was put to the world by Germany in the opening months of 1917 there was at first no answer , and the Black Weeks followed . By and by the weeks grew not so black , because the world was beginning to find answers . And as the months moved on , more and more answers were found ? answers flung down to the U-boats from the whirring skies and up from the broken waters ; answers dragged from the sterns of old salt-crusted trawlers ; answers dropped in round black cans from the taffrails of scouts and chasers and patrols and de- stroyers sweeping like a cloud round the coasts of Europe ; answers carried into the teeth of a wind of steel at Zeebrugge and Ostend . But of all the answers given to the pirate , the con voy was the compelling and authoritative answer . And the heart and meat of the convoy is " contact . " I have stood by at the making of more than a few contacts , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the deck of a crowded troopship I have seen the destroyers wheeling out of nowhere , swiftly , silently , dropping down from every quarter of an iron sky-line like small gray snowbirds , to swoop along the cheering flanks . Or standing on the bridge of one of those same destroyers , I have seen the foodships coming over the horizon in the dawn , a wide-flung line of ships like an army advancing upon us under a red banner of smoke . I have seen ships growing like ghosts in the midnight , lines andcolumns of mysterious , great steel ships towering against the stars beyond our rails where a moment ago no ships were . And I remember arfother , a most impossible contact , made with a most im-patient man , on a morning full of snowwhite rainbows . It was a brilliant day , as brilliant as a morning on the tablelands of Colorado , and we were coming out of France . Yesterday we had arrived there , de-. stroyers from the American flotilla , herding home the queerest , the ragged-. est , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( perhaps ) has ever seen . And to-day we were steaming out of the harbor 's gullet again , or rather pouring out of it at any number of revolutions per minute , to have dealings with this most impatient man . " Twenty-three hours ahead of schedule ? " the tale of him ran . And still he was not content . One could picture him out there in the bald immensity of the sea , Something Somebody , D. S. 0 . , R. N. R. , shaking his head and putting his shoulders down , " driving her home " through the last five hundred of the long thousands of miles out of Sydney and Calcutta and the China coast . One had a vision of the stokers sweating in the bellies of the big steamers ; one seemed to hear the things they had to say in their dungeons about that self-willed , headlong old fellow tramping the top-side of the flagship along the line . " Thirty - one hours ahead of sched-ule ? " By day and by night the tale of his impetuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through admiralties and lesser admiralties , commanders-in-chief and lesser commanders , all the way down to us , resting over for a bit of breath and oil and potatoes at somebody else 's port . " Thirty - three hours ahead of sched-ule ? " The Executive began to do things ! The Navigator said , " He 's got the smell of the beach in his nose , that ' Limey ' sailor-man , " and retired into the charthouse with a pencil . The Owner got up and put on his old pants and his windproof shirt , and , climbing to the bridge , began to talk with all the flags and blinkers his quartermaster had . And after that we came rolling out of France to try conclusions with this Flying Britishman ; to guide , counsel , and defend him ; to make his path , not straight , but by a good sight yet more devious ; and in general to weigh him down and hold him up and drag him back till the ways of the Admiralty might make themselves manifest . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fine , bright , crystal one . The headlands hung over us for a moment , raw cliffs breaking down under a burden of green . Lighthouses gave back the sun like snow , and the sun ran over the colored sails of sloops creeping home from fishing-banks where very queer fish indeed have come to school , and over the grimy " dazzle-paint " of coastwise Frenchmen straggling to the northward under the tutelage of torpedo-boats quite as French and quite as grimy . And away above our heads it ran with a soft luminosity over the ghost of a tiny something in the blue , like the wraith of a cigar wrapped smoothly in a phantom of silver foil ? a patrolling " Blimp " bound southward on a lofty highroad of the sky . All of them went away . The coast crept down to lie on the world 's rim , a faint , blue bastion of cloud , and the ocean took us up . An incredible peace lay over the water . The destroyers , formed in order of cruising now , kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swimming onward over the sky-colored sea . They run low , these boats , like hounds on a scent . Watching them even in the broad white light of day , one has a sense of stealth , of something secret and swift and bladelike , " at sight and gone again . " In the sky they leave no stain . Being so lean of body , their wakes are hardly more than pale , taut threads stretched back across the water . They seem to make no effort , exert no power ; their progress is unstrained , unhurried , almost lazy . Only the race of foam along their mottled flanks and the seas breaking over their bows at ordered intervals , to drown them , decks and houses and guns and all , in glittering drifts of foam , hint at the hungry pace theyare holding , hour after hour , all day long . It was a fine sight , a brave sight , but somehow , all of a sudden , quite meaningless . Why were we here , where were we going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling sometimes in weather like this , when the simple fact of an enemy becomes incredible . It is easier to believe in him at night , especially when the radio begins to chatter , dotting and dashing its tragic gossip of ships j going down just here and just there beyond the dark . It is easier to conjure him up in heavy weather , when huge , dark , misty shapes drive down the wind and the broken water is full of the shadows of things . It is easier in a fog . But with the whole blue sky above one and the whole blue sea spreading away like a dancing floor , and a pretty wind blowing and everything right , the old habit of one 's mind will come back again and the ocean is the open road . I mentioned this to the Assistant Navigator . We were leaning on the rail of the bridge , looking down along the deck , like an iron sidewalk stretching away in perspective to what seemed a i great distance , rolling lazily between its snowy borders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , torpedo-tubes and potato-bins , a lifeline and a blacksmith 's shop and an extremely seasick steward . Men picked their way along this iron causeway , ratings and petty officers , all in their dingy sea-rigs , and all on this fine day trussed up in their wadded life-belts . On the bridge behind us four bundled figures at as many corners stared out steadily at as many quarters of the shining water . Over our heads there were other watchers leveling binoculars in the crow's-nest , and still others aft . Under our feet , on the chart-room deck , the gun crews waited hour after hour , as they had waited watch by watch , week by week , for the sound of a certain gong . I heard that gong once , and I shall not soon forget the sound of it , nor the sudden tumult of footfalls ringing on hollow decks , the flicker of blue and gray and white pelting across the bright rectangle beyond the wardroom door , the ponderous swing of a painted gun , torpedo-tubes wheeling outboard like hungry reapers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fans , the rattle and cough of speaking-tubes as they reported , station by station , up to the waiting bridge . But that was weeks ago , and nothing came of it ; to-day was another day . God was in His heaven and all was right with the world . I said to the Assistant Navigator : " There are n't any , you know . Not really . " " How 's that ? " " U-boats . " He was a tall , blond , good-Looking fellow with a workable , sea-wise head and a large importing business back in Philadelphia . " We crossed the course of one , " he said , " about an hour ago . There are either two or three working up the bay , somewhere abreast of Bordeaux . Three big ones are coming out over the top of Ireland , and one was reported early this morning off the Scillys , damaged and making for home . " " Yes , " I said . " Oh yes . " He put his other elbow on the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And better than you do . I 've been out here for ? well , a good many months , at sea about all the while , bringing in convoys of all sorts in all sorts of weather , fair and foul and I have n't had a peek at one of them not yet . And some-times , as you say ? " The voice-tube from the crow's-nest was coughing . The lookouts behind us took it up , and a quartermaster passed it on : " Life-boat bottom up on the port side , sir . Coming abreast , sir , close aboard . " A gull was sitting on the keel . " But that sort of thing , now , " said the Assistant Navigator , inclining his head . " Yes , " I had to admit . Some time later we passed through a field of wreckage , broken boxes , bales of water-logged stuffs , half a chair , half a raft , a stove-in oil-cask scrawling an iridescent will and testament across the waters . But not all of these homely and disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poignantly as had that lonely life-boat an hour ago , with the little lace of wavelets playing around the dead garboards and the drownedplanks blurring off and down into the green , and that pale creature resting on the keel and gazing at us , as we towered past , with unmoved , incurious eyes . Weather came on with the dusk . We did without a sunset that evening ; night ran over us , black and thick , and the sea picked up with an amazing speed . Standing on , plunging and beaten , all the rest of the squadron lost to sight in the welter , we took what came . And what came was gray-white in the dusk , heavy and staggering and full of thunder . It must be remembered that a destroyer is not built for comfort in a seaway . She is built sharp and long like a pencil , or like a knife-blade standing on edge . Any boat whose beam is less than a tenth of her water-line length is bound to roll , and a destroyer is like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward of the beam that night , we i also pitched . And it was wet . Even on the bridge , two decks up , glassed in forward and roofed with a canvas awning , even there it was very wet . The bridge of a destroyer , it may be said in passing , is neither so elaborate nor so large as the bridge of a battle-ship . To-night in the gathering darkness it was like a little balcony hung out to toss on the black bosom of a gale , a place of silence hemmed in by storm . The heads and shoulders of the watchers showed dimly in silhouette on the strip between weather-cloth and awning , motionless , wordless , some of them , some of them pacing back and forth over the streaming deck . One knew them as much by touch as by sight . . . . There was the officer of the deck , Lieutenant Z. , one generation out of Rome , enthusiast in geared turbines , hermaphrodite hanjoes , and the French language , a thoroughgoing navy man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 here was Ensign G. , just out of the Academy , ambitious , respectful , a little self - conscious , perhaps , in the presence of the ship , and at the moment more than a little ill . And there was a chief quartermaster , boyish and grave , a chief gunner 's mate with a face for weather , a boatswain 's mate or so , four seamen in the watch-stations , and in the center of the stage the helmsman , swaying to the buck and roll of the deck , his muffled torso dimly mutilated by the shadow of the wheel where the little yellow eye of the compass-light looked through at him . And there were others , too . They came and went mysteriously , bringers of reports , shadowy reliefs , shades bearing endless bits of paper from the radioroom to be held for a brief instant under the binnacle 's glow . And there were yet others . Groping about , I came upon a figure in rough clothes sitting on the flag-locker , out of the way . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a great deal about Commander S. before I knew him . Since coming aboard I had heard a great deal more from his own officers , and it was all in the same strain . He is the kind of man who will make a navy . In physical appearance he is not cut , let us say , for a mythical hero . He is rather a short man , with a brownish face , a baldish head , calm , blue-gray eyes , and a thoughtful , slow , good-natured voice . He never " rows . " He never scowls . He never indulges in what the English call " grousing . " He is never visibly racked by the agony of decision . He is one of those ideal commanders of men whose subordinates always seem to be doing the whole thing ? and doing the whole thing mysteriously well . He uses homely curse-words . He used one now . It was his last trip in this destroyer . When we returned to base he was to be detached and sent home with a nucleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger one . And ever since he had led his squadron out , a week or so ago , he had been much on deck , prowl-ing about the rails with a certain alert and wistful light in his eye . " Daggone it ! " . said he , out of the blank . We were leaning over the rail , staring down at nothing in particular . " Daggone id " said he . " I 'd like to get one this trip . " " Maybe you will , " said 1 . " Maybe . " A tongue of spray licked over the search-light platform from the weather side . We rubbed it out of our eyes . After a moment the captain went on . " A man does n't like to go back ? well ? empty-handed . " " Empty-handed ? " " You know what I mean . " " You mean that you have n't got ' a submarine . " " I have n't seen one . " " There are n't so many of them to see or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Partly that . And then they do n't work in the same way . You do n't catch them on the surface now . They do n't stand up like they used to . In this convoy game , now ? " " I understand , Captain . You 've been in this convoy game for a long while , and you 've brought in a power of ships , first and last . " " Yes , a good many . " " And out of them all you have n't lost one ? not a single ton ? " " Not in convoy . No , that 's right . " " And there are n't so many subma-rines , somehow , and they do n't stand up as they used tD . And France has not been ' bled white . ' England has not been ' starved into submission within six months . ' The American army , which could n't possibly get across , has got across . " " Oh yes . We do that , all right . We do bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious comment . After a moment I heard him say : But it does n't make much of a story to tell . " It seemed to me to make a deal of a story to tell . Clambering down to the main deck , by and by ( on ladders which seemed , for the moment , to have gone out of their senses ) , I stood in the lee of the forecastle-head with the life-line tucked under my arm . We were running blind , black overhead , black as the pit underfoot . Nowhere was there any sign of life , no sound beyond the rush of the seas and the wailing snore of the blowers . The visible ship ran only a few yards away before the night blotted it our . A profound sense of loneliness came down , a feeling of isolation and helplessness in the presence of wind and water and steel . It seemed impossible , for the moment , to remember that the superstructure towering over my head was alive with watching men ; that behind my back , beyond a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath of light , with the chairs lashed to the table-legs , and an ensign sleeping in a sling on the starboard transom , dreaming of " June Week , " perhaps , at the Academy . It was bard to realize that the whole trembling , hollow fabric beneath the boot soles was a blaze of light , once one had penetrated that immaculate shell of blackness ? mess-decks going down and down in the sharp bows , boys from my town and your town asleep in their hammocks with their arms crooked over their eyes ; and the deep fire-rooms , where the men watching the dials and the air-pressures and the white-hot sprays moved in a very company of their own images , cast back from oil-filmed metal ; and the engine-rooms , other men in other rocking caverns of light , keeping watch and ward over the huge thrust of the turbines , the whining dynamos , the condensers , pumps , cups , gauges , dials , gongs . And all of them , through all the bright core of that black shell , sleeping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the one end . Out in the ocean night , it was still the same . Away under the black wind to the right of us , away to the left , here and there on quarter and beam , still other dark shells were rushing through the night , silent each of them , save for the pound of the seas and the long overtone of the blowers , blind , save for the one little hooded gleam shining out from the compass 's face , keeping their invisible stations mile after mile , hour after hour , by some kind of a sixth sense of seamanship which would have seemed a miracle in the old days . And all to the one end ? that the course might be laid down straight and the speed told off true , that at a certain hour on a certain day , in a latitude and longitude appointed , the foodships or the troopships should not fail to find the escort , in sun or gale or fog , waiting to fetch them in . Yes , it seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story that has not been told enough . The British have spoken habitually of their navy as " the Silent Navy " or " the Fleet in the Mists . " If that is true for them , it is tenfold truer for us . If they got very little news in the papers , at least they did have their CXXXVIII. ? No. 826. - 62men home now and then to tell the unwritten tale ; one saw the broad caps and the stripes of the Three Victories in the streets of all the towns , and if there was but one other traveler in the railway compartment , he was an officer of the R. N. R. But when our navy men embarked for overseas , they went out into a silence and a mist which were to last " for the duration . " They went out , a great part of them , from ' offices and mills , gangplows and herdsman 's saddles ; in training-barracks they licked into shape as fast as they could with luck and the grace of God and ninety-nine parts of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fouled lines and drove the pitiful handful of veteran officers to the brink of distraction . But , bungling and fouling and grumbling and laughing and driven to the brink of distraction , they did somehow manage to " pull it off " ; to get their squadrons to sea in any kind of weather , to make their contacts with an invariable and miraculous precision , and , running dark on the flanks of blind convoys , to bring the troops and the guns and food to harbor in a way which no navy on water has ever excelled . It was at night , going on toward twelve . For a great many hours we had been groping through a fog ; it lay now like a smothering blanket on the sleeping sea . Tn the wardroom three or four of us were " standing by , " with the help of coffee and sandwiches . The talk had got around to submarines ( German ones ) and their commanders . The circumstance which had brought this subject before us was this . We had all been reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure whose suc-cessive instalments came to us on the bridge , in the chart-room , the wardroom , wherever the radio messenger chanced to find us ? chapters scrawled on bits of paper , worded briefly , as they had come out of code : " From Trawler So-and-so ' to C. in C. ; one six four five B. S. T. " Submarine damaged and unable to submerge . This north , that west , course Something or Other true . Jim in pursuit . " " From C. in C. to U. S. S. ' Umpteen , ' one six five seven B. S. T. " Submarine on surface in this north , that west , ' So-and-so ' in pursuit , standing Something or Other true . Proceed all speed . " " From U. S. S. ' Umpteen ' to C. in C. .. . " So they ran , fragments of a swift drama playing itself out on another sea , whispers picked out of the vast web of whispers weaving the zone . At dinnertime we had U. S. S. " Umpteen " winging an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present course and bearing ? " Before the cheese was done with , " So-and-so " had " lost contact with submarine , " only to regain it and lose it still again with the lighted pipes . Mystery crossed the far-off stage in theper-son of one H. M. S. " Anonymous . " The role of H. M. S. " Anonymous " was never made quite clear . The whole action began to grow dim , lapsing into longer and longer silences . There came one line out of the gathering shadows : " From C. in C. to U. S. S. ' Umpteen ' . . Return to base . " It had the ring of a swan-song . " Oh , I bet he 's sore ! " the Executive promised us . " You know Smith . Well , that 's Smith in the Umpteen . ' And he needs a nice ' sub . ' right now to hang on the wall . And just when it 's all fixed fine , Mr. Sub . on top of the water , Mr. Trawler baying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred knots an hour , bristling all over with guns and tubes and bombs and Smith ? why , just then something happens ? maybe the night or a piece of fog . . ? . Oh , they 'll do it sometimes . " The little New York Irishman leaned as far back as his chair-lashing would let him and shook his head . " Just when you think you 've got them dead to rights , why , sometimes ? you have n't . " But we were not through with that drama yet . The plot was to turn yet one more corner . Long after sunset one lone , last cry crept through the dusky heavens , our old friend trawler " So-andso " resurrected , most amazingly resurrected , and calling for help . " Have expended all depth charges . . . . Am in need of assistance ! " That was all . Whether the desired assistance were of an offensive or a defensive nature we were not to know . Whether the valiant " So-and-so " ever received it remained a mystery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tangled give-and-take of the sky . Like some good stories , it had no ending ? or rather , the ending was to be revealed long afterward , a chance foot-note read into the gossip of an Irish railway compartment . The man had been there himself , an officer on that very craft , the shadowy ship " So-and-so . " They had found the quarry yet another time in the growing night , but he had managed by that to patch himself up enough to submerge . Standing over him , they had " given him all they had " ? " expended all their depth charges " as by the letter of the text . They had been rewarded by pools of oil welling up to stain the surface . Nothing else . And so , seeing that oil may mean any one of a dozen things , the tale still wants an ending , after all . . . . But the Executive was going on , over the midnight coffee and sandwiches . " Yes , " he said , casting hack to his remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you the slip . But not like they used to . Lord , no ! It 's a harder game now , and , besides , they have n't got the men ? not the kind of men they used to have . " The Navigator got his elbows on the table . " Not like Ushant Pete , ' " he put in . " I guess not ! You do n't find this later crop of commanders standing up to a convoy , much less taking the big gamble , running wild through the bunch , up and down the lines , till tengood ships are under . Not any more ! Those men are dead now . " " There used to be four good ones . " The Navigator , the only officer remaining on board out of the destroyer 's original complement , grew reminiscent . " There was ' Kelly , remember , and ' Ushant Pete ' ? " As I listened to them turning over the names of a new mythology , it occurred to me as a tragic thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KapitiinLeutnants and the Ober-Leutnants of the submarine campaign had soiled their hands with crimes that even the teller of tales can not bring himself to forget . The blood of children , of women and of wounded men , runs like a crimson blight over the whole adventurous tradition , and for once we have been given enemies of whom it is hard to make heroes . It is too had . For some of them have had qualities . The men talking around the table to-night were seamen and fighters , and there was no attempt to hide the depth of their admiration for the seamanship and the courage of the piratical dead . They know the devil as well as you or I , but far better than you or I or any landsman , they know the hell he lives in . Out of that rambling midnight tale of " the four good ones " I call back the huge , mist-drawn figure of a " Kelly . " What the real name was of this fabled captain of the lower deeps it would be hard for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as " Kelly " that the coasts of Ireland knew him in life , and it is the ghost of " Kelly " that i roams there now in the pale company of the dead . Who knows but that in the shadows out there beyond the spark of Gaunt Lightship one yet might come upon the wraith of him , heaving to in his phantom boat to " listen in " on the Admiralty 's late news , interrupting when it pleased him with a weightless key , applauding , quarreling as of old , pointing out with a facetious acrimony chance errors in the construction of the King 's English , winging soundless threats , bombastic challenges , mocking adieus . Or perhaps in the windy heart of a night one might glimpse him stealing up from an old remembered landingplace , or striding once again , a huge , imponderable shade , over the hills and beaches running down to the Old Head of Kinsale , or , dressed in stolen clothes , consuming a chop in the unsuspecting brightness of a Dublin eating-house . Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a last refuge , the tale grows fabulous . But there can he no doubt that there have been exploits and wanderings andmissions beyond the strangeness of fiction , hair-breadth escapes . high adventures ? like the record of the commander of a sunken submarine who was rescued " with a bill in his pocket bearing the three-day-old receipt of Glasgow 's leading hotel . Before I turned in that night I climbed to the bridge for a last look at the night . It was not much to look at . We swam in a chamber of mist shot with the faint pearl of half a moon riding somewhere in the lost sky . The Executive had come up with me . He never slept in his stateroom at sea , but got what sleep he could in the chart-room transom , where " two jumps " would have him out if the youngsters needed him in the night . I asked him when he thought we should be closing in with our friend , the most impatient man . " Oh , about dawn ! " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But see here ! If this fog holds on ! " I 'm sure it had the sound of a protest . " Yes , " he said . " It ' 11 need a little luck . " Luck ! It was absurd ! The ocean is a big place , a vast , bald , monotonous waste of an empty place where no roads run and no finger-boards stand up to point the way . And in a fog ! Luck ! . . When a British squadron went out to the west of Ireland and picked up the first American naval expedition within an hour of the time appointed , the Admiralty radio rewarded them with a quick " Well done ! " commemorating an exploit . And that was a contact of two wide scouting-lines sighting each other in the broad , clean light of day . I said as much to the Executive . " Oh yes , " he allowed me . " As I said , it needs a little luck , especially in this sort of weather . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in plenty of time . " When I got out of the wardroom door in the following dawn , I found the cloud still lying heavy on the sea . The sun must have heaved clear of the invisible horizon as I climbed to the bridge , for , looking out from under the starboard awning , I beheld a rainbow , white as the curve of a snow-drift and so close at hand beyond the rail that it seemed one co d have fished up a pot of very pale hal ) gold indeed with a twenty-five-cent bamboo pole . And thinking of that , I observed for the first time that the sea no longer boiled and tumbled away along the water-line , but it passed us slowly , almost lazily . And the endless song of the blowers had come to an end . I looked about me . In the pearly twilight under the awning the bridge seemed unusually populous for that hour , and unusually still . I found the captain " taking the air " on the flaglocker , a corned-beef sandwich in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've cut down speed ? " I suggested , with a rising inflection . He took a bite out of the sandwich . " Quarter-speed , yes . " " And the rest of us ? " " They 're out in line . " He waved the coffee-cup . " The Canning is next us on this side , about a mile out on the beam . " Turning my eyes , I saw nothing but the huge soft crag of the mist towering close beyond the rail , with a dead-white rainbow standing across its face . " And the convoy ? You have n't got a sight of it yet ? No word , I suppose . " " Not yet . " I suppose sometime this morning we 'll be making up with it ? " " It will be making up with us . It looked the best thing to cut in above them on the course and go on ahead at quarter-speed till they overrun the escort from behind . They 're back there now , about five miles I should say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , five or six miles , I should say . " " That is , " he added , as I turned to the little ladder leading to the searchlight platform aloft , " if we 're in luck . " Standing alone up there , with my back to the search-light and nothing all about me but the cloud , I considered this gesture of a supreme and amazing faith . For long hours of dark and daylight , down under the pall , the commander of that home-bound convoy had been groping his way , leading the laden ships he could not see into the sightless north , led himself by nothing more than the point of a wavering needle and the measured count of revolutions , unless perhaps it were that faint wind wafting in his nostrils from a far-off , familiar " beach . " For long hours we had been doing the same , sweeping headlong through a cloud , without sight of sun or star or our neighbor in the line , piling up blind miles on changing courses , by compass and count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , when the last hour and minute and appointed second had ticked away , the act of faith was accomplished ; a word passing to the helmsman , a gong sounding in the depths , a hand wheeling over a dial in the brightness of the engine-room . And the gesture of faith was made ? with the sandwich , if I remember rightly . " They 're back there now " ( that squadron of ships come all the way over the shoulder of the world from Sydney and Calcutta and the China coast ) , " about five miles five or six . " Looking at the thing dispassionately , it became absurd . I climbed down to the bridge again . The captain was gazing at his watch , and by and by he said to the Executive , who was gazing at the bridge chronometer : " I guess we 'll do that . " While the Executive scribbled something on a piece of paper and the chief gunner 's mate bawled down for a radio messenger , the captain enlightened me as to the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while on the face of his watch . " We 're going to make a try of it , " he said . " We 'll go about and run straight down the course for fifteen minutes ? and sec if we 're in luck . " He put the watch back in the pocket of his old shirt . " That message has been sent , Mr. F. ? " " Sent and acknowledged by all destroyers , sir . " " Very well . Make standard speed such-and-such knots , conic hard right , and steady on a hundred and blank . " Words were passed ; in the bowels of the ship a bell rang ; the wheel went over ; the voice of the blowers was heard once more in the mist , and the white wake beyond the fan-tail began to fall away in a singing arc . I shall not soon forget that brief , swift dash of the invisible scouting-line down the course , putting fortune to the touch in a single cast , like dice thrown once and for all . The minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counting oFF on the dial of the chronometer above the bridge-chart , and no one had anything to say . We ran at speed through labyrinthine halls and chambers of fog hung with those strange white rainbows whose like I have never seen . Thirteen minutes went , and fourteen ; each one stood as he had been standing , men and officers motionless at their stations , and under the wail and wash of our blind advance no one spoke . I found myself waiting , too , charmed by it all into an attitude of preposterous and illogical expect anty . And so when the last precious minute had ticked away and the mists held nothing yet but those absurd phantoms of rainbows , I , too , had a moment of disappointment , profound and , as it were , unexpected . " Very well , " I heard the captain calling . " Hard right and steady on the course again . And half-speed will do . " I put my hands in my pockets , still under the pall of that grotesque despair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bad , " I argued , gloomily , " as trying to find a needle in a haystack . " " Yes , " he said , and he lit his pipe . When he had it lit he added , " We 'll wait , though . " A man in a life-belt was climbing the ladder with a paper in his hand . The Executive took it from him and I heard him saying , " It 's from the Canning , sir . " The captain read , and handed it on to me . The body of the message confined itself to a single word ? " Contact ! " " Right your wheel , Mr. F. , and steady on blank . " " Very well , sir . . . . Right wheel and steady on blank . " And turning to the voice-tube leading to the crow's-nest aloft , the Executive shouted : " Keep a sharp lookout for ships on the starboard bow . Have your wits about you up there . " I have n't the eyes of a seaman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all for a minute or two , that for a minute or two the hails of the lookouts taking up the " view halloo " of the crackling crow's-nest tube seemed but another gesture in this preposterous conspiracy of faith . But of a sudden they were allabout us , huge , dim , soundless apparitions shouldering through the rainbows . We found ourselves wheeling abruptly under a towering stern , striped and spotted like the day of doom ; and raising our eyes , we saw the faces of Lascars gazing down at us with a fugitive wonder . And then they were gone and another ship stood over us , other Lascars lining the rails , other whites capped " Limey " officers thronging the bridge . And so we passed from ship to ship through the cloudy lines and columns , and to our trumpet or our flags t ! sey answered us by hanging out their names , black names on long white backboards . The mists had begun to lift a little , letting a white glory of sunshine through , when we came at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of his column in a big ship striped like a tiger , in blue and black and white . We saw him on the bridge , standing out a little from his officers banked in the wing , a gaunt man with white hair , a tall old fellow , hawk - nosed , leancheeked , typical . One can not say what rank he held in the navy , but more than one retired admiral has come out of retirement to bring home foodships on a captain 's pay . In the growing sunlight he hailed us , and the Owner , climbing up to the search-light platform with his speakingtrumpet , hailed in answer . It was something to hear those two men of the sea , come to a meeting out of the gray North and the colored harbors of the East , talking together across the white river that ran between . " I say ! ' we heard the stranger crying . " I say , you did well to find us at all in this , sir . Bally well done , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw him lift his cap . The Owner looked hard at the mouthpiece of his trumpet for a moment before replying : " Thanks , sir . But it 's mostly a matter of luck ! Mostly luck , you understand . " And he , too , lifted his cap , the old fuzzy one , and we saw him mopping his brow with his handkerchief , and then the bald spot on the top of his head .
