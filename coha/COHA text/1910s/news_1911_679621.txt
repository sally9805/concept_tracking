txt The process of removing the water surrounding the wreck of the Maine was practically completed this evening , when the water level in the cofferdam had been lowered eighteen feet , leaving the wreck surrounded by islets of mud , small pools and sinkholes of green , slimy water , In wrdcli scuttled myriads of crabs and other small creatures . The , soundings to-night showed nowhere a depth in excess of four feet . The structure of the bow as far aft as frame 18 is now exposed . permitting an analysis of the plates , beams , and ribs . and it has been shown conclusively that they originally belonged to the structuri of the double bottom , which is now ele-i vated to a height of some forty feet above the normal position , apparently giving confirmatory evidence of a tremendous exterior explosion . The dregs of water remaining in the Icofferdam can be removed in a few hours , but it is now apparent that the engineers are confronted with an infinitely more serious problem , the removal of the mud lin which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirtyseven feet to a depth that tan only be cenJectured . Although the water now is only two feet lower than in previous pumping operations , the revelations with regard to the shattered condition of the hulk have been vastly enlarged , owing to the lateral outspreading of the distorted frames and plating , especially in tile forward section , where the principal force of the explosion was expended . In the confused mass of wreckage of the bow is to be seen a curved piece of steel . This is believed to be what Ensign Powelson identified before the Sampson Court of Inquiry as part of the flat keel of the Maine . Naval Constructor Ferguson , in charge of the examination of the wreck , declines to say whether he can fully confirm Powelson 's identification , but says that adjacent plates and beams are unquestionably from the vicinity of the keel . The wardroom and officers ' quarters on the starboard side are exposed , but owing to a considerable list the mud is level with the ceiling , precluding at the present time the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the trifling quantity of water within the cofferdam , but to make preparations to erect foundations for cranes and derricks , with which to extract the heaviest parts of the wreckage , after which a means for removing the mud will be decided upon . The necessity for extensive excavations may consume several months . Among the developments as a result of the pumping to-day was the exposure of a section of the armor belt abreast the midship superstructure . This is about level with the surface of the water , it i normal position , but separated from the forward portion of the belt , which doubtless was blown out . Exploration of the gallery to-day resulted in the discovery of two pots half full of beans and other articles for kitchen use , some of which at first were believed to be human bones . The hope of the discovery of the skeleton of many of the crew is diminishing on account of the unexpectedly complete demolition of the berth deck . The engineers are greatly pleased with the success of the cofferdam , which in spite of much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the estimated maximum strain with not the slightest sign of weakness . It is believed that the wreck will be ready for inspection by the Board of Inquiry within two months . An interesting point which the engineers are now investigating is whether the bulkhead immediately aft the central superstructure , where it is believed toe hull was almost completely broken in half , remains in good condition , in which case it is believed little difficulty will be experienced in floating out the after one-third of the ship . HISTORY OF MAINE EXPLOSION . Havana Startled by the Disaster on . Night of Feb. 13 , 1898 . It was on the night of Feb , 15 , 1608 , that Havana was shaken by a terrific explosion , that a. flash as of lightning lit up the harbor , and then the Maine sank slowly beneath the waves , carrying with her 260 of her crew . Already relations between the United States and Spain were strained , and instantly the cry " Remember the Maine " sprang into being . It was Capt . Sigsbee who first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was cool enough , even with his ship scarcely under water , to send to the Secretary of the Navy the message : " Public opinion should be suspended pending further report . " It was Capt . Sigsbee , too , who recorded later what every one here appreciated that " the explosion of the Maine was the ultimate incident which impelled the people of the United States to regard Spain as an impossible neighbor . Although the war which followed was not founded on the destruction of the Maine as a political cause , that disaster was the pivotal event of the conflict which terminated Spanish possession in the Western World . Considerations like this must continue to give the Maine a unique place in the history of the United States , especially since the character and magnitude of the disaster make it one of the . most shocking on record . " It is a matter of record that Father John P. Chadwick , Chaplain of the Maine . stated some time after the explosion that when the Maine was ordered to Havana harbor its crew were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or a warlike one . Havana folk were as uncertain as were the Maine complement as to the purpose of the battleships 's presence , and , according to the Chaplain , it was rumored in Havana the night before the explosion that a great event would happen on the following night . Crew Trapped Asleep . The catastrophe occurred about 9:30 o'clock . Most of the crew were asleep . Of the thirty officers attached to the ship all but four were aboard . Father Chidwick was also in his stateroom and recounting his experiences afterward he said : " I was in my room when a loud explosion rang through the ship . It lurched to one side and all the lights were extinguished . I and I believe others on board thcught at first that war had begun , for we expected it momentarily , and that we had been hit by a shot from the fort . " /I ran to the deck and amidships . From there forward was cue mass of flames . From the flames and from the surrounding water , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' Save me : Help me ! ' " Capt . Sigsbee was on the poop deck . He was giving orders calmly , and a handful of men , those that had escaped the explosion , were obeying them . " Father Chidwick declared that reports that had reached him from men on deck at the time of the explosion and from others who saw the explosion , that the , bodies of men were sent shooting sixty ' feet into the air . The turret of the ship , which weighed more than 100 tons , was found more than 100 feet away . What Inquiry Court Said . The report of the court of inquiry which I convened on the United States ship Iowa after the explosion of the Maine was returned on Monday , March 29 , 1893 . The board making the report consisted of Capt . W. T. Sampson , President , and Lieut . Commander Marix , Judge Advocate . In the report they found , first , that - the United States battleship Malue arrived in the harbor of Havana , Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was taken to Buoy No : 4 , in from five and a half to six fathoms of water , the regular Government pilot . The Culted States Consul General at Havana had notified the authorities at that place the previous evening of the intended arrival of the Maine . Second , the state of discipline on board the Maine was excellent , and all orders and regulations in regard to the care and safety of the ship were strictly carried out . All ammunition was stowed in accordance with prescribed instructions , and proper care was taken whenever ammunition was handled . Nothing was stowed in any of the magazine or shell rooms which was not permitted to be stowed there . The temperature of the magazines and shell rooms was taken daily and reported . The only magazine which had an undue amount of heat was the after 10-inch magazine and that did not explode at the time the Maine was destroyed . The fire alarms in the bunkers were in working order and there never had been a case of spontaneous combustion of coal on the Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of the disaster , but for auxiliary purposes only . With a comparatively low pressure of steam and being tended by a reliable watch , these boilers could not have caused the explosion of the ship . The four forward boilers have since been found by the divers and are in a fair condition . On the night of the destruction of the ' Maine ev.erything had been reported secure for the night at 8 P. M. by reliable persons through the proper authorities to the commanding officer . At the time the Maine was destroyed the ship was quiet and least liable to accident caused by movements from those on board . At Frame 18 , the vertical keel was broken in two and the flat keel bent into an angle similar to the angle formed by the outside bottom plating . This break is now about six feet below the surface of the water and about 30 feet above its normal position . In the opinion of the court this effect could have been produced only by the explosion of a mine situated under the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the port side of the ship . In the opinion of the court the Maine was destroyed by the explosion of a submarine mine which caused the partial explosion of two or more of her forward magazines . The court has been unable to obtain evidence fixing the responsibility for the destruction of the Maine upon any person or persons . HAS RIOTOUS AUTO RIDE .
