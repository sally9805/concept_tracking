Our committee is formed under the general chairmanship of Mrs. Frank Mason of Paris . We stand ready to make Brussels lace once more the fashion , and to attend to all the press work . &c.; All our committee needs is for our idea to strike the would-be donor who will see In It an opportunity to revive a nation ( and Incidentally to aid our own cotton industry ) now at the psychological moment when the Belgian factories are closed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson and to Mr. Bryan in the hope of having the lace imported free of duty .
