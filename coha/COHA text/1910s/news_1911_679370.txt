txt Every roadway leading from this town is patroled by armed guards , and the police Of every neighboring hamlet , village , and City have been notified to look out for three- convicts who escaped from Sing Sing Prison here this evening . Two of the men are burglars , one of whom was sentenced for twenty-one years . The third was a life prisoner , having been convicted of murder in 1902 . So far no trace of the men has ' been found except for a possible clue furnished by the crew of a passing freight wain , who reported to the station agent of the New York Central Railroad here that they had seen two men climb the wall about the prison and descend to the railroad tracks . A southbound freight train was taking a switch at the time and moving slowly . The crew of the other freight believe that the two men they iair boarded one of the cars of this train . So heavy is the fog which envelops this section to-night that lights are indistinguishable even at so short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards are.patroling all the roadways , and every passerby is held up and questioned at least once in every hundred yards . The town resembles an armed camp . Nay Have Escaped on the Ice . Other guards are stationed at short ' intervals along the shore of the Hudson River . ** has not yet formed all the way across the river , extends nevertheless , for miles along the short front both to the north and south of the prison , and it is strong enough to bear the weight of a man , The prison authorities fear that the men may have managed to reach this ice and to have not beyond reach already by traveling northward or southward op its surface . There remains a slight chance that the . prisoners , or at least one of them if the tale of the freight train crew be true , are still within the prison bounds . It wdeald be impossible to find them in the darlcness of night , coupled with the added veil of fog which hangs over the place , and as a result a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison on the chance that daybreak will reveal one or more of the men skulking in the shadow ' of the prison walls . The possibility that all three may be within the grounds still , and that the story of the two men seen to cross the railroad wail is a fiction born in the minds of the train crew , has earned greater credence in the minds of Warden Frost and the other prison keepers from the fact that the last seen of the three men they were running toward the fourteenfOot-high iron picket fence , which shuts off the prison grounds from the river . Before they were seen to reach it , the forms of all three were lost to sight in the fog , and when guards reached the fence . some inomente:seer there was nothing to show whether the men had reached the fence , and , if so , whether they had been able to climb it How the Men Got Away . The escape was made from the administration building , which rises some 100 1 yards back from the fence beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison orchestra of sixteen pieces practices on three nights in each week . All three of the men who escaped were members et the band . This was one of the nights given over to practice , ano , according to custom , the . three fugitives , path thirteen other convicts , were released from the cell buildings at 6:30 o'clock and conducted under guard to the administration building , where they took their usual places in the auditorium . Only one guard , Wilfred WebSter , remained in the room . He sat near the door listening and enjoying the music of the orchestra until disturbed by a knock on the outside . Webster had locked the door  --  behind him when he entered with the convicts in accordance with the Prison rules , and now he rose , walked to the door and unlocked it , throwing it wide open . as he had done probably loo other times since he had been the guard in charge of the band . ? Alexander another guard , was outside anxious to speak to Webster , and as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were together in the doorway when , suddenly , three of the prisoners sprank upon them . Neither of the guards was armed , although the attack was so sudden that had they had arms they could not have used them : The three convicts held cornets in their hands , and using the musical instruments as weapons they beat both guards to the floor , blows on the head from the heavy nickel and brass cornets rendering them senseless . Then they sprang through the door and out into the prison yard . - Fellow-Convict Gives the Alarm . In front of them was a clear stretch of 100 yards to the river fence , and they might have traversed this unnoticed in the darkness and fog had it not been for one of their fellow-convicts . This man , with the remaining dozen , had stood still while the attack was made on the keepers , but as the fugitives passed through the door. - one of - them rushed - into the prison yard shouting loudly for the guard . " Help ! They 've killed the keepers . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lungs . James Woodley. one of the guards - in the yard . heard him . Woodlev was armed with a revolver , and st the shout of warning he caught a n glimse of the three dim figures , bait glimpse the ground , speeding toward the e fsnc . The guard yanked his revolver firm its holster and opened ' fire . ' ' lie reports of the five shots as Wood1ey 4h- charged them as fast as he ' could in the direction of the fugitive , a-Proused the whole prison . Guards flocked from every building , and presently the yard was overrun with armed men . But not a trace of the fugitives was found . They appeared to have been swallowed up in the mist that covered the whole place . Some of the guards ran to the Administration building where the thirteen convicts , the man who had given the alarm having rejoined ' be group , were huddled in the room as though in fear that they might be suspected of having had some hand in the escape . The two guards lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frost 's office where they were revived . Both men were found to have severe cuts on the head where the musical weapons of th.2 prisoners had struck them , but neither was injured seriously . Meantime the prison whistle , which sounds only when there has been an ' escape from the prison , was set going . At intervals of every three minutes its shrill blast was sent out over the surrounding country , serving as a warning to the folk of the countryside that fugitive prisoners were about . it served , too , as a summons for those ! guards who were off dut , , and who were in their homes in this village and other near-by towns . These men flocked toward the prison in response to the first blast , and presently Warden Frost had Rill armed men at his command , Thirty of these were detailed to make a search of the yard in the hope that the fugitives might not have already escaped over the wall . Others were sent out on the roods , while more were sent to the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other convict In the prison . Then Warden Frost commenced to telephone the news round about the country . The alarm was sent to New York . to Poughkeepsie. , to Peekskill , and to Tarrytown . Croton , Yonkers , and New Rochelle , and descriptions of the prisoners were included . To New Rochelle the news was of es - pecdal interest , for one of the men had been convicted there in lie was Ralph Taylor , known as " The Silk Hat Burglar , " and 1 , e was sentenced to twenty-one years and two months in April , 1008 , for having participated in many robberies of Summer homes along the shore of the Sound . When detectives got on the trail of him and his companion , William P. Hanna . alias James Harlan , the men posed as yachtsmen of New Rochelle. and for a time threw the police off their track . When they were captured Taylor hruk , i down and accused Harlan of having hypnotized hint . He declared that he had not known what he was doing and certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions in to-night 's escape were William Bush , sentenced in 1902 to life imprisonment for murder , and Charles , a burglar . who was sentenced to between four and five years in April , BOO . Why should have joined in the escape is a mystery to Warden Frost , All three men were good prisoners , having nothing against their prison record , and would have been eligible for parole next September . He had little to gain by his escape and everything to lose . Whether the escape was planned beforehand or was the conception of the mo-i ment , induced by the opportunity offered , by the opening of the door , is another matter which puzzles Warden Frost . Bush and Taylor had cells near together . and by the method which the officials admit all prisoners somehow acquire , they may have communicated with each other and planned the escape long before . How could have known of it is not apparent . The escape of to-night is the secen-I which has occurred in the prison within six months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars of a crowded cell and lowering selves into the yard got over the fence by the river side and fled along the g pro .
