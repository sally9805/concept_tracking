T would be extremely surprising if among the readers of I The FORUM was found one to disagree with my view that the present war is not only justified by every principle of national and international policy but absolutely inevitable . I do not intend , therefore , to discuss its rightfulness or wrongfulness . National expediency and political safety ended all such discussion with our declaration that a state of war existed between the People and the Government of the United States and the Imperial German Government . On the 6th day of last April the Congress indicted in the high court of public opinion the Imperial German Government for crimes and misdemeanors against Christian civilization in general and against the American people in particular . The Central Powers have demanded settlement of the controversy , not by arbitration but by the ancient and barbaric method of settlement of disputes ? by wager of bat- tle . He , therefore , who at this hour wants to discuss the rightfulness or wrongfulness of this war is an unwise , if not an unpatriotic citizen . The saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views on war in general and concerning this one hi particular , has crystallized his opinion into a few words very much , perhaps , like these : " The ' war is on . One side or the other is going to win it . There is an irrepressible conflict between the views and the objects of the Imperial German Government and the ideas and ideals of the American Republic . If Germany wins , the dream of the pacifist will become the nightmare of despair . It is better for the world that Germany 's enemies win . We must win . We will win . " No right-minded man wants to kill the German Emperor or deal unjustly with the German people . Viewing the conduct of the House of Hohenzollern for many years , we are willing that the Emperor shall have his " place in the sun , " but only on condition that a liberty-loving American sit beside him to see that his shadow never again brings death and desolation to any living thing . If at the close of this war there still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must so safeguard that worship that never again " till the stars grow old and the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold " shall a Son of God or a son of man be offered up an unwilling sacrifice upon his altar . The war is on . It must be , can be , will be fought to a successful conclusion . Pacifist and socialist , each ought to see that the Land of Peace is forward through the desolation of war , not backward through the broken and deserted highways of democracy . There are some features of American citizenship which in this hour should be very frankly discussed . To our credit , it may be said that we differ from other peoples . They make mistakes and forget them . We make mistakes , but we have the courage to rectify them . Much of the discontent of this Car , lessening each day , is traceable directly to our own errors .  | Germans differ in no sense from many other peoples who have come to America . Because they came , we unfortunately lccided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to be in the Republic and yet not to be a part of it . We welcomed them to enjoy our institutions and to profit Icy opportunities found here , and yet we encouraged them to remain separate and apart from the great mass of Ameri cans . No one has rejoiced more than I at the idea of having the citizenship of the country composed of a blend of the best traits of all the peoples of earth , purified and cleansed of the nationally vicious characteristics of each , but we have suddenly reached a crucial period in our history , a period when there can be only two kinds of citizens ? loyal Americans and alien enemies . DENATURALIZE THEM AND MERGE THEIR PROPERTY I can well understand that there may be in America a few men of German origin who are so obsessed with the beauties of militarism and who have learned so little about freedom and Republican institutions as to prefer Germany to America . For these I have a great compassion , but my compassion is coupled with the view that , if naturalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accumulated under institutions of which they do not approve , should be confiscated to the defense of those institutions ; and that they should either leave this country or have the manhood and courage to declare themselves alien enemies of the Republic and suffer themselves to be incarcerated until the close of the war . As Governor of Indiana , I sent a parole one Christmas to a man in the State Prison , who had been sentenced for failure to support his wife . I attached to the document a condition that he go home , live with his wife and support her . On the morning after Christmas the parole came back with a letter from the Warden , conveying the prisoner 's thanks for my kindness , but respectfully declining to accept the pa- role , with the explanation that he was enjoying more peace in the penetentiary than he ever had in living with the woman he had married . I have no respect whatever for the man who will live with his wife but who does not properly care for her anc support her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , have no soft charity for the mar of German birth or German extraction who will remain it America , enjoy the privileges and opportunities of Americar life and yet in secret and overt ways attempts to prevent the furtherance of the ideas and the cause to which America ha : pledged itself . The time has arrived when men must make a choice between the fatherland and the step-fatherland ; when they must live with , love and support their wives , or leave them and become legally separated from them . Let us , on our part , begin now the doing of the right thing , not by indiscriminate suspicion of a man because of his blood or name , but by a sober , thoughtful and purposeful intention to weld the great body of our citizenship into an American commonwealth , whose language , both national and in the home , shall be the American language , whose measure of patriotism shall not be the golden metewand of equal and exact justice but the elastic cord of sympathetic sacrifice for our country in her hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the hour of war . Sometimes the greater the disaster , the greater the blessing . The war 's successful close may not leave Ioo , 000 , - 00o American citizens , but whatever citizenship is left will be American . As a people , we will be so united that any man who loves another country more than he loves America will be a marked man . There will be no room for him in social , business , or political life . He might as well come to the mourner 's bench and get American religion or leave at once for outer darkness . Paradoxically , this war , which was inevitable , might have been averted . Had the committees of the great political parties of this country not bent so much of their energies in  | the past toward corraling what they were pleased to call the " foreign vote , " had they not translated all important speeches and party platforms into a dozen or more languages , ? 1 they not given special attention to the newspapers pubhed in foreign tongues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown to the candidates , had they , t recognized " foreign bureaus " as regular headquarters departments for the exclusive benefit of the so-called " for , , : ; n vote , " sometimes referred to as the " foreign-born ote , " the Imperial German Government would never have obtained its perverted view of the real condition of American All this was a great national mistake . It gave Europe false notion concerning us and convinced the chancelleries the world that we were a wobbly people , divided by disensions which we could not stem and made impotent by elements of indifference and disloyalty . The census of 1910 showed that there were in this country at that time nearly 7,000,000 foreign-born males over 21 rears of age ; that of these only about 3,000,000 were naturalized citizens and that fewer than 600,000 of the balance had expressed legal intention of becoming citizens . Incidentally it should be noted in fairness that , of all groups , the Germans showed the smallest percentage of alien residents , only 9 per cent being reported positively as unnaturalized or without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARMBEARING AGE It is probably safe to estimate that today in this country t here are 4,000,000 males of voting and largely of arm-bearing age , who are aliens . They are enjoying all the financial benefits of our institutions , but can not be called on to defend the country . Instead , they represent potential war complications and problems of great seriousness . The politician , in a way , has been to blame in appealing to the foreign vote . In another way , he has not been to blame for the lack of naturalization , because he was sought to ex- pedite the process of naturalization ahead of the process of absorption . We were far more interested in our immigrants becoming citizens than in their becoming good loyal Americans . By way of parenthesis , I may remark that from this time forward no person ought to be permitted to vote in any of the States of the Union who is not a full American citizen , speaking , reading and writing , at home and elsewhere , the English language and who has not given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in form , all allegiance to and faith in any other system of government than ours . Some may be surprised to learn than in nine of our States American citizenship is not even required as a voting qualification . All an immigrant of comparatively brief residence in any of these States has to do , in order to have as much voting power in choosing a President as I have , is to merely declare his intention of becoming a citizen . My own State of Indiana is one of the the country and six months in the State , who has declared his intention of becoming a citizen , may qualify for the exercise of the elective franchise . We took no trouble to protest against dual citizenship ? which is hardly dual citizenship ? until recently enacted Federal legislation . We let them vote , with full knowledge of their right , which meant our consent that , whenever they chose to do so , they could repudiate their American citizenship by appearing before a consul of their native land- and becoming alien enemies . A REFORM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country right now many thousands of men who are held by the war authorities to be alien enemies and are treated as such , even in some cases being interned , who , according to the laws of the State in which they happen to reside , have as much legal right to vote for a president or congressman as you or I. There are more than  | 3000 such twilight citizen-enemies in my own State , according to the last census . At the time this article appears formal war will have been declared against one of the allies of the Imperial Gern Government , and this anomalous situation will be thereby greatly broadened . So thoughtless and indifferent had we been to the shrinking of the ocean by steam and electricity that we rejoiced everywhere to observe business being conducted and social energies evinced under the hyphenates of I ; ritish-American , German-American , Franco-American , I talio-American , etc . It was not thought necessary to require the use of the official language in family and social life . We rather discouraged than encouraged the use of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching of native languages in the public schools sheltering the children of foreigners . All this and more we did because we never dreamed of european complications . We had few whom we were pleased to denominate just plain , old-fashioned American citizens . Within my knowledge , learned and patriotic senators have debated with zeal whether it was German , Irish or American citizens who won our freedom in the American Revolution . But the politicians have not been exclusively to blame for this condition of affairs . The people rule in this country . " They can have any kind of a government and enjoy any kind of politics they want . In the final analysis , they were responsible for the methods of politicians , who met behind closed doors and figured on how to catch the German-American vote , the Irish-American vote and other hyphenated votes , because it was considered safe and proper to make direct appeals to those votes . THEY THOUGHT WE WERE A DIVIDED NATION/ All these things were known in the chancelleries of the world , and particularly by the Imperial German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so divided that any  | sort of conduct which it Chose to impose upon uur persons and upon our property could not and would not raise any objection by the American people . Had we been a cohesive , American citizenship , with no hyphenates among us whatever ? and I do not use the term disrespectfully , because we have been quite as much to blame as the foreign-born citizens ? the Lusitania or the Arabic or the Sussex would not have been sent to the bottom of the seas . Had the German Emperor ever dreamed that we would pass immediately from a system of volunteer military service to one of conscription and that in 27 days $5,000,000,000 would be subscribed for the support of the Government in this war , no " overt act " would ever have been committed by his government against us . Had we struck when the irons were hot from the fire and welded our citizenship into Americanism , this war would not have come ? at this particular time . Yet , I insist that this war was inevitable . Had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because certain things are not subject to arbitration . Great , fixed and vital princi pies of government , which go to the root of nations can not always be submitted to the decision of a mere board . Whether people should choose their own rulers and manage their own affairs , or whether the holy oil of consecration , poured upon the head of some strong , ambitious and powerful man can run down through generations onto the beard of a madman and empower him to rule by right divine , are such far-separated ideals of government that the only way , in my judgment , in which they can forever be settled is by t h a t appeal which William of Germany has made , to the sword . And so , out of the disastrous conduct of the people and the politicians of America in the past will . come the great blessing of not only uniting the American people tinder no other name than that of plain American , with an utter disregard of blood , or race , or faith , but will also come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a people to take charge of their own government .  | THE SPLENDID SACRIFICE OF BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CLASSES Another good thing to come out of this war is that we will have proven the world-wide sneer against us not to be true . The world has thought of us for many years as a mere money-grubbing race ? seekers after pleasure , ease , comfort , enjoyment . Never in the history of the world has there been such self-sacrificing devotion to principle as the American people have displayed in the last six months . I stand amazed at the sight of the splendid sacrifice being made by the business and social life of America . In a moment , in a twinkling of an eye , we strip ourselves of all our personal desires and put on the armor of loyalty and devotion to the principles of the Republic . Yaul saw no greater light on his way to Damascus than the business men of America have seen on their way to Washington . Now we all realize that with every right goes a responsibility and that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have found out that there is a vast deal of difference between our rights and our powers and we are coming to distinguish between them . We are observing that , simply because we can , does not imply that we ought . And , not only with reference to its effect upon the war , but with reference to its effect on the future life of this people after the war , has this sudden shock been of inestimable benefit to us . . We shall not change our policy of making this the Land of Opportunity for all the weary , down-trodden , and oppressed of earth , but we shall insist that , in obtaining this opportunity , they shall also become thoroughly imbued with the great and vital principles of the Republic , and that it is a haven of refuge for those who have grown weary of OldWorld ideas and who hope to be benefited far more in their political and social than they are to be in their financial condition . As always , the politician must take the lead in these affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American people who from this time forward seeks to advance his partisan cause in any way than by a straight , truthful and  | high minded appeal to just plain , every-day , unvarnished American citizens . WHAT POLITICS HAS DONE When the history of the future shall describe this period it gives me great pleasure to put in print my view that , up to this hour , you will have little fault to find with the great majority of the politicians to whom public service has been entrusted . No legislative body in the history of the world has accomplished things so immense and far-reaching in character in a half-dozen years ' effort , as did the last Congress during its six months ' session . It virtually said to those whose duty it is to conduct the war : " Here 's all the money you want ; here 's all the men you want ; here 's all the authority you want ? go ahead and win this war as quickly as possible . " Partisanship has been cast aside in the main . So far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political debts only when I discover some Republican using the war for that purpose . I have seen so much splendid self-sacrifice on the part of men whom I have freely criticized heretofore that I stand dumb and speechless most of the time in the presence of mere partisan politics . These are war times , and no time for petty bickerings or the advocacy of any domestic measures on which the people may be divided . Nothing should be brought into our national life at this time that will weaken the energies of the country in successfully prosecuting this world war . If I can subordinate my democracy ? and if there ever was a rock-ribbed , hide-bound democrat , I claim the distinction ? certainly we can all defer needless agitation of inconsequential hobbies until the pending world conflict over democracy has been brought to a victorious end . Preventable , it could not be prevented . It was inevitable . After listening to the great men of the nation and the great men of the world , I am convinced that this war had to be fought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check the mastering ambitions and insolent power of autocracy .  | THE WAR MUST BE FOUGHT TO A FINISH It is not a Democratic war , nor a Republican war . It is not even a Wall Street war . Proportionately , there are as many rich men 's sons as poor men 's sons in the army , and the rich are paying far more than the poor in the support and maintenance of the Government in these trying hours . It is just a plain American war , and in carrying it on our people are going to forget race , blood and religion in being true Americans . Intense partisanship and rivalries have been turned to ashes in the fire of this war and men are getting closer together than they have ever been before . Whatever you may say about blood or race going into the make-tip of this people , one thing is essentially true ? however you may call it , whether Anglo-Saxon or AngloCeltic , it is English in its mental make-up , in that it never faces an emergency until the emergency arises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote $2,000,000,000 for preparedness . It would not have been worth while to put his name upon the ticket at the last election , had he done so . This year the only danger from the public wrath lay in refusing to vote $20,000,000,000 for defense and offense . The English mind meets and grapples with a situation when it arises rather than to prepare for it , and yet somehow , that mind has kept blundering on and blundering on through the centuries from Runnymede to now , enlarging the liberties of mankind , increasing its opportunities and daring to defend the rights of man . Unfortunately , next year there must be held , by the Constitution of our Government , a political election . I hope the rivalries and controversies will be as mild and inoffensive as they properly can be . You may depend upon it that they will be based on one fundamental premise , about which there will be no disagreement , and that will be the great national aim and determination to win this war . There may be differences as to how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no question , as far as the two great parties are con cerned , over the justice of our cause or our willingness to devote to it our lives , our fortunes and our most sacred honor . For myself , I am willing to wait until peace comes to determine what the terms of peace shall be . I have no fear of the President , the Congress , or the American people . No one can convince me that the nation which accorded the treatment we gave to Cuba , will , at the close of the present war , offer any nation other than unselfish , generous and brotherly treatment , in full spirit and accord with the Golden Rule . What our people need to learn now is not about the terms of peace but about the virtues of patience . The Government has an immense task in front of it . It undertook that task with no preparation . Men and supplies can not be sent across the ocean over-night . Publicity regarding many operations of the Government would be as helpful to the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are soldiers who never shoulder a gun nor fire a shot . They are the men who meet the description of the Apostle Paul as to the type of soldier when he said , " and having done all , to stand . " It is hard for us to wait ; for us not to know all the things we would like to know ; but all of us in civil life can be good soldiers of the Republic in being patient with the Government , in standing in our places , in being ready to be called for America and against her enemies , in being ready to do and to dare , and , if needs be , to die that the most sacred possession of all the ages and of all history ? the American Republic shall not become another of that long line of republics whose ruins strew the pathway of the past .  |
