txt Nothing was done by the new Congress toward developing military preparedness legislation during the two weeks it was in session prior to the beginning of the Christmas recess , and from present appearances here there is little likelihood that a fair start will be made when the Senate and the House reconvene on Jan. 3 . The situation is full of uncertainty , disheartening to those who favor the enactment oC laws that will give the country greater security , and is complicated by diverse views among members of the majority party in the House as to the means that should be employed to raise the revenues necessary to carry the Administration 's plans into effect . President Wilson and Secretary have told Congress that even if the emergency war revenue law is reenacted and if the provision of the Underwood-Simmons tariff act for placing raw sugar On the free list . on May 1 , 1918 , is repealed , it will still be ' necessary to provide means of raising about $112,000,000 annually to pay for the additional expense consequent op the increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the President for placing the nation in condition to defend itself . Many members of the House seem to have forgotten the vital nature of the issue of preparedness in their objection to measures suggested for obtaining the additional revenue required . Some of them are outspoken in opposition to the plan of the Administration for increasing the Government 's indome by direct taxation of gasoline and naphtha , horse power of automobile and other internal explosion engines , bank checks , pig iron , and fat e.1-i cated iron arts steel . There is talk of a bond issue , to which the Administration Is opposed , and the Ways and Means Committee of the House , controlled by the President 's own party , has been so impressed with the apparent formidable proportions of the opposition to ' the President 's particular scheme of raising revenue that it is considering the proposal of an inheritance tax and other means not suggested by the Administration . ? Sentiment for Larger Program . In addition , there appears to be some sentiment in Congress in favor of a much larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is talk that the Administration 's program is inadequate and that it does not coincide with the views of the expert military and naval advisers of the Secretaries of War and the Navy . There may be fairly plain sailing for the naval increase program recommended by Secretary Daniels . It is expected , however , that Mr. Daniels 's proposals will be attacked as too moderate , and that the main argument ? advanced against them will be the suggestions contamed in the report of the Naval Gen , eral Board , which Mr. Daniels recently made public . The recommendations of the General Board originally made public by the Secretary of the Navy were limited by a request from ' Mr. Daniels that the hoard outline a program calling for the expenditure of $100,000,000 a year for five years in warship construction . In the report made public later , however , the board waived this limit and contended that an adequate policy of naval preparedness should provide for the building of a fleet by 1025 that would be the  --  equal of the most powerful maintained by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General Board to reccmmending a program that would provide for the expenditure of $100,00a,00o a year for five years because it had been determined by the President and the Cabinet that the conditions of the revenues and other considerations would not justify the expenditure of any greater amount . In addition to the condition of the Treasury , . these conslderations were that the shipbuilding : facilities of the country were inadequate to handle such a great increase in the fleet . and that public opinion would not tolerate a building program that would call for the payment of more than $500,000,000 in the five-year period . In its " unhampered " recommendations the General Board proposed that forty-eight additional dreadnoughts should be built I by 1025 . The estimated cost of this con- ; struction would he $2670:21,000 a year . : or more than $1,500,000,000 for the build , ling period covered . 1 The indications are that the Naval Committee of the House will be in : clined to adhere to the recommendations , of the Secretary of the Navy rather than to those of the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing in Congress in favor of spending on the fleet alone practically all of the money to be appropriated for additional preparedness for war . This sentiment is based on the showing that has been made in the European war by the British fleet . It Is argued that , with the United States occupying an isolated position , a. strong ; fleet would prevent invasion from abroad and give the nation plenty of time to recruit , train , and equip an army sufficiently large for , any eventuality . Army Disagreement Greater . But whatever disagreement there may . be as to an adequate policy affecting the navy , it is insignificant in comparison with*the program of increase affecting ? the land forces . Alreatry ? it ? ' seems to be apparent that the formation of a Continental Army as proposed by the Secretary of War is very unpopular in both houses of Congress . The proposal is criticised by those who want a strong standing army , by those who believe the plan will not work out , by those who are in favor of this or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that segment of the personnel of the national Legislature that has earned for  --  itselt the name of " little army " men . There have been statements also that the Secretary of War was at outs with i the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs , and as evidence of this attention has been called to the fact that Chairman Chamberlain has introduced a bill providing for the adoption of what is known as the Swiss and Australian systems of compulsory military education . It has also been pointed out that Chairman Hay of the House Military Committee has introduced a 1311 that omits any provision for the Continental Army proposed by Secretary ? Garrison . Gossip has attributed disagreements to Secretary Garrison and Representative Hay that are cited as a cause for a failure to work together . Their differences , according to this gossip , date back to a reported refusal of Mr. Garrison early in Ws administration of the War Department to detach Major Gen. Leonard Wood from duty in Washington as Chief of the Army General Staff . So far as Senator Chamberlain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation for increasing the military efficiency of the country is merely suggestive . It is intended to give Congressmen and the people a chance to think of what he proposes along with all the other schemes for national defense that have been ad- : vanced . Generally , Senator Chamberlain is expected to work harmoniously . with the Administration in providing an adequate policy of military increase . In this connection , It has been very largely overlooked that the Plan of Secretary Garrison is suggestive also to a considerable extent . In his annual report Mr. Garrison confesses that . nobody can answer whether the men necessary to carry out the policy of having a continental army of 400,000 can be obtained . War College Recommendations . Enough has developed recently to indicate that the advocates of a very considerable Increase in the land forces will pit against the recommendations of the Secretary of War the recommendations ' of the Army War College . Before it was made known in any official way what had been recommended by the War College , or , more properly , the War College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands from several quarters that the recommendations be made public , and it was evident that those who made the demands-bad advance knowledge of the policy that the War College Division had laid down . The recommendations have now been made public , and with them a memorandum of Secretary Garrison in which he points out that the War College Division is one of four divisions of the General Staff and that it consists or two . Colonels , four Lieutenant Colonels. eight Majors , and seven Captains . No general officer is attached to it , according to the memorandum of the Secretary of War . The plan of the War College Division provides for a regular army of 253.500 , a continental army of 000,000 , and an appropriation of ** annually for the organized militia . It was estimated that it would cost $201.520,818 for the i ? antry and ai8 , : ; 88,5:iti for the cavalry under this scheme . To this Secretary Garrison says $20,0o0k0utt must be added for the Coast Artillery . For the continental army the War College Division estimates that f , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the expenditure working down to $62 , - 500.000 in the fourth year . Mr. Garrison was dissatisfied with the manner in which the division arrived at other figures of cost , including reserve supplies , and in his memorandum he says that he has referred the estmates back to the War College for further consideration . The main pOint involved in the recommendation of the Naval General Board and the War College Division of the Army General Starr is that in the opinion of the ** not only would the cost of the increases proposed be prohibitive , but in the ease of the fleet the number of vessels suggested could not be built in the United Stales within the time set , and in the c ; , , - en the t army the of lislments required could not be provided in a time Of pea out in the consideratiott n Coe brought the increase of Innd forces that the Adjutant General of the Army has given get any large nu111:1 ' 13'teii-to7'ielnl b firm-es to show Compulsory service . lisetidniefnfitesn.lt to One of the considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military preparedness ? is that , It the several pro : , osals to satisfy the sentiment of the country for providing a more adequate national defense are rejectee , th ? question of resorting to compulsory t'ilitary service may be placed before the eration .
