txt INCOME TAX DOUBTS . Exemption of Non-Resident Foreigners May Be Unconstitutional . In your recent article on " Income Tax Doubts " you say : " The Government is to be particularly congratulated upon the ruling it has made exempting non-resident foreigners from the provisions of the income tax. ? Under the law of 1864 the Government made a similar ruling and railroads paid foreigners the coupons of their bonds in full . Ten or fifteen years afterward the Supreme Court reversed this ruling and in the case of the United Railroad and Canal Company of New York alone compelled the Pennsylvania Railroad . the lessor , to pay to the United States $50,000 tor following the rulings of the Government officials . I presume other companies having foreign bondholders suffered in like manner . While the two laws are radically different and the Supreme Court probably will sustain the officials in their ruling , still , should they differ , the only relief the companies have would be from the owners of the coupons , if they could be found .
