SCENE  --  The interior of an old barn situated on top of a high headland of the seacoast . In the rear , to the left , a stall in which lumber is stacked up . To the right of it , an open double doorway looking out over the ocean . Outside the doorway , the faint trace of what was once a road leading to the barn . Beyond the road , the edge of a cliff which rises sheer from the sea below . On the right of the doorway , three stalls with managers and hay-ricks . The first of these is used as a woodbin and is half full of piled-up cordwood . Near this bin , a chopping block with an ax driven into the top of it . The left section of the barn contains the hay loft , which extends at a height of about twelve feet from the floor as far to the right as the middle of the doorway . The loft is bare except for a few scattered mounds of dank-looking hay . From the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about five feet long with an open running noose at the end is hanging . A rusty plow and various other farming implements , all giving evidence of long disuse , are lying on the floor near the left wall . Farther forward an old cane-bottomed chair is set back against the wall . In front of the stalls on the right stands a long , roughly constructed carpenter 's table , evidently home-made . Saws , a lathe , a hammer , chisel , a keg containing nails and other tools of the carpentry trade are on the table . Two benches are placed , one in front , one to the left of it . The right side of the barn is a bare wall . It is between six and half-past in the evening of a day in early spring . At the rising of the curtain some trailing clouds near the horizon , seen through the open doorway , are faintly tinged with gold by the first glow of the sunset . As the action progresses this reflected light gradually becomes brighter , and then slowly fades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slate color . From the rocks below the headland sounds the muffled monotone of breaking waves . As the curtain rises Mary is discovered squatting cross-legged on the floor , her back propped against the right side of the doorway , her face in profile . She is a skinny , over-grown girl of ten with thin , carroty hair worn in a pig-tail . She wears a shabby gingham dress . Her face is stupidly expressionless . Her hands flutter about aimlessly in relaxed , flabby gestures . She is staring fixedly at a rag doll which she has propped up against the doorway opposite her . She hums shrilly to herself . At a sudden noise from outside she jumps to her feet , peeks out , and quickly snatches up the doll , which she hugs fiercely to her breast . Then , after a second 's fearful hesitation , she runs to the carpenter 's table and crawls under it . As she does so Abraham Bentley appears in the doorway and stands , blinking into the shadowy barn . He is a tall , lean stoopshouldered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rheumatism , totter feebly under him as he shuffles slowly along by the aid of a thick cane . His face is gaunt , chalkywhite , furrowed with wrinkles , surmounted by a shiny bald scalp fringed with scanty wisps of white hair . His eyes peer weakly from beneath bushy , black brows . His mouth is a sunken line drawn in under his large , beak-like nose . A two week 's growth of stubby patches of beard covers his jaws and chin . He has on a threadbare brown overcoat but wears no hat . ABRAHAM ( comes slowly into the barn , peering around him suspiciously . As he reaches the table and leans one hand on it for support , Mary darts from underneath and dashes out through the doorway . Bentley is startled ; then shakes his cane after her . ) Out o ' my sight , you Papist brat ! Spawn o ' Satan ! Spyin ' on me ! They set her to it . Spyin ' to watch me ! ( He limps to the door and looks out cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Spyin ' to see  --  what they 'll never know . ( He stands staring up at the rope and taps it testingly several times with his stick , talking to himself as he does so . ) It 's tied strong  --  strong as death  --  ( He cackles with satisfaction . ) They 'll see , then ! They 'll see ! ( He laboriously creeps over to the bench and sits down wearily . He looks toward the sea and his voice quavers in a doleful chant . ) " Woe unto us ! For the day goeth away , for the shadows of the evening are stretched out . " ( He mumbles to himself for a moment  --  then speaks clearly . ) Spyin ' on me ! Spawn o ' the Pit ! ( He renews his chant . ) " They hunt our steps that we can not go in our streets ; our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end is come . " ( As he finishes Annie enters . She is a thin , slovenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pasty face . Her habitual expression is one of a dulled irritation . She talks in a high-pitched , sing-song whine . She wears a faded gingham dress and a torn sunbonnet. ) p. 3 ANNIE ( comes over to her father but warily keeps out of range of his stick . He does n't answer or appear to see her . ) Paw ! Paw ! You ai n't fergittin ' what the doctor told you when he was here last , be you ? He said you was to keep still and not go a walkin ' round . Come on back to the house , Paw . It 's gittin ' near supper time and you got to take your medicine b'fore it , like he says . ABRAHAM ( his eyes fixed in front of him ) " The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished , O daughter of Zion : he will visit thine iniquity , O daughter of Edom ; he will discover thy sins . " ANNIE ( waiting resignedly until he has finished  --  wearily ) You better take watch on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this barn no more . Lord sakes , soon 's ever my back is turned you goes sneakin ' off agen . It 's enough to drive a body outa their right mind . ABRAHAM " Behold , everyone that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee , saying , As is the mother , so is her daughter ! " ( He cackles to himself . ) So is her daughter ! ANNIE ( her face flushing with anger ) And if I am , I 'm glad I take after her and not you , y'old wizard ! ( scornfully ) A fine one you be to be shoutin ' Scripture in a body 's ears all the live-long day  --  you that druv Maw to her death with your naggin ' , and pinchin ' , and miser stinginess . If you 've a mind to pray , it 's down in the medder you ought to go , and kneel down by her grave , and ask God to forgive you for the meanness you done to her all her life . p. 4 ABRAHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is her daughter . " ANNIE ( enraged by the repetition of this quotation ) You quotin ' Scripture ! Why , Maw was n't cold in the earth b'fore you was down in the port courtin ' agen  --  courtin ' that harlot that was the talk o ' the whole town . And then you disgraces yourself and me by marryin ' her  --  her  --  and bringin ' her back home with you ; and me still goin ' every day to put flowers on Maw 's grave that you 'd forgotten . ( She glares at him vindictively , pausing for breath . ) And between you you 'd have druv me into the grae like you done Maw if I had n't married Pat Sweeney so 's I could git away and live in peace . Then you took on so high and mighty ' cause he was a Cath'lic  --  you gittin ' religion all of a moment just for spite on me ' cause I 'd left  --  and b'cause she egged you on against me ; you sayin ' it was a sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday meetin ' yourself for more'n twenty years ! ABRAHAM ( loudly ) " He will visit thine iniquity  --  " ANNIE ( interrupting ) And the carryin's-on you had the six years at home after I 'd left you  --  the shame of the whole county ! Your wife , indeed , with a child she claimed was yourn , and her goin ' with this farmer and that , and even men off the ships in the port , and you blind to it ! And then when she got sick of you and ran away  --  only to meet her end at the hands of God a year after  --  she leaves you alone with that  --  your son , Luke , shecalled him  --  and him only five years old ! p. 5 ABRAHAM ( babbling ) Luke ? Luke ? ANNIE ( tauntingly Yes , Luke ! " As is the mother , so is her son "  --  that 's what you ought to preach ' stead of puttin ' curses on me . You was glad enough to git me back home agen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help bring up that brat of hers . jealously ) You was fond enough of him all them years  --  and how did he pay you back ? Stole your money and ran off and left you just when he was sixteen and old enough to help . Told you to your face he 'd stolen and was leavin ' . He only laughed when you was took crazy and cursed him ; and he only laughed harder when you hung up that silly rope there ( she points ) and told him to hang himself on it when he ever came home agen . ABRAHAM ( mumbling ) You 'll see , then . You 'll see ! ANNIE ( wearily  --  her face becoming dull and emotionless again ) I s'pose I 'm a bigger fool than you be to argy with a half-witted body . But I tell you agen that Luke of yours ai n't comin ' back ; and if he does he ai n't the kind to hang himself , more 's the pity . He 's like her . He 'd hang you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you might 's well take down that ugly rope you 've had tied there since he run off . He 's probably dead anyway by this . p. 6 ABRAHAM ( frightened ) No ! No ! ANNIE Them as bad as him comes to a sudden end . ( irritably ) Land sakes , Paw , here I am argyin ' with your lunatic notions and the supper not ready . Come on and git your medicine . You can see no one ai n't touched your old rope . Come on ! You can sit ' n ' read your Bible . ( He makes no movement . She comes closer to him and peers into his face  --  uncertainly ) Do n't you hear me ? I do hope you ai n't off in one of your fits when you do n't know nobody . D' you know who 's talkin ' ? This is Annie  --  your Annie , Paw . ABRAHAM ( bursting into senile rage ) None o ' mine ! Spawn o ' the Pit ! ( With a quick movement he hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a cry of pain and backs away from him , holding her arm . ) ANNIE ( weeping angrily ) That 's what I git for tryin ' to be kind to you , you ugly old devil ! ( The sound of a man 's footsteps is heard from outside , and Sweeney enters . He is a stocky , muscular , sandy-haired Irishman dressed in patched corduroy trousers shoved down into high laced boots , and a blue flannel shirt . The bony face of his bullet head has a pressed-in appearance except for his heavy jaw , which sticks out pugnaciously . There is an expression of mean cunning and cupidity about his mouth and his small , round , blue eyes . He has evidently been drinking and his face is flushed and set in an angry scowl. ) p. 7 SWEENEY Have ye no supper at all made , ye lazy slut ? ( seeing that she has been crying ) What 're you blubberin ' about ? ANNIE It 's all his fault . I was tryin ' to git him home but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hit me on the arm with his cane when I went near him . SWEENEY He did , did he ? I 'll soon learn him better . ( He advances toward Bentley threateningly . ) ANNIE ( grasping his arm ) Do n't touch him , Pat . He 's in one of his fits and you might kill him . SWEENEY An ' good riddance ! ABRAHAM ( hissing ) Papist ! ( chants ) " Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that knows thee not , and upon the families that call not on thy name : for they have eaten up Jacob , and devoured him , and consumed him , and made his habitation desolate . " SWEENEY ( instinctively crosses himself  --  then scornfully ) Spit curses on me till ye choke . It 's not likely the Lord God 'll be listenin ' to a wicked auld sinner the like of you . ( to Annie ) What 's got into him to be roamin ' up here ? When I left for the town he looked too weak to lift a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same crazy notion he 's had ever since Luke left . He wanted to make sure the rope was still here . ABRAHAM ( pointing to the rope with his stick ) He he ! Luke " ll come back . Then you 'll see . You 'll see ! SWEENEY ( nervously ) Stop that mad cacklin ' for the love of heaven ! ( with a forced laugh ) It 's great laughter I should be havin ' at you , mad as you are , for thinkin ' that thief of a son of yours would come back to hang himself on account of your curses . It 's five years he 's been gone , and not a sight of him ; an ' you cursin ' an ' callin ' down the wrath o ' God on him by day an ' by night . That shows you what God thinks of your curses  --  an ' Him deaf to you ! ANNIE It 's no use talkin ' to him , Pat . SWEENEY I 've small doubt but that Luke is hung long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good end , that lad . ( his eyes on the rope ) I 'll be pullin ' that thing down , so I will ; an ' the auld loon 'll stay in the house , where he belongs , then , maybe . ( He reaches up for the rope as if to try and yank it down . Bentley waves his stick frantically in the air , and groans with rage . ) ANNIE ( frightened ) Leave it alone , Pat . Look at him . He 's liable to hurt himself . Leave his rope be . It do n't do no harm . p. 9 SWEENEY ( reluctantly moves away ) It looks ugly hangin ' there open like a mouth . ( The old man sinks back into a relieved immobility . Sweeney speaks to his wife in a low tone . ) Where 's the child ? Get her to take him out o ' this . I want a word with you he 'll not be hearin ' . ( She goes to the door and calls out : Ma-ry ! Ma-ry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment later Mary rushes breathlessly into the barn . Sweeney grabs her roughly by the arm . She shrinks away , looking at him with terrified eyes . ) You 're to take your grandfather back to the house  --  an ' see to it he stays there . ANNIE And give him his medicine . SWEENEY ( As the child continues to stare at him silently with eyes stupid from fear , he shakes her impatiently . ) D' you hear me , now ? ( to his wife ) It 's softminded she is , like I 've always told you , an ' stupid ; and you 're not too firm in the head yourself at times , God help you ! An ' look at him ! It 's the curse is in the wits of your family , not mine . ANNIE You 've been drinkin ' in town or you would n't talk that way . MARY ( whining ) Maw ! I 'm skeered ! SWEENEY ( Lets go of her arm and approaches Bentley ) Get up out o ' this , ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take you to the house . ( Bentley tries to hit him with the cane . ) Oho , ye would , would ye ? ( He wrests the cane from the old man 's hands . ) Bad cess to ye , you 're the treach'rous one ! Get up , now ! ( He jerks the old man to his feet . ) Here , Mary , take his hand . Quick now ! ( She does so tremblingly . ) Lead him to the house . p. 10 ANNIE Go on , Paw . I 'll come and git your supper in a minute . ABRAHAM ( stands stubbornly and begins to intone ) " O Lord , thou hast seen my wrong ; judge thou my cause . Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me  --  " SWEENEY ( pushing him toward the door . Bentley tries to resist . Mary pulls at his hand in a sudden fit of impish glee , and laughs shrilly . ) Get on now an ' stop your cursin ' . ABRAHAM " Render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of their hands . " SWEENEY Shut your loud quackin ' ! Here 's your cane . ( He gives it to the old man as they come to the doorway and quickly steps back out of reach . ) An ' mind you do n't touch the child with it or I 'll beat you to a jelly , old as ye are . ABRAHAM ( resisting Mary 's efforts to pull him out , stands shaking his stick at Sweeney and his wife ) " Give them sorrow of heart , thy curse unto them . Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the Lord . " MARY ( tugging at his hand and bursting again into shrill laughter ) Come on , gran'paw . ( He allows himself to be led off , right. ) p. 11 SWEENEY ( making the sign of the cross furtively  --  with a sigh of relief ) He 's gone , thank God ! What a snake 's tongue he has in him ! ( He sits down on the bench to the left of table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ( She sits down on the bench in front of table . Sweeney winks mysteriously . ) Well , I saw him , sure enough . ANNIE ( stupidly ) Who ? SWEENEY ( sharply ) Who ? Who but Dick Waller , the lawyer , that I went to see . ( lowering his voice ) An ' I found out what we was wishin ' to know . ( with a laugh ) Ye said I 'd been drinkin '  --  which is true ; but ' t was all in the plan I 'd made . I 've a head for strong drink , as ye know , but he has n't . ( He winks cunningly . ) An ' the whisky loosened his tongue till he 'd told all he knew . ANNIE He told you  --  about Paw 's will ? SWEENEY He did . ( disappointedly ) But for all the good it does us we might as well be no wiser than we was before . ( He broods for a moment in silence  --  then hits the table furiously with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miser ! p. 12 ANNIE What did he tell you ? SWEENEY Not much at the first . He 's a cute one , an ' he 'd be askin ' a fee to tel you your own name , if he could get it . His practice is all dribbled away from him lately on account of the drink . So I let on I was only payin ' a friendly call , havin ' known him for years . Then I asked him out to have a drop o ' drink , knowin ' his weakness ; an ' we had rashers of them , an ' I payin ' for it . Then I come out with it straight and asked him about the will  --  because the auld man was crazy an ' on his last legs , I told him , an ' he was the lawyer made out the will when Luke was gone . So he winked at me an ' grinned  --  he was drunk by this  --  an ' said : " It 's no use , Pat . He left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm , " I spoke back . " It 's mortgaged to the teeth ; but how about the money ? " " The money ? " an ' he looks at me in surprise , " What money ? " " The cash he has , " I says . " You 're crazy , " he says . " There was n't any cash  --  only the farm . " " D' you mean to say he made no mention of money in his will ? " I asked . You could have knocked me down with a feather . " He did not  --  on my oath , " he says . ( Sweeney leans over to his wife  --  indignantly ) Now what d' you make o ' that ? The auld divil ! ANNIE Maybe Waller was lyin ' . SWEENEY He was not . I could tell by his face . He was surprised to hear me talkin ' of money . p. 13 ANNIE But the thousand dollars Paw got for the mortgage just before that woman ran away  --  SWEENEY An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the in'trist on ! ANNIE What could he have done with that ? He ai n't spent it . It was in twenty dollar gold pieces he got it , I remember Mr. Keller of the bank tellin ' me once . SWEENEY Divil a penny he 's spent . Ye know as well as I do if it was n't for my hammerin ' , an ' sawin ' , an ' nailin ' , he 'd be in the poor house this minute  --  or the mad house , more likely . ANNIE D' you suppose that harlot ran off with it ? SWEENEY I do not ; I know better  --  an ' so do you . D' you not remember the letter she wrote tellin ' him he could support Luke on the money he 'd got on the mortgage she 'd signed with him ; for he 'd made the farm over to her when he married her . An ' where d' you suppose Luke got the hundred dollars he stole ? The auld loon must have had cash with him then , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got it hid some place in the house mot likely . SWEENEY Maybe you 're right . I 'll dig in the cellar this night when he 's sleepin ' . He used to be down there a lot recitin ' Scripture in his fits . p. 14 ANNIE What else did Waller say ? SWEENEY Nothin ' much ; except that we should put notice in the papers for Luke , an ' if he did n't come back by sivin years from when he 'd left  --  two years from now , that 'd be  --  the courts would say he was dead an ' give us the farm . Divil a lot of use it is to us now with no money to fix it up ; an ' himself ruinin ' it years ago by sellin ' everythin ' to buy that slut new clothes . ANNIE Do n't folks break wills like his'n in the courts ? SWEENEY Waller said ' t was no use . The auld divil was plain in his full senses when he made it ; an ' the courts cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' we can do then . SWEENEY No  --  except wait an ' pray that young thief is dead an ' wo n't come back ; an ' try an ' find where it is the auld man has the gold hid , if he has it yet . I 'd take him by the neck an ' choke him till he told it , if he was n't your father . ( He takes a full quart flask of whisky from the pocket of his coat and has a big drink . ) Aahh ! If we 'd on'y the thousand we 'd stock the farm good an ' I 'd give up this dog 's game ( he indicates the carpentry outfit scornfully ) an ' we 'd both work hard with a man or two to help , an ' in a few years we 'd be rich ; for ' t was always a payin ' place in the auld days . p. 15 ANNIE Yes , yes , it was always a good farm then . SWEENEY He 'll not last long in his senses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon an ' after it he 'll be a real lunatic with no legal claims to anythin ' . If we on'y had the money  --  ' T would be the divil an ' all if the auld fool should forget where he put it , an ' him takin ' leave of his senses altogether . ( He takes another nip at the bottle and puts it back in his pocket  --  with a sigh ) Ah , well , I 'll save what I can an ' at the end of two years , with good luck in the trade , maybe we 'll have enough . ( They are both startled by the heavy footfalls of someone approaching outside . A shrill burst of Mary 's laughter can be heard and the deep voice of a man talking to her . ) SWEENEY ( uneasily ) It 's Mary ; but who could that be with her ? It 's not himself . ( As he finishes speaking Luke appears in the doorway , holding the dancing Mary be the hand . He is a tall , strapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome face bronzed by the sun . What his face lacks in intelligence is partly forgiven for his goodnatured , halffoolish grin , his hearty laugh , his curly dark hair , a certain devil may are recklessness and irresponsible youth in voice and gesture . But his mouth is weak and characterless ; his brown eyes are large but shifty and acquisitive . He wears a dark blue jersey , patched blue pants , rough sailor shoes , and a gray cap . He advances into the stable with a mocking smile on his lips until he stands directly under the rope . The man and woman stare at him in petrified amazement ) p. 16 ANNIE Luke ! SWEENEY ( crossing himself ) Glory be to God  --  it 's him ! MARY ( hopping up and down wildly ) It 's Uncle Luke , Uncle Luke , Uncle Luke ! ( She runs to her mother , who pushes her away angrily . ) LUKE ( regarding them both with an amused grin ) Sure , it 's Luke  --  back after five years of bummin ' round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a week ago  --  had a bust-up  --  and then took a notion to come out here  --  bummed my way  --  and here I am . And you'reboth of you tickled to death to see me , ai n't yuh ?  --  like hell ! ( He laughs and walks over to Annie . ) Do n't yuh even want to shake flippers with your dear , long-lost brother , Annie ? I remember you and me used to git on so fine together  --  like hell ! ANNIE ( giving him a venomous look of hatred ) Keep your hands to yourself . LUKE ( grinning ) You ai n't changed , that 's sure  --  on'y you 're homlier'n ever . ( He turns to the scowling Sweeney . ) How about you , brother Pat ? SWEENEY I 'd not lower myself to take the hand of a  --  p. 17 LUKE ( with a threat in his voice ) Easy goes with that talk ! I 'm not so soft to lick as I was when I was a kid ; and do n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch with a silver dollar which she has had clutched in her hand  --  sharply ) Mary ! What have you got there ? Where did you get it ? Bring it here to me this minute ! ( Mary presses the dollar to her breast and remains standing by the doorway in stubborn silence . ) LUKE Aw , let her alone ! What 's bitin ' yoh ? That 's on'y a silver dollar I give her when I met her in front of the house . She told me you was up here ; and I give her that as a present to buy candy with . I got it in Frisco  --  cart-wheels , they call ' em . There ai n't none of them in these parts I ever seen , so I brung it along on the voyage . ANNIE ( angrily ) I do n't know or care where you got it  --  but I know you ai n't come by it honest . Mary ! Give that back to him this instant ! ( As the child hesitates , she stamps her foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts to cry softly , but comes to Luke and hands him the dollar . ) LUKE ( taking it  --  with a look of disgust at his half-sister ) I was right when I said you ai n't changed , Annie . You 're as stinkin ' mean as ever . ( to Mary , consolingly ) Quit bawlin ' , kid . You ' n ' me 'll go out on the edge of the cliff here and chuck some stones in the ocean same 's we useter , remember ? ( Mary 's tears immediately cease . She looks up at him with shining eyes , and claps her hands. ) p. 18 MARY ( pointing to the dollar he has in his hand ) Throw that ! It 's flat ' n ' it 'll skip . LUKE ( with a grin ) That 's the talk , kid . That 's all it 's good for  --  to throw away ; not buryin ' it like your miser folks 'd tell you . Here ! You take it and chuck it away . It 's yourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the doorway . He turns to Pat with a grin . ) I 'm learnin ' your kid to be a sport , Tight Wad . I hope you ai n't got no objections . MARY ( impatiently ) Come on , Uncle Luke . Watch me throw it . LUKE Aw right . ( to Pat ) I 'll step outside a second and give you two a chance to git all the dirty things yuh 're thinkin ' about me off your chest . ( threateningly ) And then I 'm goin ' ter come and talk turkey to you , see ? I did n't come back here for fun , and the sooner you gets that in your beans , the better . MARY Come on and watch me ! LUKE Aw right , I 'm comin ' . ( He walks out and stands , leaning his back against the doorway , left . Mary is about six feet beyond him on the other side of the road . She is leaning down , peering over the edge of the cliff and laughing excitedly. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? LUKE Do n't git too near the edge , kid . The water 's deep down there , and you 'd be a drowned rat if you slipped . ( She shrinks back a step . ) You chuck it when I say three . Ready now . ( She draws back her arm . ) One ! Two ! Three ! ( She throws the dollar away and bends down to see it hit the water . ) MARY ( clapping her hands and laughing ) I seen it ! I seen it ! I seen it splash ! It 's deep down now , ai n't it ? LUKE Yuh betcher it is ! Now watch how far I kin chuck rocks . ( He picks up a couple and goes to where she is standing . During the following conversation between Sweeney and his wife he continues to play this way with Mary . Their voices can be heard but the words are indistinguishable . ) SWEENEY ( glancing apprehensively toward the door  --  with a great sigh ) Speak of the divil an ' here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dirty thief , an ' us without  --  ANNIE ( interrupting him ) Did you hear what he said ? A thief like him ai n't come back for no good . ( lowering her voice ) D' you s'pose he knows about the farm bein ' left to him ? p. 20 SWEENEY ( uneasily ) How could he ? An ' yet  --  I du n no  --  ( with sudden decision ) You 'd best lave him to me to watch out for . It 's small sense you have to hide your hate from him . You 're as looney as the rist of your breed . An ' he needs to be blarneyed round to fool him an ' find out what he 's wantin ' . I 'll pritind to make friends with him , God roast his soul ! An ' do you run to the house an ' break the news to the auld man ; for if he seen him suddin its likely the little wits he has left would leave him ; an ' the thief could take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANNIE ( getting up ) I 'll tell him a little at a time till he knows . SWEENEY Be careful , now , or we 'll lose the farm this night . ( She starts towards the doorway . Sweeney speaks suddenly in a strange , awed voice . ) Did you see Luke when he first came in to us ? He stood there with the noose of the rope almost touchin ' his head . I was almost wishin '  --  ( He hesitates . ) ANNIE ( viciously ) I was wishin ' it was round his neck chokin ' him , that 's what I was  --  hangin ' him just as Paw says . SWEENEY Ssshh ! He might hear ye . Go along , now . He 's comin ' back . p. 21 MARY ( pulling at Luke 's arm as he comes back to the doorway ) Lemme throw ' nother ! Lemme throw ' nother ! LUKE ( enters just as Annie is going out and stops her ) Goin ' to the house ? Do we get any supper ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraining her rage ) Yes . LUKE ( jovially ) Good work ! And tell the old man I 'm here and I 'll see him in a while . He 'll be glad to see me , too  --  like hell ! ( He comes forward . Annie goes off , right . ) MARY ( in an angry whine , tugging at his hand ) Lemme throw ' nother . Lemme  --  LUKE ( shaking her away ) There 's lots of rocks , kid . Throw them . Dollars ai n't so plentiful . MARY ( screaming ) No ! No ! I don ' wanter throw rocks . Lemme throw ' nother o ' them . SWEENEY ( severely ) Let your uncle in peace , ye brat ! ( She commences to cry . ) Run help your mother now or I 'll give ye a good hidin ' . ( Mary runs out of the door , whimpering . Pat turns to Luke and holds out his hand. ) p. 22 LUKE ( looking at it in a amazement ) Ahoy , there ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's let by-gones be by-gones . I 'm harborin ' no grudge agen you these past years . Ye was only a lad when ye ran away an ' not to be blamed for it . I 'd have taken your hand a while back , an ' glad to , but for her bein ' with us . She has the divil 's own tongue , as ye know , an ' she ca n't forget the rowin ' you an ' her used to be havin ' . LUKE ( still looking at Sweeney 's hand ) So that 's how the wind blows ! ( with a grin ) Well , I 'll take a chance . ( They shake hands and sit down by the table , Sweeney on the front bench and Luke on the left one . ) SWEENEY ( pulls the bottle from his coat pocket  --  with a wink ) Will ye have a taste ? It 's real stuff . LUKE Yuh betcher I will ! ( He takes a big gulp and hands the bottle back . ) SWEENEY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I was n't wishin ' herself to see it or I 'd have asked ye sooner . ( There is a pause , during which each measures the other with his eyes. ) p. 23 LUKE Say , how 's the old man now ? SWEENEY ( cautiously ) Oh , the same as ivir  --  older an ' uglier , maybe . LUKE I thought he might be in the bug-house by this time . SWEENEY ( hastily ) Indeed not ; he 's foxy to printind he 's looney but he 's his wits with him all the time . LUKE ( insinuatingly ) Is he as stingy with his coin as he used to be ? SWEENEY If he owned the ocean he would n't give a fish a drink ; but I doubt if he 's any money left at all . Your mother got rid of it all , I 'm thinkin ' . ( Luke smiles a superior , knowing smile . ) He has on'y the farm , an ' that mortgaged . I 've been payin ' the in'trist an ' supportin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpentryin ' these five years past . LUKE ( with a grin ) Huh ! Yuh 're slow . Yuh oughter get wise to yourself . SWEENEY ( inquisitively ) What d'ye mean by that ? LUKE ( aggravatingly ) Aw , nothin ' . ( He turns around and his eyes fix themselves on the rope . ) What the hell  --  ( He is suddenly convulsed with laughter and slaps his thigh . ) Hahaha ! If that do n't beat the Dutch ! The old nut ! p. 24 SWEENEY What ? LUKE That rope . Say , has he had that hangin ' there ever since I skipped ? SWEENEY ( smiling ) Sure ; an ' he thinks you 'll be comin ' home to hang yourself . LUKE Hahaha ! Not his chicken ! And you say he ai n't crazy ! Gee , that 's too good to keep . I got to have a drink on that . ( Sweeney pushed the bottle toward him . He raises it toward the rope . ) Here 's how , old chum ! ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd a'most forgotten about that . Remember how hot he was that day when he hung that rope up and cussed me for pinchin ' the hundred ? He was standin ' there shakin ' his stick at me , and I was laughin ' ' cause he looked so funny with the spit dribblin ' outa his mouth like he was a mad dog . And when I turned round and beat it he shouted after me : " Remember , when you come home again there 's a rope waitin ' for yuh to hang yourself on , yuh bastard ! " ( He spits contemptuously . ) What a swell chance . ( His manner changes and he frowns . ) The old slave driver ! That 's a hell of a fine old man for a guy to have ! SWEENEY ( pushing the bottle toward him ) Take a sup an ' forgit it . ' T was a long time past . p. 25 LUKE But the rope 's there yet , ai n't it ? And he keeps it there . ( He takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll git back at him aw right , yuh wait ' n ' see . I 'll git every cent he 's got this time . SWEENEY ( slyly ) If he has a cent . I 'm not wishful to discourage ye , but  --  ( He shakes his head doubtfully , at the same time fixing Luke with a keen glance out of the corner of his eye . ) LUKE ( with a cunning wink ) Aw , he 's got it aw right . You watch me ! ( He is beginning to show the effects of the drink he has had . He pulls out tobacco and a paper and rolls a cigarette and lights it . As he puffs he continues boastfully . ) You country jays oughter wake up and see what 's goin ' on . Look at me . I was green as grass when I left here , but bummin ' round the world , and bein ' in cities , and meetin ' all kinds , and keepin ' your two eyes open  --  that 's what 'll learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you 're right . Us country folks is stupid in most ways . We 've no chance to learn the things a travelin 's lad like you 'd be knowin ' . LUKE ( complacently ) Well , you watch me and I 'll learn yuh . ( He snickers . ) So yuh think the old man 's flat broke , do yuh ? p. 26 SWEENEY I do so LUKE Then yuh 're simple ; that 's what  --  simple ! You 're lettin ' him kid yuh . SWEENEY If he has any , it 's well hid , I know that . He 's a sly old bird . LUKE And I 'm a slyer bird . D'yuh hear that ? I c'n beat his game any time . You watch me ! ( He reaches out his hand for the bottle . They both drink again . Sweeney begins to show signs of getting drunk . He hiccoughs every now and then and his voice grows uncertain and husky . ) SWEENEY It 'd be a crafty one who 'd find where he 'd hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll find it . I betcher anything yuh like I find it . You watch me ! Just wait till he 's asleep and I 'll show yuh  --  ternight . ( There is a noise of shuffling footsteps outside and Annie 's whining voice raised in angry protest . ) SWEENEY Ssshh ! It 's himself comin ' now . ( Luke rises to his feet and stands , waiting in a defensive attitude , a surly expression on his face . A moment later Bentley appears in the doorway , followed by Annie . He leans against the wall , in an extraordinary state of excitement , shaking all over , gasping for breath , his eyes devouring Luke from head to foot. ) p. 27 ANNIE I could n't do nothin ' with him . When I told him he 'd come back there was no holdin ' him . He was a'most frothin ' at the mouth till I let him out . ( whiningly ) You got to see after him , Pat , if you want any supper . I ca n't  --  SWEENEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANNIE See that you do . I 'm goin ' back . ( She goes off , right . Luke and his father stand looking at each other . The surly expression disappears from Luke 's face , which gradually expands in a broad grin . ) LUKE ( jovially ) Hello , old sport ! I s'pose yuh 're tickled to pieces to see me  --  like hell ! ( The old man shutters and stammers incoherently as if the very intensity of his desire for speech had paralyzed all power of articulation . Luke turns to Pat . ) I see he ai n't lost the old stick . Many a crack on the nut I used to get with that . ABRAHAM ( suddenly finding his voice  --  and chants ) " Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet : And bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry : For this my son was dead , and is alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( He ends up with a convulsive sob ) p. 28 LUKE ( disapprovingly ) Yuh 're still spoutin ' the rotten old Word o ' God same 's ever , eh ? Say , give us a rest on that stuff , will yuh ? Come on and shake hands like a good sport . ( He holds out his hand . The old man totters over to him , stretching out a trembling hand . Luke seizes it and pump it up and down . ) That 's the boy ! SWEENEY ( genuinely amazed ) Look at that , would ye  --  the two faced auld liar . ( Bentley passes his trembling hand all over Luke , feeling of his arms , his chest , his back . An expression of overwhelming joy suffuses his worn features . ) LUKE ( grinning at Sweeney ) Say , watch this . ( with tolerant good-humour ) On the level I b'lieve the old boy 's glad to see me at that . He looks like he was tryin ' to grin ; and I never seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Bentley attempts to feel of his face ) Hey , cut it out ! ( He pushes his hand away , but not roughly . ) I 'm all here , yuh need n't worry . Yuh need n't be scared I 'm a ghost . Come on and sit down before yuh fall down . Yuh ai n't got your sea-legs workin ' right . ( He guides the old man to the bench at left of table . ) Squat here for a spell and git your wind . ( Bentley sinks down on the bench . Luke reaches for the bottle . ) Have a drink to my makin ' port . It 'll buck yuh up . p. 29 SWEENEY ( alarmed ) Be careful , Luke . It might likely end him . LUKE ( holds the bottle up to the old man 's mouth , supporting his head with the other hand . Bentley gulps , the whisky drips over his chin , and he goes into a fit of convulsive coughing . Luke laughs . ) Hahaha ! Went down the wrong way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . ( He drinks . ) There yuh are  --  smooth as silk . ( He hands the bottle to Sweeney , who drinks and puts it back on the table . ) SWEENEY He must be glad to see ye or he 'd not drink . ' T is dead against it he 's been these five years past . ( shaking his head ) An ' him cursin ' you day an ' night ! I ca n't put head or tail to it . Look out he ai n't meanin ' some bad to ye underneath . He 's crafty at pritindin ' . LUKE ( as the old man makes signs to him with his hand ) What 's he after now ? He 's lettin ' on he 's lost his voice again . What d'yuh want ? ( Bentley points with his stick to the rope . His lips move convulsively as he makes a tremendous effort to utter words . ) ABRAHAM ( mumbling incoherently ) Luke  --  Luke  --  rope  --  Luke  --  hang . p. 30 SWEENEY ( appalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's to see you hang yourself he 's wishin ' , the auld fiend ! ABRAHAM ( nodding ) Yes  --  Luke  --  hang . LUKE ( taking it as a joke  --  with a loud guffaw ) Hahaha ! If that do n't beat the Dutch ! The old nanny-goat ! Aw right , old sport . Anything to oblige . Hahaha ! ( He takes the chair from left and places it under the rope . The old man watches him with eager eyes and seems to be trying to smile . Luke stands on the chair . ) SWEENEY Have a care , now ! I 'd not be foolin , with it in your place . LUKE All out for the big hangin ' of Luke Bentley by hisself . ( He puts the noose about his neck with an air of drunken bravado and grins at his father . The latter makes violent motions for him to go on . ) Look at him , Pat . By God , he 's in a hurry . Hahaha ! Well , old spot , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were going to jump and kick the chair from under him . ) SWEENEY ( half starts to his feet  --  horrified ) Luke ! Are ye gone mad ? LUKE ( stands staring at his father , who is still making gestures for him to jump . A scowl slowly replaces his good-natured grin . ) D'yuh really mean it  --  that yuh want to see me hangin ' myself ? ( Bentley nods vigorously in the affirmative . Luke glares at him for a moment in silence . ) Well , I 'll be damned ! ( to Pat ) An ' I thought he was only kiddin ' . ( He removes the rope gingerly from his neck . The old man stamps his foot and gesticulates wildly , groaning with disappointment . Luke jumps to the floor and looks at his father for a second . Then his face grows white with a vicious fury . ) I 'll fix your hash , you stinkin ' old murderer . ( He grabs the chair by its back and swings it over his head as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old man cowers on the bench in abject terror. ) p. 31 SWEENEY ( jumping to his feet with a cry of alarm ) Luke ! For the love of God ! ( Luke hesitates ; then hurls the chair in back of him under the loft , and stands menacingly in front of his father , his hands on his hips . ) LUKE ( grabbing Bentley 's shoulder and shaking him  --  hoarsely ) Yuh wanted to see me hangin ' there in real earnest , did n't yuh ! You 'd hang me yourself if yuh could , would n't yuh ? And you my own father ! Yuh damned son of a gun ! Yuh would , would yuh ! I 'd smash your brains out for a nickel ! ( He shakes the old man more and more furiously . ) SWEENEY Luke ! Look out ! You 'll be killin ' him next . LUKE ( giving his father one more shake , which sends him sprawling on the floor ) Git outs here ! Git outa this b'fore I kill yuh dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man up . ) Take him outa here , Pat ! ( His voice rises to a threatening roar . ) Take him outa here or I 'll break every bone in his body ! ( He raises his clenched fists over his head in a frenzy of rage . ) SWEENEY Ssshh ! Do n't be roarin ! I 've got him . ( He steers the whimpering , hysterical Bentley to the doorway . ) Come out o ' this , now . Get down to the house ! Hurry now ! Ye 've made enough trouble for one night . ( They disappear off right . Luke flings himself on a bench , breathing heavily . He picks up the bottle and takes a long swallow . Sweeney re-enters from rear . He comes over and sits down in his old place . ) Thank God he 's off down to the house , scurryin ' like a frightened hare as if he 'd never a kink in his legs in his life . He was moanin ' out loud so you could hear him a long ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auld loon he is , sure enough . p. 32 LUKE ( thickly ) The damned son of a gun ! SWEENEY I thought you 'd be killin ' him that time with the chair . LUKE ( violently ) Serve him damn right if I done it . SWEENEY An ' you laughin ' at him a moment sooner ! I thought ' t was jokin ' ye was . LUKE ( sullenly ) So I was kiddin ' ; but I thought he was tryin ' to kid me , too . And then I seen by the way he acted he really meant it . ( banging the table with his fist ) Ai n't that a hell of a fine old man for yuh ! SWEENEY He 's a mean auld swine . LUKE He meant it aw right , too . Yuh shoulda seen him lookin ' at me. ( with sudden lugubriousness ) Ai n't he a hell of a nice old man for a guy to have ? Ai n't he ? SWEENEY ( soothingly ) Hush ! It 's all over now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the verge of drunken tears ) How kin I , help thinkin '  --  and him my own father ? After me bummin ' and starvin ' round thee rotten earth , and workin ' myself to death on ships and things  --  and when I come home he tries to make me bump off  --  wants to see me a corpse  --  my own father , too ! Ai n't he a hell of an old man to have ? The rotten son of a gun ! p. 33 SWEENEY It 's past an ' done . Forgit it . ( He slaps Luke on the shoulder and pushes the bottle toward him . ) Let 's take a drop more . We 'll be goin ' to supper soon . LUKE ( takes a big drink  --  huskily ) Thanks . ( He wipes his mouth on his sleeve with a snuffle . ) But I 'll tell yuh something you can put in your pipe and smoke . It ai n't past and done , and it ai n't goin ' to be ! ( more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferget it , either ! Yuh kin betcher life on that , pal . And he ai n't goin ' to ferget it  --  not if he lives a million  --  not by a damned sight ! ( with sudden fury ) I 'll fix his hash ! I 'll git even with him , the old skunk ! You watch me ! And this very night , too ! SWEENEY How d' you mean ? LUKE You just watch me , I tell yuh ! ( banging the table ) I said I 'd git even and I will git even  --  this same night , with no long waits , either ! ( frowning ) Say , you do n't stand up for him , do yuh ? SWEENEY ( spitting  --  vehemently ) That 's child 's talk . There 's not a day passed I 've not wished him in his grave . LUKE ( excitedly ) Then we 'll both git even on him  --  you ' n ' me . We 're pals , ai n't we ? p. 34 SWEENEY Sure . LUKE And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kinda feller I am ! That 's fair enough , ai n't it ? SWEENEY Surely . LUKE I do n't want no truck with this rotten farm . You kin have my share of that . I ai n't goin ' to loaf round here more'n I got to , and when I goes this time I ai n't never comin ' back . Not me ! Not to punch dirt and milk cows . You kin have the rotten farm for all of me . What I wants is cash  --  regular coin yuh kin spend  --  not dirt . I want to show the gang a real time , and then ship away to sea agen or go bummin ' agen . I want coin yuh kin throw away  --  same 's your kid chucked that dollar of mine overboard , remember ? A real dollar , too ! She 's a spot , aw right ! SWEENEY ( anxious to bring him back to the subject ) But where d' you think to find his money ? LUKE ( confidently ) Do n't yuh fret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know his hidin ' places . I useter spy on him when I was a kid  --  Maw used to make me  --  and I seen him many a time at his sneakin ' . ( indignantly ) He used to hide stuff from the old lady . What d'yuh know about him  --  the mean skunk ! SWEENEY That was a long time back . You do n't know  --  p. 35 LUKE ( assertively ) But I do know , see ! He 's got two places . One was where I swiped the hundred . SWEENEY It 'll not be there , then . LUKE No ; but there 's the other place ; and he never knew I was wise to that . I 'd have left him clean on'y I was a kid and scared to pinch more . So you watch me ! We 'll git even on him , you ' n ' me , and go halfs , and yuh kin start thee rotten farm goin ' agen and I 'll beat it where there 's some life . SWEENEY But if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doin ' to find out where it is , then LUKE Then you ' n ' me ' ull make him tell ! SWEENEY Oho , do n't think it ! ' T is not him 'd be tellin . ' LUKE Aw , say , you 're simple ! You watch me ! I know a trick or two about makin ' people tell what they do n't wanter . ( He picks up the chisel from the table . ) Yuh see this ? Well , if he do n't answer up nice and easy we 'll show him ! ( A ferocious grin settles over his face . ) We 'll git even on him , you ' n ' me  --  and he 'll tell where it 's hid . We 'll just shove this into the stove till it 's red hot and take off his shoes and socks and warm the bottoms of his feet for him . ( savagely ) He 'll tell then  --  anything we wants him to tell . p. 36 SWEENEY But Annie ? LUKE We 'll shove a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's easy . SWEENEY ( his head lolling drunkenly  --  with a cruel leer ) ' Twill serve him right to heat up his hoofs for him , the limpin ' , auld miser !  --  if ye do n't hurt him too much . LUKE ( with a savage scowl ) We wo n't hurt him  --  more'n enough . ( suddenly raging ) I 'll pay him back aw right ! He wo n't want no more people to hang themselves when I git through with him . I 'll fix his hash ! ( He sways to his feet , the chisel in his hand . ) Come on ! Let 's git to work . Sooner we starts the sooner we 're rich . ( Sweeney rises . He is a steadier on his feet than Luke . At this moment Mary appears in the doorway . ) MARY Maw says supper 's ready . I had mine . ( She comes into the room and jumps up , trying to grab hold of the rope . ) Lift me , Uncle Luke . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare touch that rope , d'yuh hear ? MARY ( whining ) I wanter swing . LUKE ( with a shiver ) It 's bad , kid , Yuh leave it alone , take it from me. p. 37 SWEENEY She 'll get a good whalin ' if I catch her jumpin ' as it . LUKE Come on , pal . T'hell with supper . We got work to do first . ( They go to the doorway . ) SWEENEY ( turning back to the sulking Mary ) And you stay here , d' you hear , ye brat , till we call ye  --  or I 'll skin ye alive . LUKE And termorrer mornin ' , kid I 'll give yuh a whole handful of them shiny , bright things yuh chucked in the ocean  --  and yuh kin be a real spot . MARY ( eagerly ) Gim me ' em now ! Gim me ' em now , Uncle Luke , ( as he shakes his head  --  whiningly ) Gim me one ! Gim me one ! LUKE Ca n't be done , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is goin ' to git even now  --  goin ' to make him pay for  --  SWEENEY ( interrupting  --  harshly ) Hist with your noise ! D' you think she 's no ears ? Do n't be talkin ' so much . Come on , now . LUKE ( permitting himself to be pulled out the doorway ) Aw right ! I 'm with yuh . We 'll git even  --  you ' n ' me . The damned son of a gun ! ( They lurch off to the right . ) ( Mary skips to the doorway and peeps after them for a moment . Then she comes back to the center of the floor and looks around her with an air of decision . She sees the chair in under the loft and runs over to it , pulling it back and setting it on its legs directly underneath the noose of the rope . She climbs and stands on the top of the chair and grasps the noose with both her upstretched hands . Then with a shriek of delight she kicks the chair from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to part where it is fixed to the beam . A dirty gray bag tied to the end of the rope falls to the floor with a muffled , metallic thud . Mary sprawls forward on her hand and knees , whimpering . Straggly wisps from the pile of rank hay fall silently to the floor in a mist of dust . Mary , discovering she is unhurt , glances quickly around and sees the bag . She pushes herself along the floor and , untying the string at the top , puts in her hand . She gives an exclamation of joy at what she feels and , turning the bag upside down , pours its contents in her lap . Giggling to herself , she gets to her feet and goes to the doorway , where she dumps what she has in her lap in a heap on the floor just inside the barn . They lie there in a little glittering pile , shimmering in the faint sunset glow  --  fifty twenty-dollar gold pieces . Mary claps her hands and sings to herself : " Skip  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four or five of them and runs out to the edge of the cliff . She throws them one after another into the ocean as fast as she can and bends over to see them hit the water . Against the background of horizon clouds still tinted with blurred crimson she hops up and down in a sort of grotesque dance , clapping her hands and laughing shrilly . After the last one is thrown she rushes back into the barn to get more. ) p. 38 MARY ( picking up a handful  --  giggling ecstastically ) Skip ! Skip ! Skip ! ( She turns and runs out to throw them as The Curtain Falls )
