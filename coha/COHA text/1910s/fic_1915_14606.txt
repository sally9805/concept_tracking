A SIMPLE cozy library , on the ground floor of a small house , is disclosed . A door at the back opens on the hallway without . On one side large mahogany folding doors close off the other rooms . A grate with a dull fire is directly opposite . Before this , at right angles , is a large couch on which BURGESS is reclining . Near it , RHY , his wife , sits on a small , low rocker . A shaded lamp and some candles softly light the room , which is furnished in quiet taste : a few pictures with dark frames , rows of books , several tapestry chairs , a piece of statuary , and some ferns are to be observed . WILTON BURGESS is in his early forties , rather good-looking , of no particularly distinguishing features , though his face is a kind one and he is not devoid of a certain sensitiveness in speech and in apperception . He is in a dressing-gown and slippers . His left arm is bandaged at the wrist and at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of health , has obviously passed the first flush of young womanhood . She is attractive in a quiet way with her soft voice and gentle gestures . At present , however , she seems moody and pensive . She wears a simple negligAe and her hair is loosely coiled for comfort . BURGESS is smoking while thoughtfully looking at RHY , who has put down her magazine . A bell is head WILTON BURGESS Was that the bell ? p. 3 RHY No . WILTON BURGESS Ella 's out ? RHY Yes ; motion pictures . WILTON BURGESS The romance of the poor , eh ? RHY ( Sententiously ) Yes . WILTON BURGESS ( Sitting up ) What are you thinking of ? RHY You and me . WILTON BURGESS Something serious ? RHY Perhaps . WILTON BURGESS Out with it . RHY Shall I ? WILTON BURGESS ( Relighting his cigar ) Yes . RHY ( Slowly ) I was realizing it has been a long while since you and I have really sat down quietly together . And I suppose if it had n't been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Anxiously ) Oh , you will be careful crossing the streets . Promise . WILTON BURGESS ( Feeling his bandaged wrist ) Do n't worry , dear . Lots of people escape automobiles . It 's becoming an American instinct . p. 4 RHY Do n't jest about it . You jest so much at everything I say . I might almost suspect you 're doing it to hide your feeling  --  if  --  ( Impulsively ) Oh , you do love me just the same , do n't you ? WILTON BURGESS ( Puzzled ) What are you talking of , Rhy ? RHY Have you been disappointed in me ? WILTON BURGESS Disappointed ? RHY I have been so happy with you all these ten years  --  selfishly happy . WILTON BURGESS We 've got along better than most married people , I suppose . RHY But I 'm afraid of prosperity , somehow . WILTON BURGESS We 've managed to get through the hard days . That 's the real test , is n't it ? RHY ( Doubtfully ) I 'm not sure . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had each other . But now that we have everything  --   --  ( She shakes her head slowly . ) WILTON BURGESS ( Looking at her ) Have we everything now ? p. 5 RHY All we want , I mean . WILTON BURGESS ( Slowly ) All you want . RHY ( With a quick glance , as she rises ) I was speaking of what we own . WILTON BURGESS ( Enigmatically ) So I thought . RHY But you were thinking of the  --  the other thing . WILTON BURGESS Is n't it a bit natural , sometimes ? RHY ( Quietly ) It 's generally the woman who  --   --  WILTON BURGESS Men do n't say it . RHY ( Moved ) I felt you blaming me these many months ; maybe it 's been years . WILTON BURGESS ( Tenderly ) I 've not blamed you , dear . I have only been waiting for you to speak . RHY You have been disappointed . ( He rises and throws the cigar in the fireplace . ) But we were so poor at the start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have children we ought first to be able to give them everything . p. 6 WILTON BURGESS Yes ; I fooled myself , too . RHY ( Quickly ) Do you believe that I  --   --  ? WILTON BURGESS Maybe we both have been cowards ! RHY Wilton ! WILTON BURGESS Yes , afraid to assume the responsibility . ( Seeing she is unhappy ) But do n't let 's talk of it , dear . RHY ( With some difficulty ) We must ; it 's always in your thoughts . WILTON BURGESS ( Coming to her and taking her hands ) Is n't it ever in yours ? RHY ( Lowering her eyes ) That 's unkind of you . WILTON BURGESS Well , anyway , I must n't hurt you like this . Forgive me ! Maybe the accident shook me up a bit . RHY ( Dully ) You wo n't understand . WILTON BURGESS Perhaps fear is natural with some women . I do n't blame them . RHY ( Quickly ) I 'm not afraid of having a child . I 'm afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its enthusiasm , its hopes . p. 7 WILTON BURGESS Is life so terrible ? RHY Yes ; when one thinks of it . WILTON BURGESS ( Tenderly ) Do n't you ever feel like giving life , Rhy ? RHY ( Slowly , as though trying to fathom her intimate feelings ) Sometimes : yes , sometimes ; only  --  something holds me back . There 's something locked : some barrier that needs sweeping away . ( Half desperately ) Oh , if I were only sure of life . WILTON BURGESS ( Turning away ) One never is . RHY There are moments when one knows everything . WILTON BURGESS ( Thoughtfully , after a long silence ) It 's been ten years . We 're getting older , and soon you  --   --  RHY ( Lowering her eyes ) I know . WILTON BURGESS There should n't be too many years between parents and their children . They both lose touch as they grow older . RHY ( Shyly ) But I 'm not ready yet . Unless  --  unless  --  you  --   --  ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some men do . WILTON BURGESS ( Soothing her ) I never will , Rhy . I think it should be a mutual wish . RHY ( Close to him ) You 've been a dear . You 've always considered me . I realize , when I hear other wives talk , what it means to have a husband like you . WILTON BURGESS I have never forgotten that it is you who bear the child . RHY ( Slowly ) And in your heart you think I 've taken advantage of your  --  your consideration ? WILTON BURGESS I only know there are millions of mothers ! RHY ( Gazing thoughtfully before her ) I wonder how many would have been mothers if they 'd known all they had to go through , or if they 'd even had my experience bringing up children ? It was all left on my shoulders , you know , when mother died . WILTON BURGESS ( With an unconscious touch of bitterness ) But I never like to believe it was the care you gave your two little sisters which was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 9 RHY Do n't say that . WILTON BURGESS Well , then : robbed me of my right . RHY Your right ? WILTON BURGESS I did n't mean to use that harsh word . RHY It 's as good as any other to describe your feeling . WILTON BURGESS Rhy ? ( With consideration again . ) What is a husband to do if he loves his wife and wants children and  --  and finds his house empty ? RHY Empty ? Wilton , I 'm here . I love you . Ca n't I be everything to you as you are to me ? WILTON BURGESS It is n't a question of that . RHY It is with me . And maybe that 's the reason I ca n't give myself completely to the other . WILTON BURGESS What do you mean ? RHY That sometimes a child takes a woman away from her husband . WILTON BURGESS I see . I see . You do n't trust yourself . RHY It is n't that . ( Inadvertently ) Only , maybe , I 'm not sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 10 RHY ( Defensively ) Many men do before the child comes . But do you know what it means ? Does any man really know beforehand ? We 've been so close in everything , Wilton ; I 've shared your work . Every day I 've gone to the office with you , just as when we were starting our little shop together ; and even now when we have assistants and some one else could do my work . That would all have to be changed , dear . WILTON BURGESS Maybe I  --  I would like it to be changed . ( She withdraws her hands from his shoulders as though hurt . ) I never could have been where I am without you . I realize that . But we have everything , as you say . I suppose it 's a masculine instinct , yet I hate to see you work every day with those children , posing them , handling them , understanding them like a born mother . And then always the thought they 're not our children . They belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want them . Oh , I simply ca n't see you there any longer , Rhy . RHY ( Sharply ) You want to take my work from me ? WILTON BURGESS No . But  --   --  RHY ( With feeling ) All the years I 've shared it with you , built it up , helped you . Was n't it my suggestion that you specialize on children 's pictures ? Has n't it all been my work as well as yours ? p. 11 WILTON BURGESS ( Testily ) Yes , but for what have we worked ? Just for ourselves ? Is that all there is in life ? ( With a quick , intuitive glance ) Rhy ! Is that why you 're afraid of motherhood ? RHY No , no . WILTON BURGESS Your work does mean more to you than that . RHY ( Defending herself ) Would you give up your work to be a father ? WILTON BURGESS Do n't be absurd . It 's not the same with a man . RHY It 's a choice many women have to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RHY I should want to give everything to my child . I could n't bear to have anybody else care for it . I know all the risks , all the dangers . I 've been through it . I know the incompetence of nurses  --  nurses to whom we trust those little tender lives . Oh , I 'd worry every moment , as I did with my sisters . It 's the way I 'm made . I 'd have to do everything myself . ( She sinks in the chair and he finally comes to her , very tenderly . ) WILTON BURGESS It 's all right , Rhy . We must n't let it come between us . That 's all , girl , dear . p. 12 RHY ( Murmuring , as she kisses his hand ) Just wait  --  wait . ( They stare thoughtfully before them a long while . The bell rings and , as it is repeated , it gradually seems to bring them out of their mood . ) WILTON BURGESS I was sure I heard the bell  --   --  RHY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of night ? WILTON BURGESS Possibly a telegram . RHY You 'd better go . ( He goes out and she seems puzzled . ) What a curious feeling  --  who can it be ? ( RHY goes back as though half-impelled in spite of herself , and listens to the conversation , outside . ) THE WOMAN Mr. Burgess ? WILTON BURGESS ( Somewhat gruffly ) Yes . THE WOMAN Please may I see you a moment , inside ? WILTON BURGESS But  --   --  THE WOMAN ( Poignantly ) Please  --  please  --  only for a moment . Please . p. 13 RHY ( As though moved ) Let her come in , Wilton . ( BURGESS returns , followed timidly by THE WOMAN , who is middle-aged , poorly dressed , with a thin , pale face and tired eyes . She carries a medium-sized package wrapped in a newspaper . She looks up and sees RHY . There is an embarrassed pause . ) RHY ( Kindly ) Do you wish to see my husband , alone ? THE WOMAN Your husband ? Oh , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady here with me will help him to understand better . WILTON BURGESS ( Impatiently ) But if you 've any business , why did n't you come and see me at my office ? THE WOMAN ( Simply ) I go to work before your office is open . WILTON BURGESS I 'm always there till after five . THE WOMAN I work till six . RHY ( Who has been somewhat mysteriously impressed ) Sit down . You must be tired . THE WOMAN ( Sitting on the edge of the chair ) Thanks . p. 14 RHY ( After a pause ) You 're trembling . Are you cold ? THE WOMAN No : guess I 'm shaky coming to a gentleman 's house like this . RHY But you must have had a good reason . THE WOMAN ( Quickly ) Oh , I have . ( Turning to Mr. BURGESS ) I 've come to bring you something what 's yours . WILTON BURGESS ( Surprised ) Mine ? THE WOMAN ( Indicating package ) I left it at the door , like they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went across the street to see if you 'd get it . But you did n't go to the door . I was fraid it would get broken or stolen if I left it there all night . I could n't leave it , so I thought you 'd let me explain . ( With some slight hesitation THE WOMAN nervously unwraps the package . She hands a small framed photograph timidly to BURGESS , who is greatly surprised on seeing it . RHY watches , puzzled and interested . ) WILTON BURGESS ( Rather sharply ) Where did you get this ? THE WOMAN ( Nervously ) I can explain . A friend . She gave it to me to give you ' cause she wanted to be sure you 'd get it back safe , and ' cause she was afraid if she brought it back herself , you might arrest her . p. 15 RHY What is she saying , Wilton ? WILTON BURGESS Your friend was right . But I do n't see how your coming is going to save her . THE WOMAN ( Poignantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with it ? RHY What is it , Wilton ? THE WOMAN ( Slowly ) It 's the picture what was stolen from your showcase . WILTON BURGESS ( Eyeing her ) If your friend were afraid of arrest , why did n't she send it back by express or destroy it ? THE WOMAN Destroy that ? Oh , she could n't do it . She tried . ( Quickly , as he eyes her suspiciously ) She told me she tried . RHY Let me see it , Wilton . ( THE WOMAN takes it from BURGESS , gives it a quick glance , and hands it to RHY , returning to her seat . ) RHY Oh , yes ; I remember . THE WOMAN ( Her face glowing ) Ai n't he beautiful ? RHY Yes , I suppose so . p. 16 THE WOMAN ( She speaks as though it were all real , while they listen with increased interest ) My friend told me the boy used to call for her to take him from the show-case every day , when she went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still on , and every evening when she went home in the dark . She 'd heard him calling when she was working , when all the other noises in the shop were trying to drown his voice . And she could n't just wait till she could stand alone before him . And he 'd talk to her and want to be taken out of the cold to his toys and his little bed . And when she 'd come again the next morning , he 'd tell her he hated being shut up with nobody to pull the covers up or pat him in the night . My friend told me she had to do what he asked . RHY ( Impressed ) This little boy ? THE WOMAN ( Smiling ) Yes , her little boy , as he seemed to be , always calling , day and night , for her to take him from the showcase . RHY Strange ! THE WOMAN She seemed to live only for him . She had a child of her own at last . RHY She has no children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILTON BURGESS So she broke the glass and stole it , eh ? THE WOMAN Yes . Every night she 'd come back , but people were always near . One night it was raining . She waited till the street was empty . In the dark , nobody heard her break the glass . Then the little boy and her were alone in the rain . She put him close to her so he would n't get wet . She ran home . He kept her warm . She could feel him loving at her breast  --  her dry breast . Oh  --  ( There is a pause ) Then she put him on a chair beside her bed and she slept for the first time since she 'd seen him . RHY ( Tenderly ) Then why did n't she keep him ? THE WOMAN Because her room was dirty and small and she was away all day working , and it was n't no place to keep a child . WILTON BURGESS Let me have the photograph , Rhy . ( He takes it and THE WOMAN eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Umph ! so she wanted you enough to steal you ? Well , my little lad , we 'll not have you tempting people like that . ( He lifts it high above him as though intending to break it . ) THE WOMAN ( Startled ) Do n't ! p. 18 WILTON BURGESS ( Putting it down slowly and speaking kindly ) You stole it yourself . THE WOMAN ( Faltering ) Yes . WILTON BURGESS I thought so . RHY Oh ! THE WOMAN ( With emotion ) Do n't turn away from me , Mrs. Burgess . I ai n't a real thief . I did it because I did n't have what other women had . Because I had so much to give the boy ! ( There is a pause as THE WOMAN lowers her eyes and quietly sobs . BURGESS watches her as though trying to think what to do . RHY gazes at her , then goes slowly to her , putting her hand on THE WOMAN 'S shoulder . THE WOMAN looks up , takes it impulsively , and then lets it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't used to having people kind to me . RHY ( With a certain awe ) And you work in a shop ten hours a day . THE WOMAN Yes . Ten hours . RHY Oh , the waste , Wilton  --  the waste ! WILTON BURGESS Yes ; when women have so much motherhood to give and ca n't or wo n't . ( RHY looks at her husband , understanding his implication . Then wiping her eyes , she gazes at THE WOMAN , who sits with her head bowed in depression. ) p. 19 RHY Do you love the little boy ? THE WOMAN Yes . WILTON BURGESS You talk as though the photograph were something real . THE WOMAN He wanted love . It 's in his eyes . WILTON BURGESS That 's odd . RHY Whose child is it , Wilton ? WILTON BURGESS The Burlingames ' . He 's gone to the dogs : you know what became of his wife . THE WOMAN And they had a beautiful boy like that ! WILTON BURGESS ( Smiling ) Why , the boy 's a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This photograph was taken years ago . THE WOMAN ( Startled ) He 's grown up ? WILTON BURGESS Yes . THE WOMAN ( Poignantly ) And his curls ? Have they cut his curls ? WILTON BURGESS Why , of course . THE WOMAN ( As though she had lost everything ) Oh , I never thought he 'd grow up ! ( There seems nothing they can say : they look at each other , deeply moved . Then they watch her as she rises and sighs like one who has had to accept all things in life . ) I 'll be going now if you 'll let me. p. 20 WILTON BURGESS I 'd really forgotten all about this . I did n't even report it to the police . So you 've nothing to fear . THE WOMAN There ai n't much difference in jail and my work except I can walk out at night . RHY ( Impulsively ) Would you like the photograph ? WILTON BURGESS Yes : do take it . THE WOMAN ( Refusing it , with difficulty ) No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed to grow sadder there . Maybe he was like the other children . ( They look at her in question . ) They 're all like that  --  the real ones ; they like me a little at first , but I feel them grow away from me . I thought he would n't because  --  because he was only make-believe . And he looked like him . RHY Him ? THE WOMAN ( Simply ) Him I was promised to marry . That 's what 's so hard . He died and I 've nothing of him only what 's in my thoughts . I wanted a kid so and then he was took off sudden and I was alone . ( Wistfully ) Oh , it 's awful not to have something that 's your man 's ; something you can see living about you  --  that keeps speakin ' to you with his eyes or looks , after he 's gone and a woman 's left alone  --   --  p. 21 WILTON BURGESS ( Quietly ) Would you like if , instead , we put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Eagerly ) Oh , would you ? WILTON BURGESS The first thing in the morning . Yes . THE WOMAN That will be something when I walk past . WILTON BURGESS And will you come in and see me to-morrow after your work is finished ? I 'll wait for you . Maybe we can find something else for you to do , if you wish . THE WOMAN Oh , thanks . Thanks . ( Turning to RHY , who has stood lost in thought . ) Good-night , Mrs. Burgess . RHY Good-night . THE WOMAN ( Smiling ) I thought a mother would help a man to understand . RHY A mother ! THE WOMAN I feel so much happier now . Good-night . ( RHY stares before her The others go out . She does not move . A curious glow comes into her face . A deep emotion slowly floods a definite thought which has taken possession of her . She half swoons . The outer door closes and BURGESS re-enters. ) p. 22 RHY Wilton ! Wilton ! ! ( Goes to him embracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ! WILTON BURGESS ( Not understanding ) Rhy , what 's come over you ? RHY It might have been yesterday ! ( Terrified at the thought ) Oh , it would kill me if an accident or  --   --  WILTON BURGESS ( Trying to quiet her ) She 's upset you , Rhy . RHY ( Clutching him close ) Oh , I never thought of it that way ! Being left alone without having  --  oh ! WILTON BURGESS ( Slowly understanding ) Dearest ? RHY ( Sobbing hysterically ) She 's broken something in me . She 's swept away things  --   --  WILTON BURGESS Do n't cry  --  do n't ! Little wife . RHY ( Almost shyly ) Dearest , you 'll be good to me ? If  --   --  ( He kisses her for an answer , and holds her tenderly in his arms. )
