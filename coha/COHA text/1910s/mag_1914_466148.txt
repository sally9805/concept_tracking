THERE are two kinds of electricity ( as Du Faye discovered in 1734 ) , which , from the way their properties are contrasted , are called " positive " and " negative . " If an electrified body is attracted by one kind of electricity it is repelled by the other ; and , moreover , whenever one kind makes its appearance in one place , an equal quantity of the other kind appears simultaneously somewhere else . Franklin regarded electrification as due to the movement of something which he called the electric fluid . This he supposed to be a constituent of all bodies , even when they are not electrified . When not electrified , any body contains a definite " as when a solid or liquid body is negatively electrified . They form a portion of the atoms of all kinds of matter , each atom containing a definite number of corpuscles . For atoms other than hydrogen the number of corpuscles in the atom is about half the atomic weight ; thus helium , whose atomic weight is four , has two corpuscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen , has eight ; and so on . Hydrogen , whose atomic weight is one , has probably one corpuscle in its atom . The process of electrification consists in taking corpuscles from one body and giving them to another . On this view , negative electricity is molecular in structure , and all negative charges are integral multiples of a certain unit whose value is now known well as to elements ; it can , however , only be applied to substances which can be obtained in the gaseous state . The apparatus for obtaining the photographs is represented in Fig. 6 . A is the discharge tube in which the gases are contained ; II , the anode , and C , the cathode , of this tube are connected with the terminals of an induction coil ; a very narrow long tube runs through the cathode , and through this the positive rays pass into the left-hand portion of the tube , where they run between the poles of an electro-magnet , M. R and S are the terminals attached to the plates h ; h nneon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all known substances , but in addition to these there is a parab-ola ( marked with a cross in the illustra-tion ) just below the long parabola which corresponds to neon , indicating an ele-ment whose atomic weight is zz ; the atomic weight of neon is zo . This element is new ; its properties must be very similar to those of neon , for it has been found in every sample of neon tested . Some of these had been very carefully puri-fied and had , in fact , been used in the determination of the atomic weight of that ele-ment . Thus the gas a positively electrified part containing the rest of the mass and thus much more massive than the negatively electrified part of the atom . In this view , no part of the atom can be regarded as unelectrified . It is thus a matter of great interest to study the atoms and molecules from which some of the corpuscles have been extracted . A method by which this can be done , known as the method of Positive Rays , is based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1886 . Goldstein found that when the electric discharge went through gas at a low pressure in a glass vessel like that shown in Fig. r , where the cathode is pierced by a narrow tube passing through it at right angles , the following effects were to be noticed : In front of the cathode the cathode rays streamed upward , making their presence known by a greenish-yellow phosphorescence on the places where they struck against the glass , and also producing a faint luminosity in the gas through which they passed . In addition to this , however , there was something streaming downward through the tube in the cathode , something which also made the gas through which it passed luminous , though the luminosity was of a different color from that produced by the cathode rays , and also , like the cathode rays , made the glass phosphorescent when it struck against it , though again this phosphorescence was of a different color from that due to the cathode rays . These effects are shown in a very striking way if the gas in the tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere ; with this gas the luminosity produced in it by the rays passing downward through the tube in the cathode is a gorgeous red , while the cathode rays going upward produce a faint bluish luminosity which is much less striking . The rays coming through tubes or channels in the cathode were called , by Goldstein , Kanalstrahlen ; they are now , for reasons which will appear immediately , more usually called positive rays . One very remarkable difference between these rays and those which travel from the cathode in the opposite direction ? the ordinary cathodic rays ? is seen when a magnet is brought near the tube ; the cathodic rays are strongly affected by the magnet , the edges of the patches of phosphorescence on the glass move about when the magnet is moved , and when there is enough gas in the tube to make their paths visible these paths are seen to change at the approach of the magnet . No appreciable effect , however , is produced on the positive rays by a magnet sufficiently powerful to produce large deflectionsof the cathode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elapsed after Gold-stein 's discovery that Wien , by applying very intense magnetic fields , proved that the positive rays were deflected by magnetic forces and that the direction of the deflection showed that these rayswere charged with positive electricity . As the deflections of these rays by electric and magnetic forces are the means we use to study the properties of i the rays , it is necessary to say a word about the laws of such deflections . Suppose that we have a charged particle ? moving horizontally and that it passes between N and S , the poles of a magnet ( Fig. 2 ) , the line joining the poles being also horizontal , but at right angles to the path of the particle . Let 0 be the place where the particle would strike a screen if it were not deflected ; if it passes between the poles of the magnet it will be deflected vertically and will hit the screen , not at 0 , but at a point , P , vertically above it . The distance OP depends on the velocity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing between the poles of the magnet were all of the same kind and moving at the same speed , they would , in spite of the deflection , all strike the screen in the same spot ; but they will not do so even if they have the same mass if their speeds are different ; the slow particles will he more deflected than the fast ones , and the spot will be prolonged to a line . When there are several kinds of particles , each kind will give its own line , and these may overlap and get mixed up with one another . To separate all the particles , we act on them by electric as well as magnetic forces , by making them pass between two parallel vertical plates , I ? M , L being charged with positive and M with negative electricity . The electric force produced by these charged plates deflects the particles which would have struck the screen at P to another point , Q. and , since the laws of deflection for the electric force are not the same as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen at the same point unless they have the same mass and also the same speed . By measuring the deflections due to the magnetic and electric forces we can determine the mass of the particles and also their speed . Thus if we had a stream of different kinds of particles , or of particles of the same kind moving with different velocities , all mixed up together and moving in one direction so that they would all hit the screen at the same point , 0 , if they were not deflected , they will , if they pass through the magnet and between the plates , he sorted out and the different kinds of particles will hit the screen in different places . The slowly moving particles and those which have a small mass will be farthest away from 0 , while the fast ones and also the heavy ones will be close in to 0 . Again , particles which are of the same kind but are moving with different velocities will strike the screen at points which lie on a curve : this curve is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of particles moving with different velocities , they would , under the action of the electric and magnetic forces , be sorted out into a series of parabolic arcs , i and if we measured the dimensions of the parabolas we should he able to determine the value of the mass of the various particles , whichproduce them . i I his is the method i which is now always i employed to nvesti- gate the nature of the electrified particles in a gas . Fortunately , when these rapidly moving electrified particles strike against a photographic plate they affect the plate so that when it is developed a permanent record of the place where the particles struck the plate is preserved and the dimensions of the parabola can be measured at leisure . If we treat a beam of cathode rays in this way ? i. e. , expose them to magnetic and electric forces and then allow them to fall on a photo-graphic plate placed inside the tube ? we shall find that the photograph shows only one parabola ; this proves that all the cathode particles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we put different gases in the tube we find that the size of the parabola is unaltered , thus proving that the cathode particles are the same whatever may be the gas from which they are derived . By measuring this parabola we can find the mass of these cathodic particles ; in this way It has been shown that their mass is only 1/1700 of an atom of hydrogen . If we sort out the positive rays which stream through the tube in the cathode , by the electric and magnetic deflections ? to do this we must use much stronger magnets than for the cathode rays ? we find a very different state of things . Instead of one parabola we have several , and these change when the gas in the tube is altered . An example of such photographs of the positive rays is shown in Fig. 3 ; by measuring the photograph we find that the parabolas , counting from the top downward , on Fig. 3 are due to the atom of hydrogen , the molecule of hy-drogen , the atoms of carbon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carbon dioxide , and the VOL . CXXIX. ? No. 772. - 71 atom of mercury . All these are positively charged ; the central undeflected spot is due to particles which are not charged with electricity , while the parabolas on the left are due to negatively charged atoms of hydrogen , carbon , and oxygen ; the latter are very faint . The parabola on Fig. 4. is due to mercury . Fig. 5 is a photograph taken when the i gas in the tube was air and the gases given out by the electrodes and from the walls of the tube . It will he observed that the positive electricity is always on atoms and molecules of the chemical elements ; unlike negative electricity , it never occurs apart from ordinary matter ; nothing corresponding to corpuscles or electrons has been observed with positive electricity . We must regard the positively electrified particles as atoms or molecules from which corpuscles have been extracted , and the process of electrification as consisting in the detachment of corpuscles from the atoms of the gas which is electrified . IISE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of atom produces a definite and distinct parabola on the photographic plate , and since by meas-uring the parabola we can determine the mass of the atom which produces it , it is evident that we have here a method of analyzing the gases in the discharge tube . Before discussing the details of this method we may point out that these photographs supply very convincing evidence of the molecular constitution of matter . The fact that from the mixture of gases in the tube we get a few definite parabolas and not a diffused blur spread all over the plate shows that the mixture is made up of a small number of different types of particles and that the masses of the particles of any one type are identical . It has sometimes been supposed that the atomic weight of an element ( let us take oxygen as an example ) merely represents an average value , and that the masses of the different atoms of oxygen might vary considerably . The photographs show , however , that this can not be the case , for if the masses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , then instead of a single sharp parabola representing the oxygen in the tube we should have a great number of these curves forming as a whole a band bounded by two parabolas , the breadth of this band indicating the range over which the masses of the different oxygen atoms spread ; the fact that we get a sharp parabola instead of such a band shows that all the atoms have the same mass . Another point shown by these parabolas is that the molecules of some elements contain two atoms , others only one ; thus for each of the gases , hydrogen , nitrogen , and oxygen , we find two parabolas , one corresponding to the atom , the other to the molecule , while for helium , argon , and mercury vapor we find only one parabola , that corresponding to the atom . These parabolas are perhaps the most direct proof we possess that an elementary gas consists of a great number of parts all exactly equal to one another . To return , however , to their use for chemical analysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gas , each element in the tube producing one or more parabolas on the plate ; the assemblage of such parabolas may be called the positive-ray spectrum . The advantage of the positive-ray method of analysis may be illustrated by comparing it with the ordinary method of spectrum analysis . If the ordinary spectrum showed a line which did not correspond to one in the spectrum of any known element , the most that could be said would be that some unknown i substance was present in the tube , and there would be some uncertainty even about this ; for the spectra of the elements vary so much with the electrical conditions under which they are produced that we could not be sure , without further research , that the new line was not due to a change in the electrical conditions affecting the spectrum of a known substance rather than to the presence of some new element . With the positive-ray spectrum , on the other hand , when a new parabola is detected we know at once from its dimensions the atomic weight of the substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new substance , but determines at the same time its atomic weight , the spectrum registering the atomic weight of all the elements in the tube . The presence of impurities causes no inconvenience with this method ; the parabolas due to them are added to the others without interfering with them . Again , the quantity of substance required for analysis is exceedingly small ; thus , using ordinary commercial photographic plates , it is easy to detect the helium in a cubic centimeter of air ; according to Sir William Ramsay , the helium in the atmosphere only amounts to four parts in a million , so that the quantity of helium in a cubic centimeter of air is only about one-two-hundredth part of a cubic millimeter , and this can be detected by ordinary plates ; with specially prepared plates it is possible to detect one-fiftieth of this amount . Thus the method is not only much more definite than spectrum analysis ; it is also more sensitive ; it has the advantage , too , of being applicable to compounds as well as to elements ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be obtained in the gaseous state . The apparatus for obtaining the photographs is represented in Fig. 6 . A is the discharge tube in which the gases are contained ; B , the anode , and C , the cathode , of this tube are connected with the terminals of an induction coil ; a very narrow long tube runs through the cathode , and through this the positive rays pass into the left-hand portion of the tube , where they run between the poles of an electro-magnet , M. R and S are the terminals attached to the plates which , when charged , produce the electric deflection . The photographic plate is in the box P at the end of the tube ; it is suspended by a silk thread and lowered by a winch . As it is exceedingly important that the pressure in the part of the apparatus near the photographic plate should he as small as possible , a tube containing cocoanut charcoal is attached to this part of the apparatus . Before taking the photograph this tube is lowered into a vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great avidity and thus reduces the pressure of the gas in the left-hand side of the apparatus . A photograph of the apparatus in actual use is shown in Fig. 7 . As an example of the use of this method we may consider its application to the analysis of the gases in the atmosphere . Fig. 8 shows the positive-ray photograph when the gas in the discharge tube is air from which the more condensable constituents have been removed . The parabolas on the plate correspond to helium , carbon , nitrogen , neon , carbon monoxide , and carbon dioxide ; these are all known substances , but in addition to these there is a parabola ( marked with a cross in the illustration ) just below the long parabola which corresponds to neon , indicating an element whose atomic weight is 22 ; the atomic weight of neon is 20 . This element is new ; its properties must be very similar to those of neon , for it has been found in every sample of neon tested . Some of these had been very carefully purified and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atomic weight of that element . Thus the gas known as neon is really a mixture of two gases , one having an atomic weight of about 20 , the other an atomic weight of 22 . The parabola corresponding to the heavier gas is much fainter than that corresponding to the lighter one , so that in the atmosphere there is much more of the lighter gas . Mr. Aston , by allowing a mixture of the two gases to diffuse through the walls of a clay tobacco-pipe , has effected apartial separation of the two con-stituents , though as these have so nearly the same atomic weights the process is very slow and tedious . Another interesting thing discovered by examining these photographs is the existence of a parabola corresponding to a substance whose atomic weight is three ; we shall for the present call this substance X3 . The parabola corresponding to it is the third from the top in Fig. 9 ; the top parabola is that due to the atom , and the second that due to the molecule of hydrogen . The X3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear sporadically on the plates ; now and then a plate would show it and then weeks would pass before it was observed again ; and it took some time to discover the conditions necessary for its production . After many sources had been tested , it was found that it almost invariably occurred among the gases given off by solids when they are bombarded by cathode rays . All substances give off gases , chiefly hydrogen and carbon monoxide and dioxide under such bomb a rdment , and among these gases X , is nearly always found . The nature of X , was for some time obscure , but now I have little doubt that it consists of three atoms of hydrogen and is represented by the formula bearing , in fact , the same relation to hydrogen that ozone does to oxygen . The reasons for this conclusion are as follows : it is found when we bombard pure substances containing hydrogen , such as ice at the temperature of liquid air , or solid ammonia at the same temperature ; a continuous supply of it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as caustic potash . Another very strong reason is that it can be produced by sending suitable electric discharges through pure hydrogen ; it is produced , for example , by electrodeless discharges through this gas . Indeed , with very sensitive photographic plates the X , line can generally be detected when there is a considerable proportion of hydrogen in the discharge tube used to generate the positive rays . The reason why bombardment with cathode rays so readily produces the gas is that the secondary discharge which substances give off under such circumstances may be just the right type of discharge to produce X , when it passes through hydrogen . If kept in the dark or free from oxygen , X , can be kept for a considerable time ; it combines , however , with oxygen if exposed to light , or if a strong electric discharge is sent through the mixture ; it is not to be found when there is much mercury vapor in the discharge tube , so that presumably it combines with this gas ; it corn bines with red-hot- copper oxide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not nearly so readily as in the case of hydrogen itself . Another advantage of the positive-ray method is that it is capable of detecting particles which only exist for a very short time ; the time taken by a particle to pass from the discharge tube and be registered on the photographic plate is far less than the millionth part of a second , so that a particle need nor live longer than this to make its mark on the plate . It is hoped that this method will enable us to get some knowledge of what goes on during chemical combination . It is commonly believed that between the initial and final stages of many chem ical reactions there are a series of in- termediate stages in which unstable and transitory chemical compounds are formed ; if this is so , then we may hope to get by the positive-ray method direct evidence of the existence of such compounds . The results obtained by the positive rays show that positive electrification is associated with masses which are the same as the masses of the atoms and molecules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms of the eighty or so of those dements nothing in common ? Are they not all built up of units , these units being either all of one type or , at most , of a small number of types ? This view found very definite expression in Prout 's celebrated hypothesis that the atoms of the different elements are all aggregations of hydrogen atoms . It also receives a great deal of support from MendeleePs periodic law and from the numerical relations which exist between the atomic weights of the different elements . Again , in the ease of the transformation of the radioactive elements we find a series of elements which are derived from one another by the emission of alpha particles ; these particles are masses with the atomic weight of helium charged with two units of positive electricity . The simplest interpretation of this result is that atoms of helium are constituents of the radio-active elements . The consideration of the atomic weights of the lighter elements suggests that these , too , have a common constituent whose atomic weight is 4 . This , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The numbers from i to 4o are written in four columns , the first column containing those which can be divided by 4 without a remainder , the numbers in the second , third , and fourth columns giving , when divided by four , the remainders I , 2 , 3 , respectively . When there is an element whose atomic weight is equal to any number , the symbol representing that element is written by the side of the number ; if there is no element with this atomic weight , a circle incloses the number . The number in parentheses by the side of the symbol representing the element represents the group to which the element belongs in the Mendeleefian classification . It will be seen that with only three exceptions , and one of those is hydrogen , all elements occur in the first and fourth columns , and that very few numbers occur in these columns which are not the atomic weights of elements . Thus with few exceptions the atomic weights of the lighter elements are either of the form 4n , or 4n+3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first group are built up of helium atoms , those in the second of three hydrogen atoms with a variable number of helium atoms . We see , too , that in either group the addition of 4 to the atomic weight ( the addition of an atom of helium ) increases by 2 the Mendeleefian group to which the elements belong . For atomic weights greater than 4o the law is not so clear ; there are indications that at this stage of development there is a discontinuity in the way the constituent parts of the atom are arranged . It is true that the atomic weights of the elements are not exactly round numbers ; we should not , however , expect this to be the case even if their atoms were built up of atoms of helium and hydrogen . For according to the electro- magnetic theory the masses of an aggregate of such atoms would not necessarily be equal to the sum of the masses of the atoms when isolated . The difference on this theory would he proportional to the work required to split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result assumes , however , that all the forces inside the atom arc electrical , and that the electrical forces between the small charges in the atom separated by the infinitesimal atomic distances follow exactly the same laws as those we know to be followed when the distances between the charged bodies are millions of times the atomic distances and the quantities of electricity millions of times the atomic charges . We are not yet in a position to affirm that this assumption is legitimate , and therefore not able to calculate the small changes in mass which take place when atoms aggregate .
