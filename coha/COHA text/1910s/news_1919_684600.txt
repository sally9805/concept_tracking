txt MR . ROOT 'S PROPOSALS . Where Their Adoption Would Leave the United States .. To the editor of The New York Times : As I read Mr. Root 's letter on the covenant Of ' the League- of Nations , his third proposal , reserving American traditional policy ; ' when taken in connee- : tion with his first , . refusing consent to Article X. , seems not quite'so harmless RS your editorial comment of June 29 would imply . The effect of reftfaing consent to Article X. is to withdraw the United States from the League of Nations so far as its most important business , the prevention of aggressive warfare , is concerned . ' The United States , then , no long-e ? amember of ' the League in this respect , further insists by the third propoial upon no * ? " relinquishment of its traditional attitude toward purely American questions . " What does this add to the rejection of Article X. ? Something . depends upon tije *interpretation to be given to the word " purely , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Monroe Doctrine , the term must include such interference with American States as wars proposed by the Holy Alliance , leading to President Monroe 's original declaration , and such attempts as Napoleon ' III . ' s in Mexico. , The settlement of such questions as these , the defense of American States against such aggression , the United States exclusively assumes ; outside interference , the interference of the League , 10 not to be tolerated . Such questions are withdrawn from the province of the League , . and this is What I understand to be desired by the extreme opponents of the covenant . Orie probable result will be the failure of the plan to form a League ; but stippose the other nations go on to organize the League without the United States , what will be the result ? With reference to aggressive attacks upon the peace of a nation , the world will be divided into two great spheres , the American continents and the rest of the world . ' In one protection will be granted by a league in which nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rected by a council of nations ; in the other there is no league , but affairs are directed by a single ovrwhelniinFly powerful nation , , assuming a self-appointed office and providing no way in which the voice of any othet'n'ation is to be heard . Such an imperial position for the United . States , which seems inevitable*if Mr. Root 's plan as a whole is actually put into operation , goes . far beyond any official interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine yet made , and it will be interesting to see . wha.t the other American nations will say to it . Are they necessarily excluded from the League of ? Nations by this action ' of the United . States , . or , if they adopt the Covenant including Article X. and the United States adopts the whole Root plan , what kind of a practical situation will result ? What actual steps would the United States then propose to ? take when a question under the Monroe Doctrine arose ? There is also a further complication . The words " purely American . questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exclude all such . questions as have heretofore arisen under the Monroe Doctrine , like those specified above or like the Venezuelan boundary question , because the interest of a non-American State is equally involved with the American . They are not purely American questions . But historically the United States has ' not concerned itself with ' questions of war and peace which have ; neen ? ? in ity purely American . Chile and Peru may go to war with each other , and the war may end with very important boundary changes , with no violation of the Monroe Doctrine . What about such questions in the fitture ? Does the Root position exclude them from the field of the League , even if the American . nations involved have adopted the entire covenant , and , if so , is the United States to enlarge the Sphere of ? its action and take on this normal function of the League ? If Mr. Root 's first proposal is rejected and the covenant is ratified by the Senate , including Article X. , then the third proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Republican Senators may consider carefully how the situation in which we should be left by the adoption of the whole Root plan could be opracticall to saave us from sucherated a difficult and illy ogical position .

Principal Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute . Tuskegee Institute , Ala. , July 3 , 1919 : Repeal of Wartime Prohibition . To the Editor of The New York Tones : With the shuffling of responsibility of ending tine Congressional wartime prohibition between the President and Congress , it seems that the courts will be called upon to . restrain the fanaticism of the prohibitionists until the constitutional amendment shall take . effect .. The validity of the wartime prohibition.law of Nov. 21 , 1918 , depends on its being a necessary means to the war power of Congress . To save food or increase efficiency is no longer a necessary means to the war power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 116 U. S. 572 , 583 . ; " It is no . answer to the objection of unconstitutionality , as was said In Poindexter v. Greonhow , supra , that the statute whose application in the particular case is sought to be restrained is not void on Its face , but Is complained of only because Its operation in the particular instance works a violation of a constitutional right ; for the cases are numerous where the tax laws of the State , which In their general and proper application are perfectly valid , have been held to become void . in particular cases either as ' unconstitutional regulations of commerce , or as violations of contracts prohibited by the Constitution , or because In some other way they operate to deprive the party complaining of a right secured by the Constitution of the United States .
