FOR historical significance , for scenic environment , and for fascination and vagary in the course of its stream , the Columbia is is the premier river of the continent . In length it ranks fourth among the rivers of the United States ; in commerical importance it holds fifth place among the rivers of the world . From its source in British Columbia , the international waterway pursues an erratic path for fourteen hundred miles , emptying into the Pacific on the coast of the United States . The area drained by the main stream and its tributaries comprises 250,000 square miles , ? a mighty empire whose configuration varies from fertile flatlands to fierce crags and icy ranges , from gray dusty levels and reclaimed acres to soaring cliffs fretted with moss , hung with waterfalls , and surmounted by single peaks which lift their shining summits two miles above the river-edge . No vale more placid than that of the Columbia 's birth ever cradled a stream .  | But the waters that track the Windermere meadows with rippling silver break into furious rapids beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sunny plains of Washington , and charge a treacherous and curiously disordered course approaching the Cascade Range . Five mountain chains survey the Columbia during its progress to the sea . The source , Upper Columbia Lake , is at the base of the lofty Purcell Range , west of the Rocky Mountains . Flowing in a northerly direction out of this small body of water , situated eighty miles above the Canadian border , the river moves between - forested foothills of the Rockies and the Selkirks . Gathering tribute from both watersheds , it reaches a point two hundred miles north of its source , then turns south , making an inverted U which encloses the Selkirks . Near Revelstoke the Gold Range appears as the western wall of a high-towered valley which continues to the frontier . When at last the Columbia nears the end of its majestic windings , the Cascades run counter to its bed . The Search for the River The story of the Columbia embraces the political and economical history and the romance of the Northwest . The existence of a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported by Indians , and became a tradition among the first Spanish adventurers who , about the middle of the sixteenth century , began to explore the coast north of California . In 1602 , a Spanish squadron under Vizcaino reported " a rapid and abundant river " whose current at the outlet made exploration too difficult to be attempted by them . Aguilar , commander of one of the Spanish frigates , sighted the estuary of the fabled stream , to which he gave his name ? one of several names bestowed upon the great river by Europeans . In 1766 , Captain Jonathan Carver , of the American Provincial troops , undertook a journey from Boston to St. Paul to secure information concerning the Indian nations that inhabited " the back of the Mississippi , " and the resources of the " uncultivated parts of America . " While camping with the Sioux he learned , so he states in his " Travels , " that " the four most capital rivers on the continent of North  | America , viz. , the St. Lawrence , the Mississippi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river of the West , have their sources in the same neighborhood . " This , the first printed mention of the name Oregon , was also its first application in the chronicles of white men to the long-sought river . Possibly the Algonquin word wau-re-gan , " beautiful water , " was interpreted by Captain Carver as Oregon . Joaquin Miller believed the name had " rounded down phonetically from a phrase bestowed by Portuguese navigators , Hear the waters , ' acre it agua , to or-agua , or-a-gon , Oregon . " Though long reported by tribes far inland , and in 1775 definitely located by Heceta , the Spanish discoverer , not until 1792 was the river 's unfriendly bar actually crossed . To his eternal renown it was an American , Robert Gray , captain of a Boston trading-vessel , whose insistent enterprise brought the reward that had been sought by European navigators for two centuries . And this is the way it came about . In the latter part of the eighteenth century , Nootka on Vancouver Island was the center of the fur Eldorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags . Nootka was the first port in North America touched by Captain Cook , and later by Vancouver . The publication of Cook 's " Voyages " excited American interest in the commercial value of beaver and sea-otter skins . Captain Gray and the Columbia About the hearth of Dr. Bulfinch , in Boston , a partnership was formed by six friends , which resulted in their equipping the ship Cambia Rediviva ( 212 tons ) and tile sloop Lady Washington ( 90 tons ) to trade in fur skins on the Pacific . A medal was struck by the owners to commemorate this important adventure , which was furthered under patronage of President Washington and his Congress . Captain John Kendrick commanded the Columbia and Captain Gray the Washington on the vessels ' first voyage to Nootka , in 1788 . Later , Gray embarked on the Columbia for  | China , where he sold his furs and took aboard tea for Boston . On his arrival there he was feted as the first skipper to carry the Stars and Stripes around the globe . Sailing in the now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fur stations in September , 1790 . It was while skirting the coast off present-day Washington and Oregon that breakers in latitude 46 degrees , 10 minutes indicated to his practised eye the presence of sand-bars at the mouth of a river . Vancouver , coming from England , had noted the same signs , but , in his own words , " not considering this opening worthy of more attention , " had continued north after meeting the American ship . For nine days Gray awaited the abatement of the current which resisted his inquisitive prow . Finally , on May eleventh , with all sails set , he was able to run in through the breakers and enter the " large river of fresh water " which , as recorded in the ship 's log , he named " Columbia 's River . " Proceeding up stream for thirty-five miles , he made the first chart of the new-found shores . A few months later , the lower reaches of the river were explored as far as the mouth of the Willamette by Lieutenant Broughton , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims of the United States in establishing , half a century later , the rights of this country to the ter- ritory through which runs the greater part of the Columbia and its main tributaries , the Clark and the Snake . Bitter and long-drawn was the contest for this vast and fruitful area , which in 1846 was finally wrested from the grasp of the Hudson Bay Company , ? those wise and stubborn British traders whose posts had for years marked strategic points along the principal highways through the wilderness . The Lewis and Clark Expedition When , in 1804 , two young American army captains , Meriwether Lewis and William Clark , undertook at the behest of President Jefferson their epic journey from the Mississippi to the Pacific , they explored the Columbia , Far West River , discovered and named several of its affluents , and described in their journal the appearance and habits of the Indians who lived on its shores . They paddled past the " handsom cascades " on its bluffs , and along cliffs , islands and sedgy banks to the broad mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific coast . All the country which today comprises the States of Oregon , Washington and Idaho was then called Oregon , primitive name of our wondrous river . A Scotch surveyor named David Thompson discovered the Columbia 's source , followed the stream to its most northerly latitude , and in 1811 reached the estuary . Here he found already established the Pacific  | Fur Company , an enterprise chiefly financed by John Jacob Astor , and organized to trade at the mouth of the Columbia on the present site of Astoria , the first American settlement on the shores of the Pacific . If we were to follow the wanderings of the peerless river to their end , we would journey in miles nearly half the width of the continent before reaching the Pacific , and descend 2,500 feet before attaining sea level . In the Windermere trench , natal valley of the Columbia , mountains wild and high overlook farms and tree-planted terraces ; the young Columbia crawls between pastoral banks , making tranquil mirrors for the sky 's reflection . A hundred miles on , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy through channels rude and varied . None but adventurers ride the river above Beaver , a station on the trans-continental railroad west of Golden . The occasional surveyor , geologist or mountaineer whose canoe penetrates these little-known wilds is rewarded by amazing views from heights that look upon the glistening flanks of two stupendous ranges . Nine miles west of the swift-flowing river , just below the Big Bend , stands the supreme peak of the Selkirks , Sir Sandford ( 11,600 feet ) . This is the loftiest mountain in Canada which can be seen from the river . About its base is a region so choked with forests that attempts to reach the monarch itself were several times frustrated before Howard Palmer and Professor Holway finally attained the crest in the summer of 1912 . In latitude 52 , where the great southward wheel is made , the Canoe River , a snow-born stranger from the north , joins the Columbia .  | At Revelstoke , the only Canadian town of importance on the Columbia 's banks , the river has an exciting current when the water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardian , Mt . Begbie , the waters are drawn into a narrower valley , which curves between green forelands and vari-colored cliffs beneath the gaze of stately snowcaps . The portion of the river extending 130 miles from Arrowhead to Robson constitutes the Arrow Lakes . Few travelers leave the main Canadian Pacific tourist route at Revelstoke to journey down this superb by-way , though good steamers make the run on frequent schedule , and the recompense in scenic sensation is generous out of all proportion to the effort required to see these lakes of glacier-tinted water and snowy reflections . The hoydenish Kootenay mates with the Columbia at the foot of Lower Arrow Lake . A few miles south , in the heart of a world-famed gold , silver and copperproducing country , the Columbia is joined by another imposing tributary , Clark Fork , which rises south of Glacier National Park . The junction of these two rivers is at the international boundary . In early times the fur trappers crossed the historic 49th parallel here . Both Americans and British built posts and missions at Kettle Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridges of the Bitter Root Mountains , and played an important share in the history of this part of the Columbia valley before it was United States territory . Transportation down-river from Kettle Falls is by steamboat ? a  | thrilling ride through sometimes arduous currents . Again the Columbia abruptly alters its-course , turning due west , and then , below the mouth of the Okanogan , making another embracing curve to the southeast . Columbia Basin and The Dalles For two hundred miles the valley of the Columbia lies between the Cascades and an immense circular plateau , which for nearly three-quarters of its circumference is enclosed by the Columbia and its largest affluent , the Snake River . Irrigation has transformed much of this once barren basin , its dry river courses and profitless benchlands , into a plain abounding in rich harvests . For sixty miles south of Wenatchee the river-bed is harassed by sharp rocks which make regular navigation impracticable . The Priest Rapids are ten miles long and have a fall of seventy feet . Banks a thousand feet high shut in the river for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose monotony led Captain George B. McClellan to report in September , 1853 , " On the trail to The Dalles the country is everywhere stony , barren and worthless . The valley of the Columbia , near the mouth of the Yakima , is a vast sage desert . " Part of this region which McClellan thought unfitted for colonization has in our day been redeemed by irrigation , and supports millions of fruit-trees set out in methodical rows . Thus do the beneficent waters of the Columbia deck with the apple and the peachblossom this land that was once a desert . Near the border line between Washington and Oregon , at Pasco , the river receives the noble stream named the " Snake , " or " Lewis Fork , " which rises  | near the bounds of Yellowstone Park , and on its pi o cturesque path through southern Idaho plunges over a precipice 200 feet high and io5o feet wide , forming the Shoshone Falls , the only cataract on the continent comparable with Niagara . The fact that the Snake and the Missouri Rivers rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively , into the Columbia and the Mississippi , partially corroborates the statement of the Sioux Indians to Captain Jonathan Carver concerning the sources of " the most capital rivers " of North America . At Wallula the Columbia meets the Oregon Trail , over which rumbled pio neers ' ox-carts from the mid-West to the shores of the Pacific . Again the mighty river sweeps to the west , cutting through the Umatilla Hills and forming the Washington-Oregon border line . The Spokane , Seattle and Portland Railway follows the north shore , and the Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company ( Union Pacific ) the south shore . In addition , there is daily steamboat service between The Dalles and Portland . River traffic from the sea to points beyond The Dalles and Celilo was , until three years ago , impossible because of volcanic rocks and deep troughs , or dalles , which for twelve miles block the channel . The Celilo Canal , completed in 1915 at a cost of $5,000,000 , now provides " a thoroughfare beside the torrential gully , so that craft entering the Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 550 miles to a point on the Snake River , beyond Lewiston , Idaho . The city of The Dalles is built on the site of a military reservation cornmanded before the Civil War by Grant and Shericlan , and is now a chief shipping point for an immense wool and wheatgrowing section , extending into central Oregon . In full view of the town is  | the cloud-piercing cone of Mt . Hood , while across the Columbia Mt . Adams soars high above the Washington shore . The Columbia Gorge West of the Hood River and White Salmon River valleys , mute evidence of riven walls foretells the Columbia 's most spectacular feat , ? the sundering of the barrier reared by the Cascade Range . This is the only water passage through a mountain chain which extends south from the Canadian border for over a thousand miles . The Indians account for the cleaving of the mountains by poetic legends . The tale most familiarly known concerns the Bridge of the Gods , which united the two shores and was wrecked by the god that was Mt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adams . The height called Table Mountain ( 3,500 feet ) is supposedly the north pier of the fallen span , the previous existence of which is recognized not by mythologists only but by some geologists as well . In the opinion of scientists , this extraordinary passageway of the river represents ages of gradual elevation of the mountain chain and wearing away by the water . The range has its name from the cascades that distinguish the fiftymile gorge of the Columbia . At the eastern entrance the Government has overcome the problem of navigating a perilous expanse of rough water by building a system of locks . The river banks are notable for their astonishing rock forms , for contrasting intervales of lush grasses , for lofty waterfalls and subtly beautiful palisades . Of its kind the scenery in this section of the river 's course is unrivaled . The stream flows broadly , its periods of turmoil past . Many of its sentinels of carved basalt are invested with legend and history . Most lovely of all adornments are the cataracts , which overflow the high rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . exquisitely white , against backgrounds of foliage or brilliantly tinted granite . From the deck of a steamboat we see in full sublimity Mt . Hood , which John Muir describes as giving " the supreme touch of grandeur to all Columbia views , rising at every turn .  | solitary , majestic , awe-inspiring , the ruling spirit of the landscape . " The town of Vancouver , Washington , opposite the mouth of the Willamette River , bears the name of the storied fort maintained by the Hudson Bay Company as administrative headquarters west of the Rockies , between the years 1825 and 1846 . The United States reservation , which succeeded the old fur post , had Sheridan , Kearney and Grant as successive commanders during the first years of American possession . Portland , Oregon , founded in 1844 , is situated ten miles up the Willamette , or Woh-la ' - mutt , as the Indians christened it before white men came . This tributary of the Columbia waters a smiling valley which welcomed the first colony of pioneers in the Oregon Country . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of these mountain wraiths , by strange hilly islands , and by glimpses of busy villages which thrive on the harvest of sea and forest . Occasionally we see from steamer deck , car window or automobile seat an immense log boom headed for the Pacific . The seining grounds are of interest . On the banks are huge salmon canneries . Thirty miles above its outlet the river is six miles wide . Before it reaches the beautifully situated town of Astoria , its breadth is nine miles from shore to shore . For forty years the Federal Government has been engaged in overcoming the handicap of sand-bars at the Columbia 's mouth . Many millions have been spent in dredging a channel between Cape Disappointment and Point Adams , which mark the outerbounds of the magnificent estuary . Persistent ingenuity has finally achieved a passage of sufficient depth to accommodate at all times the proud craft which pass through these portals to the land " where rolls the Oregon .
