Crime and Punishment AMONG all the novels about murder the most salient is probably Dostoevsky 's " Crime and Punishment . " In that great novel , written by a man who had endured prison life and who knew at close range the criminal and the insane , the punishment of the murderer is his murder . In the end Raskolnikoff invites justice himself and seeks peace in expiating his crime , but the reader feels , and is intended to feel , that the worst penalty of his heartless act is his own piercing realization of it . For him the wages of sin is something worse than death . A generation or two ago the stern voice of the Old Testament was often heard in English fiction , but of recent years nothing has been more frequent than the accent of commiseration and pity . Men of action like Rudyard Kipling keep up the tradition of the Day of Judgment , the march of inexorable law , but much more characteristic is the note of John Galsworthy in plays like " Justice " and " Strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , there is almost a monotonous recurrence of the contrast between the definite masterful , disciplinarian type of the older generation and the agnostic , reflective , indulgent type of the new . The humanitarian tendency or bias comes out in everything that Mr. Galsworthy has to say about the ruling classes and existing institutions , and never more than in " Justice " has he shown his ironical sense of the cruelty of " letting the law take its course . " He does not emphasize , any more than Tolstoy or Dostoevsky emphasized , man 's strong tendency to evil . He emphasizes , on the contrary , man 's never-dying tendency to good ; and the dominant appeal of his art is an appeal to sympathy and understanding . This appeal , on the whole , finds response among people in America . In no other country is lynching so possible , and in this country , certainly , there are robustly vengeful citizens who seem to rejoice in the extreme reprisals of the law . But despite this evidence of red-blooded enthusiasm for punishment , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forgive . Even among persons who are quick to demand instant " justice , " a miscarriage of the law is felt to be acutely tragic , and popular sympathy is apt to rush to anyone whose lawyers can raise a reasonable doubt . Americans have not the stolid respect for the law that is characteristic of Britons . Their attitude is far more personal . And even when they know that a man is guilty , they tend , on reflection , to seek mitigating circumstances and to be imaginatively rather than legally reasonable . If the men are , as a rule , " red-bloods , " the women are preponderately " mollycoddle . " It is they especially who espouse the humanitarian code of Mr. Galsworthy and who believe most earnestly that Dostoevsky understood his murderer 's soul . There are times , however , when it is fair to question whether this psychology for the guilty is not too simple . When a sensitive and introspective human being commits a crime ? such a human being as Raskolnikoff ? it is certain that no external punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His conscience may , in reality , be a creation of human society , but it is not the direct attitude of society that causes him to suffer . It is guilt , self-accusation , remorse . But if there is anything certain in this world , it is that all creatures are not sensitive and introspective , all equally possessed of " conscience " and equally alive to guilt . From the standpoint of those who desire justice , it is comforting to believe that its process is automatic , that even if society does nothing conscience will be at work and the law of compensation will be fulfilled . But one has only to remember the terrible ironies to which Thomas Hardy has devoted a lifetime of observation , to realize the falsity of this comfort , and to step out from the warmth of laissez-faire to the cold world of injustices and complaisances , of liberties that nothing but vigilance preserves . Last week a man was tried in New York State for the shooting of his son-in-law , who had seduced his daughter . He was acquitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . The trial was brief but exceedingly painful . At great cost to herself , the widow of the murdered man came to give evidence . Resisting her father 's embraces in the courtroom , she still testified in order to save him , though she made it clear to everyone that she loved the man who had been killed . Her father confessed he was drunk when he killed the youth , but he said the youth was of evil life , and this allegation , tending to give horror to the seduction , probably weighed greatly with the jury . At any rate , they acquitted him , amid the cheers of a friendly crowd . So long as one could assume ordinary human comprehensions on the part of the acquitted man , this verdict need not seem dead loss . In some ways it approximates the ideal of many people , leaving the culprit to his own conscience . But even if this is pure romanticism , the acquittal could be condoned if the trial had made some effect . Hear , however , some reflections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World : " This is without doubt the merriest and happiest Christmas of my life . True , my daughter is not herself , but I guess she will be all right in a few days . * * , * Do I think she saved my life ? Why , no ! I am sure that even without her help I would have been acquitted . You see , I did not know what I was doing ; so how could I have been guilty ? Anna knew she had disgraced us and so she wished to do all that lay in her power to atone . " While I certainly would undo my act if it lay in my power , 1 feel sure Anna will be happier with us than if she were the wife of Eugene Newman . Marriages of that kind always end in misery , whereas now she will just take up the threads of her former life and be happy . She intends to resume her music . She is a splendid pianist . When she recovers her health all will be as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pledge never to drink again . I always have drunk like a gentleman . " Has my daughter forgiven me ? What do you mean ? What has she to forgive ? Our relations are most loving . She was always a most obedient child ? quiet , unexpressive , but with a sweet disposition . I could not understand her disobeying us the way she did by going with this boy and marrying him in view of our expressed objections . But now that is all over , and she is again our sweet loving daughter . " The daughter , according to the reporter , is completely crushed . She loved her husband , but she guesses her parents knew best , for " see what her disobedience has done . " " Nobody has any right to be ashamed of human nature , " says Arnold Bennett ; " human nature is . " With this truism only a theorist would quarrel . But , although human nature is , there are occasions when every decent human being feels the impulse and the right to vindicate its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our word one of compensation ? In this case it was the duty of citizenship to effect compensation , a duty in which it blindly failed . There is something too human in such blindness to justify contempt ; but it makes us feel that the jury as well as the homicide need to be educated , need some searing application to themselves of the suffering they so cheerfully condone .
