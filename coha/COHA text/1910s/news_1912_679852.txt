txt Andrew Carnegie faced the Stanley Steel Committee to-day for five solid hours reciting his relations to the iron and steel industry in America . It was a characteristic narrative which the retired " Ironmaster " gave to the committee  --  graphic , and at times dramatic . Throughout the ordeal , which became grueling in the afternoon , Mr. Carnegie professed to be " blissfully ignorant of the details " of the Carnegie Steel Company . Probably the most striking part in his testimony was his story of how , through the mediation of Charles M. Schwab , he sold the Carnegie Steel Company , under the supervision of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , for $120,000,000 to the syndicate which formed the United States Steel Corporation . " What a fool I was to sell out to the Steel Corporation for only $120,000,000 : " exclaimed Mr. Carnegie with mingled feelings of emotion . " I have since learned from the inside that we could have re. ? ceived $100,000,000 more from Mr. Morgan if ... we had placed that value on our mop.er ties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with millions , tossing them off nonchalantly until the eyes in the throng , which crowd , ' ed around the iron master , fairly bulged in astonishment . The first half of his story was a narration of his rise in the iron and steel business , beginning with ' his start on $1,500 borrowed capital in 1863 and ending with the monster transactions by which the Carnegie properties passed into the control or . the Morgan . syndicate without even a meeting between himself and Mr. Morgan . His description of the development of the Carnegie interests , their rapid growth through the application of the Bessemer , face-hardening and open-hearth processes , utilization of natural gases , construction of the Bessemer Road to the lakes , the acquisition of Conneaut Harbor , and launching of monster steel steamers to convey ore from the Lake Superior region , mainly out of profits without any hard search for additional capital , sounded like . a fairy story from the realm of Vulcan . Got the Best of Rockefeller . A glimpse into some of his relations with the Vanderbilts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given , and when he reached what he regarded as his clever acquisition of vast ore rights , under reasonable royalty payments from John D. Rockefeller , joy brightened the eyes of the witness , and he exclaimed : " Do you know , it makes my heart feel good to feel that I was such a man as to be able to get ahead of John D. Rockefeller on that deal . That is the one time I managed to get the best of my fellowmillionaire . " Mr. Carnegie put a damper on the asking of hypothetical questions at the very start by throwing up his hands and remarking : " Why ask a poor innocent man to give an answer to ' if ' ? " Throughout his narrative the retired pioneer of the steel industry refused to enter into details of many transactions . " I am free to confess , ' declared he , " that I never saw the inside of a book of the Carnegie Steel Company . I always left the details to my partners at i Pittsburgh . I lived mostly n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not able to take care of the details , I do n't see how I could change the situation , or improve it . " " All He Got " Was 5420,000,000 . Some of the striking declarations with which Mr. Carnegie 's testimony faii'ly bristled were : That the Government 's suit against the Steel Corporation " blundered " and was " silly " in its declaration that the book value of the Carnegie Steel Company was $84,000,000 , because this did not begin to represent the real value of the Carnegie interest . That it was a " complete surprise " to him to know that the Steel Corporation was capitalized at $492,000,160 , as alleged in the Government 's suit . That all he and his partners received from the Morgan syridicate for the Carnenie interests was $420.000,000 . That all that the Carnegie family , Andrew , his sister-in-law , Mrs. Lucy C. Car ' negie , and his cousin , received of the $420,000,000 from the Morgan syndicate was $213,000.000 . That he did not receive a cent of money and no stock in this transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds , despite statements to the contrary . That he was the " one man in Pittsburgh , " who fought the Pennsylvania Railroad interests on rail rates and brought them to terms by threatening to build a tidewater road of his own in con , nection with the Vanderbilt interests . That during one of his many absences in Europe the Vanderbilt interests , which had arranged to enter an arrangement with him for a tidewater rival road from Pittsburgh via Cbambersburg In dpposition to the Pennsylvania interests , " went over to the enemy . " That they had a " show down " with the Pennsylvania in the matter of ' better rates and was sure he got the lowest rates . hut apropos of rebating was ute- ? able to state whether the rates he . olitained were lower than taose granted 131Is the Pennsylvania to other shippers . That the price of $2S a ton on standard ' steel rails was fixed by conferences be ; tween the three leading railroad Presie dents of the Eastern trunk lines  --  the Pennsylvania .. Baltimore &; Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seating the railmakers . That if it were true , as developed in prior evidence , payments like $100,000 were made in pool profits under the old Carnegie regime that was a " small matter " in a $5.000,000 account . That he had never heard of - the railroad rate law of - MOT until recently . " Did n't Bother " About Sherman Law . That he did not bother about the Sherr man law , leaving legal details to his counsel , and was too busy attending to other business to worry about a statute whitth had not been finally construed by ' the ' courts . That never before to-day had he ever heard of the famous Addyston Pipe case , ea:tee:ea T. ! lino the Story of His Life and of Steel to the Stanley Investigating Committee . the first Sherman law ease in which Mr. Taft , now President , had rendered a great decision ; although the name " sounded familiar and reminded him of the Eddystone Light " That it - was at his suggestion In return ' for recognition by the late Jay Gould , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wabash connection into Pittsburgh . That he had been told by Judge Gary recently that there is in existence a letter written by the late Senator Hoar , immediately after the passage of the Sherman law , declaring that that law was not intended to apply to pools . That no tarriff should be collected on products , protected by pooling arrangements . That the cost of iron and steel ore is going " to go higher " and that the supposed inexhaustible ore fields of the Lake Superior fields are going to be depited " before many more ten year periods roll around . ' ' That he knows absolutely nothing of the Merritt Brothers ' case or the way in which they are alleged to nave been bested by John D. Rockefeller , although he himself took positive delight in being able to declare he triumphed over Rockefeller in a transaction involving the lease of these same ore fields . That so far as the law is concerned , there are so " many sides of the law , " and he supposed lawyers could defend either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed his name to a sworn court answer in the Prick suit of some years ago without reading the contents . but merely glancing over it , assuming the details were correct because his partners had all signed the document before him . Mr. Carnegie , although five hours on the stand , barely got a start with his testimony . He will resume the stand tomorrow . When he came before the committee he was accompanied by John Barrett , Director of the Pan-American Bureau ; J. H. Reed of Pittsburgh , and n . C. Bihler . The Crowd was considerably larger than when John W. Gates , Judge E. H. Gary or other important witnesses testified . Sitting directly before the investigators , Mr. Carnegie was completely surrounded by the audience . A Mysterious " Option . " His most interesting testimony , that detailing the prosperous days of the Carnegie Steel Company immediately preceding its sale to the Morgan syndicate , was not reached until after the noon recess . a . ' The . Carnegie Steel Company of New . Jersey was only a holding company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of New Jersey because that State's. laws gave greater powers through limited part'zership ? There were ussed $160,000,000 of . stock and the same amount of bonds . This capitalization was determined not ' Onlye- by earning power , but by thein=creasing value of our ores and the trope - that- nhe property would in time meet the : value of the securities . That the property was not overvalued is shown by the fact that we were asked to give an option for $450,000,000 a year before- we sold to the Morgan syndicate . That did not include the value of the Frick Coke Company , $70,000,000 , which brought to 6320,000.900 . " Who was back of that option ? " was asked . I have n't the slightest idea , " said the iron master . " I got a billion and something for having given my consent to that option . We were to receive $250 , - 000,060 to sell the whole of the Carnegie properties , each partner to receive his due share . " Representative Young called Mr. Carnegie 's attention to the reference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gates seemed to have known about as much about it as I. " ' " If possible , even less , " retorted Mr. Carnegie . " The Geel fell through , but $2.060,000 was paid for the option . " " Your partners were in one part of the purchase ? " asked Mr. Young . " I never understood that Frick and Phipps were to be part of the purchase . " " Were your partners interested in this . plan to purchase the steel plant ? " " I do n't think so . " Opinion Would Be " Interesting . " " Could the United States Steel Corporation have been organized without the Carnegie Company ? " " I do n't want to flatter my own company , but my opinion on that would be interesting . " " Could they have gotten along without the Carnegie Company ? " " I 'm delighted you asked that question , " replied Mr. Carnegie quickly . " We understood that $250,000.000 was a fair price a year before . . Moore &; Co. considered it fair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile option . We were capitalized at $250,000,000 . Taking in the Frick Company at $70 , - 000,000 would make it $320,000.000 . " " But , " said Mr. Young , " you did get more than that when you sold to the United States Steel . " " But why ? " asked Mr. Carnegie . " Mr. Schwab stated that very clearly . Schwab came to lee and sate , Mr. Morgan and you have been goo ( ' friends but he do n't like to approach you on the subject . He wants to know if you are willing to retire . I said , ' It depends upon my partners . ' You know my scheme of life is to spend my old age not accumulating , but distributing surplus wealth . " Schwab came Rack in a few days and said Mr. Morgan had said : What will you take ? ' Schwab sat to me then that et:20,000.000 had seemed fair on the option that fell through . Schwab said that between the time we gave the last option and this time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought fair to add that $100,000,000 to the option to give Morgan . " ? " You never got more than $420,000,000 ? " Seliy Little Memorandum " Was All . " The world is mistaken , " answered Carnegie . " All I asked Morgan was 4420,000,000 . I owned about half . I got e213,000,000 . All this talk about me holding out for a high price there 's no foundation for . I never saw Morgan or any man connected with him . Mr. Morgan saw my little memorandum , that was all . He considered it eminently fair . I have , ' since been told by Insiders that I cculd have gotten $100,000,000 more . That 's the Whole truth , This talk about me having held out for a higher price ought to stop . / " It is claimed the Carnegie Company got ' mor than its property was worth because it was needed to insure the success of the United States Steel undertaking , " said Mr. Young . " I think that with the 5,000 acres at Conneaut we would nave put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had n't sold out , we would have been a consiaerable concern by this time . " . " You had 5S per cent . of the Carnegie Corripany ? " That included the interests of my sic-. ter-in-law , Lucy Carnegie , and my cousin . My owit  --  interest in the total consolidation was 49.5 per cent . " You had a credit balance of 56 per cent dividenCs of the Carnegie Company the year before you consolidated ? " Do n't Know About Credit Balance . " We made $40000,000 profits the year we sold out . I did not look at the acCounts. - , ' khave a financial secretary . I altia:Yaitiade- it a point ' to leave ' Money i in the firm , and encouraged my partners to do so . I may have had a credit bat ! ance of $4,009,000 ? there ; I do n't know . " " You and Schwab alone decided $4220 , - 000,000 ' was a fair valuation of the Car1 negie Company ? " asked Mr. Gardner . " I never spoke to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said ! Morgan was willing to buy . Then I said I to Schwab , ' I 'm quite willing to sell . ' " " Was $420,000,000 the value of the Car1 negie Company ? " insisted Mr. Gardner . " To Mr. Morgan , " was Carnegie 's answer . You continually complained of high rates on the Pennsylvanian did the Pennsylvania make you any special concessions ? " asked Mr. Gardner . Unsuspecting in his Honesty . " Never that- I knew of , " replied Carnegie . " I notice Senator ' Oliver has spoken that we received rebates . It is startling how unsuspecting an honest person can be . I was the one man in all Pittsburgh that fought the Pennsylvania on its rates . I bought the Bessemer Road to the lakes . I joined hands with Vanderbilt . Vanderbilt sent for me and told me his son-in-law , Mr. Twombly , had advised him to build a road out of Pittsburgh . ' What do you think of it ? ' Vanderbilt asked , ' I 'll put up $5,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He said , ' So Will I. ' Hostetter .. a wealthy man of Pittsburgh , went in on it . We agreed to build the road . I went to Europe . In my absence the Pennsylvania went to Vanderbilt and urged him to abandon the project . I returned from Europe to find that Vanderbilt had been captured by the enemy . I then went to young Gould and said to him : ' Your father once came to nee at the old Windsor Hotel in New - York and said , " Young man , I 've been hearing about you . I 'll ? put up the money to buy the Pennsylvania road if you will manage it and devote yourself to it . " ' I thanked him and replied , I have been a faithful clerk and friend of Thomas A. Scott of the Pennsylvania ; nothing on earth can induce me to take a step against him . ' ' When I went to George Gould I told him this , and offered him a chance to come to Pittsburgh . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh with the Wabash  --  which has been frightfully mismanaged . " The Pennsylvania rates from Chicagoi to the Huntington yards at Newport News I on a large shipment of steel were higher than the rates ' from Pittsburgh to New ' York . I ' showed this to Roberts of the ! Pennsylvania ; told him ' I ca n't stand it any more . ' It did not seem to . interest him , and I declared , ' All right Roberts ; you will send for Me to see me ' the next time . ' Then I arranged to build the road to the coke ovens . I got a mite from President Roberts saying , ' I Want to see you . ' I sent to McCrea and said I must have rates our competitors are getting . Another " Little Memorandum . " " Thomas sent for me and said : ' Andy , you are a Pennsylvania man . Why do you fight us ? ' I replied : ' Frank , I thank you for asking that . Look at that , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coke overs . He said : I want you to quit on that ' coke oven road . ' I said : ' I 'll quit when you glee us the lowest rates , ' We made a little memorandum . Thomas and Roberts carried it out . We got no rebates others Cid not ger . ' - " You contradict the testimony of ? Senator Oliver ? " inquired Mr. Gardner . It was a very natural suspicion , " replied Mr. Carnegie . " . They made a special proposition that I should not build a road to the coke ovens . I said : Let us see . ' Then they , did reduce their rate . Whether.others got it I do n't h.no* . But when we bought the Carey Furnaces we found their coke rate was lower than the one I had got as a great concession . I do n't know whether I got a lower rate than some one else . " " Did you pay much attention to the Sherman act ? " asked Mr. Gardner . " Let me tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger in the Conpressman 's face . " I never bothered my head about it . I had more engaging subjects . I had no idea how ignorant a man I was until I read the Sherman act , passed eo long ago . I honestly believe that act was passed to correct the chaos in the railroad situation . " " You must be thinking of the railroad rate law of 1907 , " interjected Mr. Gardner , Some Perfect Arrangements . " Never heard of it , " exclaimed Mr. Carnegie . " I was out of business then . That pools were unlawful was never dreamed of by the most respectable men . I never remember attending a pool meeting in my life . Of all the perfect arrangements I know.of , I consider that of the Bessemer Railroad the best . It came about this way . They used to have consultations as to what the rate would me for the year . It came to this : The leading trunk roads would be consulted , the Pennsylvania , New York Central . and Baltimore &; Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix a certain rate for the next year that settled it . The three Presidents would meet a committee of steel men and say $23 a ton would be a fair price for steel rails . There can be no competition in rails . " " Did you keep in touch with that situation until you retired ? " " There was never any touch , " replied the ironmaster . " If I were legislating against people , I would make an exception in favor of rails . You must understand that the Sherman law has several defects . " " In Mat " interjected Mr. Stanley , " you said ' we are creatures of the tariff . The theory of protection is that home competition should reduce the price of the product , ' " " Yes , " said Carnegie , " and that 's what I state to-day . " " You thought then there should be no tariff on articles affected by pools ? " " I still think so . " smiled Carnegie . Mr. Gardner invited attention to the agreements of 1897 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was party , which agreements are alleged to have been called in , burned , and supplanted by another pooling agreement " Were you aware of serious doubt- as to its legality ? " asked Mr. Gardner , " I can have no doubts because I am familiar with no details , " rejoined Carnegie . But these agreements continued until the United States Steel Corporation took over the Carnegie Company , and the Addystone pipe decision was long before that , " insisted Mr. Gardner . " Addystone " Sounds Familiar . " Oh , " gesticulated Mr , Carnegie in a storm of laughter , " I 'm no lawyer . This isthe very first time I ever heard of the Addystone case . But it sounds familiar . It strikes me like the Eddystone light : " " sIt was the first great decision , nevertheless , by Mr. Taft ; now the President , " declared Mr. Gardper . Well ; " drawled the ironmaster , " anything . coming- from him ' deserves ' high consideration . " Mr. Gardner tried to extract from Mr. Carnegie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ore region when . Carnegie went ' out . Of : business .. It Ives explained . that the committee was seeking to ascertain how much United States Steel is overcapitalized . " They value the ore at $700,000,000 , " asserted Mr. Garfhien " The Carnegie ' Company valued this ore at $100,000,000 . Would that indicate ; , ; 000,010,000 . worth of water ? " I absolutely decline to make any wild estimate on that , " was Mr. Carnegie 's answer . " If at the time bought them I had said they were worth a dollar . a ton I would have thought it too high . If I should now call it worth 20 cents a ton it would be very much too low . One men can estimate the value of that ore as well as another , " Then Mr. Carnegie exclaimed : " Gentlemen , I tell you that ore is going to be higher in value than it is to-day . Only pessimists say the present price is going to be the price of the future . His Rockefeller Deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John . D. Rockefeller , Mr. Carnegie said : " When I discovered we could use that ore I said to Gaylen ' you go to New York , sleep there , and do n't come back until you bring a lease from Rockefeller . " Mr. Carnegie waxed exuberant .. " Do you know , " be exclaimed , " it makes my heart feel good to feel I was such a man and got ahead of John D. Rockefeller . Last week we were spending New Year 's at our place near St , Andrew 's golf links . I said to Mrs. Carnegie , Let 's go over to see the Rockefellers , over at Tarrytown . ' He was a fine old gentleman , dressed nicely , tall and spare . tie said , , ' 1 was out riding yesterday with a paper jacket . It has preserved me from the cold .

It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not refer to the ore purchase . " " We have a copy of that lease here amnrd iGta ur'dillenbne embalmed in amber , " said " I am glad of that , " responded Carnegie , " I would like to have a copy of it . That 's the one time I did get ahead Of my fellow-millionaire . " " Do you think you did more to Backe. teller than he did to the ' Merritt brothers ? " interjected Mr , Beall of Texas . " Oh , I do n't know anything about the Merritt nrothers . " " Did it ever occur to you that you were continually and flagrantly violating the law ? " asked Mr. Beall . " No , Sir , " answered Carnegie . " It was impossible that we should know that until the Supreme Court decided . " Mr. Reed here explained that it was net known until the Knight case that the Sherman act was applicable to industrial combinations . " I was not head of the Carnegie Company , " broke in the witness , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my young partners to run the business . I was seldom in Pittsburgh . I never saw the books . As to details I must confess I was blissfully ignorant My partners must have known whether they broke the law . . I knew that pool agreements were common , and I took it for granted that my partners were doing what other respectable business men were doing . When I look at the venerable shades of out ' business pioneers , I know all men were engaged in this practice . I was never notified the law was being broken . " Hifi Opinion of Lawyers . Mr. Beal : wanted to know whether the Carnegie lawyers were employed to advise how to break the law or how not to break it . " I know , " replied Carnegie , " the profession has a seamy side and that they can do one thing or the other according to how they are paid . " Mr. Carnegie was asked to explain the apparent discrepacy between the $78,000 , - 000 , given as the book value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests were sold to the Morgan syndicate . He said this 578,000 , - 000 represented only profit account and never took into consideration the value of plant , ores , or other properties . From the beginning , he said , the Carnegie interests had always prided themselves over the tact that they had never boosted the price of their plants Members of the committee read from the answer of the Carnegie magnates , filed in the Frick suit some years ago , in which it was declared that $75,000,000 represented a fair valuation of the Carnegie assets . Me . Carnegie declared this was only the book value . When told that his name was attached to the answer , Mr. Carnegie said : " That- answer was gotten up by lawyers in Pittsburgh and sent to me for signature . I saw my partners had signed it and I put my name to it without reading it 's ' The committee resorted to double-Nelson tactics in an effort to pin Mr. Carnegie down to an estimate of the real ' value of the Carnegie properties . He refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable statement : " Ore is bound to become more valuable . I predict the Lake Superior region will be depleted of ore before many ten-year Periods roll past , but I wish to say that there are wonderful ores in Cuba .

My judgment is- that we sold out to Mr. Morgan at too low a price . Am I right or am I wrong ? " The hearing will continue to-morrow : With Mr. Carnegie on the stand , TO MOVE FOR HYDE 'S TRIAL .
