Night in a market place . A small fire burns near a well . On a bench near it sleeps the Beggar . The old Prostitute is warming herself . There is the sound of dogs barking in the distance . Vast shadows move about the market-place . The Drunkard emerges from the gloom of the night . DRUNKARD Good evening , Madam Prostitute . Listens to the dogs . Why are the dogs whining like this to-night ? PROSTITUTE They must be seeing things . DRUNKARD Yes , your black soul . Perhaps they think you a devil . That 's why they chase all over the butchers ' stalls . No wonder . They 've reason to be afraid . BEGGAR in his sleep . He-he-he . Ha-ha-ha . PROSTITUTE A drunkard and a prostitute are the same thing . None of us is clean of sin . BEGGAR sleepily.Do n't take me for a " pal . " Sleeps on . DRUNKARD Leave him alone . He sings hymns the whole day long . BEGGAR Poverty is no sin . DRUNKARD Do n't mix in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ? p. 3 PROSTITUTE They say that on the first of May the Holy Mother walks through the market place , and gathers all the stray souls . DRUNKARD What have the dogs got to do with it ? PROSTITUTE They are people laden with sins . People who died without the Holy Sacrament , and who were buried outside of the fence . At night they roam about the market in the shape of dogs . They run about in the stalls of the butchers . The devil , too , stays there , but when the first of May comes and the prayers begin , the Holy Mother walks through the market-place . The souls of the damned cling to her dress , and she takes them with her to Heaven . Pause for a minute . BEGGAR turning in his sleep.Strong vinegar bursts the cask . Her soul must be black indeed . DRUNKARD It 's awful to look into it . You 'll be among them yet PROSTITUTE I 'm not afraid of that . The mercy of God is great . It will reach even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs too . Those who live in the street come back to the street after death . BEGGAR The street is the home of the beggar . Poverty is no sin . Stretches himself and sleeps on . There is a pause . The Fool comes out of the darkness . He is tall , with a vacant , good-humored face , dressed in a soldier 's hat , with a wooden toy-sword in his girdle . He grins kindly. p. 4 DRUNKARD Ah , good evening , Napoleon . He salutes the Fool . Where do you hail from ? FOOL grins and chuckles.From Turkey . I have driven out the Turk . DRUNKARD And where is your army ? FOOL I have left it on the Vistula . DRUNKARD And when will you drive the Russians out of there ? FOOL I have given my orders already . DRUNKARD Are they being carried out ? FOOL I only need to draw my sword . DRUNKARD Your sword ? FOOL Napoleon gave it to me . PROSTITUTE Leave him be . Every one is crazy in his way . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . He wanders about the hollows the whole night long . FOOL smiles.I 've quartered all of my soldiers , but I have no place for myself to sleep in . PROSTITUTE A fool , and yet he knows what he says . Gives him bread . Do you want to eat ? FOOL I get my dinner from the tables of Kings . p. 5 BEGGAR awaking.You 've brought the fool here too ? He 's got the whole market place to be crazy in , and he comes here , where honest people sleep . Takes his stick and tries to reach the Fool . PROSTITUTE defending the Fool.Leave him alone I tell you . Crazy though he be , he still wants to be among people . Like aches for like . BEGGAR Let him go to the graveyard , and yell his craziness out among the graves ;  --  and not disturb honest men in their sleep . The street is the beggar 's home , and I do n't want to share it with madmen . All that the people throw out of their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and lies down . DRUNKARD Who made you boss here ? The street belongs to all . Lie down in the city hall , in the mayor 's bed , if you want to have rest . PROSTITUTE Keep still . He has a right to the place . He 's had it long enough . DRUNKARD What kind of a right ? Are you a newcomer ? How long have you been here ? PROSTITUTE All my life . I was born in the street , there , behind the fence near the church . My mother pointed out the place to me . I have never known any other home , but the street . In the day-time it belongs to all . When people open their shops , and peasants come in their wagons , and trade begins , I feel a stranger here , and I hide in the fields near the cemetery . But when night comes , and people retire into their holes , then the street is mine . I know every nook and corner of the market place . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . In that house there , I have a home , a bed , and a wife . In the daytime I work there . I sit among boots , and drive nails into heels and soles . And I bear my wife 's nagging and cursing patiently . But when night comes I ca n't stand it any longer . The house becomes too small for me . Something draws me into the street . PROSTITUTE It is the curse of the street that rests on you as it does on the howling dogs . All of us are damned , and we are punished here for our sins . And we will not be delivered , till the Holy Mother will come , and we will take hold of her dress , and our souls will be freed . BEGGAR in his sleep.He-he-he . Ha-ha-ha . DRUNKARD becomes sad , bows his head.In the daytime I do n't mind it . Then I am like other people . I work like all do . But when night comes PROSTITUTE It 's the curse of the street . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mercy is great . The cry of a child comes from the distance . It resembles the howling of a dog . DRUNKARD What 's that ? PROSTITUTE That 's Manka 's bastard . He strays the street . He wants to come near the fire . p. 7 DRUNKARD Call him here . PROSTITUTE Keep still . She points to the Beggar . He will chase the boy away . They believe the boy is born of the Devil . DRUNKARD Who made him boss here ? All of us are children of the Devil . He calls to the boy as one calls to a dog . Come here , you . A dumb boy , all in rags , drags himself near . He makes noises like a little beast . He trembles with cold . The Prostitute tries to quiet him . PROSTITUTE He lies the whole night behind his mother 's doorstep . She is afraid of her husband . Sometimes she gives him a piece of bread , when no one looks . Thus he crawls like a worm in the street  --  human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire  --  so . He pushes the boy nearer to the fire . Give him a piece of bread . I 'll take care of any one who tries to hurt him . BEGGAR awaking.No . That 's too much . Who brought this here ? You know that the Devil is in him ? Tries to chase the boy away . PROSTITUTE hiding the boy in her shawl.Have pity . p. 8 BEGGAR You 're the Devil 's wife . That 's why you pity his child . Tries to reach the boy . DRUNKARD tears the stick from the Beggar 's hand.We 're all the children of the Devil . You 've no more on your hide than he has . BEGGAR Do n't you start anything . I am a Christian , and believe in God . I 've no home . That 's why I sleep on the street . Every dog finds his hole . But I wo n't live together with the Devil . And I wo n't be the neighbor of a harlot either . Nor was a drunkard ever a friend of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after me for ? This whole street belongs to the Devil . Why are you trying to stop me ? He tries to go away . PROSTITUTE detaining him.Do n't leave us . Let him only warm himself . He 'll go away . BEGGAR It does me little honor to be with folk like you anyway . He goes away . DRUNKARD Why do you hold him back ? Let him go if he thinks us below his dignity . PROSTITUTE And do you really think it an honor for one to remain with you ? That man is decent at least . p. 9 DRUNKARD Ah , you grow pious as you grow old . PROSTITUTE I have always wanted to be in decent company . As the Beggar disappears , strange figures begin to show themselves in the darkness . Most of them are half-naked . The Fool also comes back . A dog comes wandering into the crowd . PROSTITUTE looking around in terror.It 's awful to be with so many sick people . Not one amongst them who is of sound mind . Not one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DRUNKARD with fear.The dogs have also come to the fire . PROSTITUTE Even they are drawn to people . There is a short pause . The Bastard begins to wail . DRUNKARD What 's the trouble with him ? Take him away . PROSTITUTE That 's the Devil in him crying  --  see him gazing at something . The day begins to grow gray in the east . Strange , awful light falls over all . Now one , now another corner of the street appears and disappears . All is covered with shadows as in twilight . DRUNKARD Praised be God . The dawn . p. 10 PROSTITUTE How different the light is to-day . The dogs begin to howl . DRUNKARD What are the dogs howling about ? Chase them away from the fire . PROSTITUTE They are looking somewheres . They sniff at the air . They must see something now . In the distance is heard the sound of beating against tin plates . The dogs howl with fright . PROSTITUTE Something is coming near to us . The Fool laughs . DRUNKARD What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase him away from the fire . PROSTITUTE They all see more clearly than we . The dogs howl again , and gather in one group . Footsteps approach . DRUNKARD frightened.Something is coming near to us . A minute 's pause . All waiting in fear . The Thief appears . He carries a woman on his shoulders . The woman has a child in her arms . They are followed by small , poorly clad boys who hold trumpets and kettles in their hands , and make as much noise as they can . THIEF thunders.Fall on your knees . Draw off your hats ! Do you see who is coming ? The queen ! The queen ! All grow pale , and move aside . The Thief walks into their midst . Who is there ? Ah , the Fool . Well , how are your armies getting along ? Hold them in readiness . Hold them in readiness . The Drunkard ! Ah , the right man for the game . He bows . With awe do I kiss the little hand of Madame Prostitute . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? To the woman : Take them with you , oh , Queen . They too are dogs like us , thrown into the street . Let them come with us . We have room for many , many . p. 11 HELENKA Take them with us , my man . We will all go together . THIEF letting the Woman down.Our company is growing big . Come with us . DRUNKARD awaking from his torpor and looking at the Thief.So you are the thief they let out of prison not long ago . And I was afraid of you a little while ago . He spits . That 's a fine joke . Always at your play . Who 's the woman , and the children ? Where did you get them ? THIEF Brother , this is not play . He points to the Woman . She is a queen . He points to the children . And they are princes . Every one a prince . At your knees before her ! Take off your hat . DRUNKARD I know this gentleman quite well . He likes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To-night is the night when the dogs are delivered . Look at her . He points at the Woman . Look at us . We were locked in , and we have come out . We are all one family  --  dogs . We wander on the street . Men have shut their doors in our faces . Come , dogs . We will unite to-day . Throw off your chains , and shake yourself as if you were shaking dust from your shoulders . You are men after all . I have known you from childhood . I knew your mother . p. 12 DRUNKARD wondering.I do n't know what you mean . THIEF Look at yourself . What have they made of you ? You walk the street all night like an outcast . Your children are afraid of you . They hide when they see you drunk on the street , and weep for you . Are you to blame for it ? You were made one with a mass of flesh you hate . You sit bent over your boots the whole day long , and curses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night comes you crawl in the gutter , and you will crawl there till you will be freed from shame . DRUNKARD What are you telling me this for ? THIEF And are you to blame for this ? Have you had one minute of happiness in your whole life ? Who took care of you ? You were raised by your step-father 's cane . Show me the scars on your body . They beat you from childhood on ; first your stepfather , then your " step-wife . " No one ever spoke to you as to a friend . No one ever comforted you in your grief . The Drunkard falls to the ground and weeps . THIEF to the Woman.And he is an honest man . I know him . We went to the same school . He had an honest mother . She loved him only as a mother can . Whispering to the Woman . She brought him bread behind his stepfather 's back . p. 13 DRUNKARD I will never drink again . I give my word of honor . He weeps . THIEF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the street . But we unite to-day . Come with us , come . We will care for you . We will all be together . Take the Prostitute , and come with us . The old Prostitute rises and looks amazed . PROSTITUTE Me ? THIEF taking her hand.We will not turn you , nor avoid you . We know what you are . You are not to blame . Who brought you up ? Who was your mother ? You were born in the street like a goat . Every stone , every hole in the earth caresses you like a mother . You were thrown into the street at birth , and men ran from you as from a leper . Any wonder that this is what became of you ? You lay in the street like an old , dirty rag . PROSTITUTE half-crying.I am not worthy of such comforting words by a gentleman . THIEF You are worthy . You are like all of us . Your skin is dirty , but your soul is clean . Wash your sins away , throw the curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being like all of us . You too long for people . I know you . You are good , you love humanity . It is they who have cursed you so . You were always a clean child . Wait . Wait . He takes water from the well and pours it on her . I wash your head , and you are a human being like the rest of us . The curse is removed from you . Look around yourself . Spring is here . Its fragrance is everywhere . You are a girl yet , a mere child . You know no wickedness . You are in your father 's garden . Your mother sits near the window and looks at you . You are walking with your beloved . He takes the Drunkard , puts him side by side with the Prostitute , joins their hands , and leads them back and forth. p. 14 PROSTITUTE smiles.Do n't talk to me like that . THIEF You are being married now . Virgins come and bring you your bridal dress , your veil , your myrtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar . Your mother lays her hand on your head and blesses you .

She looks with awe at the Woman. p. 15 THIEF That 's the way . That 's the way . That 's the way . To-day we unite . We go together . We will be one with the dogs . He caresses all he finds on the street . Blow the trumpets , boys . Beat the drums . We choose a queen to-day . To the Fool . The army waits for you , with swords in their hands , with spears ready . Do you see the cannon all trained ? All wait for your command . Do you see the foe around you ? He points to the street with a broad majestic gesture . Here stands the army . FOOL happily.Yes , yes . THIEF Give your order , Napoleon . You are our general . Draw the sword , and command ! FOOL draws his wooden sword and cries loudly as if he saw an army in the market-place.Present arms !

He bends his back . Boys , blow your trumpets . Beat your drums . At your knees . All hats off . The queen comes . The queen comes . So will we go to our land . It is grown lighter . The face of the Woman has grown young and beautiful , and begins to look like the face of the Holy Mother. p. 16 PROSTITUTE who has looked at the Woman with awe , recognizes her in the gray light , as she sits on the Thief 's shoulders with the child in her arms . She falls to her knees before her , and cries in an unearthly voice.Oh , see , see . It is the Holy Mother . Look at her  --  her face . She has come from the church . Oh , it is the holy picture before which I always pray . I know her . Our Holy Mother in her very flesh . She gives a great cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother , take me under Thy protection . She falls prostrate , unable to talk any more . The others are infected with the spirit of her words . They look with fear at the Woman 's face . They recognize the Madonna . They bend half-ways on their knees . The Thief , who has let her down from his shoulders , takes off his hat and kneels with the rest . All prostrate themselves . There is the sound of a church-bell . It is day . From the open window of a house across the way , leans out the wife of the Drunkard , and yells . Ah , ah , what are you doing there . Come into the house . There is work to be done . DRUNKARD roused from his ecstasy , tears his hand away from that of the Prostitute , and looks at the Woman with the Thief . Ha-ha-ha . That 's Helenka , Andrey the Plasterer 's wife . Ha-ha-ha . He 's cracked a good joke . He runs away . The others awake as if from sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Thief 's hands. p. 17 HELENKA Why did you drag me into the street ? THIEF holding her hand . Come with me . Remember what we said . Come to another land with me . HELENKA weeping.What does he want with me ? Why did he drag me into the street ? Come home , children . All run from him . THIEF stands near the well , and thunders after them.Dogs , where are you running ? You dogs , you damned dogs Townspeople come to the well with pails , grumbling.
