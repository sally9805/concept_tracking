THE war has been breaking down principles , overturning am- o ms , shattering theories , in every direction . We have seen this statementoverwhelmingly proved in military , in naval affairs . No less is it true in finance . In the school of finance , as well as that of the army and navy , there were certain tenets that men had long clung to which have proved to be great illusions . To begin with , there was the favorite theory that the great international bankers could prevent war . in that belief great stress was laid n 1909 , when a group of leading American bankers was , at the urgent instance of President Taft and Secretary Knox , formed to join with similar powerful banking groups from England , France , Germany , Russia , and Japan , for the purpose of preserving China 's integrity . President Taft considered ( see President 's message to Congress of December , 19o9 ) the co-operation of these strong , international banking groups as the " indispensable instrumentality " needed " to carry out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus came into being the famous Six-Power Group . And over and above all desire to deal justly by China there was the idea that , with the leading bankers of the six greatest nations working i closely together , in harmony and in sympathy for a common end , such an entente cordiale in great finance would be established as would absolutely pre-vent war . It was argued that if the i Six-Power Group , in accord as to the distressing economic effect which any great war must have upon all the nations , declared together to their respective governments that they would finance no wars , the governments would find , perforce , that all their paths were paths of peace . For the moment this principle , which many intelligent people pronounced to be sound , seemed actually to be in effect . When , in 1915 , the Agadir , or Moroccan , incident arose , and the German Kaiser was described as being eager to declare war on France , he was flatly told by the great German bankers in Berlin and Frankfort that Germany was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . The accepted dictum of these German bankers was at once acclaimed as establishing the soundness of the general theory . When , however , the storm clouds of the present war were gathering , the opinion of the great groups of bankers counted apparently for nothing . Their judgment counted enormously in the steps that were taken by the different governments to maintain financial equilibrium , but on the main question of war or peace they were not even consulted . And so , on August 1 , 1954 , this interesting theory was disposed of promptly , and perhaps for all time . The explanation is not far to seek : no one of the governments involved stopped to say : " Wait a bit . Before I spend the money let me first find out whether I can raise it . " On the contrary , to these governments , all plunging headlong down the steep , the money cost was the least thing to think of ? and quite properly , too , if one compare with it the matter of human lives , liberty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be discarded is that the cost of a world war , such as this , was bound to be so stupendous as to enforce an early peace . Even the richest nations would not be able ( the theory ran ) to stand the pace . But here we have had almost two years of war , and as yet there seems to be no indication of the war ending on account of financial exhaustion . Yet the expenditures of each nation have been on a scale far more stupendous than the wildest prophet had ever dreamed . Statisticians for years had been wagging their heads and saying that the per diem cost of any great power at war would run up to the ruinous figure of $5,000,000 . This belief was partially based on the figures of ourown Civil War , when , in its final weeks , the daily cost to the Federal government was estimated at $3,0oo,0oo . At the outset of the Civil War such cost had been $1,000,000 a day , but in January , 1863 , the statement was made in Congress that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sundays included , and doubt was expressed " as to whether i money could be had for its continuance . " But when the present war broke out the per diem cost of $5,000 , o0o , as estimated by the financial philosophers , had to be altered in the case of Great Britain to $to , coo , 000 . And the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer warned the British people that such a slow pace could not last . They were quite right . Each month , by leaps and hounds , the expenditure increased ; and Mr. Asquith , in his last statement , confessed to $2.5.00c,000 per day as the outgo . And the total daily expenditure of the belligerents is now estimated at over $100,000.000 , made up as follows : Thus another fond . theory , that of heavy expenditures forcing an early peace , is shattered . Here the explana-non is fairly simple . It is this : while the present expenditures have no precedent in any previous war , the available resources have apparently increased at a still faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not difficult to follow : ( a ) In 1816 the United Kingdom 's national debt was about $4,500,000,000 . It is now , early in 1916 , about $11,155 , - 000.000 , an increase of 145 per cent . In 1816 the income of the people of Great Britain was estimated at $1,500,000,000 , and in 1916 , it is estimated to be $12 , - soo , 000,000 , an increase of 833 per cent . ( b ) The existing British debt , includ-ing the recent American loan , is less than one year 's income of the people of the United Kingdom , whereas the debt as it stood in 1816 was equal to three years ' income . On the basis of its present income , it is thought that Great Britain could support , with no greater burden on the people than was successfully carried during the Napoleonic wars , a national debt of $40,000.000,000 , bearing interest at 5 per cent . ( c ) Still another way of putting it is that the present debt , which approximates $11,155,000,000 , represents only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British people ; whereas the national debt in 1816 amounted to 36 per cent . of their estimated wealth at that time . The foregoing figures are as to the wealthiest nation , in liquid resources , of them all ? Great Britain . And France , Russia , Germany , and Italy are likewise so rich that it would appear that if the war ends within the next two years , the end will be duenot primarily to the financial exhaustion of those countries . Of course , as to the lesser Allies the case is different . Normally , they would already he so exhausted financially as to be unable to proceed . But they are all little brothers of the rich , and constantly are being helped out with gold and credit . Great Britain , according to the Round Table , that illuminating quarterly review of the politics of the British Empire , has already loaned to her allies not less than $2,00o,000.0oo . There is still a third financial tradition that has had to be abandoned . This is the one that international trade and exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so firmly established that nothing could wreck it . Another great illusion ! For when the war cameour exchanges broke down overnight . The whole structure , whereby the cattlemen in Argentine , the farmer in Dakota , the diamond-miner in Africa , the silk merchant in China , could get their pay or could settle their bills , as the case might he , without serious loss in exchange , came toppling down like a house of cards . Coincident with , and following , this downfall were to be seen all the phenomena of a world topsy-turvy . All precedent , all traditions , went by the hoard . As Frederick Scott Oliver says , in his admirable Ordeal by Battle , there is no further use in declaring a thing unthinkable when we have only to look about us and see that the unthinkable has become true These unthinkable things at the war 's outbreak fell so thick upon an unprepared world of commerce and finance that , for a time , the world was prostrate . But after a brief period of disorganization , finance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and falling back upon the principles of serenity and common sense , reasserted itself and started in to adapt its world to the abnormal- None of us can ever forget those great protective measures put Into effect on both sides of the Atlantic at the outbreak of the war . The action of three or four English financiers and statesmen on that fateful Sunday of August a , 1914 , was taken in desperate haste , yet was so far-sighted , in the declaration of moratoria and in the guaranteeing of bills of exchange , as to throw a mantle of protection over the British Empire 's home industries and over her commerce , far flung on the bosom of the seven seas . With these fond illusions lying fresh-shattered just behind them , economists , nothing daunted , are now laying down fresh theories . One favorite and rashly expressed belief is that all the warring nations , big as well as little , are about to plunge over the brink into repudiation and bankruptcy . The propagandists of this belief base it upon the undoubted strain which even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various government debts has been staggering . England is the only government that has , as yet , made a determined effort to lessen her borrowing through the heavy increase of taxes . Take the chief belligerent powers as a whole , and we shall find that the national debts have increased about as shown by the following table . Thesefigures are approximately correct , but complete statistics from the other side are not always available promptly , and the situation may have changed between the time this table was prepared and its publication : For the comfort , or confusion , as the case may be , of the prophets who are just now predicting bankruptcy for all the belligerents , it may be well to recall that in Great Britain , at any rate , prophets of ill omen , even in high places , have always appeared during every period of financial stress . When the treaty of Ryswick was signed in 1697 , after ten years of war with France , King William III. , in grave fear as to the national finances which showed a debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " May God relieve us from our present embarrassment , for I can not suppose it is His will to suffer a nation to perish which He has so miraculously saved . " In 1749 Lord Bolingbroke , in even gloomier vein , wrote : " Our Parliamentary aids , from the year 1740 exclusively to the year 1748 inclusively , amounted to ? 55,522,159 , a sum that will appear incredible to future generations , and is so , almost , to the present . Till we have paid a good part of our debts and restored our country , in some measure , to her former wealth , it will be difficult to maintain the dignity of Great Britain . " And yet the debt which caused Bolingbroke such dismay amounted to but eleven days of his country 's expenditure in the present war . It is interesting to see how the situation which made Lord Rnlingbroke so fearful compares with that to-day . The most authentic information which can be secured indicates that Great Britain 's national wealth , at that time , was about Sscoopooppo . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealth . To-day Great Britain 's debt is calculated at between one-eighth and one-ninth of the national wealth , yet , in spite of the relatively heavier burden in those former days , the value of an obligation of Great Britain was such that within about a decade from the time Lord Bolingbroke was making his sad predictions the government was able to convert the 4-per-cent. debt into3-percents . Our new prophets of sweeping financial disaster would do well to recollect that , just as under bright skies it is hard to realize that a deluge can ever come upon us , so it is only human nature to think , when we arc in the midst of dark days , that they are the darkest the world has ever seen , and that they can never end . We also have with us to-day a set of theorists who declare that America will soon become the financial center of the world . They may be correct , but the phenomena upon which they base their theory have been in existence almost too short a time to warrant permanent deductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is not unlikely to prove another great illusion . To be sure , for the moment the world seems to be financially at America 's feet . One evidence of this is the heavy discount at which the currency equivalents of the different belligerents have been selling in this market . Even the pound sterling last August fell to $4.5o ? which means that whereas , ordinarily , to buy ? I , 000 , one had to pay 4,865 , one could then buy the same amount of sterling with only $4,500 . And marks , francs , lire , kronen , and rubles have been at a far heavier discount . Another evidence of financial ascendancy ? and one more patent to the layman ? lies in the considerable amount of foreign loans already taken by American investors . Following is a list of these principal loans , the total of which runs well over $1,000,000,000 . Of all these loans , the issue , jointly by Great Britain and France , of $500,000 , - 000 bonds , has been far and away the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view . Not only is it the largest sum ever raised in America at any one time , but it has carried in its train much controversy , many features touching upon the political as well as the commercial life of the nation . In the early days of the war France sounded American bankers as to whether they would make her a loan . The bankers sought the attitude of Secretary Bryan , who expressed the opinion that , upon the theory of strict neutrality in both word and action which had been urged upon the nation , a loan to belligerent France would be improper . This opinion was immediately challenged . Many persons argued , on the ground of sentiment , that such an attitude was ungrateful , coming from a people that had benefited so materially from loans which France made to us in the War of the Revolution . Others pointed out that money was merely a commodity , and that if the American people must refrain from letting a belligerent have this particular commodity of credit , then the corollary was that America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to export food or munitions to a belligerent . These protestants to Mr. Bryan 's ideas of neutrality pointed out that for us to sell our wheat , corn , and beef to the belligerent nations was of far greater help to them than it was for us to give to them , as to our other customers , time in which to pay their bills ? that is , granting them loans . Yet no one proposed that we should decline to sell and export our foodstuffs to Great Britain and France . The logic of this argument must have come home to the State Department almost before its first attitude against making belligerent loans was well understood , for Washington soon modified its position . Within sixty days ? namely , in October , 1914 ? the same group of bankers informed the State Department that , unless there was specific objection , it proposed to grant a credit of kio , 000,000 to the French Republic . Mr. Bryan thereupon indicated that the question was of no concern to the State Department . Again , early in 1915 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America of $59,000,000 of French notes , and on this question the Administration quietly let It be known that it did not care to be advised of such operations . By the time , therefore , that the great Anglo-French loan of October , 1915 , was under negotiation , the public was well aware that the Administration not only no longer held that belligerent loans were unneutral , but , in point of fact , looked favorably upon the proposed loan to Great Britain and France , as a means necessary to maintain America 's export trade to those two countries ? a trade the loss of which would have tended to slacken industry and possibly cause concern to the Administration . Accordingly , the Anglo - French loan met open opposition only from two classes of people : First , those , comparatively limited in number , who were sincerely , if mistakenly , convinced that the allied governments would become financially involved ; and second , from that much larger number of German sympathizers who saw in the loan simply another measure to assist the Allies to defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , held tenaciously to the theory that they were unwilling that their deposits should be employed in loans to the enemies of their native land . Of course , such depositors had a perfect right to offer objection , and it is manifest that , if a large proportion of them in any one institution entered protest , their attitude i might conceivably influence the bank 's policy materially . But on the whole ( except in cities with large German-born population ) such groups of protestants were small , constituting not over 5 or io per cent . of the bank 's total deposits ; yet this small minority did not seem to realize that , though they might be opposed to the loan , the other go or 95 per cent . of depositors might be strongly in favor of it . At any rate , this opposition was ineffective . Such , in brief , is the history of the unprecedented and quickly abandoned theory that for a neutral people to make loans to a belligerent constitutes an unneutral act . Moreover , before war had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , as individuals , to remain neutral in their thoughts and sympathies was beyond belief . Clear-thinking Americans were bound to become partisans for one side or for the other . As Professor Josiah Royce has recently said in his The Duties of Americans in the Present War : " It is as impossible for every reasonable man to be in his heart and mind neutral as it was for the good cherubs in heaven to remain neutral when they first looked out from their rosy , glowing clouds and saw the angels fall . " How could it have even been expected that an American business man , for instance , full of activity , ambitious for the upbuilding of his country 's industry and commerce , could remain neutral ? How could he ever forget that for a hundred and twenty-five years . up to the time of this war , France and England had given unlim ! ! ited credit to commercial America , had lent us literally billions of dollars to help build our railways and factories , to aid in developing American industries ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how could it be refused except on the theory that the American man of affairs is heartless as well as short-sighted ? Of course , some parts of the country , more than others . were impressed with the importance of making the great loan to Great Britain and France . Of the total amount of %5oo , o00,000 , a little over $5o,000poo was underwritten in New England , almost $32o,000,000 in New York State , and , of that amount , all but $8,000,000 in New York city alone . Pennsylvania did almost $69,000,000 . The balance , $70,000,000 , was scattered throughout the country . Certain centers , notably Chicago , which underwrote only about $6,000,000 , professed their belief in the importance of the loan to America 's trade , yet manifestly failed to give it hearty support . But it is only fair to say that American investors have , until now , never had occasion to invest in foreign government securities . Ever since our existence as a nation we have been a borrowing , not a lending . people . It is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for countries of vast resource , like Great Britain , France , and Russia , the repudiation of an external debt is , in practice , out of the question . Finally , as to the future , though evidence is still wanting that the end of the war is in sight , we find ourselves already contemplating more new theories , possibly fresh illusions , as to the conditions that Will obtain when the war is over . Many economists are studying conditions as they appeared at the close of the Napoleonic conflicts , the War of the Rebellion , and the Franco-Prussian struggle , hoping from the study of such phenomena to he able to form sound , working theories for the coming post-helium period . In thus picturing the industrial situation subsequent to the war , there are two general schools . One holds to the belief that business prostration in the now warring countries will be complete and prolonged ; that , Owing to the terrific destruction of wealth and capital , and to the continued necessities of the governments to meet the interest on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rates of interest high ; that this demand will make itself felt all over the world , and will tend to curtail new enterprises everywhere ; that here in the United States an early effect will he seen , and once more the pinch of poverty will be felt and depression in business he long continued . This school holds , furthermore , that the wastage of human life will have been so great that abroad there will be a dearth of labor , both skilled and unskilled ; and that almost a generation , in point of time , will pass before this wastage of life will have been replaced and normal conditions oflife and industry brought back . The cost of living , these theorists declare , will be maintained at a distressingly high figure , owing to the high cost of labor and to the continued heavy government taxes . The same school points out , too , that the belligerent nations will suffer grievously from the loss of a whole generation of educated and trained young men , who naturally would have been the leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other school is much less pessimistic . It concedes a certain industrial languor and hesitation immediately following the war , but is confident that it will not be long continued . Its argument runs about as follows : The destruction of fixed capital ( factories and equipment ) will be found to have been greatly overestimated . To he sure , there has been destruction of villages by the wholesale , but , as compared with the total , the amount of fixed capital destroyed will be a small percentage . Of gold and securities there has been practically no loss . The process of industrial repair will begin at once , after the brief interval required for the returning soldier to beat his sword into a plowshare . Moreover , there will be ample capital to serve , and at reasonable rates of interest . The reason therefor is twofold : first , because of the enormous savings resulting from the economies of the people at large ; and , second , because of the vastly increased effectiveness in production of these people . It is pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been practised and are being permanently cultivated . And when populations aggregating two or three hundred million people are saving as never before , they build up capital almost as fast as even such a world war can waste it . Furthermore , this school reiterates , the qualities of organization , of applied energy , and of determination , which the war is steadily cultivating , will render industry abroad a much more skilled tool than ever before . Then , indeed , will " scientific management " come to its real fruition . We may or may not see socialization of industry continued on an even greater scale than to-day in Germany and England . But in any event we shall see far better organization than ever before . And that means that American industry , labor , manufacture , will meet far more formidable competition than of old . Our markets will be flooded with products From an Old World made over , working at top speed , with an organization more aroused , skilled , and effective than ever before . Who can say that either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time alone will reveal which , if either , of them has produced theories of value . If neither of them , then we shall again establish the precedent that only the unprecedented is to be expected . Whatever be the status after the war , it is plain that to-day , and for some years to come , there opens before the manufacturers and merchants of America unexampled opportunity for up-building . But those opportunities are not so easy as to he available without wise and generous vision . Great Britain and Germany have built up their overseas trade by methods both cautious and courageous . They have gained strong positions in new markets like South America and the Far East by first creating the demand for their wares and then by supplying and financing that demand . Most of the public utilities to-day in those markets are owned by British and German , sometimes French , Belgian , or Dutch investors . An English manufacturer will furnish electrical equipment for a street railway in the Argentine , will accept bonds in payment , and then an English securities company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The process is repeated over and over again ; and so , in course of time , a great pioneer and trading nation like the English secures a solid foothold all over the world . Just now , however , owing to the war , neither England nor Germany is able to maintain its old-time policy:of financing its great customers abroad . Already these customers areturningto America for help . Uponthe liberality and wisdom with which America meets such demands will depend the extent to which this country builds up her trade in those foreign regions . Great opportunities , too , are opening before us on the continent of Europe itself . Russia is beckoning to us with an insistent finger . Hitherto Germany has largely supplied industrial Russia with her equipment . Russia declares that after the war she will be slow to renew those trade relations . Whether or not that feeling will remain strong , Russia 's men of affairs and her government officials are just now inviting America to come and open up new markets , to equip railroads , to establish branch banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even for northern France , American machinery and American capital may be required to rebuild bridges , roads , and factories . From London , mobilizing its holdings not alone of American , but of all foreign securities , may come the suggestion that American capital buy from the English holders securities representing the control of some important railway south of the equator , a link in a chain coupling up new and fertile regions . And with any such developments as I picture , with America lending her aid , in safe and orderly fashion , to rebuild the world , one must hope for a great increase in scientific attainment over here , for a great development of technical education , for a greater revival of the useful arts ? a precursor , perhaps , of a great revival of learning and of the fine arts in America . It is being asserted of Americans to-day that , despite their donations to the suffering millions across the Atlantic , they are not thrilled with a deep and abiding sympathy for the spirit of self-sacrifice and heroism that is animating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own abundant , material prosperity . It seems a trite thing to say that all this wealth will be of no real use to the nation unless it aids in developing America 's institutions , in educating and broadening her citizens ; that all this material success will have gone for naught unless it adds to the nation 's enlightenment and progress . Yet , with- out a revival of science and learning to illumine , to inspirit , and make them wise , business and finance can never fulfil their work of contributing substantially to the arts of peace and of civilization .
