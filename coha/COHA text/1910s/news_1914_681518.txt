These lectures have given delight and Instruction every year literally to hundreds of thousands of our people . The weakest of all the objections urged against the lectures is the remark that the subjects are chiefly " poetry and art . " The record is directly to the contrary . The subjects named , though not In so abstract a form , are rightfully In the course , but in a reasonable and just proportion to other subjects . Among other elements of excellent judgment shown by Dr. Henry M. Lelpziger , the Supervisor of Lectures , is a sane division into subjects of utility , instruction , health , and art , or cultural themes . I know of many parts of the elty In which these lectures have been a real boon . Their value can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape , but the value is great . nevertheless . Their money cost is really very small . I feel certain that the members of the Board of Aldermen . upon reconsideration of this matter , will withdraw their opposition and continue their support of this splendid system of popular education .
