chapter begins through the initiative of the wind . Abbie Farwell Brown 's " The Christmas Angel " ( Houghton ) , with illustrations by Reginald Birch , should find warm welcome ; the story is touching and effective in the same way as " The Christmas Carol . " Eden Phillpotts has written " The Flint Heart " ( Dutton ) , a mixture of Dartmoor and Lewis Carroll . Those who are unfortunate enough to hold the unlucky stone called the Flint Heart lose all gentleness and compassion . Disaster follows upon disaster . " FineIla in Fairyland " ( Houghton ) is by Demetra Kenneth Brown , who has told very prettily and simply how a naughty girl was made good through the ministrations of flower fairies and of butterflies . Clifton Johnson has turned his hand to many forms of editing ; readers will remember his Tree Fairy Series . This year he is editing for Baker &; Taylor " Golden Books for Children , " the first two being " The Arabian Nights " and " Robin Hood . " We like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give each story a setting , but we should be better pleased if we were surer of having before us the true versions . We would call attention to a cheaper edition of Barrie 's " Peter Pan " ( Scribner ) with Rackham 's delightful color plates , though we must warn the buyer that the story herein contained is not the same as that of the play . " Norse Fairy Tales " ( Lippincott ) , selected and adapted from the translations by Sir G. W. Dasent , is an artistic volume copiously illustrated in color and line ? by R. L. Knowles . In their original these tales were not intended for children . L. Frank Baum , in " The Emerald City of Oz " ( Reilly &; Britton ) , declares that this shall be the last of the " Oz " series ; he therefore assembles all of the characters , so enjoyed by children , for their farewell . The first of these books appeared in 1900 , and we believe their popularity was due more to the fancifulness of a name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , as the publishers think , that they were " bloodless fairy tales " which " led the way ' out of the dark ages of Blue-beard books for children . " The Rand-McNally Company 's edition of Browning 's " The Pied Piper of Hamelin " has been effectively illustrated and lettered by Hope Dunlap . The color is very broad , but the conceptions are agreeable , and almost mural in scope . The black and white pages are equally effective . " Famous Scouts " ( Page ) , by Charles H. L. Johnston , is just the sort of book to please boys , for it is not only by the author of " Famous Cavalry Leaders , " but it includes careers of trappers , pioneers , and soldiers of the frontier . It begins with Israel Putnam and ends with Buffalo Bill . A second volume in the Guide to Biography series includes " American Men of Mind , " among them philanthropists and reformers , painters and sculptors , and so on . It is difficult to regard this work by Burton E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cursory sketch of short related biographies , so arranged as to be a ready reference volume  --  another " Who 's Who . " The tone of Edwin M. Bacon 's " The Boy 's Drake " ( Scribner ) is to be recommended . It is a full biographical account based on an authentic record , and containing copious quotations ; there are pictures , maps , and reproductions of title pages . Already there have been issued in this series " The Boy 's Hakluyt " and " The Boy 's Catlin . " Harvey F. B. Wheeler has prepared an adequate volume entitled " The Boy 's Napoleon " ( Crowell ) . It is well written and is full in detail . A fit companion to this is Edward Fraser 's " Bellerophon " ( Stokes ) , which traces the record of the British man-of-war on whose deck Bonaparte gave himself into custody . The book is effectively printed , and bound in an attractive cover design . Of books retold we may name the following : " The ? Boy 's Cuchulain " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germ and Flower " ( Little , Brown ) , by Prof. J. H. Cox ; " Stories from the Chronicle of the Cid " ( Holt ) , by Mary W. Plummer ; " Stories from Dante " ( Crowell ) , by Susan Cunning-ton ; " Heroes of the Elizabethan Age " ( Lippincott ) , by Edward Gilliat ; " Heroes of the Polar Seas " ( Lippincott ) , by J. Kennedy Maclean ; " Tales from the Alhambra " ( Houghton ) , by Josephine Brower ; " Stories from Shakespeare " ( Crowell ) , by Thomas Carter ; " Old Greek Nature Stories ( Crowell ) , by F. A. Farrar , and " The Children 's Plutarch " ( Harper ) , by F. J. Gould . It is almost impossible to give any adequate idea of the field of fiction for children . About 30 per cent . of the deluge consists of members of the series class , and these we pass by , warning the Christmas buyer . We have extracted from the mass a few volumes deserving of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no more refreshing story than Inez Haynes Gillmore 's " Phoebe and Ernest " ( Holt ) , which tells in graphic manner the trials of a hero and heroine during a transformation age . Norman Duncan 's " Billy Topsail 8r ; Company " ( Revell ) contains all the splendid dash of a former volume . H. H. Jackson 's " Nelly 's Silver Mine " ( Little , Brown ) is a story of Colorado , worthy of the new form given it . Among the college stories , none is more distinctive than Katharine Holland Brown 's " Philippa at Halcyon " ( Scribner ) . It may be overcharged with a certain moral tone , but it abounds in fun and good cheer . John Masefield 's " Martin Hyde : The Duke 's Messenger " ( Little , Brown ) , a story of the Pretender , loses slightly by its first person narrative , but it has excitement in it , and a deal of movement , besides good writing . The same Criticism applies to Gulielma Zollinger 's " The Rout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story has reached us for a long time than Charles Major 's " The Little King " ( Macmillan ) , which tells of the varied adventures of the child Louis XIV and Sweet Mam'selle . The illustrations are striking . Lieut. - Com . Yates Stirling , jr. , U. S. N. , is the author of many volumes , in a series of which " A U. S. Midshipman in the Philippines " ( Penn ) is one . The same may be said of Commander E. L. Beach 's " Midshipman Ralph Osborn at Sea " ( Wild0 . In passing we must note Rupert Hughes 's " The Lakerim Cruise " ( Century ) , Annie Fellows Johnston 's " Mary Ware in Texas " ( Page ) , " Patty 's Success , " by Carolyn Wells ( Dodd , Mead ) , and Margaret Sidney 's " A Little Maid of Boston Town " ( Lothrop , Lee ) . Dudley and Stratemeyer are also well represented . Notes .

John Adams Thayer 's " Astir , " which appeared in France last June simultaneously with its publication here , is to be brought out in London early in 1911 , by T. Werner Laurie , with the title " Getting On : The Confessions of a Publisher . " A. C. McClurg &; Co. announce for the autumn of 1911 a translation of Vicente Blasco Ibdilez 's story of bull fighting , " Sangre y Arena , " by Frances Douglas ( Mrs. Charles F. Lummis ) . At a meeting of the American Academy of Arts and Letters , which was held at the New Theatre on Thursday and Friday of last week , it was announced that the gold medal of the Institute of Arts and Letters was this year awarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadler will publish with A. C. McClurg &; Co . " The Physiology of Faith and Fear . " The same house has made arrangements with Charles Carver for dramatizations of the following books : Randall Parrish 's " My Lady of the South " and " Bob Hampton of Placer " ; Charles E. Walk 's " The Silver Blade , " and Will Lillibridge 's " Ben Blair . " Henry Frowde announces for immediate publication an addition to the Church Art in England Series , viz. , " Wood Carving in English Churches , " by Francis Bond , which has much to say about stall and tabernacle work , bishops ' thrones , and chancel chairs ; there will be 124 illustrations . Another volume , " Wood Carvings , " is being written by P. M. Johnston , which will deal with chests , almeries , organ cases , doors , and collecting boxes . Mexico , Cuba , Argentina , Colombia , Venezuela , and Spain are represented in " Las Mejores Poesias Liricas de la Lengua Castellana , " edited by Prof. E. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Holt &; Co. are issuing shortly . Holt . &; Co. also promise " Das Marchen von Heute , " edited with notes and vocabulary by M. C. Stewart ( which includes besides the title story " Der Elfen Geheimnis " and " Der Gliiekspitz " ) , and " The Silver Thread and Other Folk Plays for Young People . " The Appletons will have ready February 1 " The American Year Book , " which undertakes to cover the history of the year 1910 entire and to serve as a convenient new , hand-ok. - A 3 ; ewlarge paper edition of Words-book complete poetical writings , in ten volumes , with a series of photogravures , is announced by Houghton Mifflin for appearance this month . The list of books to be published in January by Frederick A. Stokes Co . Includes : " Sydney Carteret , Rancher , " by Harold Bindloss ; " Woman and Marriage , " by Margaret Stephens ; " Garden Flowers in Colors : Orchids , Daffodils " ; " The Book of Cupid , Anthology , " by Henry Newboldt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by Cuthbert Hadden . A ninth volume in the Beaumont and Fletcher of the Cambridge English Classics ( Putnam ) adds five plays : The Sea-Voyage , Wit at Several Weapons , The Fair Maid of the Inn , Cupid 's Revenge , and the Two Noble Kinsmen . With the tenth volume the labors of the editor , A. R. Waller , will be ended . The " Greek Studies " has been added to Macmillan 's new Library Edition of Pater . Only one more volume is needed to complete the set . A committee of the Harvard Alumni Association , with C. Chester Lane as chairman , has compiled a " Harvard University Directory , " which is published by the University Press . In a stout volume of nearly 1,300 pages , the names are listed , amounting to 32,188 , of all living men who have at any time been students of the university . For 1,656 of these men no addresses could be found ; for the others , the address and degrees , with dates , are given . Various statistical tables at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , the centenary of Mrs. Gaskell 's birth , would not pass without the reissuing of one or two of her novels , was inevitable from the publisher 's point of view , and was a pleasant thought to that growing body of readers to whom her work singularly appeals . Bell &; Sons of London have set forth " Sylvia 's Lovers " in a rather handsome edition , with colored illustrations by M. V. Wheelhouse . The preface , by Thomas Seccombe , contains a very readable life , and undertakes to define Mrs. Gaskell 's position in English fiction . If you ask for the normal type of English novel in the highest degree of perfection to which it ever attained , I should certainly be inclined to say , take " Mary Barton , " " North and South , " " Sylvia 's Lovers , " and " Wives and Daughters . " Not one of them altogether or entirely attains to the perfection of which Mrs. Gaskell herself was capable . But they fully and adequately reveal her power , and likewise her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the potentialities and limitations of which , alike , it seems to me , she had an intuition surpassing the utmost efforts of any of her greater contemporaries . " Wives and Daughters " is issued by Henry Frowde , as an addition to the series of " World 's Classics . " There are a few pages of introduction by Clement Shorter . The importance of Boston in the history and culture of the country makes M. A. De Wolfe Howe 's " Boston Common , Scenes from Four Centuries , " which is issued by the Riverside Press , Cambridge , a book of more than local interest . Old drawings , plans , and maps , and modern photographs present the city from a very primitive stage down to the present day ; town records carry the history back to the very beginning . We read of the year 1646 : That there shall be kept on the Common bye the Inhabitants of the Towne- but 70 anilch Kine ; . . . that there shalbe no dry cattell , younge Cattell , or horse shalbe free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse for Elder Oliver ; . . . that ifany desire to kep sheep , hee may kep fours sheep in liew of a Cow . How persistently the Common has been the centre of public life in Boston is revealed by this book clearly enough . Present residents will look with special curiosity at a plan of the streets made by Capt . John Bonner in 1722 , whereon we note that Treamount Street runs into Common Street . " The Oxford Book of Italian Verse " ( Clarendon Press ) contains three hundred and forty-five lyrics , from the thirteenth century to the nineteenth century , chosen by St. John Lucas . ' About one hundred writers are represented by significant poems , and in general the selections are judiciously made . No reader who is familiar with Italian literature will , naturally , agree in every case with the editor 's judgment . For instance , among the ten poems quoted from Carducci we miss the famous " T ' amo , o pio Bove , " which is often spoken of as the finest sonnet of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carducci brings the collection to a close . In an introductory sketch Mr. Lucas gives a spirited account of the historical development of poetry in Italy . The opinions expressed are those generally accepted ; the different poets are neatly , if sometimes rather too definitely , classified and withal the editor 's enthusiasm is persuasive . There is no bibliography , except for the occasional mention of a title in the notes , along with the extremely concise biographies . A few of the historical allusions and fewer still of the difficult words are explained . Sometimes the information given is exceedingly scanty , as in this note on Vittorelli ( a poet , by the way , whose fame is just now having something of a revival in Italy ) : " Born at Bassano . Held a public appointment at Venice . Byron liked his poetry . " Rime , " Venezia , 1851.1 " Similarly , the notary of Lentino , properly called either Giacomo or Jacepo , but here dubbed Giacopo , is dismissed as " another of the Sicilian group of poets . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a collection of verse this Oxford Book is a delight to the eye and to the mind . Uniform in style and method with the English and French anthologies from the same press , this new volume will be even more welcome to lovers of poetry , owing to the lack of competitors in its special field . Walter Tyndale 's " Japan and the Japanese " ( Macmillan ) , which comes to us arrayed both inwardly and outwardly in festal apparel , is the work of an English painter , who wisely sketched and colored in the rainy and misty climate of Japan only when he could secure the right light , atmosphere , and appropriate natural conditions . Hence , the twenty-two full-page illustrations in color have a home-like look to an old resident in the sunny isles of the cherry blossom . To others the tints may seem extravagant . Mr. Tyndale 's landscape is ever a thoroughly human one , and probably no illustrated book thus far produced shows more significantly the effect of natural beauty on fine manners . Praiseworthy is Mr. Tyndale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , like the oleander and the pomegranate ; though the standard features of the vegetable world and of art and architecture are not neglected . The perspective is unusually good . The author 's text is light , pleasing , and accurately descriptive of the daily ways and temperament of the Japanese . He exposes some ridiculous notions , among others that of the mythical Chinaman in the Japanese ' banks , who keeps the money . There is an index . In " Tennyson as a Student and Poet of Nature " ( Macmillan ) , Sir Norman Lockyer and Winfred L. Lockyer have gathered together and classified all the passages from the poet 's works " which deal with the scientific aspects of nature . " " The highest poetry , " Sir Norman observes in the preface , " should be associated with the ? highest knowledge . Tennyson 's great achievement has been to show us that in the study of science we have one of the bases of the fullest poetry . " Tennyson was a close friend of Sir Norman 's , whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was astonished at the poet 's " minute knowledge in various fields . " Sir Norman continues : So far as my memory serves rffe , I was introduced to the late Lord Tennyson by Wodlner about the year 1864 . I was then living in Fairfax Road , West Hampstead , and I had erected my six-inch Cooke equatorial in the garden . I soon found that he was an enthusiastic astronomer , and that few points in the descriptive part of the subject had escaped him . He was therefore often in the observatory . Some of his remarks still linger fresh in my memory . One night when the moon 's terminator swept across the broken ground round Tycho , he said : " What a splendid Hell that would make . " Again , after showing him the clusters in Hercules and Perseus , he remarked musingly : " I can not think much of . the county families after that . " In 1866 my wife was translating GuillemiMs " Le Ciel " and I was editing and considerably expanding it ; he read many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English edition , " The Heavens . " Of Tennyson 's conception of the cosmogony , Sir Norman writes : In Tennyson we find the complete separation of Science from Dogmatic Theology thus foreshadowed by Milton , finally achieved . . . The modern Systema Mundi which Tennyson dwells on over and over again is dominated by Astronomy and Geology , terrible Muses . In " The Beaux and the Dandies " ( Lane ) , Clare Jerrold has collected for those whose curiosity runs after such matters a fair-sized volume of anecdotes of Nash , Brummel , D'Orsay , and their courts . The beaux for whom Mr. Jerrold has a soft heart really began with the Restoration , when Charles II drew a crowd of young men about him ; but they flowered in later reigns . Soule of the anecdotes which the author has got together are excellent for their humor or wit , but there is much that might have been omitted . He recalls a story of the heartless Sheridan , who was at Bath , under Beau Nash . Meeting , after a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his high play at gambling , Sheridan asked : " How are you , major , how have you been going on of late ? " " I have had a great misfortune since last we met , " was the reply . " I have lost Mrs. Brereton . " " Aye , " an= swered Sheridan . " How did you lose her , at hazard or at quinze ? " A number of George Selwyn 's stories are given , and altogether it is almost as much a book of wits as of beaux . " Gambetta 's Life and Letters " ( Appleton ) , an authorized translation by V. M. Montagu of M. Gheusi 's " Gambetta par Gambetta , " published in Paris in 1909 , is , as the French title shows more clearly than the English , composed almost entirely of Gambetta 's own writings , principally letters , collected together as a sort of posthumous Apologia . The chief value and interest of the book lie in its refutation of certain stories that have been diligently circulated about Gambetta . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in the right eye because his father would not take him away from the little seminary at Cahors , to which the boy had taken a violent dislike because it was run by priests . The second story is yet more dramatic  --  that Mme. Leonie Leon ruined Gambetta 's life and then , when he failed to carry out a coup d'etat on his own account , murdered him for the sake of another lover . These stories , to the regret of all lovers of scandal , M. Gheusi refutes once and for all . It is to be hoped that they will not be resurrected again . Gambetta brought himself into public notice first in November , 1868 , when he made his famous speech in the ProcAs Baudin . In vain did the President try to stop his eloquence : he refused to stop speaking . His words were a veritable flood , and the reporters , " after breaking their pencils in the effort to follow him , " as his biographer enthusiastically relates , sat rapt in admiration of his overwhelming eloquence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time of that speech to October , 1869 , when he was elected a Deputy to Parliament There he at once gained a commanding position through his eloquence and extraordinary activity . M. Gheusi deals somewhat too gently with the amatory passages in Gambetta 's highly irregular life , and makes too sympathetic a scene out of a death that was caused in great part by irregular living at the time when Gambetta was at the summit of his career . Still , even to the unsympathetic reader , the letters in this volume will seem more than sad . There is a vein of tragedy running through them all . The fearful struggles the man went through against poverty and ill health , and his consummate bravery , do much to eradicate the unsavory taste of his life in other respects And there is a touch of fineness in the letter of his father , who , when asked that his son 's body might be sent to Paris for burial , replied : " You had him when he was alive ; now that he is dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him . He shall rest in the cemetery at Nice , whither his mother has preceded him . " In " The Qualities of Men " ( Houghton Mifflin Company ) Joseph Jastrow presents in popular form the results of an extended study soon to be published with the title of " Character and Temperament . " Dr. Jastrow emphasizes throughout innate sensibility as chief motive of right action . Men differ more in their sensibilities than In their logical capacity . Four general grades of sensibility are distinguished , the Poietic , Kinetic ( executive ) , Dull , and Base . In the case of Poietic man , the adjustment of individual sensibility to social convention is necessarily a very complicated one . Indeed , the success of the adjustment is in direct ratio to its elaborateness . Of simple lives and utopias Dr. Jastrow Is no friend . On the practical side the book is largely a pleathat our democracy should make larger use of the man of imagination . Our danger , he finds is in over-exaltation of the kinetic type ; and in resentment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sociological views expressed by George Bourne in " The Ascending Effort " ( reviewed in the Nation August 11 ) . Both critics , by emphasizing the value of sensibility , approach the pragmatic position. , and both by insisting on the validity of remoter ideals , evade this fashionable classification . Dr. Jastrow 's manner is robust and interesting , but possibly by reason of insistent cleverness of phrase e little difficult . One could wish the teaching taken up by one who had the public ear . This little book whets one 's appetite for the larger study of which it is a forerunner . From Doubleday , Page &; Co. we have an American edition of " Mountain Adventures at Home and Abroad , " by George D Abraham , well known to readers of mountain-climbing literature as author of " The Complete Mountaineer , " and as an enthusiastic member of various organizations of the climbing fraternity in England and on the Continent . If the Englishman is subject to some reproach for seeking his pleasure in going out and killing something , it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just as constant an clement in his recreation The disasters incidentally recorded make Mr Abraham 's volume rather grewsome in parts , though it must be said to his credit that he uses these stories , not to feed a morbid interest in the sensational , but to counsel such sane methods of climbing as will eliminate the large proportion of really avoidable accidents and free an exhilarating and ennobling recreation from undeserved reproach Bits of Virgil , Byron , and various other poets give to this volume a certain air of literary cultivation often missing in current books of adventure , though one can not accuse the author of reaching the level which he alleges against the late Sir- Leslie Stephen , whose account of an ascent of the Schreckhorn , in 1861 , " reaches such heights of literary excellence that nobody since has been able to identify the route taken " Old accounts of the distressing physical effects of ascent to high altitudes lead the author to the conclusion that the human race is gradually improving in its capacity to endure the rarified atmosphere of high levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , the highest Himalayan summits may yet be conquered . The volume is provided with a brief glossary of the technical terms employed in the text , and a fairly complete index . Thomas Okey is an industrious bookmaker , who has , turned his hand to many themes . His " Venice and its Story " ( Dutton ) is a combination of history , guidebook , and art-manual . The historical sketch is mainly an epitome of Horatio Brown 's larger work , written with an eye on the picturesque or dramatic episodes . One misses , however , the essential  --  the clear tracing of evolution in the life of a people that extended over eleven centuries Mr. Okey 's remarks on the painters , sculptors , and architects are of little value . There are penand-ink and several colored illustrations , which give the book a holiday air . " A Book of the Black Forest " ( Dutton ) , as we are told in the prefatory note , " does not pretend to say everything there is to say about the Black Forest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section is taken up by the author , C. E. Hughes , and we get a description of the scenery , of the towns , industries , and inns , with a spice of legend that helps to make it readable Mr Hughes spent several holidays in the forest , and he must have taken notes with a certain plodding fidelity that is perhaps too well reflected in his clearly-printed pages . In short , the utilitarian object of the book makes it seem just a little too uninspired . But it is assuredly full of information for the traveller , it contains two good maps and above twenty illustrations by the author . Of all the great natural spectacles within the borders of the United States , the Grand Callon of the Colorado River of the West , in Arizona , probably is the greatest . It shows the world in the making .

The tourist who wishes to approach the wonderful scene in a state of preparation should first read this book The October number of the American Journal of International Law , just issued , opens with Paul S. Reinsch 's comprehensive paper on the - Fourth International Conference of American Republics  --  a body winch , he declares , has assumed a well-defined and dignified position among great international organizations . This Fourth Conference met at Buenos Ayres on July 12 , under the active presidency of Dr. Bermejo , Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Argentina . It was understood beforehand that certain aspects of the general welfare of the Continent were to be the subject of the Conference Technical reasons for denying admission of representatives were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even those of Nicaragua , whose dominant de facto government had not been universally recognized . The organization of the Pan-American Union was a subject of detailed and careful consideration in committee , and the tentative draft of a treaty was adopted by the general body . No action was taken looking to any essential modification of the Union 's functions , which , hoWever , were strongly emphasized . The Union has intervened in unifying consular documents , in improving custom-house regulation and sanitary police , in promoting the construction of the Pan-American Railway , in the improvement and promotion of steamship service , the interchange of university professorships , the strengthening of international confidence . Samuel B. Crandall discusses the law as applied to the Spanish treaty claims commission . Lester H. Woolsey considers early cases on the doctrine of continuous voyages  --  a subject with which the Supreme Court dealt after 1861 . He shows that that court , in deciding cases involving this doctrine , simply applied what had been held by British courts half a century before . Two papers touch Chinese questions : one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery in the Empire  --  noting that recently a rescript has been promulgated declaring that the institution is abolished , and almost procuring that end , though the Manchus seem not to , have been brought within its terms as completely as have the Chinese proper ; the second , by William R. Manning , on China and the Powers since the Boxer Movement . This is an elaborate narrative of international events occurring since 1899 that have affected the Empire . In most of them China has herself directly participated , including entry into arrangements with Russia and Japan touching Manchurian railways . She has relinquished much : In fact , she has virtually withdrawn from Manchuria , as far as railways are concerned . The Japanese press is ; urging that suzerainty in Manchuria be assumed ; the Japanese treat the country as a conquered one , her railway guards being found at great distances from the railway , and interfering in matters outside of their province . But since the Treaty of Portsmouth Mr. Manning thinks that China has won courage to resist ; e. g. , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the railway zone over both Chinese and foreigners , China interposed ; was supported by the United States consul , and in May , 1909 , Chinese sovereignty there was recognized by Russia , and the jurisdiction divided . The Supplement with this number presents copies of twelve treaties and conventions affecting China , and correspondence on one international matter affecting her . Important also is the complete award , covering forty pages , of the Arbitrators in the North Atlantic Coast Fisheries case between Great Britain and the United States , with the reasoning in entenso on the various points decided . The Rev. George Wolfe Shinn , who for thirty-one years was rector of Grace Church , Newton , Mass. , and lately its rector emeritus , died last week , at the age of seventy-one . He was the author of a " Manual- of the Prayer Book , " and edited for twenty-five years the Whittaker Series of Sunday School Instruction .

Up to his thirtieth ? year , he studied almost exclusively in Libraries .. Finding books unsatisfactory for a real comprehension of history , he determined to travel extensively in order to complement the study of books with the study of realities . He spent five years in the United States , four in France , and about twelve in England , where he lectured frequently at Oxford , Cambridge , and London Universities . The British government employed him to assist in the preparation of the Venezuela boundary case .

He was a member of the American Academy of Political and Social Science , and of the American Authors ' Society . The death is reported , in his seventy-third year , of Prof. Robert Flint , D.D. , formerly professor of moral philosophy at the University of Edinburgh . Of his many writings may be mentioned : " Philosophy of History in Europe , " " Historical Philosophy in France , " and " Theism. "
