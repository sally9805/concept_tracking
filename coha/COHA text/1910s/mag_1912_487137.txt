Two years ago Professor Moorman of the , University of Leeds published a solid volume on Herrick , whose bulk was justified by an excellent chapter on the Lyric of the English Renaissance . Now , from the prolific literary shops of Paris , we have another thick book on the same subject. , M. Delattre is learned and judicious , . His indefatigable research has unearthed one or two documents which add a little , a very little , to our knowledge of Herrick the man , and his French training has saved him from the uncritical attitude of laudation towards Herrick the poet , which is too common among English writers . But five hundred ample pages of analysis devoted to so light a theme are an intolerable tax on human patience .

Really , to ldcher le mot , as they say in M. Delattre 's own country , this sort of thing is a monstrosity ; the French , in their recent , studies of English literature , bid fair to make their rivals over the Rhine appear in comparison moderate and sensible . As for Herrick 's life , after all this ransacking of records , we know but little . He was born in London , in 1591 . His father , a prosperous goldsmith , " in the Goulsmeth Rowe in Cheap , " in the year after Robert 's birth " did throwe himself forthe of a garret window in London aforesaide whereby he did kill and destroye himself . " After this event , whether suicide or accident , the mother retired with her family to Hampton , where the boy got bis first taste of country life . As Mr. Moorman aptly says , " the Hampton scenery is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevailing mood of the Hesperides . ' " Where he got his schooling is not known , but in his seventeenth year he was apprenticed to his uncle , Sir William , also a prosperous goldsmith in London . No doubt the jocund life of the ' prentice boys of those days left its mark on the lad , and it is a pretty conjecture that such poems as " Corinna 's Going a Maying " were the direct or indirect fruit of that experience . It is more essential to observe that hisfamily associations were with the solid , prudent , home-loving bourgeoisie of Elizabethan London ; something of that quality he seems to have kept to the end of his years . In 1613 Herrick went up to Cambridge , and was enrolled as a fellow commoner at St. John 's College , from which he afterwards transfer-red himself to Trinity . He graduated in1617 , and three years later proceeded M.A. We know almost nothing of his life in Cambridge , nor is it even certain when he gave up residence The important matter is that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , to a less extent , the Greek poets , with the result that scarcely will you find a book of English verse more replete with classical reminiscences . He belonged by right to the " university wits , " and could hold his own in the circle over which Jonson ruled uproariously and divinely , an Apollo of shameful girth . Just when or how Herrick became " sealed of the tribe of Ben " is not recorded , but of his intimacy with the master there can be no doubt . Many of his lyrics , we may surmise , were first heard at . . . those lyric feasts , Made at the Sun , The Dog , the Triple Tun ; Thou seest a present God-like power - Imprinted in each herb and flower ; And Smell'st the breath of great-eyed Inns , Sweet as the blossoms of the vine Apparently Herrick felt relief when , in 1647 , Cromwell 's men ejected him from Dean Prior , yet in 1660 we find him making petition to " the Lords in Parliament Assembled " to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns to his old charge His burial is noted in the parish register under the date of October 15 , 1674 , but no stone marks his place of rest in the village churchyard At earlier dates Herrick had published one or two poems in collections of the day , but the only book entirely from his pen was brought out in London the year after his ejection from Dean Prior . This volume is composed of two parts . the first , with the general title page , " Hesperides or , The Works Both Human and Divine , " contains only the secular poems and is dated 1648 , the second , with a separate title page , " His Noble Numbers ; or , His Pious Pieces , " bears the date 1647 . Just why the book was published in this form we can not say , and , indeed , the whole composition of the volume is something of a mystery There are indications that the order of the poems is not entirely without design , but for the most part , with the exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumbled together in the most " admired disorder " As for the critical estimation of the book , I confess that I give my opinion with diffidence and some uneasiness , for when I read what has been written of Herrick by competent judges , I am left in a state of bewilderment . Thus Lowell thought Herrick " the most Catullian of poets since Catullus " ; yet certainly the spirit of these two poets is totally estranged . In faCt , Professor Moorman has brought out this estrangement by an apt comparison .. Herrick reproduces the somewhat fanciful lines . Da mi basis mile , deinde centum , Dein mile alters. , dem seconds centum ; Dein usque alters mane , deinde centumcleverly enough : Give me a kiss , and to that kiss a score ; Then to that twenty add a hundred more ; A thousand to that hundred ; so kiss on , To make that thousand up a million But , unmoved by the passion and poignancy of the foregoing verses Soles oecideie of redire possunt , Nobis , quum semel oeudit bievis lux , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his grossest lines That is well put , yet Professor Moorman proceeds to institute a comparison of Herrick with Horace which appears as far strained as that with Catullus , It would be easy to show that " His Age " misses the gravity of the Horatian Eheu fugaces just as completely as the Catullian imitation missed the passion and poignancy- of its original . ' And what shall be said of such epithets as " a certain massiveness , a resonance , and an august , imperial splendor , " even though Professor Moorman applies them to the exceptional poem in the " Hesperides ' and not to the mass ? Or what shall we say of such a phrase as " dreamy reverie " used by the same writer to characterize the love-songs ? Our other biographer of Herrick , M. Delattre , finds in him many points of resemblance with La Fontaine . Palgrave , though his critical estimate of Herrick is in some respects excellent , yet goes out of the way to liken his spirit to Alfred de Musset 's , and even associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as a lyrist generally he is scarce-l --  excelled , except by Shelley . " Professor Saintshury exclaims that " there is nothing in English verse to equal the Litany ' ) as an expression of religious fear ; while there is also nothing in English verse to equal the ' Thanksgiving , ' . . . as an expression of religious trust , " And to Swinburne the whole lyric movement of the age " culminates in the crowning star of Herrick ! " Now all these critics , unless it be the alliterative last , show true discernment at times in their judgment of Herrick , but to such comparisons and laudations as these here brought together , I for one can only respond with a No possum-us . I simply can not feel these rap- tures in the " Hesperides " ; I can not perceive these qualities . A passage from Professor Moorman 's chapter in the " Cambridge History of English Literature " ( VII , 17 ) seems to me , both by its truth and by its error , to point to a sounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest gift of all  --  that of touching the deepest chords in human nature , and of rousing men to high purposes and high enthusiasms . But this lack of intensity is common to him and to the renascence lyrists as a whole . For the renascence song is that of a nation still in its childhood , unconscious , as yet , of conflicting emotions , or complexity of thought , and knowing nothing of the burden of modernity The error here is flagrant . To say that the lyric poets of the seventeenth century , because they were unaffected by the burden of modernity , did not touch the deepest chords in human nature , is merely to write one 's self down a victim of that conceit of the present which is starving so many souls in our generation . He who discovers something deepei in the enthusiasm of Shelley , as do Professor Moorman and others of his school , than in the ancient , passions of love and beauty and death and the glory of everlastingness , belongs in reality in the same class with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , in one of his essays , extends the happy . content of loss-modernity so far as to announce that " lyric poetry may be said to have had no exist-ence among us before Dryden composed his celebrated ode " But Professor Moorman , on the other hand , is right in saying , as others have said , of Herrick iii pafticular , that he lacked the highest gift . Indeed , I suspect that the real key to the secret of the " Hesperides " is to be found in this failure to touch the deepest emotions combined with a singularly high level of technical excellence . As a whole , the III . lyric poetry of Herrick 's age is marked by three characteristics the repetition of conventional themes , a general amateurishness of execution , with the occasional elevation to supreme beauty of form and intensity of emotion . By the first of these traits nothing derogatory is meant . All ages of creative power have their peculiar round of themes , and it would scarcely be going too far to say of any period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its loyalty to a convention in selecting the material of art . As for the Jacobean and Caroline lyrics , I have often thought that a most interesting and instructive anthology could be made by grouping together the principal pieces under easily defined topics . Two things , I think , would appear from Such an anthology . In the first place , in almost every subject we should find that Herrick had risen high , but had not quite reached the perfection of some one poem of another author . In the general field of love he has written much and well , but there is no number of his which has qualities worthy to stand beside the supreme loveliness and pathos of Jonson 's " Drink to me only with thine eyes . " Yet Professor Moorman can say without reserve that " at every point the disciple transcends the master , " and can with complacency quote the words of Swinburne , than which no critical statement could be more fatuously wrong : " So we turn from Jonson to Herrick ; and so do we recognize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not have every gift but one in higher development of excellence and in fuller perfection of power , but who is utterly and absolutely transcended and shone down by his probably unconscious competitor on the proper and peculiar ground of pure and simple poetry . " It is time that the truth were said and known ' Swinburne as a critic is mere sound and fury , signifying nothing ; to quote him as an authority is to stultify one 's self . But that is by the way . If we turn to the more specific expressions of lcive we shall see that here also Herrick rises high , but never quite to the summit . Thus he has written his verses " To the Rose " . Go , happy Rose , and interwove With other flowers , bind my Love . Tell her , too , she must not be Longer flowing , longer free , That so oft has fetter 'd me . It is a fair rendering , of a theme as old as the Greek Anthology and much aftected by our Caroline poets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lovely Rose ! Tell her that wastes her time and me , That now she knows , When I resemble her to thee , How sweet and fair she seems to be The one is pretty ; the other has that indescribable thrill of emotion , that swift hint of some obscure connection between things on the surface and the deepest privacies of the heart , which marks the great lyric . You will search in vain through the whole of Herrick for any mate to the second line , so simple in expression yet so complex in meaning , of this stanza of Waller 's . For the rest I can only indicate the points of comparison . ' Herrick has written of the bracelet that was to bind two lovers together ; again he is pretty , but what a world of feeling lies between that prettiness and the passion of Donne 's " bracelet of bright hair about the bone " ! Herrick has played on the conventional fancy of cherry-red lips : Cherry-ripe , ripe , ripe , I cry , Full and fair ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between such easy , fluent lines and the lyric ecstasy of Campion whom he has imi-tated ? ? lier Eyes like Angels watch them still ; Her Brows like bended bows do stand , Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill All that attempt , with eye or hand , Those sacred Cherries to come nigh , Till Cherry ripe themselves do cry . Again Herrick has touched on the common theme of flowers dying and having their resurrection in the beauty of a woman 's face , and again he has missed the supreme alchemy of such lines as those of Carew : Ask no more where Jove bestows , When June is past , the fading rose ; For in your beauty 's orient deep , These flowers , as in their causes , sleep . He has catalogued with wanton dalliance the charms of his mistress 's body , but something of the full luxury of the flesh seems still lacking when we compare his verse with Donne 's twentieth " Elegy " or Carew 's " Rapture . " He has boasted the free joys of inconstancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he appears . And so one might gO on through almost the whole range ' of the lyric convention of the day . Even where , as in one or two of his religious poems , he rises above the level of his daily Muse , these comparisons will crowd into the mind . I would say nothing to deprive his Noble Numbers on . " Eternity " and " The White Island " of their fair and calm loveliness , yet withal it can not be denied that they move on a lower plain , that they have less of the sheer exultation of glory , than Vaughan 's blinding vision of the World of Light . I feel the same lessening of things divine in the famous " Litany " : When the house doth sigh and weep , And the world is drown 'd in sleep , Yet mine eyes the watch do keep , Sweet Spirit , comfort me ! I would not charge this prayer or any or Herrick 's religious poems with insincerity ; as far as he felt , the words are true ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . That word " comfort " which sings so deeply in other poets of the age , seems here to be verging towards its later sense of physical ease . Who , for instance , can feel in it the spiritual strength and peace that John Winthrop meant to convey when on sailing for America he wrote to his home : " I shall parte from thee with sorrowe enough ; be comfortable my most sweet wife , for God wilbe with thee " ? IV . It should be plain enough that Herrick sang in a lower key than the other great lyric poets of the age when the bi eath of the gods blew upon them . But there is a compensation . It is equally characteristic of Herrick 's contemporaries that , when the instantaneous inspiration failed them , they too often fell into heaviness and awkwardness . The bulk of their work is marked by a curious negligence and amateurishness of manner , as becomes men who were untrained in their art and , as gentlemen , rather despised the painful discipline of their trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but goes beyond it . Take away his epigrams , which are for the most part either feeble or gross or both , and which show a mistaken ambition to rival Martial , and the rest of his work is distinguished by a singular evenness of achievement . He is rarely dull or cumbrous or careless ; he is almost always the cunning craftsman , and never the fumbling amateur . In a word , he is literary , and by that quality stands at once both above and below his great compeers . Here it is needful to distinguish . I would not call him literary in the sense that Jonson and Milton were such , in the sense that he felt the sway of true authority , and deliberately sought to fashion the utterance of his inner life on the models of antiquity , making their mastery his own . He was literary in another and lower way than that , in so far as his emotions and ideas were themselves secondary and derived from others , and , coming to him from literary sources , tell easily into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew , as other men know , the pangs of love , the attractions of beauty , and the consolations of religion ; but , apparently , he felt these things not very keenly , and in his poems wrote largely from the impulse of what other men had lived . Hence a certain detachment of art in his work , which pleases the reader but never quite touches the springs of emotion ; and hence , in the end , a certain monotonous level of exquisite mediocrity . But I would not exaggerate . It is true , that even at his highest moments , there is generally heard , if one attends closely , some note that lowers the key . But I would not say that all in him is " dead , and closed up in ivory , " nor that he always sings " without the sweet concurrence of the heart " There are lines and stanzas scattered here and there which speak of direct communings with larger things : ? Show me that world of Stars , and whence They noiseless spill their Influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brevity to be drawn from flowers and other fading symbols of life 's allurement , that almost , but not quite , raise Herrick into the blessed choir . And there is one whole range of subjects in which I seem to hear the very pulse of the man beating , and no echo of the heart of others . If Herrick was to his finger-tips literary and a child of Jonson , he belonged al6o by birth and breeding to the strong , home-keeping , prudent bourgeoisie of Elizabeth 's England . Something of this , too , has gone into his verse , along with the licentious influences of the Renaissance . Indeed , I think we nowhere else come so close to his real , unborrowed feelings as we do in those humbler poems which tell of the physical peace and comfort of a quiet home . The superb scenery of Devon awakened no wonder in his breast ; his sympathy with the rural customs of his parish was , I suspect , that of a bookish and amused man from the city ; but when he turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private Wealth , " then speaks the man himself . He may be marvellously graceful when he praises his " many fresh and fragrant mistresses , " yet withal leave with us the impression of Drummond 's line : " Though in love 's library yet no lover 's he " ; but so soon as he turns from his Perillas and Antheas to his servant and housekeeper , Prudence Baldwin , we know at least that we are in contact with a delicious reality . In a way , one is prepared to assent to Edward Phillips 's charge that Herrick was " not particularly influenced by any nymph or goddess except his maid Prue " ; we may even admit in a fashion with James Grainger , " from the effects of her inspiration , that Prue was but indifferently qualified for a tenth muse . " The praise of this woman who made the comfort of the poet 's home may not lift Ili very high , but we feel at ease with her , we grow to love her faithful . ness and pleasant ways . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is no picture- of a venturesome explorer of far poetic seas , but of a rather timid gentleman of middle age , sitting by the fire in a snug and modest country parsonage , with Horace in his hand , and the willing Prue  --  how loved , and how well loved , who shall say ? ? at hand to fetch the desired cup of that sack which he had learned to Praise , and perhaps to drink , long ago under the tutelage of the great Ben I , for one , have no contempt for that picture . And so also of Herrick 's religion , we will not say it was insincere or hypo-critic because the gods of Anacreon were as real to him as the God of the Gospels ; but we may think he came nearest to his real sense of worship , not in the " Litany " or " The White IsP and , " beautiful as are those chants , but rather in his " Thanksgiving to God for His House " : Lord , thou hast given me a cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof Is weather proof , Under the spars of which I lie Both soft and dry , Where thou , my chamber for to ward , Hast set a guard Of harmless thoughts , to watch and keep Me , while I sleep . . Some brittle sticks of thorn or briar Make me a fire Close by whose living coal I sit , And glow like it . Lord , I confess , too , when I dine The pulse is thine , And all those other bits that be There placed by thee ; The worts , the'purslain , and the mess Of water-cress , Which of - thy kindness thou hast sent ; And my content Makes those , and my beloved beet , To be more sweet . . . Here we might end , but the picture would not be complete without a word on Herrick 's love for children , which also is a part of his homing instinct . He did not marry ; he even carried his bachelorhood with a boast ; but he never writes with a sweeter pathos than in his brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more familiar parentage . I may perhaps be accused of preferring low things to high , and simple things to proud , but if I had to name the poem of Herrick 's that seems to me the most perfect in witchery of language and that I oftenest repeat to myself without reservation of praise or diminution of pleasure , it would be the unassuming " Grace for a Child " : Here a little child I stand , Heaving up my either hand ; Cold as paddocks though they be , Here I lift them up to Thee , For a benison to fall On our meat , and on us all P. E. M. NEWS FOR BIBLIOPHILES . There lies before me on the table , as I write , a soiled and time-stained pamphlet , which is now one of the rarest of rarities . It is an octavo of twenty-four pages , and the title : " Occasional Papers , by the late William Dodd , LL.D , " is followed by a vignette of a basket of flowers with two bees hovering over it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for G Kearsley , at No 46 in Fleet-street M Dca.L-xxVII Entered in the Hall-Book of the Company of Stationers " But it was never published A. former owner has written an explanation : This pamphlet was printed by Dr Johnson 's direction , but on the day before the intended publication Mrs. Dodd , for whose benefit the sale of it was intended , conscious that the contents were not all her husband 's writing , thanked Dr Johnson in most grateful terms , but begged it might be suppressed , her request was granted , and the whole impression of 500 , copies were cancelled , two or three excepted of which this is one . This statement is confirmed in a passage of that " Life of Samuel Johnson , LL D , " by Sir John Hawkins , which few even of the " true Johnsonians " now-a-days take the trouble to read .

He took a warm interest in some charities , but his private life was marred by heedless extravagance and stained by vices which seemed all the blacker in a man of his pulpit piety In 1774 his name was removed from the list of the King 's chaplains in consequence of an attempt to bribe the Lord Chancellor in order to obtain the living of the Parish of St George , Hanover Square The end came in 1777 when pressed by his creditois he forged the signature of the fifth ( not the famous fourth ) Earl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond for ? 4,200 The crime was detected almost by accident The bond was disfigured by a blot of ink , and after it left Dodd 's hands the holder wrote out a new bond and took it to Lord Chesterfield for a fresh signature He at once repudiated it , and Dodd was arrested while at table with some of his gay friends Forgery was then punished with death .
