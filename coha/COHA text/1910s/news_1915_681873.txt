txt REPROACH OF PLATONIC NEUTRALITY Whether the World Be Freed or Mastered , in What Esteem Cam Those Regard Themselves Who Failed to Do Their Part ? A Letter from Georges Dumesnil , Professor of Philosophy at the University of Grenoble . Ballston Spa , N. Y. , June 30 , 1915 . To the Editor of The New York Times : You ' will probably be interested in the inclosed letter from M. Georges Dumesnil , Professor of Philosophy at the University of Grenoble and one of the most distinguished scholars and editors in France . Comparatively speaking , French savants have been so reticent about expressing abroad their views on various aspects of the war that it seems to me your readers might welcome the frank opinion of one of them , even though they might not fully concur with all that it connotates . FREDERIC D. CHEYDLEUR , Docteur de l'Unlyersite de Grenoble , Instructor Romance Language Williams College . The Letter . Grenoble , 4 Marceau St. , June 11 , 1915 . Dear Sir : I thank you . for the kind thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW YORK TIMES . Am I wrong in concluding from it that you have received all right the number of the " Amitie-de France " that I sent you ? I am directing to you another of them . We are continuing to work , but you know through . what trials . Mournings are endless . The brother of our maid , she who used to open the door for you when you were so kind as to come to my house , is dead . The second eldest son of oun Dean , M. Morillot , is dead . One of my farmers froze his feet last Winter in the trenches ; three others of my men from the country are in the army . Our students have paid a liberal tribute to the murderous fury of Wotan . MY stepson has been at the front since the beginning of hostilities . Do you recall one evening when you were sitting in our garden ? You were expressing to me your astonishment at seeing so many soldiers in Europe ; you had scarcely seen any during all your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  gue said to you : " The French are not afraid . " I believe that we have shown it in a terrible manner since that time . With our inferior numbers and armament it was we who broke the first dash of the wild animal . Still today after ten Months of war and while recognizing openly the invaluable service that our friends , the English , are rendering us in ruling the sea , on the western front of 600 kilometers they scarcely hold sixty of it and it is we , invaded and decimated , who are bearing the principal weight of - the day . The poor French soldier , often so insignificant in appearance and so peaceful in life , shows every day that in our time as formerly he is inferior to no other in the world , to say nothing more . A great sentiment sustains us in our cruel battle . We know that we are struggling , not only for the liberty of France , but for the liberty of the world . The whole world saw us with indifference or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were blind . Their eyes are being forced open . Who thought that the liberty of the planet was attached to the steeple of Strasburg ? One sees clearly at the pres- ent moment that it Is attached to the towers of Notre Dame . I am too much of a philosopher not tO face the two issues of the struggle . If we were to go down in it , we should have this sad consolation , namely , . thatof seeing the world ruined with of You - alone would remain standing in it , but rone ? does not have to be an adept to be assured that it would not be ter a long time . You are hated in Germs : y as I ascertained ' more than thirty yeare ago the English were , without their deeming it worth their while to take the matter fully into account . Even though your just pride of an American be provoked by it , it is evident to every man . Of common sense and a little foresight that the Germans would suffer only the shortest possible time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impede their march toward Universal dominion , which is their avowed aim ; and after having conquered the whole of Europe and the old world , - they would have a good opportunity of reducing you . They would do it with enthusiasm . Like England you are going to be rapidly less and less insular . . When that time comes it will be netther the fine judicial argumentation of President Wilson nor still less the unifying intentions of Mr. Bryan , that will delay your downfall one secorni . To establish the foundations of peace between men , they must have at least a sincere desire of preserving it , and it is that of which there is no trace in the hearts of the ruling Germans . It is evident , except for those qui oculos habent et non , Sr.c. , that there will be no peaceful development of the world possible so long as German militarism will not have been exterminated , unless one countS , as they do , for a peaceful development the common servitude : pax Germano , . We are unanimously grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has assigned to herself and for the generosity with which she is accomplishing it . But while I am in the act of conversing with you frankly , as is proper , I wish to inform you of a feeling from which the most thoughtful among us do not refrain . After the violation of all the conventions of The Hague signed by all the great powers , the violation and the disemboweling of Belgium , the violation of all strictly humane laws of war , brought back far below the level where it was 2,500 years ago , ( since the Greeks regularly made truces to bury the dead , ) if we understand and approve of the reserve of the small , powerless nations , it is more difficult for us to enter into the reasons of neutrals who have strength and who look on the struggle as at a play more or less exciting in which one takes sides only platonically and in idea . And in whatever way events may turn out after the end of hostilities , whether the world be freed or whether it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will those who might have been actors in the formidable drama and will have been only spectators of it be obliged to grant themselves . It is to tell you with what serious consideration we welcomed the so brave action of Italy . GEORGES DUMESNIL.
