I 've rented the house , sold the car , and paid that ominous installment on the mortgage . Actually ! Then I drew a long breath of relief , packed four trunks with all our earthly possessions , and came on down here with Anne . Do you know , my adorable child kissed all her little chairs and her bed good-bye , and last of all hugged the porch pillars . For a youngster not yet six , she realizes things very vividly . We are in the second-line trenches , thank you ! ? not the fighting line , but the supporting one , at least . I feel as if I too were at last a part of the Great War , only , as usually happens , this particular assignment is n't what I planned . We were so eager and happy to come to D ? , so as to be near Jack , that details of living seemed quite unimportant . He had found us a tiny three-room apartment , and we were to get our meals at a boarding-house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweaters , and to teach Anne to read and write . To my first query Mrs. Smith gave the astonishing answer , ' Dinner is at six . We do n't serve lunch . ' There is sometimes a providence in our disappointments . When I tasted the dinners , I was thankful they did n't serve lunches ! But as Elijah 's ravens were n't immediately visible , I hunted out the nearest grocery and meat-store before I unpacked the trunks . In three days I knew that , to keep Anne alive , I 'd have to get all the meals . The Westhas not yet learned the gentle art of keeping boarders . But on Wednesday and Saturday , when Jack came in and beamed contentment on us , I forgot that I 'd been all the week cooking meals , trying to crowd everything into the drawers of one bureau , and taking Anne out to the park . Red Cross ambitions had faded into the middle distance . The problem of one small child was rampant . You should see our ' apartment ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here they vacate two bedrooms and put up a sign , ' Apartments for light housekeeping . ' An extremely elegant affair , where part of the second floor has been reconstructed , may boast a little kitchen with a real gas-stove and refrigerator . Such is ours . Not for worlds would I suggest to Jack that we are not satisfied and happy in our dingy little three rooms , with the torn wallpaper and battered window-shades . You know we 've never talked to each other about there being any sacrifice connected with this war . We simply decided it was right for him to serve , and after we 'd made that choice , all the other things to be settled simply fell into their places as subordinate . Of course , we had to give up the house , but we remind ourselves of how wonderful it will be to come back some day to its orderly beauty and charm ? and forget about it meanwhile . D and these three rooms seem home to me , with Jack only ten miles away ; and so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little less luxury and comfort will be quite wholesome . There is even a sense of achievement in being able to give up the fleshpots of Egypt without once looking back . But can you picture an active child romping in three little rooms ? no porch or yard to play in , her only outdoors sedate walks to a park six squares away ? And she has no one but me even to speak to all day long . Trying for anyone ! If you could see her patiently cutting out paper dolls while Mother cleans up , or gazing dreamily out of the window , or waiting hopefully a long hour on the corner because Daddy is expected this afternoon , you would realize how little there is to fill her hungry mind . Quite suddenly , I hasie decided to put her in school . I 'll find the right place somewhere , somehow . Supper-time ! As ever , MARGARET . October 1 . MY DEAR NAN , Do you remember Thaddeus of Warsaw batting about London ? That is how I felt in this strange town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scent a-questing . The exiled prince was a modest creature compared with me . Of course , you smile . But , Nan dear , that feeling helps to keep one up , just as having one 's hair neatly netted and one 's shoes smartly polished helps . Also , it gets you what you want . I found my school , the only private one in town ( imagine a private school with my income ! ) ; but as its enrollment was complete , the principal did not wish any more pupils . Really , Anne is to be admitted because she is a soldier 's daughter , and I am allowed to make payment each month instead of semi-annually in advance . Do I hear anyone suggest that patriotism does n't count ? It is a quite wonderful place . Even in the primary they believe in teaching the youngsters to love the Flag and to speak French . My landlady has been so kind , bestowing chow-chow ( which I dislike intensely ) upon me and taking in groceries in my absence , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I explained how much we liked her ! RAM and her , how delightful everything was , how unwilling I was to leave , till presently I began to wonder why in the world I was going to leave . Just as breath failed me , she broke in with calm deliberation : ' Well , Mrs. I think perhaps it ' s just as well . This apartment was never designed for it child . ' ( Wherein one might imagine some hidden grievance of her own . ) And so , with mutual gratitude , We parted . Children are n't wanted anywhere . It reminded me of indignant Father years ago vainly trying to find a place for a wife and seven children to board for the summer . ' Children ? Oh , no ! ' they all said , ' we do n't take children . ' This was hospitable Virginia , too . ' Heavens ! ' he finally exploded : if it was n't for the children , we 'd never come to this forsaken spot . We 'd go to Atlantic City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young married woman , with a six-months ' baby , who has followed her lieut. here . She is quite worn out looking for a place where they do n't shut the door on a baby . You see , it is n't at all like the regular army , for whom the government always provided quarters . You simply scour the nearest town for a place you can afford . I have $105 a month for Anne and myself , and I am mad enough to spend $20 for her school . Take away that $20 , $10 for rent , $10 perhaps for fuel , and see what is left for ice , gas , laundry , milk , food . No , it does n't scare me ; it inspires me . It is a challenge to fight . I 'll manage it yet . And I wo n't go back to a stuffy unhealthy little apartment , and I wo n't put Anne in a public school with colored children and the mentally depressed . But oh , I am sorry for the little woman ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage it ! October 7 . DEAR NANCY , We have cleaned house and settled . The neighborhood is unique . We are one square from the finest street in town , and on that you may observe the children 's ponies quartered in the front yard , and cows contentedly pasturing in vacant lots . It gives a delightful air of informality ? a kind of neighborly friendliness . You can reach in and pat the ponies . But , oh ! how different from my three-room section ! We are on the fringe of this neighborhood . Ours is a car-line street , at present much torn up because they are improving ' it in some not easily discernible way . We have a straggly unfenced yard , but to have a yard at all is unique just now . At least , it is a place for Anne to play . Such a tiny funny little cottage ? semi-detached , as the English say , with five rooms , or . to be exact , four and one half , for the kitchen is minute . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is very complete as to luxuries , such as ornaments and fine china and family photographs , and very lacking as to necessities , such as laundry-tubs and garbage-pails . Buy to have achieved it at all is a triumph , The comfort and joy and sense of home that this little gray house gives us you can only guess . October 18 . We 've been out to the cantonment and stayed , of course , to mess . It was in the nature of a mad dissipation for Anne and me . In the mess-hall the furniture might be called built-in . Pic- tore a table of well-scrubbed boards a hundred feet long , more or less . You know everything that is n't a yard or forty inches looks about a hundred feet to me . Each side of this is a board nailed firmly to supports two feet from the floor . You sit down and swing your feet over , or else you ascend and then descend to get on the tableward side . Of course , the men ? and they were built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this awkwardness , and the undeniable oleomargarine , took on a glorified tinge for us . To our surprise we were absolutely unnoticed ; everyone was too busy to do anything but eat and run . Then we went over and inspected the quarters , each of the young officers eager to display to us how nifty ' his little room looked . None of them are heated yet , and as October has been a cold month , I remembered with thankfulness the wool-wadded blankets I had started Jack off with . But , my dear , they 've put the shower-baths in a separate building . Imagine the penalties of cleanliness when the thermometer gets below zero ! If I could make you feel the spirit under it all ? a thing glimpsed on this little visit and better comprehended from things Jack has told me ! You see them in all stages the crude awkward young farmers making a joke of their mess-kits and banging each other 's heads sportively with the collapsible frying-pans ; the alert ready soldiers who enlisted before the draft and have seen two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-timers , sergeants of experience , who know enough to screen with tact the ignorance of their new officers . One young chap Jack was rather interested in because he showed such intelligence and effort . How is it going ? ' he asked him the other day . The boy 's face lit up with real enthu- siasm . ' Fine ! ' he said ; ' the army for me every time . ' Another youngster , who has been in four or five weeks , Jack is going to make a corporal . When he was told he was eligible at this early date , tears of amazement started to his eyes . ' How can you do it so soon ? ' I asked . ' Well , ' he answered , ' whatever I give that chap to do gets done and well done . He is the most dependable man in the company . ' You see ? Not cleverness or physical strength or military knowledge , but just character . Of course , there are disappointments . Young Tom Travers , after six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company here . He came fresh from gas and bomb practice , confidently expecting to teach a squad himself . He was put in charge of the laundry account . I think of this boy and I think of Jack , captain of an ambulance company and mired in military detail when his soul craves surgery . I know each will find his level soon . You ca n't keep good men back when opportunity beckons . But think of this tremendous organization ! How could it come out perfect , its first struggling year , and fit each man into the place where he can do his one best work ? We are very proud of our ambulance companies , chiefly , I think , because they have such pride in themselves . An inspecting colonel who is making the rounds of the cantonments saw them at drill . ' Well , ' he said , ' I 've seen them all , and there 's only one other ambulance unit that can touch yours , and that 's the one at C ? . ' You can guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . On the ground , at one side of the entrance to their barracks , is a great spread eagle , with the medical reserve insignia painted in color upon him , all done in cement . On the other side of the door way the company number is emblazon. ed . It 's not the artistic ensemble , but the thought and care with which the work is done , that touches you . There 's a marching song these Western boys are fond of , with this touching refrain : Saturday , November 10 . Sometimes I have moments of depression ? only moments , my dear . They do n't come because of cleaning and cooking and washing and ironing . That is all part of the game ? a game to learn , if I do n't know it well enough already . No ! They come with the thought of France , and the vision of what Jack must see and do there . I have sometimes been so glad he is a doctor and not in the fighting line , because it is surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's country ; and yet he sees the grimmest , most terrible part of it all . He misses the fierce excitement of the attack , but gets all its tragic aftermath . This news from Italy and Russia is depressing . I know perfectly well what it means for Anne and me . A year , or even two years , added to the long separation we have already reckoned . What a great girl she will be when he comes back ! And oh , what a long , long time of hardship and danger and discouragement for him ! But I rarely look ahead . I keep my mind fixed , n making this little home comfortable gay , and try to think of the pleasant things that will happen this week . I 've been married nearly ten years , and yet there is a wonderful thrill to Wednesdays and Saturdays , when Jack comes home to dinner . Saturdays he always brings two or three others with him , and we have a gay evening and a good dinner , with the best china and linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impending future colors all the present more richly . We have never enjoyed things together more than now . To get all the fun we can out of the next few months , so as to pile up happy memories ? that 's my creed at present . If I can live each day now without weakening , I wo n't falter when the hard time comes ? the separation , and the long , long days of waiting and suspense . Courage is something of a habit . But , oh , Nan , I 'd be ashamed not to be doing my share . When I think of those wonderful Belgian and French women , or read Viviani 's message in our Second Liberty Loan appeal , everything we can give seems only too little . Our men have the easier task ; their land is not ravaged , their homes wrecked ; they can defend us with the sure conviction that we are safe and protected meanwhile . And we women live in ease and plenty in comparison with those over there . When I think of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having so much . I think of this war as chiefly for the children , that they may be safe and sheltered and gay ? that children may never again be touched by such agony and suffering . Of course , I try to keep all the shadows from Anne , but sometimes she feels hidden things very vividly . She broke upon me yesterday with this ? out of a clear sky : ' Mother , if the Germans should win this war , I think I 'd feel safer up in heaven with God ! ' November 55 . Did you know that finance can be a matter of deep and absorbing interest to others of us than the Hetty Greens of life ? In extreme youth , I never cared much for mathematics ; but when there is a personal side to a problem , it has a new appeal . There is a certain zest in finding out into just how many parts you can divide $105 . Lordly sum ! It looked large to me , and perfectly adequate . Moreover , last month I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the milk company had failed to send in their bill , and that there were no charges against me for fuel . In the generous and magnificent glow that comes from a sense of sufficient funds , I spent $1.88 for theatre-tickets , and was even mad enough to buy a pair of shoes for Anne and gloves for myself . Last night I sat down and figured up , and the day of reckoning has surely dawned . It is like a puzzle that wo n't work out : rent $30 , fuel $11.50 , school $20 , laundry $6.50 , gas , electricity , and ' phone $5 , milk $8 . That leaves $24 for food and all incidentals ; but owing to my extravagance , there was n't $24 left . You know you ca n't let the incidentals devour the food-supply . So with a penitent heart I drew $10 from my tiny bank reserve , and like the knave of hearts , vowed I would steal no more . Seriously , Nan , I 've realized the truly poor as never before , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fear of sickness ! They know they can get along if the worker of the family does n't fall ill or lose his job . Now , I am all right so long as I keep on my two feet . Oh , of course , you say at once that I can always draw on you or Jim . I know it . And I wo n't , unless I am actually down and out . Nevertheless , it is a very real comfort to know that I have you two there like a solid wall at my back . And that is something that the poor do not have . I know too that , if I were practical and sensible , I should save money instead of spending my whole income just living . Of course , that would mean giving up Anne 's school , or else giving up this little house , and boarding . No sacrifice on my part , but a very big sacrifice for either Anne or Jack . I wo n't do it . For as long as he is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at any cost . Whatever the future holds , we 'll squeeze the present dry . Sounds American , does n't it ? But I have a canny eye on the future , too . He is captain now , you know , and can give me a little more money to manage on next month . I 'll probably buy a Liberty Bond ! December W. I must tell you the great news . The luck is with us . The government is stretching out long tentacles , feeling for the surgeons even in the ambulance section . Each company is asked to send one officer for a month 's special intensive work in fractures . So , of course , Jack goes . The suspense is thrilling . It may be Philadelphia or New York , or somewhere in the dear East , and I shall see you again very soon . For , of course , Anne and I go , too . Jack wants me to go to Aunt Clara 's and have a month 's rest . Picture it ! January 55 . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found it was to be Chicago . My dear , I am no unspoiled child of nature . As between country and country town and a fair-sized city like Chicago , I 'd choose Chicago every time . Things are so easy . I simply waved my wand ( i.e. advertised ) , and found at once a charming furnished flat , and here we are having the most idyllic time . Of course , I loathe fiats ordinarily , but this is the month of January and a fuel famine is on . So I look abroad over a waste of apartment houses , graciously pitying the people who must live in them , and at thesame moment hug to my heart the happy vision of that warm sunny little place that is our temporary home . But for Anne we might be a newly wedded pair . To have Jack come home every evening makes me foolish with delight . lie has been so happy . ' Why I have n't thought surgery for six months , ' he said to me the first evening ; it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our four weeks have come swiftly to a close . It seemed fantastically unreal that we should have to go back to D ? ; we were surprised at our own reluctance . After this taste of his own work , Jack was like a balky horse at the thought of the military harness of the ambulance company again . And then to-day the impossible happened ! Our first week in Chicago he had put in an application for transfer to some surgical service ; but nothing had come of it , and the other men in the class were inclined to chaff him for his belief in some change . On this , our last day here , he went to work with railroad ticket and trunk-check in his pocket . Just before work began , the director glanced up and said casually , ' Oh , I 've a wire from you from Wash . ington , Captain A little stir of curiosity and interest ran through the class . He is transferred to surgical service at Camp C , and leaves to-morrow for the new work . Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fmd us a place to stay . Are n't we really the luckiest mortals ? arr . RtvEn , March se . What an odd lot of experiences I ant accumulating ! We are actually living in a little hotel , nee boarding-house . Of course , it must be cheap , or we should n't be here , but the food is amazingly good . Our table is strictly military in personnel , except for an elderly female to whom we all try to be nice so that she wo n't feel out of it . The town has a main street three blocks long , a few shops , and many moving-picture theatres . Everyone is engaged in the lucrative business of taking roomers and taking in the army , and they rather strike you as looking on the war as a sad affair , but , for all that , beneficial to Little River . Business is certainly booming . It is n't because of the cramped conditions and inconveniences that I am sometimes shaken into a sudden consciousness of the strangeness of our life here . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . But there are trivial racking little occurrences that really distress me . One Sunday evening Major B ? came in a little before seven for supper , and was challenged by the dining-room maid for being late . She mistook her victim . He turned on her with fire , and rebuked her impertinence in a tone that brought the shamed color to her face . Only the day before , another maid had peremptorily ordered three of the boarders who work in Little River to get their breakfast at a cafe , because ' we are short of help and I ca n't do it all . ' You wonder that such things can be ? Poor creatures ! They themselves are often harried and hustled beyond patient endurance . The landlady is an unamalgamated Swede , who works in the kitchen with the grim determination of feeding sixty boarders and employing as little help as possible . The only thing which she regards with interest and devotion is the Almighty Dollar . One maid , a slip of a girl hardly 17 , left her because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The good old soul who cleans our rooms said to me with tears in her eyes , ' I do n't mind the work , hard as it is ; if she were only a little kinder , I 'd stay on . ' In the head of such a house as this , a little dignity and poise , a little tact and consideration , might make a real pleasure out of hard necessity . It is so easy to smile , so little trouble for us to make our beds and win Lena 's quick gratitude for the trivial help . It is the spirit of unkindness to others which chafes and distresses me and makes life here seem unhomelike and strange . - Of course , none of these things happen to me , and I feel sure that none ever will while I stay here . I hate to have them happen to those helpless to protect themselves . Yet when the landlord opened my door yesterday to put on the window-screens , it fell to me to explain to him the necessity of knocking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His attitude toward Jack is that of a well-disciplined schoolboy ? perhaps a German schoolboy ? toward an all-powerful master ; and to me he is scarcely less docile . To a harmless and well-meaning civilian I have seen him boisterously overbearing . Why do any of us stay , you wonder . My dear , there is no other place to go . There are practically no houses to rent . The only real hotel is financially inaccessible to the likes of us . So we live on at the Gladd House ? is n't the name a delicious joke ? ? and try to breathe wholesomely in an atmosphere of loud and thoughtless incivility . April 7 . I feel as if I had lived here for years and nothing new would ever happen to me . And yet the people here are a continual source of surprise . There is the prosperous owner of the tlite Laundry , who constantly talks shop to his wife at meal-time . It is difficult now to get even enough girls to help in their greatly increased business They shake their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconvenient and disturbing . The owner of a millinery shop is anxious to sell out , and scolds at the unreadiness of investors who have put their money into Liberty bonds and hesitate before such a gilt-edged opportunity as she can offer . A young married woman discusses the kind of car she wishes her husband to buy her this spring , and thinks young couples should not be forced to pay an income-tax . It seems as if the war had barely ruffled the consciousness of such Americans as these . I look at people absorbed in the business of getting and spending , unaware of these tremendous times , and they seem grotesque and unreal , shadowy caricatures of men and women . Then the recollection of the Army people here comes over me with a sense of relief . I never think of them as commonplace , however they seem outwardly . The Cause has set them apart in a common sacrifice , and there is a strong sense of kinship . There may be a little jealousy of someone 's quick promotion , some little bickering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long associated in the unnatural atmosphere of a hotel ; but that is all really superficial . They all recognize the hidden bond . When newly arrived little Mrs. Lansdowne told us with singular naivete that this was not what she was accustomed to , the smile went round the circle . Pray , does she think we have always lived M a garret ? But in spite of our superior recognition of her pretty Southern helplessness , everyone had a sympathetic sense that a lieutenant 's pay must be stretched to tenuous and impossible thinness to provide clothes and food for four . She brought two children with her . So everyone is relieved and glad to hear that his captain 's commission is coming . These Army women do n't complain . I have yet to meet one who is not a thoroughly good sport . They know well enough why they are in the struggle , and the knowledge is a kind of wholesome and sustaining spiritual food . They stiffen to their heroic best . One mother ? and she hates sewing ? makes all the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , has risen to the occasion and taken half a house for the summer , and plans to do all the work for herself and her family . We 've never known her to do anything but dress herself prettily , read novels , and take the children to the movies . And the men ? A few nights ago a major in the field hospital said to me ruefully , ' I 'm held here doing work a $30 clerk could do as well . ' He had given up a big practice in New York to go to the Front , and he is to all appearances considerably farther from the Front than he was six months ago . The economic waste of it all strikes one forcibly . The Medical Reserve have put aside their busy civil life and gone freely and gladly into the service , in overwhelming numbers . From no other ranks have men come in such high proportion . The money sacrifice in itself is unimportant . But all these men have spent six years , and many of them far more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession . Conceive them at a military camp . One man serves as a kind of headquarters adjutant , whatever his military title may be ; another has charge of the hospital exchange and sells cigarettes , candy , and puttees ; a third is in command of the laundry ; others , who for years have done operative work themselves , are now assistant intemes in the base hospital . Surely just here lies the reason why many more medical men hesitate to join the service . Those who went in to heal wounds are kept busy tying red tape or doing desk-work instead of scalpel work . Meanwhile the greatest battle of history is raging , and these men whose help over there is so badly needed are all on the wrong side of the water . How does Jack look on it all , you wonder . I fear he is much like all the rest ; he wants to get over and get into it . For our first two weeks here he was an animated Image of Gloom . They put him in the contagious ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I confidently believe he risked court-martial for neglect of duty ! But after ten years of surgery ? please consider ! And now at last he has charge of a surgical ward , and is like to stay there some months . The new work waked him up ; here , at least , was something he could do . They have averaged a death a day this past month , and Jack is bound he will reduce that percentage and is working tooth and nail over his cases . He is trying a new solution too , that Dr. is using for shock over in France , and it is really doing wonders . Fancy these fine husky chaps dying of an empyema , after pneumonia , in a base-hospital here , before they 've even had a chance to go over the top ! There 's a kind of silent enduring heroism about it that does n't mean war-medals and the Roll of Honor , but brings a catch in your throat just the same . All the officers who know call them a sandy lot . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ' s not the operative surgery he wanted , but it is a very definite demand for skill and care . And certainly it is as high-hearted a service to save men in an American hospital as on a French battlefield . The spirit with which he takes up his task is the spirit I see everywhere . They may chafe inwardly ; outwardly they face each day with a heartening smile . And seeing these men of forty , who have already won success , putting it all by with cheerful courage and taking up their round of petty duties , do you wonder that I am out of patience with the Gifted Youth ? The Gifted Youth is twenty-three . He has a complete education ? chiefly in languages ; he has a fine spirit and a sensitive soul . Consider his feelings on being thrust into barracks with uncongenial Italians and Swedes , men intellectually beneath him ! There were even rough soldiers , who swore , This , too , is undoubtedly an economic waste . He disliked drilling , shrank from the vulgarity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use his ready French and German . Finally he proved his superiority by refusing to obey some slightly irregular order of his lieutenant . More than this , he told his fiancee and one or two sympathetic friends all about it . The story came finally to the wife of an officer and to the officer himself . Then there was plenty of publicity . Captain and lieutenant both received reprimands for the irregularity . My chap ? he had been corporal ? was reduced to the ranks . The major who settled things debated long the question of a court-martial , and chose this lighter punishment . He plans soon to have a long talk with the boy , entitled the Spirit of the Service , ' and then transfer him to another company for a fresh start . Can you guess how ill-used and unfairly rated this Gifted Youth considers himself ? And all for a little matter of disobedience . It is so easy to lose sight of the big idea we are all working for , when you are unhappy and uncomfortable and have had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to do their duty provided their duty is what just suits them ! The best thing about most of these boys in camp is that they take the small dull tasks and dignify them by a fine accomplishment , and to the tune of a merry whistle . April 45 . I was playing a bed-time game of parchesi when the news came . Somehow I 'd got the feeling that we 'd stay on here for months , and had settled down mentally . I live so little except vicariously , experiencing myself Jack 's hopes and depressions , or swayed by the emotions of the tremendous days we are going through . But I feel as if it is always a big exciting life , though nothing happens to me . On this evening something did happen to me . My sudden joy when Jack opened the door on an unexpected Friday night quieted when I saw his face . Because of Anne he scribbled a little note , ' Base-hospital unit of 35 men recommended to-day for over-seas service , by wire . I am one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on finishing your play and sending your child to bed , with all the blood in your body thumping in your head , and all yourself an eager cry to know more . We do n't know more and sha n't till the final summons comes . He is to go soon . That is all . So we are getting ready . Jack is sitting up nights over his empyema report , and I am singularly idle trying to make the most of the last flying days . Every fine day Anne and I take a jitney to camp , and spend our time in and out of Jack 's tiny room . The officers ' quarters and many of the hospital buildings look down on a lovely little lake at the very end of the cantonment . We dig trenches in the sand , launch fleets of ships in the lake , or , if the day is cold , cross a tiny stream on a single plank and take a bracing walk through an oak grove on the hill beyond . Through the day we see Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free for two hours . It is worth all the time of waiting to have him at the quiet end of the day . Anne goes home a tired and happy little girl . I have much leisure to think over these two happy months past and wonder about the future . Little things keep jumping up in my memory . There was that Sunday afternoon when Jack came in to Little River at four , and we had time for a long walk and talk before supper . ' The War has brought us even closer together , has n't it ? ' he said . ' Did you ever think that we might be at home , merely making more money and buying more beautiful pictures and rugs , and now , in spite of the lack of money , all the really beautiful things are coming to us without any effort on our part ? ' Perhaps it is that one 's sense of what is really beautiful has grown so sharp and clear , has pierced beneath the surface-pleasant . I remember so well my old idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a calamitous necessity . And now the life I find myself leading is n't merely the only right one : it brings pleasure and deep enjoyment . The only question in my mind is , bow I can help most after he goes . The important thing , Jack thinks , is n't what you are doing in the service , but that you are doing it well . After the War is over , the only lasting regret any of us will have will be not to have helped our utmost . I knew a girl at home too capable to waste her time knitting socks , the duty of the commonplace person , so she is still wondering , to what lofty task she can consecrate her- self ? and doing nothing . I dread following in her footsteps . So perhaps when he sails I shall just go on knitting ? and loving Anne twice as much , to make up for what she misses .
