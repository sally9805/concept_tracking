THE NEW Christmas Candy THE girl who came out from the inner office when I applied for work at the candy factory said they did n't need any packers , but that they would put me on as an inexperienced dipper . I agreed to come to work the following morning . The hours were from eight to six , with an hour for lunch and a half day on Saturday . I was to get nine dollars a week to start . The next morning at a few minutes before eight I came to the office again . There were five other girls standing around , and as we waited we talked . One of the girls had worked in a gas mask factory where she said she had made twenty-eight dollars a week , and here she was applying for work at nine . One by one the man in the office called us to took our names and addresses , our age and our previous experience . He offered at first to put me in the hard candy room as a packer , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to send me to that room , for before Christmas dippers are in demand . One of the young girls in the office showed us where to hang our hats and coats -- a dark , stuffy room that smelled of chocolate , where we groped around for a hook . Then up three flights to the dipping room . When we came into the room the forelady or ? dered the first two girls to sit down at the tables . She sent me to the farther end of the room and called a tiny Italian girl , Mary , to show me how to pack . It was simple enough . All I had to do was to take a five-pound cardboard box , put af piece of wax paper on the bottom , fill in a layer of chocolates , then another piece of wax paper , then a sheet of cardboard , then wax paper , now another layer of chocolates , and repeat . For a while Mal brought me the heavy boards on which the dried chocolates were , then I had to get them myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I stepped over to the Italian woman nearest me and asked her if I could get a bench and sit down to the work . She told me I could not sit down Ord the forelady came and told me to . So I worked on ' Almost all the packers were old Italian women who stood stolidly and moved nothing but their hands , and those very quickly . I wondered 11 ? W they could stand like that , without the ceaseless shifting from foot to foot which alone made the thing possible for me . At eleven o'clock the fore ; lady came back and sent me to learn to diP ? was glad to drop to a bench in front of the long table . Chocolate dipping is a skilled occupation . , It takes all of a year to become an expert dipper . In front of me was a marble slab , to my right oblong tin tray , with a smaller tray in front to hold the loose bits of chocolate . In the middle of the table was a narrow basin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked Celia , the girl who showed me how to dip . In the basin was a long-handled ladle , and Celia told me to pour a dipperful of the chocolate on the marble slab in front of me . I did so , and Celia put her right hand into the thick fluid and cooled it off ; then she emptied it by handfuls into the tin tray at the side and told me to scrape what remained on the marble slab hack into the basin . We then poured a dipperful ? the warm chocolate into the back part of the in tray to cool off . Celia told me to put my hand Into the cooled chocolate on the tray . I put it in . It.was like messing around in fudge , just before it is ready to pour into the pans . One of the Italian Ms said , " Just suppose the ' igh brows were to See us doin ' this . " The first two days I was kept at dipping almonds . Felia was very good at showing me carefully just " w @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sadie , " I said it was . She would pat me in an encouraging way on the shoulder . She was a Spanish girl , and she wore the filthiest apron I have ever seen . Everything smelled sickeningly of the chocolate . The first day I worked there were no Windows open , and there were over a hundred , e'rnen in the room . Great care is needed in keepItig the temperature of the dipping department just right , as the chocolate must harden quickly . The PiPes overhead were white with frost . Most of the women wore old ragged sweaters under their aprons . We all had to wear muslin caps . At my left was a large wooden tray filled with Sonds coated with sugar . With my left hand I had to throw one of the nuts into the cooled chocolate on the tin tray , cover it completely , lift it out , , arid place it on the board in front of me . On the hard , each time I took a new one , I had to lay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h4sed backwards on it , so that each piece of candy b ? re the firm 's initials . To lift the covered almond CIllt of the chocolate , I had first to find the point , Place the nut upon my middle and first finger , with the Point facing toward the palm of my hand , then Put my thumb on the point and slide the almond t ( 31/1 my fingers to the paper-covered board . As Put it down I had to make the " stroke " that ? f the on all high priced candy , by having enough f h the chocolate on the end of my thumb to make s:eh backward line on the top of the candy . I tlii ) Itled. chocolate from my fingers as I tried to get the nut on the board , and the stroke was not always as Perfect as it should have been . Celia was paShe really was a good teacher . he forelady spent most of her time among the ex Perienced dippers . Occasionally she came to the back of the room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made ill natured by constant speeding up of the girls . I remember that one day a few minutes before twelve some of the girls started to sing the Star Spangled Banner , and she scolded , " I do n't know what youse are youse act like a lot of loose lunatics . " At twelve o'clock the bell rang . There were two dilapidated , rusty sinks in the room . There was plenty of hot water , but liquid soap at only one of the sinks . The first day I worked there was a towel at the rear of the room . It was black by noon time , and for two days it hung there ; after that we either did n't try to dry our hands or else we wiped them off on the paper that was lying around . A sign over the sink saidl " Bring your own drinking cup : Always wash your hands before resuming work . " One of the women had a tin cup . and we all borrowed it from her . The toilet arrangements were far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never dared to take the-time to stop and rinse their hands before going back to their places . Where the public is asked to pay , an unusually high price for the product it would . seem that unusual care should be taken to keep the place as clean and as decent as possible . The Y. W. C. A. is reported as calling the girls " tough , " and ' it would be a wonder if they were anything else . Most of the girls brought their lunch and ate it sitting around the room in which they worked . A few groups gathered and talked ; most of the-women sat alone and rested . We had to be back in the room at ten minutes to one , to empty the larger pan , in which the chocolate had caked , into , a box at one end of the room . At one o'clock the , bell rang and we started again . The girls at my table were young , only opposite me was there an older married woman . They talked in low tones to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " Youse know I get scolded when you girls ' talk . " Celia said my apron , which I had paid a dollar and sixty-nine cents for at noon , was " real neat . " We worked on and ' on . About three o'clock the girls began to watch the time . I thought that if only about half past three we could have had ten minutes in which to stand up and stretch it would have meant so much . But that , of course , would have allowed the chocolate to harden in the pans . We had to ask permission to go downstairs or to get a drink . The forewoman kept on screaming , urging the girls to work faster . Celia helped me a lot , and we talked . She said if I kept at it and worked hard , pretty soon I 'd get a raise ; I 'd get nine and a half dollars . a week . One afternoon a good sized mouse ran . across the table , creating a great and welcome corn ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly about their own affairs . A little girl on the opposite side of the table from me told about her " gentleman friend . " He was taken with the influenza , and when at his request she went to Bellevue Hospital to see him , he was dead . Their engagement was to have been announced at Christmas . He was seventeen , she sixteen . " He was a real fine fellow , " she said . " My mother liked him , too . " " Are you married , Sadie ? " they asked me . " Mostly married ladies work here . " The girl next me said , " Seems like we never get a full week 's pay . Last week they took out for Victory Day , and now this week they take a day 's pay out on everyone for the War Fund Drive ; and next week comes Thanksgiving . They just take the money out of your envelope and send it to the fund , and they get all the credit . A dollar and a half out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half to live on , " she explained to me . The married women compared notes about their husbands , and they all talked about the husbands we unmarried ones were going to get . They talked about their children and their housekeeping , and much about the cost of living . Many of them did washing and housework after they reached home at night . Up to four o'clock I dipped fairly well for a beginner . From four to five I grew steadily worse , and from five to six I spilled chocolate over myself and over the board . All the other girls were doing the same . One night Celia , who stood all day , said , " I wish it was five o'clock . " The other girls , realizing for the first time that she too was weary , asked if she were tired . She said " Yes , " and she looked it . " I wish they would hurry up and put through that law that only lets us work until five o'clock , " she sighed . And we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experienced dippers stay until seven o'clock , Celia with them . The girls at first refused to stay , but the forelady screamed at them , " Youse 'll stay every other night until seven ; I wo n't make youse stay ' til ten , but ' til seven youse 'll stay ; and youse 'll work every Saturday until six , from next week on ' til Christmas . " " Where , " I thought , " are the labor laws and their enforcement in this state ? " That last hour was torture for us all . The lights were turned on , the shades were pulled down , and the room grew steadily colder . Only the lash of the fore-lady 's tongue kept us at it : . The girls all grumbled and said that five o'clock should be the quitting time . We did not dare watch the time too closely for fear of the forelady . There was no clock in the room , but one of us had a watch . The forelady was a wonder , the girls agreed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , in her way , only she did scream at the girls . When the bell rang at six // o'clock we had to empty the basin of hot chocolate into the tin tray to harden over night , which took five minutes . Then the hundred girls had to get the thickest of the chocolate off their hands , and with only two sinks it made a mob scene around them . The forelady always scolded at how slow we were ( she was as tired as we ) . " Do n't stop to manicure your hands , ladies , " she would yell at us . Then we had to take off our aprons and caps , get on our street clothes , and stand in line to ring the time clock . It was always ten minutes past six before we left the factory . They made thirty minutes on the girls ' time a day , since we had to be in the room at ten minutes of eight and at ten to one . I worked all week ; I was early every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last one o'clock day until after Christmas . On u'Y way home I stopped and asked the price of the candy I had been dipping most of the week . It was a dollar and thirty cents a pound ! Celia had told me that a fairly good dipper should dip about fifty pounds a day , or three hundred a week , for the nine dollars . When I reached home I lay down to rest for a few minutes . I smelled abominably of chocolate , my hand was numb , my fingers stiff ; my nails a sight and my arm aching . I rolled aroun ? for a while trying to sleep , and could n't . Finally I did sleep . When I woke up it was after tell o'clock . So ended my first week in a candy factory .
