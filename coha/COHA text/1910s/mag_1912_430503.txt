IN an old square tower , in Greenwich Observatory precincts , there stands a small telescope by which the changes in the solar surface are registered day by day , changes which seem to show that this comparatively little world of ours may , in its turn , have some effect upon the sun . The base of the tower dates back to the earliest beginning of the Observatory , for it marks the place where Flamsteed , the first Astronomer Royal , set up his mural arc . When the highest floor is reached , it is found to be covered by a shallow cylindrical dome , divided into two parts , of which the smaller is in the north and is permanently fixed , but the rest can be turned round in any direction , so that when the movable part has its opening toward the fixed point , the dome is closed . With the movable part in any other direction , the dome is open , and the telescope can command the desired region of the sky . The telescope is four inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The size of the image of the sun is always proportional to the focal length of the telescope , and as it requires a focal length of nine feet to give an image of the sun of one-inch diameter , the solar image produced by a small telescope would be only five-ninths of an inch . This is too small for any practical purpose , so behind the principal focus of the telescope a magnifying lens is introduced which enlarges the image fully fourteen times , and a picture of the sun nearly eight inches in diameter is produced on the photographic plate . If the steadiness of the atmosphere permit , the photographs taken with the photoheliograph , as this instrument is called , will show details on the sun as small as the pupil of the eye of a man standing at a mile distance . This , it will be readily admitted , is fine photography , but it may give us some understanding of the enormous distance separating us from the sun , and of the vastness of the sun 's propor/ tions , to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun nearly four hundred miles in actual breadth . T he telescope and camera combined are just ten feet long , and they have barely room , so small is the tower , to swing clear of the walls and floor . The picture on t h e preceding page shows the tower from the outside with the d o m e open and the telescope directed toward the sun . The work of photographing the sun daily began at Greenwich in 1874 , and from 1878 to the present time the combined record as obtained by similar photoheliographs at Greenwich ; in India , in Mauritius , and at the Cape , has been practically continuous . What is the object of photographing the sun so often ? Because it changes ; and everything that changes is a challenge to scientific examination . Once a clay is not , indeed , often enough to observe the sun , but time and money and men are lacking ' to carry out a fuller watchfulness . The weather also is not always kind , and it requires the co-operation of at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape , Kodaikanal , and Greenwich ? to secure that no day shall be without its record . It is especially to study the changes of the spots on the sun that these photographs are taken . The general appearance of a sun-spot is familiar to every one , from drawings or photographs , if not from actual observation in the telescope . The general surface of the sun is so bright that the nucleus of a spot appears , by contrast , of inky blackness , giving the impression of a cavity through which we look into unknown depths of darkness . Round the nucleus there is generally a broad , gray , striated fringe ? the penumbra ? suggesting the sloping sides of a funnel ; and round , across , and into this funnel are often driven bright clouds , brighter even than the " photosphere , " as the general luminous surface is called . The enormous size of the sun , combined with its low density , and the tremendous temperature of its surface , proves that it is essentially gaseous in its condition . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flocculent appearance that we should expect would be presented by a shell of glowing clouds , and such the photosphere is generally supposed to be . In this cloud-shell , spots appear as rents or vortices , and from their rapid movements and sudden changes they appear to be the solar analogies of the cyclones  |p583  and tempests that torture our own cold and sluggish atmosphere into fury . They seem , in fact , to be sun-storms ; differing from earth-storms , not merely in their much greater violence and extent , but also in that we , from our standpoint , look down upon them from above , not up into them from below . These sun-spots , or solar storms , like the storms of our earth , begin in small disturbances , develop and grow , and then subside again into quiescence . And , again , just as terrestrial storms move upon the surface of the earth , so these solar storms move on the surface of the sun , and in much the same zigzag and erratic fashion . But the real movements of spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , whether they live for many days or for few , are carried forward continually by the sun 's rotation and appear to cross its disk from east to west , occupying from thirteen to fourteen days in the passage . At the most , therefore , we on the earth can only see a group of spots for about fourteen days at a time ; then it turns away from the earth at the sun 's western edge , and is invisible for another fourteen days , when it appears again at the sun 's eastern edge , if it has not died in the mean time . For spot groups live for very different lengths of time . One out of every four has its birth , maturity , and death within twenty - four hours . Like the insect of a summer 's day , it is a mere ephemera . Not that it is of insignificant size ; for the average area of a one-day group is fourteen millions of square miles , or considerably larger than Africa . Other groups again have been known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , or a third time , and so on even to a . seventh ; this l a s t case involving a total duration of about six months . The largest group ever photographed at Greenwich attained , on February 2 , 1905 , the enormous dimensions of thirty - nine hundred millions of square miles , and was thus capable of accommodating , if laid side by side in it , seventy worlds as large as our own . This great group lasted a little over three months . We can not tell exactly how long it lasted , since , though it formed on the side of the sun that is turned toward us , and we were able to watch its rise , it was dissipated while in the remoter hemisphere . It was still a large group when it was last seen close to the western edge on April 5th ; when the same region was brought by the rotation of the sun into view again on April 20th , the group had wholly vanished . Spots therefore take their origin sometimes in the hemisphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us . Of some spots we know the beginning and the end ; of others we see neither , though we can watch them in their middle life . The sun to us indeed  |p584  appears as if it were a round disk ; we know it really to he a globe that is always turning , turning ; every point on its vast equator flying forward , forward , at the speed of 4,500 miles an hour . We are accustomed to speak of its " east limb , " of its " west limb , " and of its " central meridian , " and these to us bear a fixed relation to the visible disk ; the sun knows nothing of them , for every part of its surface must pass through these three positions in succession . If , then , we notice any special particularity about the behavior of spots in relation to these three positions , that particularity must in some way be due to the earth , for these positions have no significance as relating to the sun itself , but only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 583 represents the disk of the sun , divided by thirteen meridian lines into segments , or " tunes , " each of which represents the part of the surface that a spot will seem to traverse in a day . The lines are only continued from the equator to forty degrees of latitude in either direction , as spots are hardly ever seen in higher latitudes . The areas included between the successive meridian lines , though apparently different , are in reality equal , and as these lines are purely imaginary , having no solar relations and depending only on our own point of view , we should expect that spots would form as freely in the hemisphere that we see as in that turned away from us , or in any one of these segments of the sun as in another . So with the attainment of their greatest development , or with their final extinction . If our earth has no effect on all or any of these phases of spot life , then there is no reason why any one particular phase should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun 's surface than in its complement ; for these divisions have no real existence except that of appearance from the earth . With a few groups , observed during a short period , we should expect to find irregularities in distribution ; but when in a period of many years thousands of spotgroups are observed , we should expect to find them distributed , on the whole , indifferently to any line that was defined simply by the direction in which the earth happened to be at the time . But there is no such indifference . In 1907 Mrs. Walter Maunder , in a paper read before the Royal Astronomical Society , discussed from this point of view the thirteen years , 1889 to 1901 , extending from one epoch when the sun was almost free from spots to the next epoch of similar quiescence ; and she found that there was a distinct predominance for the half of the disk to the east of its central line over the half to the west of that line , both in the number of the groups seen and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun that is placed symmetrically with respect to this central line , we find that more groups pass into it than out of it ; and the same is true for the disk as a whole . During the thirteen years in question , 947 groups came into view at the eastern " limb " or edge of the disk , but only 777 passed out of sight at the western ; so that 170 more groups died than were born on the side of the sun that is turned toward us . Irrespective of short-lived groups that are born and die on the visible hemisphere of the sun , 391 groups were observed to originate on this side of the sun , leaving 5 72 to arise on the remoter side ; but 564 ended their life-history on the side turned toward us , leaving only 402 to disintegrate in the unseen hemisphere . The birth-rate of spots is therefore higher than the death-rate on the unseen side of the sun , but lower than the death-rate on this side . This is an astonishing difference , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen when we compare any given meridian on the east of the central line with any meridian at a corresponding distance to the west of it ; or if we treat separately the northern and southern groups . A similar relation is seen when we deal , not with the number of separate spot-groups , but with the total area covered by them . There is a steady predominance in spotted area for any meridian east of the center over that an equal distance to the west of it , though the difference is not large . It would be wearying to mention in full the various ways in which this striking relationship comes out ; it may be summarized by saying that to all appear/ maces spots tend to be fewer in number and slightly smaller in size after they have passed under the earth , as seen from the sun , than before . How are we to explain this ? The first obvious impulse is to say that the earth really has an effect upon the spots . But when we remember that the sun is ninetythree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth ) ; that the earth is not much bigger than the very smallest of the spots that we observe , and is far smaller than the majority ; that it is a world radiating no light or heat of its own , while the sun is intensely hot and bright , we are inclined to reject this as impossible and absurd . What explanation can we then find ? The first that suggests itself arises from the fact that spots near the edge of the disk are seen very foreshortened ; consequently they appear much smaller than they really are , and , if actually small , may be easily overlooked . This cause has an appreciable effect , for the number of spots and their total area are greatest in the regions near the center of the sun , and diminish as they aproach its edge ; slowly at first , but afterward more rapidly . But this fact does not help us to the explanation we want , for this effect of foreshortening is the same in every direction . The method of measurement has also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimating positions or areas a little too much in one direction rather than another . This suggestion is also at fault . The photographs are measured in a circular micrometer in which they are placed so that the center of the image of the sun accords precisely with the center of rotation of the instrument , and the photograph is then turned round till the spot to be measured comes under a microscope which travels in a straight line between two metal bars lying exactly over the center of the photograph . A spot near the cast edge of the photograph is measured in the same way and under the same conditions as one near the west edge ; and each spot is measured twice ; one set of measures being made by an observer with the microscope to the left of the center , and a second set by an observer with the microscope to the right . The counting of the spots and the measurement of the areas depend simply on their distance from the center of the sun , and not at all upon their direction from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or west , or what is their longitude , is not . evident to the measurer , but is deduced in the course of computation afterward . A third suggestion is based on the fact that most spots develop more quickly than they decline ; a spot may be increasing in size for three days , but diminishing for eight or nine . During these nine days , it was argued . the area on any one day would be a little less than on the day before , and the spot would be farther west on the second day than on the first , and the western areas would therefore tend on the average to be a little less than the eastern . But this loses sight of two considerations : first , that the growth of a spot from nothing to its fullest size must be equal . neither more nor less , to its decline from fullest size to nothing ; and next , unless the earth has a real effect on spots , the places where a spot is born , reaches its full growth and dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible positions as seen from the earth . It is more plausible to suppose that there may be something in the shape of spots , or in the contour of the sun 's surface near them , that renders them more easily visible when approaching us than when receding from us . If the surface were heaped up behind a spot , this would not hinder a spot being seen in its progress from the eastern edge toward the middle of the disk , but might hide it in whole or in part in its movement from the center toward the west . It must be confessed , however , that examination of the photographs does not lend support to this idea , and we are driven back to the suggestion , absurd and almost incredible as it seems , that the earth does really modify the birth and growth of spots ; does hinder their birth ; does hasten their decay . For the surroundings of the sun are less substantial than they seem . The corona stretches its marvelous wings and petals , its plumes and streamers , hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though so glorious to see in a  |p586  total eclipse , are almost of " such stuff as dreams are made of , " and even the light , filmy structure of a comet will pass through them unretarded . Great uprushes of glowing hydrogen or calcium are seen from time to time in the prominences , rising it may be myriads of miles in a minute ; but great as the apparent movement , the actual amount of material in motion must be slight . The chromosphere appears to surround the sun like a continuous atmosphere of glowing gases to ' a depth of some five thousand miles , but it can be no atmosphere like our own , wherein each layer supports the pressure of all those above ; for the attraction of gravitation at the surface of the sun is twenty-nine times as great as at the surface of the earth , and a true solar atmosphere five thousand miles in depth would be inconceivably rare at its upper surface , inconceivably dense at its base . The manner in which comets ' tails are driven off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a repulsive as well as an attractive action exercised by the sun , and the streamers and rays of the corona testify to a similar effect . So , too , the recurrence of magnetic storms on the earth at intervals corresponding to the solar rotation proves that the sun is able to drive particles in streams across the mighty gulf between it and the earth . It may well be , then , that the pressure of the sun 's radiation , which has a strong repellent action on minute particles , may , for the solar clonds , almost neutralize its gravitation . With the forces acting on these clouds almost in a state of balance , the feeble pull of the earth may be quite sufficient to alter their distribution , and thus to hide , to some degree , small spots in particular positions with regard to it . Nevertheless it is wonderful and unexpected that the earth should exercise any influence at all on the wide-spread convulsions of the solar surface ; and yet more wonderful and unexpected that the evidence of such influence should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  |p587
