txt The statement supplied by the correspondent of The Chicago Tribune as to the " views " of Mr. TA.s , r on the political situation may , we suppose , be taken as " authorized , " as it is announced to be . Since no one but Mr. Tayr himself could give authority for it it is permissible to accept it as his own for all purposes of discussion . The first impression it conveys is that Mr. TAN 'S ' is a. little scared . If he . were as confident as the language of the statement represents him to be he would be content to let the facts take care of themselves and trust the people to see his claims as he says they actually are . And the impression of his apprehension is reinforced by tho consideration of the time he has chosen to make his claims . Had the Republicans of Iowa and Sansas recognized those claims , had they submitted to the leadership of the politicians who are Warm admirers of . Mr. T.A.FT , and had this class of politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is Tmilicely that he would have felt it needful to set forth at such length and with such anxious emphasis the reasons why his Administration should be indorsed at the approaching elections . As a matter of expediency we should be inclined to think that he has made a. mistake , and that in the light of the deep disaffection manifested in his own party it would have been safer , as it clearly would have been more dignified , to maintain a self-respectful silence as to the political situation . Perhaps that would have required a more self-poised and a. stronger nature than Mr. Teres , ! nit his friends would have done well to advise him to assume a virtue though he had it not . What Mr. TAFT does , does awkwardly , ens with much show of embarrassment , is to excuse himself , to present an apology for his personal and party conduct since he became President . That is not an Imposing attitude for a man In his high office . It is all the worse because he is excusing himself , not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against those of an Important , aggressive , and triumphant portion of his own party . The statement put forth in his name is an answer to the Republican conventions of the Middle West . And it is in substance , as well as in form , a weak and ineffective answer . He insists that under his guidance , and with his assent , his party " has fulfilled loyally Its campaign pledges . " He refers , of course , to the tariff . But in the same breath that he asserts the loyal fulfillment of tariff pledges he proceeds to plead that " tariff experts will submit to the President within two years recommendations for revision of certain schedules of the tariff law . " These recommendations will be based on information now being gathered by the experts as to the difference ? of costs at home and abroad . The tariff pledge of the Republican Party was that this principle should be applied to the whole I tariff . If It was loyally fulfilled , why OZ6 experts being employed  --  and for the first time  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle requires ? We really do not recall in recent political history an exhibition of such amazing self-stultification , such innocent confession of Utter befuddlement as to a great party issue by a man in such high post . We regret to use language of this sort as to Mr. Tam and we do it with all due respect for his sincerity and good faith . Rut the facts are so plain that they need but to be stated to show what an extraordinary blank there is In his mind on this question . . Mr. TAFT makes claims for service to his party and-to the country in other regards that are entirely justified . They are also relatively unchallenged . Et was hardly necessary to cite them , and they do not in the least modify the strange inconsistency into which he has fallen as to the tariff . He is right in - his - feeling , which he niakes. more clear than perhaps he intended , that the latter is the real issue which his party has to meet in the elections of November . On that issue we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much good .
