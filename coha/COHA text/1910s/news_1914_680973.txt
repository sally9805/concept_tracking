txt Pittsburgh 's Interest in Art . In Sunday 's TIMES M. Jacques - Meunier , commenting on the lack of interest in the exhibition of bronzes , refers to the exhibit in Pittsburgh and says " It was at the Carnegie Institute , which seems to be surrounded by a zoological garden , and in the competition with giraffes , elephants , jackals , &c..; art did not always emerge victorious . I have seen many persons take a short cut through the museum on their way from one animal house to another without even pausing to look around them . " The only zoological garden maintained in Pittsburgh is situated in another park distant three or more miles from the Carnegie Institute . There is no short cut from any place through the Museum . Pittsburghers are in the habit of distinguishing between a museum and an art institute , and the statement raises a pertinent question as to whether M. Jacques Meunier has ever been in Pittsburgh .                   @ @
