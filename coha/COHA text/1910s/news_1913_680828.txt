txt Election Appeals to Teachers . The " New York Civil Service Society has sent to a number of the teachers of the city a communication stating that if the Fusion candidates are elected they will probably standardize the salaries of city employes , employ out-of-town experts to investigate the expenditures of the city , , and do a number of other things which to the benighted minds of the senders seem likely to close the outlets from the public till . I should like to say for the benefit of these and similar persons that the teachers of the city are not open to bribes ; that the teachers of the city do not select candidates on the principles which this communication suggests ; that on the contrary they are self-respecting , decent citizens who will not do anything that any other decant ma n would not do . In fact , almost any teacher If approached with such a proposition as this In person would probably kick the proposer out of the door .
