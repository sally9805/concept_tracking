txt There seems to be some doubt whether Speaker CLARE was or was not in favor of annexing Canada , but there is no sort of doubt that he is opposed to Canada 's annexing Americans , as she is doing at an unprecedented rate . Last year Canada took 130,000 Americans from our census , and she is reckoning on getting 130,000 this year . Almost half her immigration is from this side the border , and a surprising and growing proportion of these Americans Canadianize themselves both by buying farms and by citizenship . The day that Americans stayed , at home and despised those who expatriated themselves is passing if not passed . The movement is insidious . At the present moment eight shiploads of European immigrants are afloat for Canada , while there are signs that the outward movement which is customary with us during labor troubles will ' be marked this year . There Is no such startling record of our loss to Canada . Our citizens quietly slip over the border in groups or traitleads , but their going is not advertised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They know so well why they are going that advice is wasted upon them . On the contrary the effect of the Speaker 's utterance Is rather to stimulate it by giving prominence to it . There is no mystery why Canada Is the " good thing " the ' United States used to be . It is bemuse Canada is following in its neighbor 's footsteps that it is repeating the fortunate experience which its neighbor is envying , even While deliberately turning . its back on the teachings of the past . A fortnight ago the Dominion budget speech reported the unprecedented surplus of i$39 , - 000,000 , and on Thursday the Government passed through the Committee on Supply credits of $38,000,000 for railways anti canals . With this assistance the railways themselves are both enabled and compelled to increase their facilities . The subsidized roads get the actual cash and the unsubsidized roads must keep up with the procession or fall behind . Accordingly we find a single road allotting ten millions for work of its evil . Naturally the Canadian newspapers contain announcements calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ap &t; from those Americans who go with money in their pockets obtained by cashing in their high-priced American lands . Thiaprocess of ? railway stimulation is the very same process which we used to prac tice , and which raised the values of . our farm lands from ten billions in 1880 to forty-one billions in 1910. - ? One of the most striking things , in the situation is that . the , process ' which yielded such results has : been reversed by the . beneficiarteeTof If . - The farmers , who put into theirpocket ? this thirty - one - Meg " glitch embled-thewto ievitolt upon the consumers toE agricultural products ' lead ' the cry Which is depriving our railways of the , prosperity that the - Canadian Government - is to the . Canadian railways . The emigration to Canada ought to convince these same farmers  --  or those - Of them who do net join the procession to Canada ? that . they are drying up the sources of their own prosperity . The-anti-railway cry has left the companies no money for the pioneer work ' which opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . Total operating revenues for our railways earned last year $11,799 per mile , and only half of the decrease of $302 per mile could be saved by decrease in expenses . The Legislatures that are producing these results by two-cent fare laws , and oppressive regulations , naturally are not granting land or money in aid of extension to their enemies . So construction is at a minimum , and even maintenance is starved . Some of the strongest of the old roads are adding to their mileage , or enlarging their terminals , but there is a conspicuous absence of the new work that used to make such hives of industry as now we must look for across the border . This is most true of the district most hostile to the railways , and the greatest sufferer by the policy of hostility . The percentage of decrease in Income in the West is double that of the East , where depression is felt least because the new work has long been ' greatest in the West . A St. Paul dispatch says that within a fortnight two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , the property of men who expect to pay for their farms with the - first crop . To fight this movement with amendments of the homestead laws is like pouring rosewater on a conflagration . The case calls for a reversion of the policy which has checked railway construction . It is idle to say that the United . States is adequately supplied with railways . There are solid counties which have never heard a locomotive whistle , and it is the ' new State which has not yet been redeemed from its Indian ownership which is most savage in its throttling of the greatest factor in its possible prosperity . Canada will excuse us if we find something in its prosperity not altogether displeasing to us . Members of the Dominion Parliament occupy columns in the Canadian journals discussing the " danger of American " separatist sentiment among American " Settlers , " and the newspapers head the article " row to hold the West for Canada . " Our peaceful penetration has Its troubles for those now profiting so greatly at our expense      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
