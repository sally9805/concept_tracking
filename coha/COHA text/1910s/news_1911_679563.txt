txt We see no necessity whatever for " the enactment of drastic and farreaching legislation " for the control of industrial corporations which Mr. Loose-years advocates . The Sherman act of 1890 puts in the hands of the Government powers of control entirely adequate for the protection of the public against all restraining and monopolizing practices . The meaning of that law has now been made clear . It deScribes a class of offenses which ought =where to be permitted , and its prohibitions are sufficiently broad , it seems to us , to include all those practices and abuses . The law is drastic , for its penalties are severe enough to be deterrent . Nor is the Sherman act open to the objection urged by Mr. ROOSEVE712 when in his Outlook article he said that it " was framed on a theory that it was possible to turn back the wheels of progress in industrialism and , in an age- of combination , to put a stop to combinations under which business was carried on . " We do not so understand the history or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , the Supreme Court does not so understand it . Mr. EtoosEvertr has evidently tacit cleared his mind of the old and erroneous interpretations of the act Under which the prohibition of all con : , tracts and agreements in restraint of trade was made to include innumerable restraints , not of trade , but of competition , all sorts of contracts , such as are necessary and indispensable to the transaction of business . Congress did riot put that meaning into the law . By an amendment it struck out altogether the word " competition . " As it is now rightly construed , the act does not prohibit combinations , it does not turn back the wheels of progress in industrialism , and it does not " put a stop to the combinations under which business " is carried on . It is only when those combinations work a restraint of trade that they come within the meaning of the act . That is the interpretation put upon the law by the opinions and the decrees of the court in the Standard Oil and in the Tobacco cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ' We say that since it does hot necessarily follow because an illegal restraint of trade or an attempt to monopolize or monopolization resulted . from the combination and the transfer of the stocks of the subsidiary cor.porations to the New Jersey corporation that a like restraint or attempt to monopolize , or monopolization would necessarily arise from agreements be. , tween one or more of the subsidiary corporations after the transfer of the stock by the New Jersey corporation . - The Chief Justice dA ; elt upon the contention that a literal compliance ' with the decree of the Circuit Court below , . by forbidding such agreements " between one or more of the subsidiary corporations , " was " calculated to do injury to the public , and , it may be , In and of itself to produce the very restraint on the due course of trade which it was intended to prevent .

Again , in the decree in the Tobacco case the court regarded it as a duty to grant the relief demanded " with as little injury as possible to the interests of - the general public and a proper regard to the vast interests of private property which may have become vested , in many persons . " Therefore the court below was ordered to hear the parties by evidence or otherwise " for the purpose of ascertaining and determining upon some plan or method of dissolving the combination and of recreating out of the elements now corn ? posing it a new condition , which shall be honestly in harmony with and not repugnant to the law . " The recreation of a new condition out of these elements certainly does not exclude but plainly connotes the possible corn -- 1 I biliation of some of the elements , always , however , in a manner which will nee be repugnant to the law .

And even litigation would be superfluous . Would it not be just as well for Mr. ROOSEVEiLT and Judge GARY and other active-minded persons to wait until the Circuit Court in this district has determined upon the plan for the dissolution of the American Tobacco Company and the recreation out of its elements of new conditions in conformity with the law before proceeding to draw up new and drastic bills which , while providing for full control and regulation , shall nevertheless not " put a stop " to the combinations under which business " is carried on ?
