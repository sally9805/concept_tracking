HE entire company had gathered at the residence of Judge Even-weight , and were about to proceed to the dining-room , when the cry of " Extra ! " rang out on the street . For a moment dinner was forgotten , and attention was concentrated upon the general inquiry , " What can it be ? " A few minutes later a servant handed the Judge a copy of the " extra . " The headlines told the whole story . A revolution had broken out in Central America , and the life and property of citizens of the United States were said to be in danger . The tension of suspense being thus relieved , the company moved toward the open doors of the dining-room and were presently seated at the table . " I feared , " said the Judge , " it might be the breaking out of a general war in Europe . The situation recently has been very grave . A spark from the Balkans might create a conflagration in which all the great Powers would be involved . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so much at stake in the clash of their enormous armaments , the statesmen of Europe can not devise a means of guaranteeing peace . " " The Balkans , " remarked the Editor , " seem to be to the great powers of Europe what some of the countries to the south of us are to the United States ? a kind of plague-spot where trouble may be looked for at any time . " " That is true , " interposed the Ambassador ; " and in addition to the inconvenience that always attends interventions in a neighbor 's quarrels , the Europeans have the serious embarrassment that no one of them can intervene alone , and they can not all possibly agree to intervene in the same sense . " " What is at the bottom of all this friction between the powers ? " inquired the Senator . " They would do much better to consider their common interests and protect them by pacific agreement , by a real concert ' ? to employ a word that was once much used , but now appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause is , Channing ? " " The meat in the cocoanut is worldcommerce , " the Ambassador replied . " The facilities for mechanical production have been in recent years so enormously augmented that all the older nations are anxious about new markets . There are only two ways of securing these : first , by obtaining political control of new territory and enforcing a market by imposing a tariff on foreign imports , thus excluding competition ; or , second , by preventing this procedure on the part of others , thus maintaining the open door ' in the less advanced countries where opportunities for the extension of trade still exist . The jealousy between the great powers is thereby rendered intense . Nearly all the important international incidents of recent times have had this origin . Connected with the same interests are the efforts of the less favored nations to secure an avenue to the open sea , advantageous ports , and naval stations in other parts of the globe . It is for these reasons that armies , navies , and the diplomatic and consular services are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . The fact is , they are trade rivals . " " In this country , " suggested the Senator , " we have been disposed to consider the political and the commercial aspects of foreign policy as quite independent , or at least hardly at all connected . I have often heard it remarked that the diplomatic service is a purely ' political ' branch of an administration , while all questions of a ' commercial ' character fall to the consular service . Upon this ground it might very well be contended that , being essentially ' political , ' the diplomatic service should be treated differently from the consular service , this last being in no sense political , but entirely commercial . " " It looks to me , " said the Editor , " as if that were a mere refinement of words . Take , for example , this revolution just announced this evening . That is , no doubt , political ; and yet see how it affects business . Not only is normal trade interrupted , but the lives and property of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i endangered . It immediately becomes the duty of foreign diplomatic representatives to demand protection for these interests , and war vessels will no doubt be sent to support the demand . Was it not just as much of a duty , as far as possible , to prevent this danger as to try to exorcise the evil now : " " I have heard it said , " remarked the Representative , " that there is no obligation on the part of our government to protect life and property in foreign lands . If American citizens want to be protected in their rights , it is said , let them stay at home where they are safe . " " But , on that principle , what is to become of our foreign interests ? our trade , and commerce , and the home in-dustries that supply them : " inquired the Ambassador . " Are we to leave these things altogether to other nations , or are we to have a share in them ? And if we are to have it , how shall we obtain it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It appears to me an entirely new idea , " said the Judge , " that American citizens have no claim to protection outside of our own country . Have we not from the beginning , even in our com-paratively feeble condition , protected our citizens and their commerce ? Did we not even then drive the Algerian pirates off the sea ? And in recent times did we not rescue Miss Stone from Bulgarian brigands , and save Mr. Perdicaris from death or captivity , when John Hay sent his famous message , Perdicaris alive , or Raisouli dead ' ? " " A too strenuous insistence upon the protection of our citizens in foreign lands might easily involve us in war , and war has become very expensive , " said the Senator . " We are lovers of peace , and the people have no disposition to go to war for the sake of a few adventurers , sometimes themselves trouble-makers , who go abroad to improve their fortunes . ' " If we cultivate that spirit of indifference , " broke in the Editor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be disposed to protect life and property at home . Until human nature is radically changed , life and property everywhere will be exposed to violence . It is the business of the state to protect them , and all civilized states offer them protection . Where there is no state , or where a government has reached a condition of impotence or indifference in this matter , there is an-. archy . In the name of civilization something has to be done about it . It is well enough to let foreign nations alone so long as they remain civilized , but when they relapse into barbarism they expose themselves to conquest ; and , sooner or later , some power or combination of powers will undertake this task . But there are many means of accomplishing the desired end besides war . The fear of war often has the same effect . It is demoralizing to let it be understood that life and property will not be protected . A good rule is , to put the weaker and less perfectly organized peoples upon their good behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not continue in a state of anarchy . We should not countenance it . " " If , " observed the Historian , " you compare the development of those nations that have not failed to protect their interests with the collapse of the nations that have lost the power to do so through first weakening their own prestige , you will see that it is a law of history that indifference on the part of the state to the rights of its citizens has in the end led to national disaster . Some nations are weak through their poverty , others through their wealth . A nation which , through the self-contentment of its people and their indifference to the national prestige , permits the more aggressive nations to push it into the background , soon becomes itself the prey of their avarice . They will ultimately deprive it of all its natural advantages and cover it with humiliation . Prestige , once lost , can not easily be regained . " " It is , of course , a fine thing for a country to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Senator . " No maritime nation , or even a country which has no ships but only merchandise on the sea , wishes to incur the hostility of such a power ; but I do not see what diplomacy can accomplish ; or , indeed , that it has much of anything to do with material interests . I have always looked upon it as a kind of social institution , intended to create neighborly feeling by means of friendly intercourse . " " Friendly feeling , no doubt , has its place , and it is the business of diplomacy when possible to cultivate it ; but there is no period of history in which it has been indifferent to the substantial interests of trade and commerce , or without a serious effect upon them , " replied the Historian . " There never was , I suppose , a monarch who made a larger use of diplomatic agencies to accomplish his purposes than Louis XIV . of France ; yet , if you will examine closely into his policies , you will see that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an extension of French industry and commerce . He personally interested himself ? often writing despatches to his ambassadors with his own hand on these subjects ? in order to place the cloths of Provence and Languedoc in Turkey , the wines of Medoc in England , the salt of Brittany in Sweden , the silks of Lyons and the watches of Paris in Persia , hardware in Portugal , and dry-goods in the Indies ? and throughout the whole world the manufactures and products du cru du royaume . Of these details we have the written evidence in the archives . The interest of the Grand Munarch in obtaining the ports of the Netherlands , the possessions of Canada , and the trade of the Spanish colonies , had behind it the same motive . A recent French writer , urging a renewed interest in questions of finance and commerce by his government , asserts that if you read the diplomatic correspondence of the Pharaohs of the nineteenth century before Christ , restored to us in the ruins of Tell-el-Amarnah by the cuneiform inscriptions , you will see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in that early time , to affairs of finance and commerce . In every age of the world the history of diplomacy is closely connected with plans for obtaining possession of the world 's wealth . " " This sounds , " said the Editor , " as if we ought to choose our ambassadors from the ranks of business men . " " So far as this phase of their duties is concerned , " observed the Judge , " that would be a good idea ; but would they , as a rule , have the necessary equipment in other respects ? " " As a rule , " continued the Historian , " business men do not possess all the qualifications necessary for diplomatic usefulness ; and , even if they did , to draw exclusively or largely on that class would give the impression of a too pronounced commercialism . It would be difficult also to induce the best qualified business men to abandon their private enterprises in order to enter a branch of the public service that demands of its personnel great pecuniary sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would consider entrance into the diplomatic service as the most unbusiness-like performance that could be suggested to him ; especially if he knew , as he would soon discover , that his government would certainly not permit him to engage during his mission in any kind of private enterprise on his own account . " " How , then , are we ever to obtain the services of men in all respects adapted to the work required in the diplomatic service ? Can we hope to do any better than we are doing ? Have we not had , and have we not at present , some very able diplomatic officers ? " demanded the Senator . " No doubt , " interposed the Editor . " We have had some extremely able and even brilliant diplomatists , and it is not THE MATERIAL NEEDS OF OUR DIPLOMATIC SERVICE 451 disputed that we have at present some highly accomplished representatives of our country at some of the foreign capitals . It is , however , no reflection upon them , and implies no criticism of the appointing power , to inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done the best we know how , there is no harm in asking if we might not do still better . It is only of late that I have become interested in this subject , and I am already convinced that , as a nation , we are not doing for this branch of the public service what we ought to do ; nothing , for example , comparable to what we are doing for the army , and especially the navy . In those branches of the service we take the matter seriously , and see to it that they are properly organized and properly equipped . " " We begin by forming the personnel of the service , " observed the Ambassador . " We educate our officers . " " And why should we not , for the same reason , educate our diplomatists ? " asked the Representative . " It requires a long period to produce a scientific officer , fit to command a regiment or a ship , " remarked the Senator ; " but general knowledge is all that is needed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges and universities . For military and naval officers , however , we require special schools . " " How is it . in other countries ? " inquired the Representative . " Do they not educate their diplomatic officers ? " " Practically all the young diplomats of France have diplomas from the Ecare Libre des Sciences Politiques , and among the students are representatives of most of the European countries . Some of our own secretaries have attended there , " said the Ambassador . " Besides , on account of the privileges which most governments accord to diplomatic attack 's , who have already passed the preliminary examinations and are preparing to enter the service , nearly every European embassy becomes a practical training-school in diplomacy . " " It is only recently , I believe , " said the Historian , " that this training has finally been reduced to a system . Still , in many countries the Foreign Office has long been a seminary of instruction ; andmore than a century ago there was at Strasburg a school for young diplomats , presided over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , " asked the Editor , " could we not organize in connection with our Department of State an educational bureau that would serve this purpose ? Some of the better qualified diplomatic and consular officers could be recalled on leave from time to time to impart the results of their experience . Only a small permanent staff of carefully selected men would be necessary , and the whole enterprise would cost the government less than a hundred thousand dollars a year . " " I have just been reading a hook by Sir Harry Johnston on Common Sense in Foreign Policy , " remarked the Ambassador , " in which the importance of putting such matters in charge of persons who from personal experience realize the needs of the service is well illustrated . Taking up the examination-paper set in 19ti for appointment to the position of clerk in the Foreign Office by the Civil Service Commission of England , he calls attention to such questions as these : What has been the relation of intuitionism to utilitarianism in British moral theory before Mill ? ' Can the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental principle of syllogistic inference be sustained ? ' and , mirablie diem , ' What reasons have we to believe that other persons exist ? " ' " I should think , " observed the Judge , " it would be unfortunate for a diplomatist to have any doubts on that point ! " " Commenting on this sort of ' rubbish , ' as he calls it , Sir Harry very pertinently inquires : Of what earthly use would an acquaintance with all the tricks of speech of this sort be to a British secretary of embassy at the court of Wilhelm II. ; or to a student-interpreter at Smyrna ; or to an envoy to the Argentine , who must know the facts about the foot-and-mouth disease from A to Z , and the prices of British short-horned bulls ? " " Good ! " exclaimed the Representative with enthusiasm . " If Congress had an idea that training for diplomacy meant that sort of thing , they would vote five million dollars for the immediate establishment of a special school , even if they had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand inhabitants . They could then face their constituents with a mind at rest . " " Does your English author propose any curriculum of study for such students ? " inquired the Senator with some interest . " Oh yes ; he fully explains his ideas on that point , and they are very sensible . Even more interesting than that , however , is his summary of the qualities that should be possessed by the novitiates out of whom future diplomatists are to be made : no ' pedants with bulging brows ' or ' addle-pated students with crammed learning of a useless type , ' but hearty , manly , shrewd , businesslike , observant , and welt-informed young men , ' fit to he ' employed in foreign countries as the eyes and ears and mouthpieces of the British Imperial Gov-. ernment , ' as the ' makers of friendship , the detectors of plots , the protectors of British subjects , and the advocates of British commerce ' ; nofain. - ant holders of nice posts , ' no ' languid dilettanti , concentrating all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ' members of a widespread Intelligence Division . ' " " Fine ! " broke out the Senator . " You would hardly need to ask Congress for a cent if the country had that conception of our diplomatic service . By Jove ! it is a tonic to think of it . I shall --  " " But hold ! " cried out the Judge . " You are proposing here , all of a sudden , the creation of a school for young diplomatists , less pretentious and less costly , no doubt , than those we have for our soldiers and sailors , but what are you going to do for the young fellows who , with ardor and even with enthusiasm , gather to obtain its instruction ? Will you offer them a career ? No ; you will offer them after a long period of study the salary of a city clerk , with the prospect ? if they turn out brilliantly ? some day of becoming ministers , and possibly even ambassadors . You will order them for half a lifetime to countries remote from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable for theirwives and dangerous for the lives of their children . You will expect them to move about the world on short notice ; and when , finally , after long service , the ambition of some of them is realized , you will expect them to rent from their own private purses establishments for the representation of their country 's interests that will consume more than their salaries . Finally , you will , at your pleasure and without notice , turn them off without a penny , to be forgotten and to die in obscurity ! " In saying this the Judge had spoken with solemnity , and a look of gravity deepened on every countenance as he proceeded . " You will go on , " he resumed , " speaking of their service as ' merely or ? namental . You will think of them as idle fellows ' who have fallen into ' soft places . ' And it is , in reality , only to young men who expect to inherit fortunes that your school will appeal . Who else would think of placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemn him to twenty years of waiting , to reward him finally , perhaps , with a position which he can not maintain for want of means ? If you really wish to have a service , you must make it a career , and you must make it possible for a young man to believe that he will be at least as well treated as an officer in the army or the navy . Are you prepared to do that ? " " I see no reason why we should not , " replied the Representative . " We can afford to do it . The service will he worth all it will cost . The money , if the work be well done , will all come back , with a surplus . By better preparing the conditions of peace we might save the expense of a war . " " Great Britain , I understand , " interposed the Senator , " is extremely liberal in providing for her higher diplomatic officers . The British ambassador at Washington , I have been informed , receives a salary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suitable embassy building and a liberal allowance for service and entertainment . All the British embassies , I believe , are maintained on a similar scale . How much does all that cost the British govern-ment ? " " The British government , " replied the Ambassador , " pays out annually for its foreign service less than we do . " " Why , how is that possible ? " asked several persons at once . " The answer is very simple . Great Britain owns its buildings throughout the world , pays no rent and no taxes , and these buildings would sell to-day for much more than they cost , " replied the Ambassador . " We , on the contrary , pay high rent for our offices nearly everywhere , and have poor ac-commodation . We are like a man living in a hotel , instead of in his own house . We pay high and do not even have the credit of being neighborly . We are constantly on the move , and have the appearance of entertaining a secret intention to move out altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being potential foes , have quietly settled down to stay in each other 's capitals . You always know where to find the embassies of the great powers of Europe , but to find ours you can not even depend on the latest city directory . You finally , in despair , go to a cab-stand and ask the cabby to drive you round till you find it . " " You say Great Britain pays no taxes , " broke in the Senator . " How is that ? Do we pay taxes ? I thought all foreign embassies and legations were exempt from taxation . Why are we discriminated against ? " " It is strange , Senator , that you , who are a business man , should ask that question of a mere ambassador , who is supposed to know nothing of business , and is simply ' ornamental , ' " was the laughing reply . " Does not the landlord always charge up the taxes in the rent he demands of his tenant ? We are today paying taxes in every capital of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own buildings , pay no taxes , because these are by courtesy exempt . " " But the frequent sight of the embassy archives , the United States coat of arms , and the Stars and Stripes , with the household outfit of the ambassador , carted through the streets on a dray , like the effects of an evicted tenant ? does not that affect the prestige of our country ? " demanded the Editor . " It would if we had ever had any in that respect , " replied the Ambassador ; " but in every capital of Europe the arrival of a new American ambassador is greeted with inquiries as to the hotel at which he will stop ; and that is besieged with house agents who want to put off on the stranger the houses which , for reasons well understood by them , they can not rent to residents of the place . I know of an instance where an American ambassador was saved only by a happy accident from renting as an Embassy of the United States a house that a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its occupants . Had he taken it , his act would have caused a scandal that might have made his life miserable and his mission a failure . Having been warned in time , he escaped this calamity ; but , not being able at once to find another residence , he spent several months in the company of house-agents looking at impossible habitations before he was finally so fortunate as to find a property which , after extensive repairs at his own expense , he considered suitable for the representative of the United States government to occupy . " " Was he not a little too particular ? " asked the Editor . " Not at all . He was simply determined that , cost him what it might , his country should not be disgraced . " " We arc taking care of that , " replied the Senator . " Congress has passed a bill authorizing the Secretary of State to expend as much as five hundred thousand dollars a year in the purchase of embassy and legation buildings . " " On condition , " added the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to appropriate the money , which the present bill permits but does not provide for ; and further , that he shall expend no more than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in any one place . That will do very well for the legations in the smaller capitals , but it leaves the embassies in the great capitals out of the question . In London , Paris , Berlin , and St. Petersburg , for example , you could not buy the ground for an embassy , in a proper location , for that sum . What , for example , could you obtain for that amount in a central location in New York City , or in Chicago ? In the capitals I have mentioned nothing short of half a million dollars would make a proper showing . I once thought this extravagant . In the town where I live the best house and tot , containing a whole acre of ground , can be bought for forty thousand dollars . At first , I could not understand how such a great sum as half a million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere , and I opposed such profligacy , as I called it , on the ground that it was inconsistent with our republican ideas ; but I have since personally looked into this matter , and I am convinced that it is our duty , and that it would be greatly to our advantage , to acquire a suitable property in every great capital . Still , I have had a hard time to convince my neighbors . " " We are heading in the right direction , " said the Senator . " In time , with the growth of public sentiment , we shall be able to do the right thing everywhere . It is for you and your colleagues of the press , Mr. Editor , to see that the people are properly instructed on this point . " " We are fully awake to our duty in that respect , Senator , " replied the Editor . " The people are already better informed than you think . They will approve any reasonable action Congress may take ; and it will be easy to convince them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can not , however , be readily persuaded that an American ambassador should receive a salary of fifty thousand dollars a year . ' That will appear to them a piece of extravagance ; and 1 , for one , will never defend such an increase . On the contrary , the salaries of ambassadors and ministers should be lowered ; the latter , at least , brought down to the level of what we pay our Senators and Representatives . Certainly , a minister to Peru or Bolivia is not a more important public officer than a Senator of the United States . Of course , he can not travel to his post , hire a house in a foreign country , and entertain officially on seventy- five hundred dollars a year . No one should expect him to do so , and yet he must do these things . He has a mission of representation . He does not go there for his own benefit , but to do certain work for his country . His country should bear the expense , and should have a voice in determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly consider its own prestige , and not limit his expenses unduly . His outlay for travel , for himself and his family , his official residence , the means of locomotion in the performance of his duties , and a liberal amount of official entertainment should all be provided for by his government . His salary would then be merely the remuneration of his personal services , and would probably suffice for his necessary personal expenses , such as his private table and the ordinary family living . All this is so entirely reasonable that the most critical advocate of economy could not object to it . " " Who , then , would determine what the expense of representation should be ? the officer himself ? " asked the Senator . " By no means , " replied the Editor . " This being a government expense , the government should , by careful inquiry , ascertain the cost of the kind of representation it desires to have in each country . This estimate having been made and settled , it should appear as a distinct item in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purpose . " " What would be the advantage of that method over the present one ? " inquired the Senator . " As it is , some of our diplomatic officers expend large sums out of their own pockets . Is not this a desirable saving to the tax-payers ? " " There are , Senator , two distinct answers to your question ? one of fact and the other of principle , " replied the Editor . " As a matter of fact , the expenditure of money by a diplomatic officer out of his own purse is of doubtful advantage to his government . It is , of course , known that public representation is thus made dependent upon private generosity . It is , therefore , perfectly understood that whatever hospitality is extended is not at the expense of the government , which in consequence obtains no credit for it . The ambassador may be considered generous and may be personally esteemed by the beneficiaries of THE MATERIAL NEEDS OF his entertainments ; but , quite logically , his government will be regarded as penurious or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to the test of principle , the ? showing is still less favorable . It is often said , ' Why pay money out of the public treasury , when there are persons not only willing , but eager , to fill these offices at their own expense , and even to pay for the privilege ? ' But if this method is to be commended in the case of this class of offices , why not farm out all other public offices in the same manner ? Why not offer Senatorships , Cabinet positions , and high rank in the army and navy to those who would save the most to the taxpayers by personally bearing the expenses of their offices ? In the past , in certain countries , this was customary . Governments farmed out the taxes to favored persons , sold commissions in the army to the highest bidder , and conferred titles of nobility for a money consideration . Do you approve of such practices , Senator ? " " Why , certainly not , " was the quick reply . - " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now speak with commenda-tion of a desirable saving to the taxpayers ' by allowing public officers to represent the country at their own expense ? Which horn of the dilemma , then , do you prefer : to say that such expenditure by an officer does not really represent the country , but only himself , or that he pays his country for permitting him to represent it ? What would you say to appointing a man who was not a sailor to be a captain in the navy , on condition that he provide the ship ? " " I had not looked at the matter in that light before , " returned the Senator in a somewhat subdued tone . " But , " he added , " a ship , to be a part of the navy , must necessarily be a vessel of a public character . " " Do you consider , then , that an embassy or a legation does trot possess a public character ? " queried the Editor . " I think , Senator , " interposed the Judge , good-naturedly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not wish to press the point , " persisted the Historian , " hut it seems to me impossible to separate the peryo , . CXXX. ? No. 777. - 57 OUR DIPLOMATIC SERVICE 455 sonal and official sides of a diplomatic mission , for the reason that the official character of it overrules everything personal . An officer 's person and residence both enjoy certain immunities . No matter who pays the rent of it , the house in which he lives is extra-territorial , and , for the time , legally a part of his own i country . Personality is completely absorbed by the office . Such immunities could not be accorded to a private individual . An ambassador has a rank at court and a position in society that no one not a public officer could possibly obtain .

" But , " inquired the Representative , " if they receive a quid pro quo , how does that differ from paying for the office ? " " Oh , it is not so bad as that ! " exclaimed the Senator . " Such a conclusion would be unpatriotic . No one has ever meant to profit by such a transaction . " " Probably , Senator , " resumed the Historian , " no one has ever done in this connection what has appeared to him morally wrong . We simply have not analyzed the motives of our practice in this respect , or considered the construction that may be put upon it ; but others have not failed to do this , much to our discredit . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer any criticism upon our method of filling our offices ? We have a right to do as we please in these matters , " observed the Senator . " Certainly , we have that right ; but we must accept the consequences . Let me mention one of them . A member of the Corps Diplomatique , in my presence , said to an American of great wealth who was living abroad , but had no personal distinction entitling him to the station in society he was ambitious to obtain , ' Why do you not return to your country and buy an ambassadorship ? " ' After a painful silence , which no one ventured to break , the Judge , looking up from an intense contemplation of the table-cloth , relieved the strain by asking : " And what did the American say ? " " He said nothing . He merely laughed . " " And what did you say ? " asked the Editor . " I made up my mind to resent the insult , as I felt it to be , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ? " " What did he reply ? " demanded the Senator . " I was expecting a blow in the face , and was prepared to answer it , when the man replied , very pleasantly , ' Thirty years of previous service . " ' Obviously , the discussion was at an end ; and , the coffee and cigars having been finished , the company arose . As the gentlemen passed into the Judge 's library before saying " Good night , " it was noticed that the Senator looked somewhat vexed . " Of course that was only an impudent joke , and should not be taken seriously , " he remarked to the Historian as they left the dining-room together . " As it turned out , I was not , upon reflection , disposed to take it seriously . I believe the man meant no harm , and was not even aware that we would regard his suggestion as insolent . He was , I think , quite innocently giving advice to a friend on the strength of certain impressions he had received . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " queried the Senator . The guests were already taking leave of their host ; and , not wishing to linger behind the others , the Historian replied , " That , Senator , is a question that might involve a long discussion .
