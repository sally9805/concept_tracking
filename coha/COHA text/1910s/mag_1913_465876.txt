I HAVE a barn-door outlook because I have a hay-barn study , and I chose a hay-barn study because I wanted a barn-door outlook ? a wide , near view into fields and woods and orchards where I could be on intimate terms with the wild life about me , and with free , open-air nature . Usually there is nothing small or stingy about a barn door , and a farmer 's hay-barn puts only a very thin partition between you and the outside world . Therefore what could be a more fit place to thresh out dry philosophical subjects than a barn floor ? I have a few such subjects to thresh out , and I thresh them here , turning them over as many times as we used to turn over the oat and rye sheaves in the old days when I wielded the hickory flail with my brothers on this same barn floor . What a pleasure it is to look hack to those autumn days , generally in September or early October , when we used to thresh out a few bushels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grist-mill for a fresh supply of flour ! How often we paused in our work to munch apples that had been mellowing in the haymow by our side , and look out through the big doorway upon the sunlit meadows and hill-slopes I The sound of the flail is heard in the old barn no more , but in its stead the scratching of a pen and the uneasy stirring of a man seated there behind a big box , threshing out a harvest for a loaf of much less general value . As I sit here day after day , bending over my work , I get many glimpses of the little rills of will life that circulate about me . The feature of it that impresses me most is the life of fear that most of the wild creatures lead . They are as alert and cautious as are the picket-lines of opposing armies . Just over the line of stone wall in the orchard a woodchuck comes hesitatingly out of his hole and goes nibbling in the grass not fifty feet away . How alert and watchful heis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , then resumes his feeding . When I make a slight noise he rushes to the cover of the stone wall . Then , as no danger appears , he climbs to the top of it and looks in my direction . As I move as if to get up he drops back quietly to his hole . A chipmunk comes along on the stone wall , hurrying somewhere on an important errand , but changing his course every moment . He runs on the top of the wall , then along its side , then into it and through it and out on the other side , pausing every few seconds and looking and listening , careful not to expose himself long in any one position , really skulking and hiding all along his journey . His enemies are keen and watchful and liable to appear at any moment , and he knows it , not so much by experience as by instinct . His young are timid and watchful the first time they emerge from the den into the light of day . Then a red squirrel comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rushes along from cover to cover like a soldier dodging the enemy 's bullets . When he discovers me he pauses , and with one paw on his heart appears to press a button , that lets off a flood of snickering , explosive sounds that seem like ridicule of me and my work . Failing to get any response from me , he presently turns . and . springing from the wall to the bending branch of a near apple-tree , he rushes up and disappears amid the foliage . Presently I see him on the end of a branch , where he seizes a green apple not yet a third grown , and , darting down to a large , horizontal branch , sits up with the apple in his paws and proceeds to chip it up for the pale , unripe seeds at its core , all the time keenly alive to possible dangers that may surround him . What a nervous , hustling , high-strung creature he is ? a live wire at all times and places ! That pert curl of the end of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the shell of a nut , is expressive of his character . What a contrast his nervous and explosive activity presents to the more sedate and dignified life of the gray squirrel ! One of these passed us only a few yards away on our walk in the woods the other days long , undulating line of soft gray , silent as a spirit and graceful as a wave on the beach . A little later , in the fine , slow-falling rain , a rabbit suddenly emerges into my field of vision fifty feet away . How timid and scared she looks ! She pauses a moment amid the weeds , then hops a yard or two and pauses again , then passes under the bars and hesitates on the edge of a more open and exposed place immediately in front of me . Here she works her nose , feeling of every current of air , analyzing every scent to see if danger is near . Apparently detecting something suspicious in the currents that drift from my direction , she turns back , pauses again , works her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yesterday I saw a rat stealing green peas from my garden in the open day . He darted out of the stone wall six or eight feet away to the row of peas , rushed about nervously among the vines ; then , before I could seize my rifle , darted back to the cover of the wall . Once I cautiously approached his hiding - place in the wall and waited . Presently his head emerged from the line of weeds by the fence , his nose began working anxiously , he sifted and resifted the air with it , and then quickly withdrew ; his nose had detected me , but his eye bad not . An animal 's touchstone is its nose , and not its eye . The eye quickly detects objects in motion , but not those at rest ; this is the function of the nose . A highhole alights on the ground in full view in the orchard twenty yards away , and , spying my motionless figure , pauses and regards me long and intently . His eye serves him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous , be stoops to the turf for his beloved ants and other insects , but lifts his head every few seconds to see that no danger is imminent . Not one moment is he off his guard . A hawk may suddenly swoop from the air above , or a four-footed foe approach from any side . Ihave seen a sharp-shinned hawk pick up a highhole from the turf in a twinkling under just such conditions . What a contrast between the anxious behavior of these wild creatures and the ease and indifference of the grazing cattle ! All the wild creatures evidently regard me with mingled feelings of curiosity and distrust . A song-sparrow hops and flirts and attitudinizes and peers at me from the door-sill , wondering if there is any harm in me . A phoebe-bird comes in and flits about , disturbed by my presence . For the third or fourth time this season , I think , she is planning a nest . In June she began one over a window on the porch where I sleep in. the open air . She had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little disturbed . by my presence , especially in the early morning , when I wanted to sleep and she wanted to work . She let fall some of her mortar upon me , but at least I had no fear of a falling brick . She gradually got used to me , and her work was progressing into the moss stage when two women appeared and made their beds upon the porch , and in the morning went to and fro with brooms , of course . Then Phoebe seemed to say to herself , " This is too much , " and she left her unfinished nest and resorted to the empty hay-barn . Here she built a nest on one of the bark-covered end timbers half-way up the big mow , not being quite as used to barns and the exigencies of haying-times as swallows are , who build their mud nests against the rafters in the peak . She had deposited her eggs , when the haymakers began pitching hay into the space beneath her ; sweating , hurrying haymakers do not see or regard the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fragrant hay rose and covered the timber and the nest , and crept on up toward the swallow 's unfledged family in the peak , but did not quite reach it . Phoebe and her mate hung about the barn disconsolate for days , and now , ten days later , she is hovering about my open door on the floor below , evidently prospecting for another building-site . I hope she will find me so quiet and my air so friendly that she will choose a niche on the hewn timber over my head . Just this moment I saw her snap up a flying " miller " in the orchard a few rods away . She was compelled to swoop four times before she intercepted that little moth in its unsteady , zigzagging flight . She is an expert at this sort of thing ; it is her business to take her game on the wing , but the moths are experts in zigzag flying , and Phcebe missed her mark three times . I beard the snap of her beak at each swoop . It is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moth or a butterfly on the wing . Last year in August the junco , or common snowbird , came into the big barn and built her nest in the side of the haymow , only a few feet from me . The clean , fragrant hay attracted her as it had attracted me . One would have thought that in a haymow she had nesting material near at hand . But no ; her nest-building instincts had to take the old rut ; she must bring her own material from without ; the haymow was only the mossy bank or the wood-side turf where her species had hidden their nests for untold generations . She did not weave one spear of the farmer 's hay into her nest , but brought in the usual bits of dry grass and weeds and horsehair and shaped the fabric after the old pattern , tucking it well in under tho drooping locks of hay . As I sat morning after morning weaving my thoughts together and looking out of the great barn doorway into sunlit fields , the junco wove her straws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her three exquisite eggs . Why the bird departed so widely from the usual habits of nest-building of her species who can tell ? I had never before seen a junco 's nest except on the ground in remote fields , or in mossy banks by the side of mountain roads . This nest is the finest to be found upon the ground , its usual lining of horsehair makes its interior especially smooth and shapely , and the nest in the haymow showed only a little falling off , as is usually the case in the second nest of the season . The songs of the birds , the construction of their nests , and the number of their eggs taper off as the season wanes . The junco impresses me as a fidgety , emphatic , feather-edged sort of bird ; the two white quills in its tail which flash out so suddenly on every movement seemto stamp in this impression . My junco was a little nervous at first and showed her white quills , but she soon grew used to my presence , and would alight upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hammock ropes . When an artist came to paint my portrait amid such rustic surroundings , the bird only eyed her a little suspiciously at first , and then went forward with her own affairs . One night the wind blew the easel with its canvas over against the haymow where the nest was placed , but the bird was there on her eggs in the morning . Her wild instincts did not desert her in one respect , at least : when I would flush her from the nest she would drop down to the floor and with spread plumage and fluttering movements seek for a moment to decoy me away from the nest , after the habit of most ground-builders . The male came about the barn frequently with three or four other juncos , which I suspect were the first or June brood of the pair , now able to take care of themselves , but still held together by the family instinct , as often happens in the case of some other birds , such as bluebirds and chickadees . My little mascot hatched all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until , during my absence of three or four days , some night-prowler , probably a rat , plundered the nest , and the little summer idyl in the heart of the old barn abruptly ended . I saw the juncos no more . While I was so closely associated with the junco in the old barn I had a good chance to observe her incubating habits . I was surprised at the frequent and long recesses that she took during school-hours . Every hour during the warmest days she was off from ten to twelve minutes , either to take the air or to take a bite , or to let up on the temperature of her eggs , or to have a word with her other family ; I am at a loss to know which . Toward the end of her term , which was twelve days , and as the days grew cooler , she was not gadding out and in so often , but kept her place three or four hours at a time . When the young were batched they seemed mainly fed with inserts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the inside of the barn . It was pretty sight to see the mother-bird making the rounds of the barn , running along the timbers , jumping up here and there , and seizing some invisible object , showing the while her white petticoats ? as a French girl called that display of white tail feathers . Day after day and week after week as I look through the big , open barn door I see a marsh-hawk beating about low over the fields . He , or rather she ( for I see by the greater size and browner color that it is the female ) , moves very slowly and deliberately on level , flexible wing , now over the meadow , now over the oat or millet field , then above the pasture and the swamp , tacking and turning , her eye bent upon the ground , and no doubt sending fear or panic through the heart of many a nibbling mouse or sitting bird . She occasionally hesitates or stops in her flight and drops upon the ground , as if seeking insects or frogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or strike after the manner of other hawks . It is a pleasure to watch her through the glass and see her make these circuits of the fields on effortless wing , day after day , and strike no bird or other living thing , as if in quest of something she never finds . I never see the male . She has perhaps assigned hint other territory to hunt over . He is smaIler , with more blue in his plumage . One day she had a scrap or a game of some kind with three or four crows on the side of a rocky hill . I think the crows teased and annoyed her . I heard their cawing and saw phem pursuing the hawk , and then saw her swoop upon them or turn over in the air beneath them , as if to show them what feats she could do on the wing that were beyond their powers . The crows often made a peculiar guttural cawing and cackling as if they enjoyed the sport , but they were clumsy and awkward enough on the wing compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them from a point high in the air , like a thunderbolt , but never seemed to touch them . Twice I saw her swoop upon them as they sat upon the ground , and the crows called out in half-sportive , half-protesting tones , as if saying , That was a little too close ; beware , beware ! " It was like a skilful swordsman flourishing his weapon aboutthe head of a peasant ; but not a feather was touched so far as I could see . It is the only time I ever saw this hawk in a sportive or aggressive mood . I have seen jays tease the sharp-shinned hawk in this way , and escape his retaliating blows by darting into a cedar-tree . All the crow tribe , I think , love to badger and mock some of their neighbors . How much business the crows seem to have apart from hunting their living ! I hear their voices in the morning before sun-up , sounding out from different points of the fields and woods , as if every one of them were giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim , you do this ; here , Corvus , you go there and put that thing through " ; and Jim caws back a response , and Corvus says , " I 'm off this minute . " I get the impression that it is convention day or general training day with them . There are voices in all keys of masculinity and femininity . Here and there seems to be one in authority who calls at intervals , " Haw-ah , haw , hawah Others utter a strident " Haw ! " still others a rapid , feminine call . Some seem hurrying , others seem at rest , but the landscape is apparently alive with crows carrying out some plan of concerted action . How fond they must be of one another ! What boon companions they are ! In constant communication , saluting one another from the trees , the ground , the air , watchful of one another 's safety , sharing their plunder , uniting against a common enemy , noisy , sportive , predacious , and open and aboveboard in all their ways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in how many ways he challenges our admiration ! What a contrast the crow presents to the silent , solitary hawk ! The hawks have but two occupations ? hunting and soaring ; they have no social or tribal relations , and make no show of business as does the crow . The crow does not hide ; he seems to crave the utmost publicity ; his goings and comings are advertised with all the effectiveness of his strident voice ; but all our hawks are silent end stealthy . Let me return to the red squirrel , because he returns to me hourly . He is the most frisky , diverting , and altogether impish of all our wild creatures . Ho is a veritable Puck . All the other wild folk that cross my field of vision , or look in upon me here in my fragrant hay-barn study , seem to have but one feeling about me : " What is it ? Is it dangerous ? Has it any designs upon me ? " But my appearance seems to awaken other feelings in the red squirrel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and goes through a series of antics and poses and hilarious gestures , giving out the while a stream of snickering , staccato sounds that suggest unmistakably that I am a source of mirth and ridicule to him . His gestures and attitudes are all those of mingled mirth , curiosity , defiance , and contempt ? seldom those of fear . He comes spinning along on the stone wall in front of rne , with those abrupt , nervous pauses every few yards that characterize all his movements . On seeing me he checks his speed , and with depressed tail impels himself along , a few inches at a time , in a series of spasmodic starts and sallies ; the hind part of his body flattened , and his legs spread , his head erect and alert , his tail full of kinks and quirks . How it undulates ! Now its end curls , now it is flattened to tho stone , now it springs straight up as if part of a trap , hind-feet the while keeping time in a sort of nervous dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next moment he is sitting erect with fare-paws pressed against his white chest , his tail rippling out behind him or up his back , and his shrill , nasal tones still pouring out . He hops to the next stone , he assumes a new position , his tail Palpitates and jerks more lively than ever ; now he is on all-fours , with curved back ; now he sits up at an angle , his tail all the time charged with mingled suspicion and mirth . Then he springs to a rail that runs out at right angles from the wall toward me , and with hectoring snickers and shrill trebles , pointed straight at me , keeps up his performance . What an actor he is ! What a furry embodiment of quick , nervous energy and impertinence ! Surely he has a sense of something like humor ; surely he is teasing and mocking me and telling me , both by gesture and by word of mouth , that I present a very ridiculous appearance . A chipmunk comes hurrying along with stuffed cheek - pouches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top , stopping every few yards to see that the way is clear , but giving little heed to me or to the performing squirrel . In comparison the chipmunk is a demure , preoccupied , pretty little busybody who often watches you curiously , but never mocks you or pokes fun at you ; while the gray squirrel has the manners of the best-bred wood-folk ; he goes his way without fuss or bluster , a picture of sylvan grace and buoyancy . All the movements of the red squirrel are quick , sharp , jerky , machine-like . Ho does nothing slowly or gently ; everything with a snap and a jerk . His progression is a series of interrupted sallies . When he pauses on the stone wall he faces this way and that with a sudden jerk ; he turns around in two or three quick leaps . So abrupt and automatic in his movements , so stiff and angular in behavior , yet be is charged and overflowing with life and energy . One thinks of him as a bundle of steel wires and needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sounds or calls is like the buzz of a reel or the whir of an alarm - clock . Something seems to touch a spring there in the old apple-tree , and out leaps this strident sound as of spinning brass wheels . When I speak sharply to him , in the midst of his antics , he pauses a moment with uplifted paw , watching me intently , and then with a snicker springs upon a branch of an apple-tree that hangs down near the wall , and disappears amid the foliage . The red squirrel is always actively saucy , aggressively impudent . He peeps in at me through a broken pane in the window and snickers ; he strikes up a jig on the stone underpinning twenty feet away and mocks ; he darts in and out among the timbers and chatters and giggles ; he climbs up over the door , pokes his head in , and lets off a volley ; he moves by jerks along the sill a few feet from my head and chirps derisively ; he eyes me from points on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the barn , and flings his anger or his contempt upon me . No other of our wood-folk has such a facile , emotional tail as the red squirrel . It seems as if an electric current were running through it most of the time ; it vibrates , it ripples , it curls , it jerks , it arches , it flattens ; now it is like a plume in his cap ; now it is a cloak around his shoulders ; then it is an instrument to point and emphasize his states of emotional excitement ; every movement of his body is seconded or reflected in his tail . There seems to be some automatic adjustment between his tail and his vocal machinery . The tail of the gray squirrel shows to best advantage when he is running over the ground in the woods ? and a long , graceful , undulating line of soft silver gray the creature makes ! The gray squirrel is more strictly a wood-dweller than the red , and has the grace and elusiveness that belong more especially to the sylvan creatures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Underneath his strident , nasal snicker you may hear a note in another key , much finer and shriller . Or it is as if the volume of sound was split up into two strains , one proceeding from his throat and the other from his mouth . If the red squirrels do not have an actual game of tag , they have something so near it that I can not tell the difference . Just now I see one in hot pursuit of another on the stone wall ; both are apparently going at the top of their speed . They make a red streak over the dark-gray stones . When the pursuer seems to overtake the pursued and becomes " It , " the race is reversed , and away they go on the back track with the same fleetness of the hunter and the hunted , till things are reversed again . I have seen them engaged in the same game in tree-tops , each one having his innings by turn . The gray squirrel comes and goes , but the red squirrel we have always with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a true American ; he has nearly all the national traits ? nervous energy , quickness , resourcefulness , pertness , not to say impudence and conceit . Ho is not altogether lovely or blameless . Ile makes war on the chipmunk , he is a robber of birds ' nests , and is destructive of the i orchard fruits . Nearly every man 's hand is against him , yet he thrives , and long may he continue to do so I One day I placed some over-ripe plums on the wall in front of me to see what he would do with them . At first he fell eagerly to releasing the pit , and then to cutting his way to the kernel in the pit . After one of them had been disposed of in this way , he proceeded to carry off the others and place them here and there amid the branches of a plum-tree from which be had stolen every plum long before they were ripe . A day or two later I noted that they had all been removed from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forks of an apple-tree not far off . A small butternut-tree standing near the wall had only a score or so of butternuts upon it this year ; the squirrels might be seen almost any hour in the day darting about the branches of that tree , hunting the green nuts , and in early September the last nut was taken . They carried them away and placed them , one here and one there , in the forks of the apple-trees . I noticed that they did not depend upon the eye to find the nuts ; they did not look the branches over from some lower branch as you and I would have done ; they explored the branches one by one , running out to the end , and , if the nut was there , seized it and came swiftly down . I think the red squirrel rarely lays up any considerable store , but bides his nuts here and there in the trees and upon the ground . This habit makes him the planter of future trees , of oaks , hickories , chestnuts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency . One morning I saw a chipmunk catch a flying grasshopper on the wing . Little Striped-back sat on the wall with stuffed pockets , waiting for something , when along came the big grasshopper in a hesitating , uncertain manner of flight . As it hovered above the chipmunk the latter by a quick , dexterous movement sprang or reached up and caught it , and in less than one-half minute its fanlike wings were opening out in front of the captor 's mouth and its body was being eagerly devoured . This same chipmunk , I think it is , has his den under the barn near me . Often he comes from the stone wall with distended cheek-pouches , and pauses fifteen feet away , close by cover , and looks to seo if any danger is impending . To reach his hole he has to cross an open space a rod or more wide , and the thought of it evidently agitates him a little . I am sitting there looking over my desk upon him , and he is skeptical about my being as harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of open there in front of him ? " he seems to say . He sits up with fore-paws pressed so prettily to his white breast . He is so near I can see the rapid throbbing of his chest as he sniffs the air . A moment he sits and looks and sniffs , then in hurried movements crosses the open , his cheek-pockets showing full as he darts by me . He is like a baseball-runner trying to steal a base : danger lurks on all sides ; he must not leave the cover of one base till ho sees the way is clear , and then ? off with a rush ! Pray do n't work yourself up to such a pitch , my little neighbor ; you shall make a home-run without the slightest show of opposition from inc . One day a gray squirrel came along on the stone wall beside the road . In front of the house he crossed an open bar-way , and then paused to observe two men at work in full view near the house . The men were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The squirrel sprang up a near by butternut-tree , sat down on a limb , and had a good , long look . " Very suspicious , " he seemed to think ; " maybe they are fixing a trap for me " ; and he deliberately came down the tree and returned the way he had come , spinning along the top of the wall , his long , fine tail outlined by a narrow band of silver as he sped off toward the woods .
