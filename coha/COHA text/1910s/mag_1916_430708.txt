 | ONE afternoon during the Republican Convention week I spent a half-hour with one of the elder and astute Republican leaders . I think that in many ways he is the most astute of them all . He is of the Old Guard , and yet not of it . He has enough of the conservative quality in his nature so that radical departures from party discipline and order never move him , but , on the other hand , he has never been under the control of reactionary financial influence , and he reads the temper of progress and does what he can to bring progress to pass . He was a quiet and powerful influence in the National Convention this year , and as things seemed to him to be moving , and actually turned out to be moving , certainly and resistlessly in the direction of his own belief and desire , I found him self-poised and calm in the midst of discordant views and conflicting purposes . I have known him in other years , and he talked freely and frankly like a genial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in substance is what he said to me as he looked out reflectively through his window in the Blackstone over the stormy waters of Lake Michigan . " The Republican party , " said he , " was born in a great burst of patriotism and faith in human rights . After the war big property interests slowly got hold of it because they found it worth while to control the leading departments of the Government , and the most certain way  | to do it was to control or get into power their kind of big leaders in one or both of the old parties . And that is the way we got the Old Guard . And that is the meaning of the Old Guard . Whether they acknowledged it or not , the Old Guard stood for that point of view . And it all but wrecked the Republican party . In 1912 influences of that kind made their last stand for the old order . And if they had succeeded there would soon have been no Republican party . The trend of the country is against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his big hand over and grasped mine , and said , " What Roosevelt and the Progressives did in 1912 was to save the Republican party to the service of the country . " And he went on : The Old Guard can not control this Convention . There are none of us who can place our delegates with the certainty of former years . The delegates are going to have a Republican , but they are going to have Hughes because they think he is the biggest party Republican who can be elected to serve the country in the present crisis . The Old Guard is for Hughes , but it is because they have to be . None of us leaders could put anybody else across , no matter how hard we might try : " This was the afternoon before the Convention opened , and I had full opportunity to test out the insight of this distinguished political party manager during the succeeding days . Under the shadow and protection of the shield of a big , friendly Chicago policeman , I had a seat at every session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look the Convention over at my leisure and observe at least the objective signs of all that was going on within the minds of delegates and leaders . The Convention was never what might be termed enthusiastic , but it became , as the days went by , a serious and determined Convention . There were no great groups of direct primary freemen , as in 1912 , fighting militantly for their rights against what they believed to be a stubborn and tyrannous oligarchy . The Convention was pretty carefully hand-picked , but it was not a convention of political hacks or of docile political incapables who would stand without hitching . It was hand-picked in the sense that great care had been taken by the leaders to get men of substance and of assured party position , who would have the party point of view , and who could not , by any manner of means , be stampeded to anybody who was not a party Republican , no matter whether his name was Gladstone or Alexander the Great . There never was a moment after the Convention met when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of certain Progressive leaders that Theodore Roosevelt might be nominated by the Republicans . It was simply not in the human stuff which made up the Republican Convention to do any such thing when once the delegates had assembled in Chicago . After the entirely friendly conferences which took place between the Progressive committee and the Republican committee , the Old Guard leaders were mellower than the delegates . The delegates wished reunion , but not Roosevelt . And if by any stretch of imagination the Old Guard had come to conceive it wise that Roosevelt should be nominated , ' it would have been impossible for them to force their will upon the Convention . In other words , the delegates were generally estimable men who were in this matter the natural aftermath of the prepossessions , the habits of mind , the resentments , which drove the Old Guard group to such lengths four years before . There was not the slightest need this time of strong-arm methods or fraud or any other device to beat Roosevelt . The power certainly to accomplish this lay in the unalterable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the selection of the membership of the Republican Convention , but this task was made entirely easy by the fact that many efficient leaders and a multitude of voters withdrew from the party in 1912 , and although the majority of them had returned , they were not yet in a position , and most of them were not yet in the mood of inclination , to enter into a struggle for delegates in the primary campaign . And so the conservatives naturally had their way and the process of selection against Roosevelt was far from difficult . The threat of the Progressive Convention was therefore impotent to obtain the choice of Mr. Roosevelt by the Republican party . And the attempt was further made futile by the deep-seated conviction of the Old Guard leaders themselves that if the Republican Convention took the issue of Americanism and a fit nominee , wild horses could not draw Theodore Roosevelt into the contest of a third party . They banked on their experience of his patriotic integrity and his long life of devotion to the interest of the country . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt and the remnant of the Progressive organization was that the necessity of the issue of Americanism and of the strongest possible nomination of a Republican was made plain to the dullest delegate in the Coliseum . The threat of Roosevelt nursed the issue of Americanism to the point where the Republicans necessarily and naturally took it over in its maturity , and made impossible the nomination of any other candidate except Justice Hughes . All this lay in the background . But as the days went by , and the tension lightened a little , and the preliminary deadness and gloom were shaken off , and the sunshine came after the rain , and the bands played patriotic airs , and the songs of the Nation rang out from ten thousand throats , and the cheery and natural and very human and sensible speech of the veteran Depew suffused its charm , and the silver-toned eloquence of Governor Willis , of Ohio , with its appeal to the spirit of idealism and reunion and reconsecration aroused a deeper thrill , and the splendid and scholarly patriotic utterance of President Butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the assembly , it was plain to any impartial observer that bitterness and rancor and prejudice and resentments were being lost sight of by the delegates themselves , and the higher sentiment of the vast gathering was asserting itself with power . From that moment a stout Americanism and Hughes became the hearty and willing choice of the thousand representatives of National Republicanism . Out of the eater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness . At no time was it a Convention of enthusiasm . But it developed a serious and common purpose which in the end may be better for the country . The soul of the Convention slowly found itself . The Progressive Convention was all soul , too much dissociated from the organized habits and ways by which impulses are put into effect in this world . I have no sort of sympathy with the view which prevailed among the unthinking here that the Progressive Convention was a gathering of wild men and women . It was a holy impulse , but there was a large element of impracticalness . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent-spirited but not well-informed gentleman from the Middle Vest who sat in front of me when John M. Parker , of Louisiana , was nominated by the Progressives for Vice-President : CTLOOK 21 June " that is a darned good nomination , too , " said he , " to break the solid South I " That was the Progressive Convention on the side of its yearning impossibility . But it had a noble side , a side of earnest men beating their hearts out against the hard , unyielding system of the world in which they lived . " Intrenched power , deeply rooted partisan habit of mind , money , everything , seems against us , " said one of their most eloquent champions , " and yet if we keep our political motives pure , our faces toward the morning , we shall win the victory . " The country can not get along without that spirit , neither can the Republican party . In the Republican Convention the need of America was being supplied laboriously through the machinery of a tempering and resisting organization . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart-beat of free and untrammeled human spirits . The Progressive Convention seemed to me to be something like the abolitionist ' core of the Republican party , squeezed out and palpitatingly exposed to view in the Auditorium . It will be the first real job of Hughes and Americanism to get that core back where it belongs in the center of Republicanism . It was interesting to watch the Coliseum Convention feeling its way inexorably to Hughes . It was a unique spectacle in American politics . Nobody to speak for him , nobody to pay for him , nobody to prepare demonstrations for him , nothing but deep and unseen and more or less subconscious human forces , selfish and unselfish , inside and outside the Convention , pushing him forward with the precision and irresistibility of glacial pressure . Political foreordination ought to be good Republican doctrine from this time forward . Thence sprang the nomination of Hughes . And it brought forward a strong , able , upright man . I was amused more than once by hearing certain Middle Western and Far Western leaders . Progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campaign that Hughes would be able to conduct . The Middle Westerners , at least , ought not to have forgotten the remarkable incursion of Hughes into Ohio and Minnesota during the campaign of 1908 , and certainly no New Yorker can fail to recall those wonderful sweeps across the Empire State which Hughes made again and again during his Governorship , exhorting and arousing the people and establishing for himself and the Republican party and for the com- monwealth an alert and conscientious electorate such as New York never knew before and has never known since . When he first ran for the Governorship , he was far from a flexible and pleasing and powerful speaker . He was too didactic and legal . But the time came , as his observation and experience grew , when he strode the platforms of great assemblies with the tread of a giant . Neither the Republicans nor the people anywhere in the country need give themselves any concern whatever about his mental or technical equipment for the task of the campaign which is before him , nor doubt his eminent fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he may enter upon the Presidency . One of the most notable differences between Hughes and Wilson is this : The trend of the political theory of Wilson seems to be that he is first the premier of his party and second the President of the country . The trend of the political theory of Hughes is that heshould be first the President of the country and second the premier of his party . Hughes in New York stood for two great changes iii the political order of his State : first , for the liberalization of the party machinery , and , second , for putting powerful privileged interest in a just relation to the sovereignty of the whole people . He was against the racetrack gambling syndicate , not on narrow ethical grounds , but because the syndicate had unjustly secured through the Legislature , in evasion of the Constitution , privileges not accorded to the rest of the people . The syndicate was powerfully regnant over the Constitution and the people , and not in a position of proper subordination . And Hughes put an end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sovereignty and supervision of the State to check monopolistic practices . But his fairness to the corporation was as evident as his fidelity to the people . In his long fight against great odds for the direct primary he sought , not to destroy party organization , but to make it serve the popular will . His idea of the direct primary was that it should be simply a referendum upon the choices of public office made by popularly elected party leaders . He wished to elect the leaders freely and directly and let them have a great deal to say , but he wished to put a final check upon them in the knowledge that on primary day they had to go up against a referendum of the people . As he often used to phrase it , he was in favor of putting the hobbles upon the party bosses and of taking them off the people . As I have watched the proceedings in and about the conventions this year and have sought to interpret them in terms of the great revolution of 1912 , it has struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great party bolt of four years ago started out to accomplish has not been accomplished at all . What the protesting element was really aroused over in Chicago in 1912 was the tyranny of the National Committee of the Republican party in holding on to iniquitous party rules and customs after they were brought to the light and when they had become obnoxious to the popular will and conscience . But the process of making the Republican party responsive to the reactions of the best instincts of its own rank and file by proportioning representation in the National Convention to the voting power of the party in the separate States , and then electing the delegates directly under just and uniform rules on the same day in all the States , has hardly been entered upon . Instead , the bolting Republicans were joined with a great variety of political elements in the country , and the Progressive party was founded in a great burst of altruistic National vision . I do not think it could have been avoided , because there were longsuppressed internal volcanic forces and convictions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the country will always be a better country because the volcanic outburst came . But now the outburst is quieted , and the Progressive party , which was the channel of its expression , has disintegrated . The liberalization of the Republican organization has not gone forward , and still there is the party menace of another revolt against intrenched injustice . And the National menace , too , because it would be far better if progress could be orderly and rational in the United States under the two-party system . Now Hughes , if elected , is , in my opinion , likely to be profoundly interested in the liberalization of the organization of National parties . So it may be that instinctively , even if unconsciously , the Republican Convention has opened the way for the stream of political prcgress to flow on as it would have done smoothly and powerfully in 1912 except for the Bourbon wall of adamant which then blocked the channel . And the Hughes nomination , too , will  | sooner or later meet a response in the conscience of the great business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dawning change in the point of view of business leaders has appeared in the backing which strong men in commerce and finance have given to the Roosevelt programme of National unity and preparation in the last eighteen months . And most of them backed it through motives of the highest patriotism . This patriotic fealty will be transferred to Hughes if , as he is sure to do , he voices powerfully the aspiration and the need of the real America . The tested and tried fairness and firmness of Hughes towards the economic interests of the country and his natural instinct toward freedom and efficiency within the political parties are traits of leadership which will help to quiet and resolve the unsettled issues of 1912 as well as the deeper ones of the present hour . If we take the long view , the Republican Convention , both in its platform and its candidate , will undoubtedly furnish a clear illustration of the resistless power and energy of the liberal movement in American politics . The Old Guard is passing . It bows to the inevitable and reaction has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather dull . There was a good deal more doing that was dramatic and human over at the Auditorium , where the Progressives met . But still you could have a good time at the Coliseum . Senator Harding , of Ohio , turned out to be a most able and delightful presiding officer . There never was a moment during the whole week when he was not the master of the assembly , and he did it so easily and so pleasantly and so tactfully that it was a joy to watch him . Until the Convention got to understand its own mind as late as Friday morning I was afraid that Abraham Lincoln would be nominated in spite of himself and in spite of his absence from earthly scenes . It seemed to me he missed it several times only by a hair . And then I wondered . Suppose he had appeared in the flesh and had told the Convention directly and plainly beforehand , as he knew how , just where he stood on " divided allegiance , " for example . I wonder whether they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not he would have been regarded as " available . " The place was full of sergeants-at-arms . That was the way several hundred political gentlemen from near and far seemed to have secured admission to the show . The sergeants-at-arms had no seats , and the hall was full of policemen with superior authority whose duty seemed to be chiefly to keep the sergeants-at-arms moving so that the aisles would be clear . And one of the more stout and jovial of the political sergeants , a prosperous and perspiring representative from Indiana who was over-topped in his civil capacity by the military arm , and who suffered from the perpetual injunction to " move on , " was wont thus to greet his friends in the Indiana delegation hastily as he passed them on each circuit : " Good-by , Ed , goodby , Fred , good-by , Joe ; I 'll see you on the next round . " He finally worked off his sergeant 's badge on another political gentleman in exchange for the badge of a page . The only difference , he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to run instead of walk , but any kind of a change was welcome . What about the platform and Fairbanks ? The platform is well enough , but it has only gums and not teeth . One of the chief tasks of candidate Hughes will be to put teeth into it . The nomination of Fairbanks was far less subtly foreordained than that of Hughes . It was clearly " indicated " to all political doctors . Fairbanks 's job is to carry his State of Indiana . The Republicans must have Indiana . It is an uncertain State , and just now is deep dyed in Democracy . It is the State of Vice-President Marshall , probably again to be the running mate of Wilson . It is the State of that able Democratic general Tom Taggart , of French Lick . Roosevelt carried it by 94,000 in 1904 , but it is Democratic now almost from top to bottom . Hence Fairbanks . Besides , Fairbanks has Vice-Presidential experience and has kept well out of the shindy of the last four fateful years . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his State . He has the record for harmony between the Progressive and the Republican factionalists of 1912 . Both kinds were on his delegation at Chicago , both kinds are on his State ticket , both kinds are in his reconstructed organization in Indiana . He has shown the way to narrow-visioned Republicans in other commonwealths to heal the wound to the bone . The Republican party is passing the crisis . The reflection about this Convention that will some day startle the country like a fire-bell in the night is the proscribing of Roosevelt because he would not conform . In its honeyed aspect it is an indication only of  | what is known as the partisan bias of political organization in the United States . But in its deeper meaning it is a disconcerting evidence of the presence of the temper of the Russian bureaucracy at work within the organization of American democracy . At its best it signifies the inbred habit of mind of millions which sometimes unconsciously and blindly prefers party to country . The difference between Roosevelt and that habit of mind is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . The end is his country . He risked the destruction of the Republican party in 1912 in order that the country might be awakened to free itself from invisible tyranny . And in 1916 he as readily consented to the elimination of the Progressive party , because it could no longer serve the country , but had become a dangerous derelict in the path of political progress . That is the truth which some noble and sorrowful men and women who still cling to the Progressive party will some day see . It is a truth which those who have never perceived in Roosevelt anything but ruthless selfishness will never see . Happy is it that the spirit of American democracy which ran strong and deep beneath the surface in the Republican Convention should have driven the spirit of proscription for party 's sake towards another great and true leader of the American people in the person of Hughes . Whether liberalism in the person and platform of Hughes shall win the election in the Republican party depends upon the rapid cementing of the union of Republican forces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Convention were for the most part the handpicked favorites of the delegates and leaders on the floor . I speak in respectful terms . There was no attempt to pack the galleries . The galleries were for the most part the invited friends of the organization leaders and delegates below . The political managers of the Republican party would do well to ponder upon the most prolonged and spontaneous expression of regard and devotion which occurred during the Convention , the expression from their own home folks in the gallery when Senator Fall , of New Mexico . had named Theodore Roosevelt . Murray Crane 's practiced eye did not fail to scrutinize the spectacle carefully . Let the Republican political managers beware of continuing to nurse the resentment of the forty-two hundred thousand men who broke once for all in 1912 the habit of proscription and unworthy party bias and voted for Theodore Roosevelt on an alien ticket . The Hughes spirit and the Roosevelt spirit together can win this election . But neither can win it alone . If together they win , the Republican party has safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more strangely set . I sat with the representatives of the press on the stage of the Auditorium ; but the real stage was before me , down in the orchestra chairs . There sat the Progressive delegates , a thousand or more . From all parts of the country , and from such outlying points as Alaska and Hawaii , they had come intent on doing a great historic deed . Their leader , Theodore Roosevelt , had made the issue of the Presidential campaign Americanism and Preparedness , and they were firm in the faith that with that issue and with that leader they were going to victory and vindication . There they sat ? eager , earnest , very much alive . as solid a body of idealists as ever assembled : men of the plains , whose faces had been bronzed by the weather and seamed by hard experience ; substantial men of affairs from the East and the Middle AVest ; freemen from the Pacific coast , accustomed to the ways of the newest democracy ; Southerners , who for their political faith had broken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penalty . Among them , too , were a score or more of women . Altogether these hundreds of delegates formed a body which any American would have been proud to point out to a foreign visitor as representative of their country . They were not men to wait on ceremony .  | No parliamentary law for them if it stood in the way of getting their will done promptly . Their Chairman was of their mind . Whenever anything needed to be done , he manufactured the parliamentary law on the spot to allow them to do it , and they did it unanimously . And they had leaders to their taste . The old darky preacher 's oratorical divisions were their models . He said that he began his sermons by argufyin ' , continued by explanafyin ' , and ended by givin ' ' em the rousement . When that body of delegates needed argufyin ' , they listened to the clear , convincing word of James R. Garfield , or Gifford Pinchot , or Dean William Draper Lewis , who was chiefly responsible , as Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable platform ; when they needed explanafyin ' , they heard Mr. George W. Perkins , or Secretary O. K. Davis , or former Attorney-General Bonaparte , or that indefatigable bearer of political burdens , Oscar Straus ; and when they wanted the rousement , as they often did , they called for and got it in plenty from Henry J. Allen . Victor Murdock , Governor Johnson , and Bainbridge Colby . The plan that these delegates were determined upon was twofold : First , to make every effort to induce the Republicans , who were holding their sessions simultaneously at the Coliseum , to nominate Mr. Roosevelt ; or , failing in that , to nominate him themselves alone , defy the Republicans , and appeal to the country . Their pent-up feelings had not long to wait for eruption . At the first mention of the name of Theodore Roosevelt they flung off all restraint . Raymond Robins , the Chairman , was lost in a maze of shouting , marching , singing men and women , who thronged the aisles , clambered over chairs , trooped upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One delegation bore aloft a banner inscribed , " The People Want Theodore Roosevelt , a Regular American " ( a retort to the Republican slogan demanding a " Regular Republican " ) ; another , a banner declaring that " Teddy Will Not Pussyfoot . " North Dakota , where Roosevelt spent his ranch days , was represented by a banner displaying a picture of a log cabin , and under the name of the State the inscription , " The Pioneer Home of Col. Theodore Roosevelt . " It was a Southern banner , however , which did more by implication than all the others by assertion to announce that there was for that Convention but one man . It bore the words , " Georgia , His Mother 's Home . " Then these enthusiasts settled down to their first business . Perhaps the ponderous Republicans would listen ; we must gi%e them every chance , it was argued ; we are going to nominate Roosevelt , anyway ; and , if the Republicans will join us , they can have all the credit . We are seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must think . So they cheered , and sang , and told one another of the vision of a united party and a united country , and pictured Northern Republicans voting for Roosevelt under the Republican banner , and Southerners , freed from party prejudice , voting for Roosevelt under the Progressive banner , and men of all sections , wearied of Democratic misrule and discovering the way to social justice and the common defense of American rights , flocking to the united standard of the Progressive and Republican parties to place at the head of the Nation the man who of all Americans is best known and most feared in the capitals of Europe , and most honored in the mines and the factories , in the shops and streets and homes of America . And the more they thought of it , the clearer the vision became . Even the men of the press were tempted to " hit the trail . " One man behind me , forgetful of the fact that a newspaper man is supposed to have no feelings , leaned over to his neighbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of news from the Coliseum that seemed hopeful , and , loud enough for me to hear in the confusion , said : " I expect to see those fellows start out of this hall before this Convention is over , and go marching up Wabash Avenue with their banners and join with those Republican delegates in nominating T. R. by acclamation . " All the while tragedy was ahead of them , but they could not see it coming . They could not imagine it . The greater the difficulties , the greater grew their faith . They offered the Republicans an invitation to a conference by committee . They waited and turned their minds to their routine . The vast gathering at the Coliseum seemed not to be aware of this live assemblage of Progressives only a few blocks away . No answer seemed forthcoming . The Progressive leaders could hold their delegates no longer . With a shout , they voted to adjourn for the afternoon ( this was Thursday , June 8 ) when  | the pounding of the Chairman 's hammer ( no mere gavel could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans had accepted their invitation , and to authorize a committee to meet the Republican committee . The next day they had news that raised their hopes . The Republican committee had no candidate to suggest to them , and had no arguments to answer the claim of the Progressives for their candidate ; both agreed that the good of the country depends on the restoration of control of the Government to the hands of those who believe in and will execute the policies alike supported by the Republican and Progressive parties ; and these Republican conferees reported without comment , favorable or adverse , that the Progressives offered Theodore Roosevelt as the candidate on whom the two parties could unite . That word ' unite " roused the Progressive delegates to cheering that could not be suppressed for several minutes . Scarcely had this demonstration died down when they were brought up standing by a report from the Coliseum that the name of Roosevelt had been cheered there . Then these delegates , excited as they were by hope , impatient as they were through delay , resumed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They refused to be swept off their feet by suggestions of impracticable plans . They insisted on explicitness in announcement of their principles . In the midst of this business they caught sight of Senator Borah , of Idaho , a Republican who had been a fighter for Roosevelt in 1912 , and they made him welcome . " I never saw a bunch of fellows so quick on the trigger , " remarked one observer concerning this incident . " When Borah told them he came over from the Coliseum to get inspiration , they went wild ; but they sized up the situation the next minute and let him know there was no use of him thinking of himself as a compromise candidate ; for when he mentioned Roosevelt 's name did you notice how in a flash they began shouting in unison , We want Teddy , we want Teddy ! ' You ca n't get ahead of a bunch like that . " All day they were on ec'ge ; but not too much on edge to find out for themselves and to decide after a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were willing to put themselves on record as favoring it individually , they were not going to swamp all the other issues in the platform by a prohibition plank ? if a plank can be said to swamp anything . All the while they *ere restive . They wanted to be sure that , if two candidates were to be nominated at Chicago , the first to be nominated should be theirs . If they could only nominate first , they could make the Republican ticket the " third ticket " ? that at least was the idea of many of them . At the same time they wanted to write in the record the fact that they had given the Republicans every chance . So the race between their desire to be first and their desire to be fair was nip and tuck . That evening . Friday , as I came into the Auditorium the whole gathering was singing , in harmony which they had found for themselves . the strong and simple harmony of the revival meeting : " Why not , why not , Why not nominate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had come by telephone of the first ballot at the Coliseum they heard Governor Johnson of California , while he recalled " those glorious days of 1912 , " contrast those days with this night which " finds us , " as he said , " sitting at the feet of Reed Smoot and Murray Crane , " and yet , in deference to the word said to be from Mr. Roosevelt , counsel moderation . They cheered as they heard that Brumbaugh , of Pennsylvania , had withdrawn his candidacy for the Republican nomination in favor of Mr. Roosevelt , and they hoped for a sign that the vision that they were seeing was beginning to appear before those who had once spurned it . Their spirit was expressed by a young man , the leader of the North Dakota delegation , who delivered one of the shortest speeches of the Convention . In a drawl that had in it a world of humor he began from the floor : " A friend of mine in the Republican Convention asked me . ' Can you control your delegation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The crowd liked that , and made him go up to the platform . He began again : I have much language in my system which I shall retain therein . We people from Mr. Roosevelt 's second birthplace laughter , we 've felt just like Governor Johnson ; we 've had to hold on to our seats to behave ourselves as we should . We feel that we are ready to hold tight a little longer laughter and approval . And we know two things : first , that we are having an awful good time , and , second , that as far as we 've gone this Convention has been  | absolutely right . With this I shall now retain all the rest of my language in my system . And stilt they waited and listened to the telephone messages , and shouted . and held themselves in until the second ballot had been taken at the Coliseum and the Republicans had adjourned without result . By Saturday morning ( June 10 ) hope of reunion had gone , when suddenly news came that Mr. Roosevelt had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Faith in reunion revived . The leaves on the olive branch that had seemed faded grew green again . Perhaps this was the master stroke that would open the way to reunion that seemed closed . They had shut their ears to the suggestion , their minds to the very thought that they could accept any man but Roosevelt . The idea that Senator Lodge could be made their candidate was not one they could conceivably entertain ; but the idea that Senator Lodge might be the entering wedge by which the Republican Convention could be split open for the admission of Roosevelt was not so utterly foreign to their thought . They did not understand their own leader ; but they did want him . He was a part of their aspirations . The Chairman of their National Executive Committee , Mr. Perkins , worn out with sleeplessness. urged them to bide their time . John M. Parker , of Louisiana , who had labored incessantly to build up a new National party in the South , protested against inaction in the face of impending danger . Then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The storm broke ; the name of Theodore Roosevelt was placed in nomination and accepted by acclamation . Those who once fought for the faith had again enlisted against the same powers that had thwarted them before . They had done their utmost to conciliate those powers . Now for the battle ! In this exaltation of spirit they reassembled . They had beaten the Republicans by thirty seconds . Confronted by such a leader as theirs , the Republican candidate must surely face defeat or withdraw . With a view to reuniting now , not Republicans and Democrats , but North and South , they made their VicePresidential candidate the Progressive leader of Louisiana , John M. Parker , and while they were still in this exaltation of spirit the blow fell . They were about to adjourn and go forth to fight and win for their party and their party 's leader when the Chairman 's hammer sounded the doom . They hushed while the Chairman read this telegram from Oyster Bay : I am very grateful for the honor you confer upon me by nominating me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not know the attitude of the candidate of the Republican party toward the vital questions of the day . Therefore , if you desire an immediate decision , I must decline the nomination . But if you prefer it I suggest that my conditional refusal to run be placed in the hands of the Progressive National Committee . If Mr. Hughes 's statements when he makes them shall satisfy the Committee that it is for the interest of the country that he be elected , they can act accordingly and treat my refusal as definitely accepted . If they are not satisfied , they can so notify the Progressive party and at the same time they can confer with me and then determine on whatever action we may severally deem appropriate to meet the needs of the country . THEODORE ROOSEVELT . The incredible , the unthinkable , had happened . The vision had gone . Men sat stunned . There were women there ready to cry . The foundations of their faith seemed swept away . The faces that had been alight with devotion and courage were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and singing and marching turned and drooped off . It seemed a tragedy beyond words to see that body of people crushed in that way . Some of those who went out from that drama understood , but others did not . Scores upon scores were too angry to speak . A few , finding words , hurled them in denunciation of the man they had been praising . Most of them , when they think it over , will be sorry for what they said or thought that afternoon . Some , of course , are implacable . They will go back home to meet the chaffing of their unwise Republican acquaintances , and will find some consolation in voting , if not working . for the re-election of Wilson . The rest , however , who have taken time to think it over , will become reconciled to the new and unwelcome , but not altogether unpromising , situation . I have talked with them , and I think I know their mind . They will be proud of what their party has done , proud of their part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of liberalism in the Republican party . They will realize that  | if they lost their faith for the moment it was because they had not believed the words that Mr. Roosevelt had been saying again and again . He had told them , told the country , that he was not interested in the political fortunes of himself or any other man , but that he was deeply concerned for the safety of the country , and to this end he was working , not for any party . but for the cause of preparedness and undivided allegiance to America . He had called on Americans to forget their differences in order to uphold the issues he believes supreme . These Progressives who have kept their mental balance are realizing that those of their party associates who have been nursing their resentments for the wrongs of 1912 , and who have closed their minds to the possibility of supporting any man but Roosevelt , have been committing the same error which they charge against those Republicans who are nursing their resentments for what they consider the wrongs of 1912 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under any circumstances accept Roosevelt . Such men , whether Progressives or Republicans , are thinking more of party name , or personal fortune , or minor issues than of the Nation . The better part of the Progressives realize that such Progressive Bourbonism is the worst type of Bourbonism , because it is hiding the reality under false pretense . If Mr. Roosevelt should finally be convinced , as it seems plain that he is , that the best way to uphold the honor , safety , and unity of the United States is by the support of Hughes , these Progressives realize that he is bound by all he has said to do so . The Progressives who disagree with Mr. Roosevelt may not give their support to Mr. Hughes ; but those Progressives who turn against their leader because he disagrees with them in judgment will not have many to keep them company . There are Progressives on whom the loss of Mr. Roosevelt 's party leadership will fall heavily because of what is at stake in their own States ; but they are realizing ? at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside to serve these causes at the sacrifice of the Nation 's good , or in denial of what he has been plainly saying . The tragedy is harder for some to bear because the blow has come so late ; but after the Progressive Convention was once determined upon , that blow could not have come earlier without endangering the very National causes to which Mr. Roosevelt has pledged himself , and which he has made the issues of the campaign . The Progressives tried to use the party to force the Republicans to take their candidate : most of them are beginning to see that the service which the party has rendered is a much higher one . It has been to force the issues of supreme moment upon a reluctant Republican party and a dormant people . On Mr. Roosevelt has rested ? unjustly , these Progressives know ? the obloquy of disrupting the Republican party . Nbw , if Mr. Hughes loses , the burden of defeat is shifted to the shoulders of those who selected him and who ought to have borne that burden of defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burden of a disrupted party will be destroyed . And , in any case , a new burden has been placed upon the shoulders of all Americans ? the burden of the Nation 's unity and safety . Those Progressives who for party 's sake evade their share of the burden , or for the sake of their grudges add to the share that others must bear , will not be regarded as true to their profession of faith . Loyalty does not consist in shouting and singing and marching and lip service . Loyalty consists in holding fast in adversity . That is what most of the Progressives I have talked with are going to do . As long as there was a chance that the cause of the Nation 's unity and safety might be intrusted to the keeping of a united party under the leader best suited to advance it , no effort was spared to bring that chance about . As long as there was danger that this cause might have no other advocate except the Progressive party , no effort was spared to keep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of discussion as to whether those efforts were always wisely directed . But most Progressives , so far as I can learn , are thinking , not about the chances that have gone by , but the one chance that remains . As I talked with the members of the party after they had had a while to think it over , this is what they , in general , have seen to be their duty . It is not all clear to them yet ; but most of them , I think , will undoubtedly do what they can to elect Hughes .
