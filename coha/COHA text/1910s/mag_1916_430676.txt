A few seasons ago , when a celebrated transAtlantic pianist returned to America for the first extended tour that he had undertaken here in a number of years , an Olympian critic bitterly complained because of his placing upon his programmes certain of the compositions of Mendelssohn . " An artist , " the reviewer wrote , " acclaimed the first of living pianists , owes it to his public to offer it something of greater distinction than outmoded specimens of an invertebrate art which , in these days , should be consecrated to the young ladies ' boarding-schools and not obtruded upon the mature musical intelligence , " ? or words to that effect . But there was balm left in Gilead . For not long afterward another eminent trans-Atlantic virtuoso who visited these shores offered to the public a " tonepoem " in which a contemporary composer had endeavored to depict the emotions which the passage of a reverberant express-train over an evidently rudimentary railway had aroused within his breast . Tumultuous indeed was the resultant repercussion , and correspondingly surging was the enthusiasm of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or as near passion as an Olympian critic may allow himself to betray , ? that the public ( very obviously of " mature musical intelligence " ) was vastly indebted to the executant for his interpretation of this distinguished example of the new art-forms with which modern pianistic literature was being enriched . We can never sufficiently marvel , I think , at the critical capacity to take its artistic pleasures painfully . From modern art it seems , preferably , to demand a paralyzing punch upon the solar plexus , after which it most delights in being dragged by the heels to the topmost turret of the artist 's ivory tower and violently precipitated therefrom . The critical anatomy being admittedly indestructible , it then , having gathered itself together and picked itself up , hastens off to blacken paper to the effect that it has been its privilege to assist at a most distinguished performance . " Distinguished ! " ? potent word ! " I think ? therefore I am , " said Descartes . " It is dis- tinguished ? therefore it is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyphony ? of anything that aspires to consideration as an artistic achievement . " Y-e-e-s , " feebly assents the bourgeois bystander ( who , as we all know , forms the indispensable background of Olympian criticism ) , shuddering lest he make a mistake , " but how am I to know what is distinguished from what is n't ? " " How indeed ? " is the response . " To be frank , you can not . But I am here to instruct you . Follow me , and possibility of error is eliminated . For instance ? . " And the next lesson ensues . I have just been studying one of these lessons , and I confess to a doubt ? to a doubt that swells to a suspicion ? of the infallibility of my Mentor ; who , in this case , is discussing the poet Longfellow . To be particular , he is offering what he terms a " Portrait of Longfellow " ; and , as the finishing touch thereof , he pronounces him to have been , as a poet , utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something different , he thinks , may be averred . One can even discern that he is rather pleased to be able to record that Longfellow was , humanly speaking , a truly distinguished gentleman ; and he bestows on him various approving phrases which must , to his benignant shade in its serene place upon Parnassus , be indeed most comforting . But of Longfellow the poet ? ! Up go the Olympian eyebrows ; the Olympian nostrils dilate , and very ' palpably they sniff ; and the Olympian hand , with a weary gesture , altogether eliminates the author of " My Lost Youth , " " Palingenesis , " and " A Psalm of Life " from his distinguished consideration . It is done with an assured inexorability that is final . But ? if the reader happens to have a portrait of Longfellow hanging upon his library wall ( as some bourgeois readers who have not yet balanced themselves upon the most vertiginous aiguilles of the New Parnassus possibly still have ) he will raise his eyes to the pictured face and , as I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts will swell into suspicions . But not suspicions of Longfellow , ? suspicions of the Olympian and oh , so distinguished , critic ! In my opening paragraph I alluded to a composer ? Mendelssohn ; for , as I ponder his case and that of Longfellow , I find between them a quite predicable parallelism : in their lives and works , the places which , in their respective pantheons , they occupy , and , above all , the " distinction " which , in Olympian estimation , they enjoy ? or , rather , lack ! It is not , necessarily , complete , for such parallels never can be ; still , the seeker for similitude will not fail to discover it should he compare the music of Mendelssohn with the poetry of Longfellow . Both are characterized by a spontaneous purity , sincerity , and sweetness , an exquisitely poignant emotional sensibility , an innate serenity and inimitable because quite unaffected grace ; by fineness of fibre , delicacy of timbre , and instinctive avoidance of things repulsive and repellent . Both poet and composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable for the ease at which they sustained themselves at their own levels and the rarity with which , appreciably , they fell below them . Each is devoid of eroticism but instinct with love , as we contrast it with the implications of passion , though in this respect Longfellow 's range is wider and his touch more vibrant . As their accomplishments were similar , so also were their limitations ? limitations from which they themselves would never have presumed to claim exemption , for their unpretentiousness was complete , the " immodesty of genius " being foreign to their natures . Both also possessed extraordinary personal charm , and they remain incontestably among the bestbeloved makers of music and poetry that yet have lived . If this correspondance has never before enforced itself , take down your Longfellow and re-read " Voices of the Night " and others of those so familiar and so felicitous lyrics , and then once more scan the scores or harken to the audible music of " Songs without Words " ; turn again the leaves of " Evangeline , " " Hiawatha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " The Golden Legend , " and then recall the harmonies of the " Midsummer Night 's Dream " overture , " Fingal 's Cave , " " SeaCalm and Happy Voyage , " or " Elijah . " It has become one of the established canons of Olympian criticism to depreciate both the poet and the composer . But this depreciation , while it may be " distinguished , " can not degrade them ; because , happily enough , both Longfellow and Mendelssohn wrote , not for critics , but for lovers of poetry and music . It merely indicates , in the depreciators , a lack of sympathy , an insensibility , a delimitation , a sort of tone-deafness , for which they are , after  | all , most to be pitied . To the lover of Longfellow and Mendelssohn , it may become rather tiresome at times , and rather sad ; until he remembers that nowadays the beaker of art is not dipped , ordinarily , into the Castalian spring , but filled from a siphon ? or even from a beer-pump ! There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brim and something ( usually bitter ) beneath , to be gulped down at a single swallow lest it gag the thirsting ? soul I was going to say , but perhaps throat would be more accurate . There is also a great deal of fizz and foam in what I may call the Neo- or Beyond-Olympian criticism now flourishing ; to one of whose oracles we owe the statement ( in a brand-new volume of superior finality ) that Longfellow 's voice is that of ? " a barrel-organ " ! An example of tone-deafness not so piteous as it is out of all whooping . The Olympian ? or , more correctly , the Brahminical ? critic is much given to fulminating against those who discuss one of the arts in terms of another . To him music , let us say , is music , and poetry is poetry , and it is quite a monstrous thing to mix or mingle them in any way . But one making no pretensions to the critical estate , who began writing about a poet by referring to a musician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be recalled , then , that Hans von Billow , who was , in his early career , one of the original Wagnerian propagandists , and , in his latter days , was among the first to hail with enthusiasm the compositions of Richard Strauss , pronounced Mendelssohn 's " Songs without Words " as immortally classical as the lyrics of Goethe . Similarly , I chanced to read , not long ago , the verdict of a critic of like breadth and catholicity , who pronounced the lyrics and sonnets of Longfellow the most enduringly classical poetry to which America has yet given birth . I am well aware that the use of the adjective " classical " causes many people to see red , metaphorically speaking . That is , if I may be permitted a Celticism , they see something which they think ought to be red but from which , they imagine , all vestiges of color have carefully been removed and life replaced by petrifaction . Which is , indeed , most lamentable , most melancholy . Because , on account of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary sense , half their lives ! If they only knew what a classic , a true classic , really is ! How infinitely precious , how perennially pleasure-giving , how perdurably , thrillingly , sentiently alive ! Why can not they emulate Mr. Pennell , who finds first Pittsburgh and then the Parthenon subjects that inspire him to the production of masterpieces ? In Longfellow 's case it happens , as a further curious commentary , that this so purely and so surely " classical poet has been , since first his voice was lifted , the chosen singer of youth . If you will turn to the newly published volumoc of Lafcadio Hearn 's " Interpretations of Literature " ? an unexpected retrieval of gold and gems from the grave ? you will there find a chapter on Longfellow which , coming as it does from a man recognized as the finest literary artist identified with modern American literature and one of the finest ever identified with any , should give some of the depreciators pause ; so replete is it with reverence , with love , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does not love Longfellow is , in a vital way , deficient in poetical sympathy ; and that a man who , having loved Longfellow in his youth , afterward depreciates and sneers at him , is defective in his organization . To be sure , this was written some fifteen years ago , ? which , as time goes nowadays in the Garden of Poesy , is a very long while . Would Hearn 's rapport with Longfellow have found such unequivocal expression had it been granted him to survive another decade and witness what it has brought ? Was it his misfortune to pass from the literary scene before its poetical structures began to be erected in the Perpendicular Style ; before the gargoyle had become greater than the cathedral , the mascaron more than the vase ; before the organ was supplanted by the steam-calliope and the harp by the horse-fiddle ? Or was it rather incalculably his good fortune ? I will not pretend to say . But of this I am sure , ? that youth , in its essence , is unchanging , immortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always continue to love . And those of us who are so happy as to retain our youthfulness of spirit , our early sensitiveness and sympathy , to the " grand climacteric " and beyond , will continue to cherish the poetry of Longfellow in our hearts , irrespective of the dicta of Olympian criticism . For what is the necessity of " distinction " to that which we love ?  |
