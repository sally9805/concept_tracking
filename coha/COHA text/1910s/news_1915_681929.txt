txt The current issue of The Army and Navy Journal asserts that about fifty German submarines have been destroyed since the beginning of the war . The largest estimate from England  --  which officially never announces her successes in the submarine warfare , except where the capture of survivors makes it necessary  --  has been thirty-two . " We have it on authority which would carry conviction were we at liberty to mention it , " The Army and Navy Journal 's announcement says , " that nearly fifty German submarines have been sunk , captured , or destroyed by the Allies up to the 20th of July . " Colonel William C. Church . editor of The Journal , yesterday told a NEW YORK TIMES reporter that he had written the paragraph quoted and that he had trustworthy information upon which he based his statement . It came from an official high in the British Admiralty . Colonel Church felt constrained to keep his name a secret and believed that it would be unwise if more detailed information were made public . Tun NEw YORK TIMES London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine blockage , commented on the fact that it was the ninth day that it had been in effect , and said that , while the Admiralty had made no announcement of preparations to resist the undersea raiders , the public has been assured that it would be difficult for them to operate safely along the English and Irish coasts . Previous to this it had been announced that the German Government was worried over two submarines that were long overdue at their base . " It is feared they have been destroyed , " the dispatch ended . The partial text of a secret report from Cuxhaven to the German Admiralty on March 11 admitted that twelve submarines had been sunk or were missing , and it Was added that many of these were of the latest type . It was said further that a meeting was to be held on the next day at which it was to be decided whether or not the submarine warfare should be discontinued . On March 5 it was announced in London that four submarines had been sunk , the sinking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- U-15 , U-18 , and one rammed by the British cruiser Badger . On March 24 , in an air raid on Antwerp , a British aviator destroyed one submarine and badly damaged another , according to a special cable dispatch to THE TIMES from Rotterdam . A dispatch from Paris , published on April 1 , announced that the Ministry of War had issued a statement telling of the destruction of a submarine by a cruiser . Five days later it was announced , also from Paris , that a German submarine had been trapped in steel nets off the harbor of Dover . It was announced that these nets had been placed at the mouths of most of the important British and French harbors , and this was the first intimation of their use . The loss of seventeen submarines was reported to have been the cost of the blockade to Germany up to May 20 , and it was said that these had alt been lost since Feb. 18 , the day the blockade became official . There have been many reports of Individual losses since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successes won by swift motor boats armed with smah rapid fire guns against the undersea boats . Some of these pursuing boats , the American said , would travel fifty miles an hour . " Potting submarines , " said he , " is considered exciting sport among some of the sportsmen 1 have talked with , who do n't mind the danger so long as there is a chance of getting a crack at a periscope . Of course a well-aimed shot from a 3-inch rifle will put a submarine out of business just as effectively as a ton of metal from a 10-inch gun . " The Army and Navy Journal 's announcement coincides with a hint conveyed by a well informed Faaaiisn newspaper man in a letter to a friend here , received a few days ago . " By the way , " the letter said , " if anybody tries to talk submarines to you , just laugh at them . I do n't know just how kind the Censorship has been to the United States in this respect , but from all I hear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they will continue to get a few merchant vessels , there have been probably more German seamen put out of business by their submarines sinking , than there have been passengers and crews of their victims .
