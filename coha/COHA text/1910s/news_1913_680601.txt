txt C. L. Bardo , General Manager , and other principal operating octicials of the New Haven Railroad heard their methods criticised to-day before the Inter-State Commerce Commission 's Board of Inquiry , sitting in joint session with the Public Utilities Commission of Connecticut . The New Haven officials listened to statements from men who appeared as railroad experts that Charles 3 . Dougherty , engineer , who ran the train which caused the fatal Stamford wreck of last Thursday , never could have entered the cab of a well-ordered road ; that cars hauled in Dougherty 's train never could'have-got out of the station under the rules of most Eastern lines , and that the signal blocks of the New Haven road were set nearer together than good railroad usage would permit . The chief critic of New Haven meth ' ods was Patrick J. Langdon , for twenty-seven years a locomotive engineer on the Lackawanna , and now chief air brake Inspector for that road . He be , gan an investigation of the Stamford . wreck on the invitation of President Mellen of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locomotive 1,33S , " the death engine . " yesterday when Dougherty 's run was reproduced , and the air brakes failed to stop the train until it had passed the place of the wreck by four car lengths . He also was in the cab this morning when the engine was put toroug , h a " breakaway " test , in which the cars were separated from the locomotive when going ? sixty miles an hour . Before starting with No. 1,3:i8 , Mr. Langdon examined the engine , while the air brake experts of the Pennsylvania Road and the Westinghouse Company inspected the cars which had made up the second section of the Boston express on the day of the wreck . Langdon 's testimony was called for to bring out the result of the " breakaway " test . It will be followed te4morro* by evidence from the other experts invited by President Mellen to examine ' thetrain Dougherty drove into the wooden Pullmak - Car ' . - gkylaidr , t-kiliing -- six persons . - The Lackawanna expert 's findings , which were solidly against the New Haven management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose as Mr. Langdon was about to leave the stand and obtained permission to crossexamine him . Mr. Bardo attempted to defend the New Haven 's methods . The General - Manager admitted that on the unfitness of Dougherty for the passenger service Mr. Langdon had given irrefutable ? evidence . He announced his intention to revise at the earliest possible moment the rules under which Dougherty was qualified . He said he purposed to_the make it impossible for an engineer to qualify in the passenger service until he had at least three years of experience in through freight service . At . present , engineers on the New Haven qualify for through passenger service after a single year 's experience , that rule , according to Mr. Bardo , being peculiar to the New Haven and the Boston and Maine roads . The standard period for preliminary training in the freight service on other roads is from three to five years . Finds Brakes the Finest Type . Mr. Langdon testified he found the brakes of Engine 1.3:38 to be the finest type on the market . " I first looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he continued . " I checked up all the levers and found them in first-class shape . I examined the feed valves , air gauges , and reducing valves , and found them placed ideally for the convenience of the engineer . I found the air brake equip , ment in first-class shape . " But that statement I wish to qualify . When I examined the air pump , which was of an excellent type . I found it very dirty inside . The pump refused to work at first , and as we have to have it working before taking the engine out for a test I repaired it I found the pump valve was erratic . and I found that this was due to dirt under the diaphragm . " Q. ? And how . did that dirt get there ? A. ? Well . it ought n't to be there . After finding the valve was erratic , I supposed the dirt was due to packing used in the construction of the pump cylinder . That is , 1 supposed the surplus white lead and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a test to ascertain if my conclusion was correct , and I found a good deal of dirt . I removed it and placed the pump in working condition . Q. ? And what did you next do ? A .. ? I ordered a ten-pound reduction made to test the air brakes . When the air valve had been opened I walked back along the line , of cars to see how each of them was tak- ? I Mg the air . The Pullman car Centerdale was not responding to the brakes at all , found . - Q. ? And how were the other cars ? A. ? I went hack to the engine after observing the i'enterdale and ordered five pounds more of air reduction . As I received a signal indicating that the brakes still refused to work on this car I ordered still another five pounds . Then the Centerda.le 's brakes took hold . ? Q. ? And the air reduction in a usual braking operation on the road would not he sufficient to set this car 's brakes ? A ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Langdon testified that this one heavy Pullman car , if in the middle of a heavy train and left to drive the train forward without any brakes on , would push the train from 200 to 300 feet beyond the point where it would stop if the car 's brakes were operating . He said that in his opinion the Pullman car . Centerdale , which was the fourth car hack from the engine in the death train , had run without brakes Rntil Dougherty turned on the emergency , and that then the brakes caught with such force that they broke the train in two . It had been testified by Dougherty that his train parted at the fourth car shortly before the wreck occurred . The expert was asked if in his opinion it would have been possible to set the brakes of the Centerdale by any reduction of air of the degree engineers used in service . He answered the brakes could be induced " to do no braking whatever " under such conditions . Inter-State Commerce Commissioner McChord handed to the expert a volume containing testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish to ask you , " the Commissioner said , " after you have time to read Dougherty 's record , as given by himself , what you think of his qualifications to run a passenger express train ? " Mr. Langdon studied the page of testimony . " Why , such an engineer , " he replied , " never could get into a Lackawanna cab . I consider him entirely unfit " Q. -- And what would have happened to // EXPERT CONDEMNS NEW HAVEN WAYS // such an engineer on your road ? A. ? I would have kept him on the freight service for at least two more years . I never permit an engineer to qualify until he has been three years In the freight service . Q. ? Would you have permitted a green engineer to take out an express train on almost his first passenger run ? A. ? No . I never permit an engineer to take out an engine until he has been over the run three or four times in the cab as an observer . On his first run I require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all the points about the run . I ride with the new engineer myself whenever I can , and when I can not do so a foreman of engineers rides with him . Criticises New Haven Cars . " Some of those cars , " Mr. Langdon said , referring to the fatal second secition , " never could have got out of a Lackawanna station . We never would have permitted a car requiring a twenty-pound pressure to set the brakes to go out on the road . Mr. Langdon told about the long distances required by the Boston express to stop In yesterday 's brake tests . Q. ? Could the train have been stopped more quickly if the cars had had good brakes ? A. ? Yes . The questions turned to the signal blocks . H. W. Belnap , Chief Inspector of the Commerce Commission , attacked the New Haven system of blocks . " How far Is it from the distance or warning signal outside Stamford to the home signal , where a train ought to stop if both signals should be set against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,800 feet , " Mr. Langdon responded , " and in every test we made , ? except one , it required a greater distance than that to bring the train to a stop . " Q. ? In other words , If you had been running in service and had been warned of danger ahead only when you were close to the danger signals  --  a condition you would meet in foggy and rainy weather ? you could n't have stopped your train before running Into a car In the position of the Skylark ? A. ? No , we could n't have stopped . There was n't enough distance . Thinks Signal Blocks Too Short . Q. ? Do you think the New Haven 's block signals are too close together and that good railroading , would require a longer distance between them ? block signal system to be efficient always should allow more than ample distance between a distance signal and a home signal for a train to come to a full stop on an ordinary application of the brake . ' Q. ? And what distance would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 2,500 feet ? from 2,500 to 2,600 feet . Q. ? That is more than 700 feet greater distance than the New Haven block at Stamford contains ? A. ? Yes . It would be a good , safe practice to operate at . the greater distance , and safety is what we want . Safety is the first consideration in deciding about signals . Q. ? Which should you prefer in actual railroading , a good engineer and poor brakes or an engineer with poor judgment and good brakes ? A. ? I 'd take the engineer with good judgment and the bad brakes . An engineer with good judgment can get a lot of results , even with bad brakes , while a bad engineer is bound to get Into trouble , no matter how good his brakes are . Commissioner McChord expressed curiosity about the pin from the brake lever ' which became detached in yesterday 's eighth test . He asked if it had been found or if any one knew when it was lost . Mr. Langdon said he did n't know it was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test " of yesterday . A. ? And what happened when you broke the engine loose from the cars after replacing the pin this morning ? A. ? The cars stopped more rapidly than the engine . They stopped from 61 miles an hour in 23.4 seconds . The engine ran 27 seconds , and made a gap of 196 feet between itself and the cars . Tries to Clear the Company . General Manager Bardo asked questions intended to exculpate the New Haven as to its signal system . Q. ? Do n't you know , Mr. Langdon , that an engineer familiar with his run ought to know how to make a scheduled stop without any reference to signals ? A. ? Yes : that is so . An experienced engineer ought to know his landscape and tracks well enough to come into any known station under complete control , regardless of signals . Q. ? Then is n't it all right to place a warning signal close enough to a home signal so that a stop can be made after it is seen ; that is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be seen to the home ? A. ? Well , an engineer with good judgment and good brakes could operate under such a system , but good judgment and good brakes do nt ' always come in pairs . Q. ? Do n't you think a prudent manager would trust an engineer of Dougherty 's experience with a passenger train ? A. ? No : I do not . Mr. Langdon brought out that Dougherty , on his fatal run , set his brakes at the emergency 1,971 feet before his train stopped and that this run carried him the entire distance between the distance signal and the home signal and 171 feet beyond the home signal . Next to Mr. Langdon , the chief witness was Dougherty . He faced 160 men , most of whom were railroad operators , and many of whom were his direct superiors in the New Haven system . There was none of the sympathetic treatment such as was given to him in the inquest . Dougherty trembled when he faced the lawyers for the New Haven road . He told substantially the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but added a phrase to the instructions given to him by John Francis Carroll . the traveling engineer , who coached him before he first drove 1,338 . " Carroll said to me , " Dougherty testified , " For heaven 's sake look out . brakes rakes are not holding , and Harmon got It yesterday for going past South Norwalk . And watch the water valves They 're out of order , and Bardo 's raising holy hell . " Dougherty was too nervous to talk at length . After trying in vain to hold his quivering knees still with his hands , he was excused for the day . Swears To Crossed Signals . John Harmon , the suspended engineer , who ran past a stop with 1,338 on the ' Monday before the wreck , testified that he had encountered a distance signal reading " Go ahead , " only to find himself rushing at full speed on a home signal set at " Stop . " Although New Haven officials had asserted that condition was mechanically impossible , Harmon insisted he had encountered the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . Charles N. Joy , airbrake expert of the New Haven road , questioned as to the signals , admitted for the first time since the wreck that the condition Harmon described was possible theoretically . Records kept by tower men at Stamford and Glen Brook , east of Stamford . were introduced to show that Dougherty approached Stamford at ninety miles an hour . Dougherty Insisted that the clocks from which his time was taken had no second hands . That finally was admitted by the tower men , who explained the records were made roughly as trains pa , ssed and were not meant to show the exact running time . Jerry O'Connell , a New Haven engineer , called for the company , testified he had driven Train 53 , the Boston Express second section , on the day of the wreck , from Boston to New Haven , and there had turned it over to Dougherty . He said the engine worked perfectly . Dougherty whispered to Mr. Doherty of the Commerce Commission 's counsel , The lawyer asked what engine the witness was describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I brought the train to New Haven , I but I had another ! connotive . Dougherty. was the first man ? that day to use 1,338 . " It was 1,338 that smashed the Skylark . Stna.rt Waite , New . Haven engineer , r testified he looked over the brake equip , ment of Dougherty 's train right after the wreck . " I found two cars with good brakes . " he said , " and three with bad brakes , but not any worse than we usually get . You ca n't have perfect brakes in this business , you know . T found one car with the brakes not working at all . " Waite admitted he 'd hate to stake his life on stopping any train between the distance signal at Stamford and the home signal . The commission 's hearing will be eon , tinued to-morrow . Coroner Phelan 's inquest is to be resumed on Friday .
