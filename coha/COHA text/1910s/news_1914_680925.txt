txt LITIGANTS AS JURORS . A Class That Should Be Made to Do Its Share of Court Service . With commendation of what P.obert W. Amick has to say on " Jury Service by All , " I would add that it would be well , in exercising the " dragnet " for eligibles , to do so with particular regard to the citizen . of the litigious class . Here I , for instance , have been performing jury service since the early nineties , and yet I ani of that type of citizen who would rather pay a lawyer to keep him out of court than get him in , even on a splendid chance of winning . My experience has made it plain to me that there is a vast amount of litigation in our courts over questions that could readily be settled between the contending parties , if they would employ able counsel and " get together " for a settlement . I know that the Juror 's function is to pass on questions of fact only , but why ca n't these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and letting them reach a determination , as against " beating about the bush- " in- court , to the exhaustion of every one 's patience ? Are the lawyers themselves responsible for it ? While I appreciate my duties as  --  a citizen , I am settled in the belief that I have already been compelled to shoulder a greater burden of Jury duty than should have been placed on me under the circumstances . Let the Commissioner of jurors consult the court records of parties to suits , and " nali " those fellows wherever he can find them . Besides , I think that there would not be Bo much evasion Of jury service If a fairer degree of consideration were accorded to talesmen . Moreover , the period of liability should be limited to , say , twenty years of any man 's lifetime .
