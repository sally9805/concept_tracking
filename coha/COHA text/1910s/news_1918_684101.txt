txt Announcement is made in the Mexican press that Henry Ford of Detroit has submitted a play to President Carranza of Mexico for the establishment in that country of an extensive and complete plant for the manufacture of tractors for agriculture purposes . The plan is to educate Mexican mechanics in the Ford plants in this country and then return them to their own land to overate the factory there . The nrincioal object of the Mexican factory will be the manufacture of tractors , which will be sold to farmers practically at cost and also on terms which will allow them to be paid for from the increased crops made possible by the use of the modern machinery . At present those wishing to buy tractors are met by the necessity of paying heavy freight , import and other charges , commissions , etc . All this will be obviated by the manufactory in Mexico and the tractors and other machinery will be sold for much less of profit that may be made in this enterprise will remain in that country . Stringent provisions will be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . While after his death his descendants will be required to follow the same policy . It is the intention of Mr. Ford to invest several millions in this enterprise  --  whatever sum may be necessary te put it upon a successful footing from its inception . No idea has been given as to the probable location of the manufactory , but it will , of course , be at some point where rail transportation is convenient , as where oil , coal , iron and other essentials be readily procured .
