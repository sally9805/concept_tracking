txt The Chamber of Commerce approves the declaration of its leading committees that the United States is abandoning its moral leadership of the world by its conduct during our " crisis of morals and trade . " Like good men of business , they put morals first , and therein mark the contrast between the characters of the leadership of business and of labor . If there is one thing surer than another , it is that business has lost its control of legislation to labor , and it is only necessary to call the roll of recent statutes to discover that they are distinguished by marked deterioration of quality , being motived more by interests than by regard for good conduct . A large number of conspicuous statutes have for their object the procuring of advantages for some at the cost of others , or of procuring for some exemptions from rules of conduct which are fastened on others . The eight-hour law , the rural credits law , the workmen 's compensation law , the grain anti-gambling law , the Clayton trust exemption law , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage rather than of the regulation of conduct . It used not to be so , when our morals were sounder , and character profited a man more than property in the opinion of his fellows -- all that makes life worth living for most , even now . According to the Mayflower compact of 1620 , our forebears " in ye " presence of God and one another cove " nant and combine ourselves togeather " into a civill body politic for our better " ordering * * * and by virtue hereof to " enacte , constitute , and frame such just " and equall laws , ordinances , acts , con " stitutions , and offices from time to " time as shall be thought most meete " and convenient for ye generall goode " of ye Colonie , unto which we promise " all due submission and obedience . " " Just and equall laws for ye generall goode of ye Colonie . " Rich and poor could unite on that program . We take some of our laws from our unions nowadays , in good quantity , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality , or " ye generall goode " ? How does that test apply to the coal strike , or to the steel strike , or to any of many strikes in which the peace is broken to keep men from working in the production of necessaries at a time of waste and want , and both in unusual degree ? Last week THE TIMES gave a half page to the Federation of Labor 's formal response to the Republican Chairman 's request for a program of " reforms . " It is amazing that they appear such to our largest and in many respects best combination of labor . There is not on the list ' one which does not seek something for some at the cost of others , the cost being greater in morals than in money . Often the reform is phrased in words which would command assent if the thought were not negatived by the application of the formula to current events in a manitar to shock those not blinded by selfishness rather than regard for " ye generall goode . " For instance , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have now " reached a period of civilization when " human rights should be placed above " property rights " ? Yet there is more sound than sense in the formula . Even the beasts of the jungle recognize that property is a right , and will defend their own with their lives . The protection of property by law is a human right as distinguished from the right of might in the forest . The property of man in himself and his right to dispose of his labor power is a fundamental human right , ?  --  but it is denied by those who would re'fuse it to all but themselves , a faction in the minority of a class . The world would be relieved of its wants in great degree if all men were free to work , under the law , for " ye generall goode . " Second among the reforms is a demand for an administration of law in class interests , and repeal of , whatever restrains the activities of labor leaders . It is alleged that our laws " forbid the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and that " when a speaker in union meetings " is responsible for utterances which only " a fool or knave would make , then the " entire membership is held responsible " in damages for such an individual " wrong or indiscretion. ; and when a " strike takes place , then the law affords " an easy way to rob the union and its " members of all their funds . " The reference is probably to the injunction against the use of the funds of the coal strikers ' union for the assistance of those in conspiracy to freeze their countrymen . Or perhaps the reference may be to the fact that the present strikers have been found guilty of conduct hostile to " ye generall goode , " and have been compelled to lodge security of $800,000 in Liberty bonds to answer for the damages they caused , thus putting human rights of the unionists above the property rights of the rest of their countrymen ! For the protection of such rights the Federation would abolish the injunction process , which is for the protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human rights . How is it possible for these ideas to be phrased without notice that capitalist and labor combinations ' are both lawful when reasonable , and that the law has been enforced more harshly against capital than against labor ? How is it possible for labor not to see that the injunction process is not a declaration of the personal will of the Judge , but is the assertion of law , and at the present moment is under appeal as to its lawfulness ? How many times has labor been challenged in vain to cite cases of wrong done by injunctions , and how often has the use of the process prevented irreparable injury , as by the suffering resulting from the deprivation of fuel in the Winter ? There is not another nation so offending against good morals as ours , and making a merit of it in the manner of the unions , and with similar inconsistency in words and deeds . There are leaders enough in the cause of interests , but there is a dearth of moral leaders such as have abounded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dollars together in the manner of those who , seeki ; : g to save their lives , lose them . Americans who would save themselves from shame and detriment can best do so by dissociating themselves ? from the descendants of the Pilgrims who are so unworthy of the Mayflower traditions .
