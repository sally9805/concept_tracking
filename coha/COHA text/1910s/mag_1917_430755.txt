 | WHY " must the world be made safe for democracy , " as President Wilson demands ? Is Germany the enemy of democracy the world over , and therefore the enemy of the American people ? The many asking this question have a right to a frank answer from every man who , like myself , has urged our entrance since October , 1914 , and looks on our share in the war as our greatest service to humanity , great as have been the services of the American people to man for 142 years . Democracy has been safe enough here through all that span and spreads the world over . What quarrel have we with the German people ? None ! A tenth or more , perhaps a fifth , of our population is drawn from it , directly or indirectly . No factor has been more wedded to liberty than our German communities and our German newspapers . They saved Missouri to the Union . They furnished a larger share of foreign-born in the army of the North than any race but the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; their literature has raised our stage to a new level in the discussion of moral and social problems ; their capacity for organization and efficiency has become the world example . In the great hazard of war , which in many ways is the final test of humanity , in the highest and the lowest , the German staff and German armies have made all the rest of the world seem like amateurs . Why does the world need to he made safe for democracy ? Why is Germany the enemy of freedom ? Because in the last sixty years Germany has put its soul in pawn to the Imperial German Government . The Reichstag , little more than a debating society , has just sought to free the soul and will of Germany from the imperial pawnshop by demanding the right to pass on the terms of peace and to secure the responsibility of the Kaiser 's ministers to the representatives of the people . Both efforts have failed at start . They must succeed , if the world is ever to have lasting peace which the safety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking peace and an imperial world in the heart of Europe always ready for war , as the first law of its being , can not live together . As the Imperial German Government stands to-day it controls 170,000,000 armed for war as no territory ever was before , holding the world 's strategic center , between Europe and Asia and Africa . The German Kaiser , the Austrian Kaiser , and twentythree kings , princes , and dukes hold complete control of these people and this territory . It is the last fortress of privilege and despotism the world over . While it remains the world can not be made safe for democracy . Our institutions , national policy , and liberties arc in as much peril as any other land , and the proof of this is the policy and the act of the Imperial German Government under the present Kaiser , as I shall now show . GERMANY 'S " MASK OF DEMOCRACY " Down to 1848 , everyone believed that Germany would be the first of European continental lands to see liberty . In that fell hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the King of Prussia , rather than the Frankfort Diet , which spoke for a regenerated , self-governing Germany , and the best of the Teuton blood led by men like Carl Schurz left their native lands with a price on their heads to find freedom and great careers among us , ? men confidently believed that in the end Germany would be in the forefront of those who , to quote a great German , find " liberty in death for country . " But in 1862 Bismarck offered to Germany the first proof of what despotism could do by wrenching Schleswig- Holstein from Denmark and self-government , establishing the headship of Prussia in all the German land . For four years Bismarck was preparing in the Council Chamber and MVIoltke in the field for the physical supremacy of this headship ( 1866 ) at Sadowa . To do this it was necessary to refuse a Prussian legislature the constitutional right to control expenditure , a right and power on which democracy must rest and must defend or military despotism follows . To-day , in the midst of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reichstag is pleading for the same constitutional power denied in Germany for more than half a century . In 1871 , the next surrender was made . When the German Empire was proclaimed at Versailles , in the midst of the great triumph of the Franco-Prussian War , the constitution of this empire created a popular national legislature ( the House of Representatives , as we should say ) , a Reichstag elected by universal manhood suffrage . This was the mask of democracy which at that time imperial autocracy thought wise to wear . But the general power over the business and policy of foreign affairs and the decision on final national action in war rests in the Council of the States , the Bundesrath . The princes , not the people , choose this body , each sovereign in the German Empire selecting the representatives of his state , and the King of Prussia , who is , exofficio , Kaiser , controls this chamber , which governs the Empire and creates the German Government . Even our Senate has again and again betrayed liberty , but how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary lords of our States and the representatives of these lords controlled , through ministers and standing committees , the army , navy , tariff , excise , trade , within and without the empire , railroads , ports , telegraphs , finance , and foreign affairs ? This is the " Imperial German Government " against which we have in terms declared war , not against Germany or the people of Germany , but against the " Imperial German Government , " made of , by , and for the Kaiser , kings , princes , granddukes , and dukes , ruling by divine right and refusing all responsibility to the people or their representatives . For a decade this system was handled by Bismarck , on the whole , wisely . In 1878 he returned to the early traditions of his youth in foreign affairs , and , when Russia had beaten the Turkish Empire to the ground , called the Congress of Berlin , which , like the Congress of Vienna , held that it was not war , but the conference of the great powers of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater spoils of war were taken from Russia ; free Bulgaria was made ; Rumania and Serbia were given independence ; provision was made that , should there come again in the Turkish Empire , such dire massacres as in 1860 and 1876 shocked the world , Europe would step in and administer such territory by a gendarmerie , a police force paid by Turkey but officered by Europeans and responsible to the European concert of great powers for keeping order , and protecting the weak from Turkish and Kurdish massacre . Bismarck , the great figure of Europe of the nineteenth century , as many frank utterances show , personally believed that the great fabric he had constituted would in the end gravitate towards freedom , and he protested against taking Alsace and Lorraine from the French because he held that it would sow the seeds of endless hate and make violence the law and habit of the German people . But he who had forced others to yield to necessity in his turn yielded to military necessity . So always , when men and nations sell themselves for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in new concessions and the numbing of conscience , national and personal . But Germany , in spite of all , was uneasy , and it became necessary , as is the way in all descending from the high level of struggle and effort and forfeiting claim to better things , to drug conscience by material advantage . The German Government ( for the phrase sums as a whole all the forces of the lower nature of Germany during the three score years in which Germany has been losing its soul to find it again in the agony and fiery sacrifice of war ) had to provide those things which should make it to the material interest of the German people to remain subject to the German Government . The upper classes were already satisfied . They were composed of these two portions , among 65,000,000 ? the ruling houses of Germany , in all six or eight hundred men , women , and children , and the " Junkers , " or the old dominant aristocracy , and others , newer , the " Vons , " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half a million all told , were already satisfied . These had power and social supremacy , the task of governing not only sovereignties and small principalities , but had the controlling share in the government of the German Empire , which dominated Europe . There remained the new manufacturing and commercial classes which grew to greatness and surpassed all the boundaries of their home market in the decade from 1870 to 1880 ; and the vast laboring class , harder worked and less well fed and less well housed than any other in Western Europe and without life 's joyous joys , which mark the Latin races , partly from climate and partly from temperament . These two classes had to be satisfied for their loss of liberty by new material advantages . COMMERCE AS A BUTTRESS OF AUTOCRACY Foreign trade from a Germany divided into many and populous states had small protection . Behind the trade and exports of a united Germany Bismarck arrayed the diplomacy and the power of a great empire . When the Kaiser became a large shareholder in Krupp 's and led in subscriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by the rest of the Junker class , but he and those in this class could do far more under an autocratic system , which placed all the threads of power in the hands of their ministers and the organizations of the German Empire , as a whole , and in its units than could or would English ministers responsible to legislators in the House of Commons . Still more , this association of the new mercantile wealth of Germany , with its old ruling class , gave bankers and manufacturers , all associated in the same commercial enterprises , a new place in the sun of the new German hierarchy . Their educated sons went into the army . Those who remained in business became officers of the reserve . To be an officer of the reserve meant prestige , recognition , and a place in the Kaiser 's sunlight as Commander-inChief , and placed the political influence of this class on the side of the military and militant autocracy . It is difficult for the American , who looks on an officer as one of the servants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal dignity and importance which a banker or publisher felt if he were an officer in the reserve . The real thing , I found , on which one of the foremost publishers of Germany prided himself was not the revolution which he had worked in color-printing and in the issue of a great powerful , profitable illustrated journal , but in his position as major in charge of all the automobiles in Leipsic when called into military use . These associations made the entire business class of Germany , its kings and princes of industry , and the lords of great domains of factories , part of the system which supported not liberty , as the American and English business man always has , but autocracy . TAKING CARE OF THE LABORER For the artisan class , covering all labor , it was necessary to provide its special price . This was furnished in the labor legislation which established in Germany sick benefits , industrial insurance , and old-age pensions . These benefits for workmen were exchangeable between all the lands of Central Europe . A laborer or mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same autocratic shadow of a great power which made the life of a laborer easy and safe , but left him so that while he continued to cultivate socialist doctrine in theory he has never from the time this system was adopted been perilous to the established order . This mess of pottage provided for capital and labor , there was added in this amazing system an education which from the highest university professor down to the teacher in the smallest schoolhouse was under control . The whole fabric in training a nation , educating it , giving its ideas and ideals form and shape was placed in the hands of professors and teachers who were free to do everything but attack autocracy . EDUCATION AS THE HANDMAID OF KAISERISM Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen issued thirty years ago a life of Goethe , on which I wrote a review which brought us in close touch . It had been published in German , and I asked him as to its success . He told me that when he went to Germany he received a polite invitation to come to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussia and found the minister at his desk with a copy of the volume in his hand . " This , " said the minister , " we feel is the best life of Goethe that has been written , but there are two chapters in it HOW THE GERMAN EMPIRE HAS MENACED DEMOCRACY 165 which dwell upon the liberal views of Goethe , which we all regret , which he would never hold to-day , which have no real part in his life as a whole . If you will take this volume , leave out these chapters , or rewrite them so they are not a republican propaganda , I will put it into our schools wherever there is a course in literature . All the other units of the Empire will follow , and Austria will probably do the same . " Boyesen said to me , " I looked at him as he sat there in his undress uniform and I realized I was face to face with the military power of a great country stifling freedom , and I told him as politely as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it was copyrighted in Germany and by other countries of the Geneva convention , I knew that the minister could not alter it ; but the dream of royalties which would have meant to me a competence for life , if this book were once made a text-book , which came before me when I saw my volume in his hand , vanished . " A decade after the Congress of Berlin , until the present Kaiser " dropped the pilot " ( Bismarck ) and began his own personal policy whose end has opened the hell of war for all the world , the German Government continued as it had in the Congress of Berlin . It followed the view that peace could be best secured by using the united power of Europe in due course to preserve from massacre and rapine lands where these things came . As a European country , it did its part to develop lands which were stagnating , and to nourish the growing free states of the Balkans , thriftily furnishing them , in Rumania , Bulgaria , and Greece , with kinglings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the same steps which had won for Austria the two provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina were able to secure its free avenue of trade across the Balkans to Salonica . THE TEMPTATION TO EXPLOIT COLONIES No one would be foolish enough to say , or idiot enough to think , that either the present Kaiser , or his succession of ministers , or the Junkers of Germany had any deliberate plan between 1890 and 1900 , when the new regime opened , to mine the fair and promising heights of European prosperity , and store the mine with explosives , which rent all asunder in August , 1914 . Men can plan good lives but they are led into bad lives by the unconscious pressure of the temptations to which they yield step by step . At the moment when Bismarck left , the Kaiser , his ministers and the ruling class of which he was alike the head and fountain of promotion , had placed before them a new and singular temptation . Leopold of Belgium , flagitious in his personal life , was the thriftiest business man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gotha ? long thrifty princelings . He organized the Congo Free State , and while the United States refused to be a party to the convention which created it in Berlin in 1885 , this country was the first to recognize it as an independent state . Belgium paid for developing this state , but the subsidiary companies which Leopold organized reaped the profits . Several of these companies for years together paid dividends of 100 per cent . wrenched from the illfated inhabitants of the Congo basin , who were slave-driven , mutilated , murdered , and visited with rapine and desolation so that the shareholders in these companies , many of them members of the ruling class of Germany , might make these profits . At the very time , when Africa came up for division , when the Ottoman Sultanate was passing to its end and China in the welter of battle between the moribund government of Peking and the militant autocracy of Tokio , there sprang up in this way before the class which had more weight and influence than any other in the destiny of Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploited , profits untold might be extorted from new tropical colonies . I do not say that this was the cause of the change of German policy , but I do say at the very time when the German imperial machine came first to have a colonial policy , this temptation was spread in the path of those who could decide in what direction its policy should be directed . Whether , as was laid out in the Congress of Berlin by the creation of new autonomous principalities , and the independent developments of all lands and peoples , or by their exploitation . Europe had in 1775 22,000,000 square miles of colonies . When the Congress of Vienna met , in 1815 , this whole system had gone to pot . The settled colonies over which Europe had control had sunk to less than 8,000,000 square miles , even when one added the desert waste of Siberia , and the waste , desert and deserted , of Australia and British  | North America . The total colonial area in 1815 was not much over one-third of what Europe had controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial system of their day . Between 1815 and 1878 , from the Congress of Vienna to the Congress of Berlin , the total colonial area of Europe increased some four million square miles in sixty-three years . Between the Congress of Berlin in 1878 , and the breaking out of the present war , the area of the colonies of Europe more than doubled , gaining 13,000,000 square miles , reaching 26,000,000 square miles , and left nothing which was worth having in the future except three great areas ? the Ottoman Empire , the Empire of China , and Latin America , from the Rio Grande , south , in round numbers about 8,500,000 square miles . This was about all that was left when the present war broke out as a possible field for exploitation , and of these two fields one the United States had guarded under the Monroe Doctrine , and it had pledged its efforts to preserve the " administrative entity " of China . In other words , the future of German colonial exploitation necessarily led along paths which would bring it into collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points in our foreign relations . This was inevitable . If one great liberty-loving power is steadily bent , as President Wilson declared ' of the United States , and as has been our national policy , on preserving all small states , giving them a chance for their future and their liberty , and another great autocratic power believes in their exploitation it will inevitably result that the autocracy will be led into situations where it faces , and is certain to come to the verge of , a collision with a people loving freedom for itself and for all the world . The first collision came early . In 1889 a difference arose as to the possession of the Samoan Islands . A harbor was ceded to us in 1872 , and in 1878 this concession was confirmed . In 1889 , the fleet of the German Government , three vessels , a single American vessel under odds of three to one , disputed the administration of Samoa . Suddenly in spring , , there flashed around the world from Auckland the message that collision had come . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed extremely probable that he would look on the odds of three to one as about a fair fighting chance between a German squadron and an American crew , commanded by an IrishAmerican . THE SAMOAN CASE The Information Bureau of ' the Navy Department made a careful examination , and its chief told me that this left no doubt in his mind that the report originated after a launch from Samoa had reached Auckland , and its crew given no shore leave until there had been twenty-four hours of cabling with Berlin , when the crew ashore spread the report because Berlin wished to test American feeling . Those with keen memories will remember that the whole country flamed from San Francisco to New York , and the German-American press was as explicit as any part of our newspapers in declaring that there was only one course for the United States , and not the one which Berlin had hoped would be taken . Here was Germany , which had been our earliest friend in Europe under the Great Frederick , to whose universities thousands and thousands of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more influenced by Germany than any other ; which had contributed to our population from the early German immigrants two centuries ago to ' the present time next to Britain and Ireland , whose heroes we had harbored , whose literature we had read and studied earlier than England , whose art in the Dusseldorf School personally influenced us for fifty years , and towards whom every American had an affectionate regard , coming to the very edge of collision with us twenty-eight years ago by methods carefully recorded in " A Footnote of History , " by Robert Louis Stevenson . IN THE FAR EAST The beginning of the last decade of the nineteenth century ( 1890-1900 ) saw the partition of Africa , and the last time that the nations of the world looked out on a peaceful prospect was when , on the completion of this partition about 1893 , Lord Salisbury pointed out that for the first time in the history of the world a continent inhabited by savages unable to govern themselves had been divided without war or collision ? an omen , he prophesied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there came the war between Japan and China , ending in the collapse of the latter , and Germany , departing from its previous policy of abstention in the East , began negotiations which brought Russia , Germany , and France to- gether for the last time , disappointing Japan of the fruits of war , and reorganizing Manchuria on a basis which was certain sooner or later to bring war between Japan and Russia . So the first entrance of the German Government in East Asia was a preparation for hostilities . War between Russia and Japan became inevitable and came a decade later , in 1904 . France was left with distrust of both Japan and China . Aggression on China was encouraged . Germany , in 1897 , seized Kiau Chau , came into control , in part , of two hundred square miles and nearly two million of people , and laid a future claim to Shantung , as reprisal for two German missionaries , ? the highest ruling quotation for missionaries , as the Paris Temps said , since St. Paul left Damascus to begin missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the embassies at Peking safe , and the other powers were seeking peace , Germany , at Pau-ting-fu , inflicted a horrible " punitive expedition " which preceded and exceeded all the Belgian horrors . " Has there not been , " said an American general in Peking to the ranking officer in command of the German troops , " a recrudescence of medieval atrocities ? " " Recrudescence ? You may think so , " was the reply ; " they have never ceased in Europe . " The Kaiser had told his troops as they went to leave their mark on China . From this time the whole influence and power of the Government of Germany has been used to disorganize the Chinese Empire , and the last record of the policy of an autocratic power , always opposing the development of free institutions , has been the proof within a month that the attempted restoration of the Manchus was financed from Berlin in order to make East Asia unsafe for democracy . ARMENIAN MASSACRES UNPUNISHED BECAUSE OF GERMANY This is the necessary position and action of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present or prospective , is perilous . In the fall of 1895 there came the first Armenian massacres in Turkey . The massacres in 1860 in Mt . Lebanon and Damascus , and in 1876 in Bulgaria , had been punished by Europe . The Treaty of Berlin pointed the way and named the method , . a police force organized by the European concert and officered by some lesser power , to preserve order and secure justice . The major crime of the Armenian was not that he was a Christian in a Moslem community ; but a man who had been taught by American missionaries and in American colleges to love liberty and seek it . To the amazement of the world , Sultan Abd-elHamid went untouched . When Dr. George Washburn , the great American who , as president of Robert College at Constantinople , had created free Bulgaria , asked Lord Salisbury why nothing had been done the Premier of England answered that he had to choose between a general European war or leave the Armenian massacres unavenged because of the position of the German Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a war would bring he stayed his hand , terrible as it was to leave unavenged the slaughter of fifty thousand men , women , and children . DEMOCRACY UNSAFE IN THE NEAR EAST The descendant of Lord Burghley , who had faced the might of Spain to protect the Netherlands from massacre , only postponed the European war to be waged by a Kaiser grown in power and the officers of that Kaiser , who had befriended the worst and most bloodstained tyrant of our day , have in the past two years suggested , watched , and abetted the deportation and death of 800,000 Armenians , whose one crime was their obstinate support of liberty and their loyalty to their ancient faith . While the Turkish Revolution stood for freedom , Berlin opposed it . When the Turkish Revolution became a venal military despotism whose massacres of Armenian , Syrian , Arab , and Greek outdid the worst of a long succession of Sultans , the German Government was its friend , ally and supporter , furnishing army , officers , and treasure . Nothing could so thwart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the territory of the Ottoman Empire become safe for democracy . This territory holding the channels andthe coasts of the East Mediterranean is today the most valuable derelict drifting on the sea of current history . It has the only coal on the Mediterranean , the largest undeveloped oil wells in the Kerkuk fields , a vast store of copper and iron ore , the one territory near Europe which could raise at least 300,000,000 bushels of wheat , possibilities of cotton not elsewhere seen , and the control of the commerce of the East . German capital , representing the alliance of Junker and banker , gave Baron Hirsch the railroads of the Balkans . In 1900 , when  | England needed the Kaiser 's good-will to prevent interference in the Boer War , the concession for the railroad from Scutari , opposite Constantinople on the Bosphorus , to Baghdad and Bussorah was extorted from a reluctant Sultan . England yielded here and Russia was unable to resist . A treaty between the German Government and England , just before war came and only recently known , confirmed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf . To carry out this dream of an interlocking territory , German , Austrian , Hun , Bulgar , and Ottoman , from the Baltic and North Sea to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf , holding the Black Sea , the Bosphorus and Dardanelles , able in due time to wrest the Suez Canal from England by a land attack and " hold the East in pawn , " Armenians were massacred in 1895 and in 1915 . In 1897 Greece was goaded to war to find the Turkish army had been drilled and prepared for victory by Marshal Von der Goltz , sent by the German Government . Every plan for a gendarmerie , as provided by the Berlin Congress , to keep Macedonia in order was frustrated by the German Government . Austria , in 1908 , made Bosnia and Herzegovina integral parts of the dual Empire , the Balkans for twenty years were full of ravage , rapine , rape , battle , murder , and sudden death , and the four small self-governing sovereign states , Serbia , Rumania , Bulgaria , and Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger American States ) , which , twenty-five years ago , gravitated towards union , were finally brought to the double wars from 1911 to 1913 , marked by many signs that the German Government 's plan was- to bring them to 1914 exhausted , and force action by Russia which would precipitate a general European war . All this because the German Government could not afford to have democracy safe in the Balkans , unaware in the judicial blindness of autocratic ambition that the end was to be that democracy would be made safe in Russia . Wherever freedom drew near , there the German Government stood ready to smite . Our first collision came in Samoa . Through the decade that followed , the policy of the German Government had destroyed American college buildings in Turkey and opposed all our efforts to secure the preservation of the " administrative entity " of China and its " Open Door , " guaranteed by treaty and agreement between Japan and England , Russia , France , and the United States ? the last by an exchange of notes ? but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace was unrepented and therefore unforgiven . THE GERMAN FLEET AT MANILA When Admiral Dewey 's fleet was in Manila Harbor , in 1898 , after taking the city , the only fleet which did not salute our flag was the fleet of the German Government . It was heavier , gun for gun , than the American . Its attitude was so threatening that the English fleet under Admiral Chichester anchored between the two , ready to act . It was not the last time English and American fleets were to act together in defense of Freedom . In the judgment and on the authority of one of the few of those then on the ground and still living , who held high positions , no doubt existed in our fleet , our army or our civil administrators , that the Kaiser 's fleet had instructions to use any opportunity for action . The German Government extorted from us the Caroline Islands , now in Japanese hands , a serious addition to our future perils of the Pacific . When President McKinley came to a final decision on our retention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal message from Lord Salisbury , not through the usual channels , that he hoped the United States would keep the archipelago , because , if we did not , this German Government would take them and a general war would follow , since Japan and England would act . I say this on the authority of my life-long friend and for thirty years my beloved chief on the Philadelphia Press , the late Charles Emory Smith , then Postmaster-General . A " DEFENSIVE POLICY " Under President Roosevelt , the fleet of the German Government was so near seizing a port in Venezuela that Admiral Dewey was ordered to protect it at all hazards and the German Government given forty-eight hours in which to submit its claims to arbitration . The island of St. Thomas had been the subject of negotiation by the German Government and we therefore bought it . Brazil was apprehensive last January - that in the end Holland would yield its unprofitable share of Guiana to the German Government and therefore her fleet to-day acts with ours . The Cuban rebellion was the work of the agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Foreign Minister ,  | to Mexico , is recent and familiar . Chile , the only Latin land not finally friendly to the Allies , has the least of democracy in its administration of any South American state . Not even in Latin America , protected by us so long under the Monroe Doctrine , is the German Government willing that democracy should be made safe . This is the record of the German Government . Even our effort at the Algeciras Conference to give Morocco one last chance for independence and development by a Swiss gendarmerie to preserve order , was opposed in the conference and later was frustrated by the subsequent policy of the German Government . This policy harried France , humiliated her before Europe , forced the resignation of Delcasse , the Foreign Minister , who foresaw this war , and used every means at home and abroad to persuade the world that democracy had failed in the French Republic . No one to-day doubts that the Imperial German Government was fomenting strife and paying for sedition through all the stormy years before the war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperous democracy . Our sister republic stands to-day the glorious proof of what democracy can do in war as well as in peace . The Imperial German Government could not afford to have democracy safe in France , and during peace mined its very soil and laid its concrete gun emplacements on French territory to destroy French democracy . Wherever liberty and self-government appear , the world around , the Imperial German Government has been its foe for a quarter of a century . Even in our land it has spread its net of espionage to bring disorder , violate law , and discredit democracy . When the collision came at last in 1914 , the preparation of the German Government to destroy self-government was clear . With 30 per cent . of the population of warring Europe , the Teutonic alliance had 45 per cent . of the fighting force . For a " defensive " war , it had ready 12,500,000 rifles , kits , and uniforms , or three times the number in Russia , France , and England . For five years 60 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosives . The capacity of the munition works in Germany was equal to that of all the rest of the world , and Austria , less in the public eye , was preparing the guns which destroyed Liege and swept a path through Belgium . Preparations were made in this country by Germany on which I am not now at liberty to speak . " The world must be made safe for democracy . " Belgium held the gate while France made ready . France gave England . time and the two gave the Republic of the West time to prepare . It was because we had to choose between making the world safe for democracy with allies or fight the last great battle alone , that we entered the conflict . We had good reason . The German Government ordered us off the seas our fathers crossed to find liberty , and we are sending their sons across that sea to bring liberty to all the world . It would be little to win this war . We enter it confidently looking to a League to Enforce Peace in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the world safe for democracy . " In that task a new Germany , which has found again its soul in the failure and defeat of autocracy at the hands of the German people , will share , and we shall see again the - vision which may dawn at any hour of this night of war , the Germany of Kant and of Goethe , dedicated to a free mind in free states , the world around .
