txt Though the French , France Is as is well known by the Tired of readers of their best books and by visitors to Indecency. their best theatres , are not a prim or - prudish people , they , nevertheless , have a clear realization of the difference between justifiable frankHless of speech and the exploitation of indecency for the money there is in it . Whoever doubts this truth , as some are sufficiently ill-informed or prejudiced to do , would doubt it no longer if he could have heard a recent debate in the French Senate on the quality of certain speetacles presented on the Parisian I stage . Speaker after speaker declared intolerable the lengths to which certain managers have been going and resented as a national disgrace the failure of the police to suppress the vile shows which , they said , gave a wholly false impression of French character to the foreigners who formed the great majority of their patrons . t Several of the Parisian papers have promptly taken the side of decency , and the comments of Le Temps are especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not only ignoble ; they are stupid , and they make no appeal to " the true Paris , which knows how to work cheerfully and to amuse itself with good taste . " M. ARTHUR MEYER , the dramatic critic , writing in the same paper , also laments the tendency to substitute the nude for ingenuity of construction and originality , and rather ruefully tells of an attempt made by himself to turn the tide in another direction by writing and causing to be performed a play that would oppose to loose morals , free unions , and intellectual anarchy , something of restraint , discipline , and tradition . His play was not a success , but this , he insists , was because It lacked dramatic excellence , he having succeeded in making it ' a " good " play in only one sense , instead of the necessary two . Of course no dramatic work will succeed anywhere merely because its plot and characters are " respectable " and its " lesson " edifying . It may be all that and still be so dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . As M. ME Y ER writes : " The public has not responded to my call because I am only an amateur playwright . But let a professional of the new school , one who knows how to reform the French stage , put his dramatic powers to  --  the service of ideas that ought to be the atmosphere of the theatre and are demanded by all honest people  --  then the public will come . " As the House CornBut Salem mittee on AppropriaMust Not tions has refused to Go Hungry . report a bill giving $200,000 from the National Treasury for the relief of the people made homeless by the Salem fire , It is evident that other means of providing for their care must be promptly sought . The committee based its action on the not unreasonable ground that Massachusetts was a State able to supply the needs of its own unfortunates from its own resources . That same thought must have entered the minds of many , when the appeal for aid in behalf of Salem was first made , but after such a calamity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most is that instant assistance should be given in whatever happens to be the most convenient way . The majority members of the Appropriations Committee have taken a sterner view , and they have not been moved by the explanation offered for the failure of Massachusetts adequately to meet with its colossal wealth a not colossal emergency . The excuse made is that the State Constitution forbids allotments of State funds for such purposes . That excuse would be better if it were accompanied by an expression of deep and shamed regret that the State Constitution contains such a. provision and by a convincing promise to eliminate it as soon as possible . In that case the action of Congress would doubtless have been different . And , anyway , there is nothing in the Constitution of Massachusetts to prevent the inhabitants of its towns and cities not burned , including the innumerable manufacturers who , thanks to the tariff , have for many years exacted heavy tribute from the rest of the country , from giving as much as they please to Salem 's sufferers . Quite the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope news that has come from . Hammondsport of late is Appears , the announcement that the aeroplane America can fly more than fairly well with one of its two motors not running . Doubts as to the possibility of that have been many and grave , for , with one motor out of action , a two-motored aeroplane is subjected to pressures and strains that seemed likely  --  some said sure ? so seriously to disturb its equilibrium as to make flight Impracticable . In this instance , however , as in so many others , it seems to have been unsafe to say that a certain thing could not be done . Fact has an unkind habit of contradicting prophesy , arid the obviously impossible has never had or deserved as little reverence as in these days . Now that the America has flown with only one motor going , those of us who have expatiated on the insuperable difficulties in the way of taking astronomical observations from an aeroplane , and of finding ' the Azores with a. craft that can do terribly little hunting for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cassandraa.
