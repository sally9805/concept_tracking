 | AN experience as juror serving some half-dozen or more terms in State courts and two terms in the United States courts , covering some hundreds of trials , either actively engaged or as spectator , and principally in criminal cases , is , perhaps , a greater mishap of its kind than usually falls to the lot of the citizen . If it does not entitle one to speak with any degree of authority on the position of a juryman it at least suggests some topics for serious reflection , more especially as regards the juror 's relations to trials for crime . This paper proposes to present briefly a few of these . We are often told that " trial by jury " is the palladium of our liberties , the great glory of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence ; and it is hardly to be questioned that the founders of the American Republic considered the preservation of this principle as of the first importance . Alexander Hamilton devotes Number LXXXIII of The Federalist solely to a defence against the charge that the new Constitution neglected to guarantee jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to clear up any obscurity on this point it was found necessary for the first Congress to propose a number of amendments firmly engrafting the principle of jury trial upon American jurisprudence in order to secure final ratification of the Constitution by all the States . In theory , then , at least , the position of a juryman ought to be one of some special dignity , and certainly it is often one of great moral responsibility . So far as the observation of one man goes , the juryman with few exceptions enters the jury-box with a keen sense of his responsibilities and a conscientious and sober desire to do his duty in rendering even-handed justice . In jury room discussions I remember perhaps two or three cases , not more , where prejudice quite evidently ruled a fellow-juror 's judgment , several instances where sympathy blinded him to the demand of the law for a punitive verdict , but not a single instance where a @# suspicion of corrupt motive has remained . The juror seems specially to bear in mind ? more faithfully than either bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation goes ? that he is what his title implies , the sworn man . The juryman when summoned for court service is likely to have had little or no previous experience ; the majority are serving for the first time . He is brought into court under threat of punishment if he does not obey the summons ; he finds it difficult to be relieved of what is often ? perhaps usually ? a distasteful and inconvenient duty paid for at day-laborer 's wage ; if he wishes to proffer a request to be let off he must be presented by an attorney at the bar of the court for examination , make his plea and offer his excuse in respectful terms , and , as a favor , receive the mercy of the court or , perhaps , have it frowningly rejected by the judge , who sits towering above him while he stands below as an unsuccessful suppliant . Usually , I fancy , he is treated with courtesy , but sometimes it is scant and sometimes he meets impatient rudeness . There is the oft-told story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qualifications of a good judge , answered : " A good judge ? H-m , let me see : he ought to have good manners , a good temper , common-sense , and ? well , IT he knows a little law it wo n't hurt him . " No doubt these are qualities which go far to insure success in any walk of life ; but however it may be in England , it must be admitted that occasionally our American judges lack the first two qualifications , though , perhaps , I ought to say that I myself have never had personal cause of complaint and have the memory of much courtesy from the bench . Lapses from good temper are no doubt unconscious and simply due to some natural infirmity and the vexation incident to tedious routine work ; though it may be that a judge , especially a younger one , thinks it his duty to bear in mind the old German law which prescribed that he should sit " like a grim-looking  | lion . " Gentlemen of the robe have a weakness for precedents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the court 's peremptory summons finds little in his treatment to impress him with an idea of special dignity in his position , even if he has no overt cause of complaint . He is herded with his fellows , ordered about by the tipstaves or bailiffs of court , addressed in peremptory tones ; sometimes , if in his unfamiliarity he is going the wrong way , he is grabbed by one of these gentry of the badge and hustled as if he were the prisoner in the dock . He sits in the court room with an ever-present sense , if he be sensitive , that he must be careful not to get into trouble ; the feeling of liberty is gone , he is enveloped in an atmosphere of restraint . Really he is placed more on an equality with the prisoner at the bar than with the judge on the bench , yet he is as essentially a part of the court as that august potentate and may have at any time a greater responsibility imposed on him . In some court rooms , when disengaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the jury-box , the juror is often forced to sit among criminals , witnesses , loafers , and ill-smelling persons attracted to the court by business or curiosity ; though in some court rooms separate seats are provided for the temporarily disengaged jurymen . The juror is sworn to render his verdict according to the evidence submitted to him and the law in the case . In Pennsylvania , at least , by decision of the Supreme Court of that State , the jury is declared the judge of the law as well as of the evidence in criminal trials . By what fine-spun reasoning the administration of justice in civil causes may be considered to involve different principles , the special logic of the legal mind will no doubt discover ; but in criminal trials in Pennsylvania , if it is not so elsewhere , it would seem as if the Supreme Court has relegated the sitting judge to the position of a sort of presiding officer or chief clerk or upper bailiff , to keep order in the court and to see that the jury is not interfered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically directs the verdict , and perhaps commonly , and properly , influences it . The late Judge Waddell , a very able , upright , and fair-minded judge of a county court , whose agreeable personality made it a pleasure to sit under him , had some years ago a case of criminal libel sent back to him by the Supreme Court , on appeal , for retrial on the ground that in his charge he had instructed the jury that under the law as he expounded it a verdict of guilty should be rendered . I was present at the second trial and distinctly remember the opening words of his charge . " Gentlemen of the jury , " he said , smarting under an unaccustomed reversal , " I want first to say to you that in this case you are to judge the law as well as the facts . Do n't forget that ; the Supreme Court has so decided and that is the law in Pennsylvania . I repeat it , you are to judge the law . But ? you have sworn to render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to say that the best evidence you can have of what is the law governing this case is what I tell you it is ! " Whereupon he proceeded to lay down the law , the jury promptly convicted the defendant , who as promptly appealed again to the Supreme Court and was promptly granted a third trial . I believe he was finally acquitted or the case was dropped . There was no criticism by the Supreme Court of Judge Waddell 's interpretation of the actual law in the case , as I remember it , but simply that he was overstepping his authority when he imposed his interpretation on the jury . The Supreme Court 's decision still stands , and is recognized theoretically as law ; yet perhaps cases might still be appealed successfully on the ground that it is ignored . It would seem too plain for argument that judges should not set an example of evasion of law . In a recent murder trial in Tennessee , a cause celebre , the judge took a very remarkable course . When the time came to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the episode : " The law makes the judge the witness of the law , ' remarked Judge Hart , so I will now take the witness stand and give my testimony . ' He left the bench , walked around to the witness chair which has been the centre of attraction for two months and began to read . " It is difficult to think of any more definitive way , aside from its spectacular features , in which he could have put himself on record , at this stage , as a mere witness in the case testifying before the jury as to the law , recognizing the jury as the real court having judgment of the law as well the facts . He could  | not have made clearer admission that the case in which he was engaged was a " trial by jury , " to use the old and familiar legal phrase . Lawyers , as other folk , sometimes use words loosely . One often hears of a judge " trying " a case , sometimes from his own lips ; the prosecuting attorney often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case ; the defending counsel says so , too ; but the theory of jury trial seems certainly to be that the one judges , the other prosecutes , and the third defends ; but it is the jury which " tries " ? " threshes " it out , " separates , as what is good from what is bad " in the first meaning of the word , or in the derived meanings , " puts to the test or proof , " " brings to a decision " in the retirement of the jury room . Probably in the majority of cases it is the opinion of the judge , so far as the jurors can gather it from his charge , which makes the verdict of the jury . Speeches of attorneys for prosecution or defence carry little weight in the retirement of the jury room , so far as my observation goes ; I recall only once that such a speech was mentioned in considering a verdict , and then a juryman arguing for the defendant criticized the man 's own counsel ! I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is listened to with grave attention , and his opinion , if it is at all indicated in the charge , is frequently referred to in the jury room when the case is doubtful . In all the many charges I have listened to there remains the recollection of but two that struck me as unjust ; and in general they have seemed conspicuously fair-minded . In one of these exceptions I was myself the plaintiff in the action , many years ago , so that hardly counts . In the other , I was a juror in a civil case , and the judge had an unfortunate infirmity of temper , due to ill health , which often caused him to scold and hector . It was excused by everybody on account of his high personal character and conspicuous ability on the bench . He was essentially a just man , universally respected , and with a quite unusual capacity for rendering justice ; but he always seemed to want to render it himself and to have no use for the jury unless he could not make up his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , a damage suit against a corporation , he charged the jury quite @# @# strenuously for the defendant ; but in spite of that the vote stood six to six when first taken and would certainly have shown a large majority for the plaintiff , if not unanimity , had it not been for the judge 's charge . Several jurors , indeed , expressed actual fear of punishment if the verdict should be rendered in accordance with their own convictions of justice and had to be reasoned with on that score . I think even then the verdict might have been a substantial one for the plaintiff , but after some hours the judge sent for the jury , heartily abused us collectively for not rendering his verdict , warned us not to " allow this jury to be dominated by one obstinate man " ? I fancy he had in mind a very quiet and innocent countryman who was scarcely opening his mouth in the jury room and was voting with the judge ? and finally sent us back with the announcement that he was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that the clerk would remain for an hour or so to record our verdict if we agreed on one . After that a judgment for the plaintiff was hopeless ; we were threatened with imprisonment for at least two days if we did not promptly agree , and with but a few minutes to spare the defendant corporation got its verdict . If ever an agreement was reached under coercion and " duress of imprisonment , " that would seem to be one . The counsel for plaintiff , learning the state of affairs in the jury room , which he did before we left court , took an appeal and got a retrial . The case was ultimately settled out of court , I think . This particular judge was rarely reversed on appeal ; he was a most worthy and estimable man , though inclined to be arbitrary , as United States judges often are . In this case , as in others where the judge rails at the jury , it would seem as if he were really guilty of that " contempt of court " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The judge ? and the lawyers side with him ? seems to think that he is " The Court , " sometimes so styles himself , and sometimes is addressed by that term , yet he is after all only a part of it , if properly the most considerable part , though the juror is as essentially a part , too . If a juryman should follow a bad example and scold , hector , and rail at the judge ? or anybody else in court for that matter ? he 88 Some Difficultie  | would promptly be committed for contempt . Really , it seems good logic to hold that if the judge ? one part of the court ? can commit for contempt a juryman ? another part ? the jury ought to have the same right to commit the judge when he offends ; though how they are going to enforce an order of commitment seems beyond conjecture . Speaking seriously , however , the whole question of a judge 's power to commit for contempt is somewhat vague . and a little inchoate after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedent , and it would probably be desirable to have it accurately defined by statute . In that one case , at least , I have known the fear of it powerfully to influence jurymen in joining in a verdict against their convictions . If that was a violation of their oath , if it was perjury , then it is hard to see why the act of the judge which brought it about was not subornation . In some civil causes the judge has a practice of issuing " binding instructions " to the jury to render a particular verdict where he is convinced the law would not justify any other . He may take the case from the jury by entering a nonsuit , but then a new suit might be brought on the same cause of action ; so , to settle the matter , he wishes a verdict , and as he can not render one himself and enter it on the record he instructs the jury to do it . Something very like that appears sometimes to be done in criminal trials as well . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the legal mind , which occasionally has a fondness for perversion of reasoning , will find plenty of argument to support it . But there is the juror with an oath resting on his conscience obliging him to render a verdict on his own judgment ; what is he to do ? Is he simply to obey orders ? As a matter of fact , unless he happens to be foreman , he never renders any verdict at all ; he is not consulted by his fellows and simply sits still while the foreman , under instructions from the judge , announces a verdict in which no one has taken a part except himself . Whether that is placed on the record as the free action of the jury I do not know ; if the fact that " binding instructions " have been issued is not recorded , it ought to be . To the lay mind it would seem clear that no sworn juror should consent to accept instructions from any one . And the whole proceeding is simply a convenience to save a few moments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the jury and send them out , they would come back at once with the proper verdict at least ninety-nine times out of a hundred , if not invariably . There is probably no miscarriage of justice from this practice , but as a short cut it seems unreasonable , unnecessary , arbitrary , and improper ; yet few practices are more firmly engrafted on court procedure . There is a case recently reported where a coroner , apparently wishing to shield the police from danger of prosecution for false arrest , forced his jury to accuse a particular person of murder when they had brought in an open verdict against " parties unknown , " which he declined to receive and bullied the jurors into changing it as he wished . The evidence , it may be said , was so slight that the person accused by the coroner was never even indicted , but was discharged on hearing . No judge in this country would dare to commit a jury for their verdict , though jurymen are sometimes afraid of it ; but verdicts have been known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurors dismissed from further service in disgrace . Sometimes judges openly show their disagreement with the conclusions of the jury in a way that does not tend to enhance respect for the jury system . I once heard a judge call back to the bar of a court a man who had just been acquitted and tell him that he need not think he left that court room in the character of an innocent man , even though the jury had pronounced him not guilty . And in another case the judge ordered the acquitted man back into the custody of the court while he inquired of the district attorney whether there was no way in which he could be tried over again . I was not in the jury-box in either of these cases , but from what I heard of the evidence it seemed to me both verdicts were just , and that it was not in good form to cast reflections upon them . In England it has been claimed that in theory jurors are even to-day liable to fine for bringing in a verdict " contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " though it is said that this is disputable and " certainly would never now be attempted in practice . " Before 1670 jurors who per- sisted in acquitting prisoners whom the judges wished convicted were often fined and imprisoned . In the celebrated case of the acquittal of William Penn and Mead , the presiding officer of court , the recorder , said to the jury , after they had been virulently abused during the trial : " I am sorry , gentlemen , you have followed your own judgments and opinions , rather than the good and wholesome advice which was given you ; God keep my life out of your hands ; but for this the court fines you forty marks a man , and imprisonment till paid . " They were discharged from Newgate jail upon habeas corpus and " their commitment was adjudged illegal . " Other cases of the kind were brought before the House of Commons , which resolved " that the precedents and practice of fining or imprisoning jurors for verdicts is illegal . " And " finally , in 167o , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the practice was contrary to law . " The same principle of law which protects jurors from punishment by fine or imprisonment when the judge thinks their verdict a perversion of justice , it would seem , ought to protect them as well from lesser punishment by scolding or open contempt . If their judgment is honest , even though mistaken , they are entitled to be treated with respect ; if they have entered into a conspiracy to pervert justice they should be indicted and tried as for any other crime . Scolding and openly manifested contempt is ill judged in either case ; it is either an inadequate punishment or it is unjust and improper . When the jury returns a verdict it is the judgment of the court ; and for the sitting judge to treat that judgment of the court flippantly or contemptuously because he disagrees with it tends to bring the whole system into disrepute . His plain duty is to do what he can to elevate the system of trial by jury so long as it is an essential part of our jurisprudence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for this state of affairs judges can not be held entirely guiltless . It is doubtless only the very few who commit improprieties , but the great majority of righteous judges have a power of influence if they would exercise it ; and it might be of profit to ask themselves why it is that when a man is obliged to serve as a juror many of his friends think it the same sort of joke as if he were arrested and fined for speeding a motor-car . It is hard to think of any more effective way to enhance the dignity of trial by jury in the mind of the public than by respect shown to the jurors in the court room ; and that is largely , if not entirely , at present in the hands of the judge . The general neglect to use unquestionable power for better things is more fairly a subject of criticism than the few instances of gross impropriety which serve to call attention to the weakness of the situation . It should not be hard for courts to increase popular respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time show themselves in suspicion of the courts . If jurors and jury service are not now what they should be , the majority of judges can effect a reform to higher standards , provided they honestly and earnestly believe in trial by jury as a safeguard of liberty and justice . Many of them are perhaps not altogether convinced of that , the pleasing platitudes of expositors of " AngloSaxon law " notwithstanding . It may be questioned whether the tendency is growing to take the system seriously ; one sometimes hears lawyers question its value and express preference for trial without jury . The question as to how a serious divergence of view in the jury room should be dealt with has presented much difficulty and has often been discussed . Experience in jury service does not seem to suggest any entirely satisfactory remedy ; and in practice it seems impossible to avoid at times some degree of pressure upon the minority to get on with the business of the court and avoid unreasonable mistrials . In civil cases , as in damage suits where the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury often arrives at a verdict by averaging the discordant estimates of its members ; but that is a crude method at the best , and no doubt is often abused . I remember once being foreman of a jury trying a suit against a telephone company for damaging some trees with its wires . The plaintiff , on the stand , thought his damage might be three hundred and fifty dollars . Personally I thought the injury insignificant , if any ; but the eleven other jurymen had no doubt whatever that a telephone company always injures trees or anything else at every opportunity . After general discussion I proposed that each  | juror should write on a slip his own estimate of the damage to be awarded . One slip was for nothing , one for five dollars , and I think one for twenty-five dollars ; but the average was some fifty dollars beyond the plaintiff 's own estimate ! On calling attention to this and that one slip contained the grossly excessive figures of six hundred dollars , the youngest juryman , who seemed a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that 's mine . I supposed it would come to an average and thought I 'd better put it high enough so as to make it all right ! " Perhaps some of those who made low estimates may have had the same idea . However , we settled on a hundred-dollar verdict rather than have a mistrial ; and I learned afterward that the defendant company was satisfied to get off so easy . While it thought it ought to have a verdict in its favor , it did not expect one . One of the counsel in this case was a woman lawyer , and tried her case admirably , though the jury found against her client . In criminal trials , especially for a grave offence , there is often much difficulty in arriving at unanimity . Few cases that are defended at all are so clear as to be beyond the shadow of a doubt ; and the line of cleavage is vague between what is " a reasonable doubt " to which the accused is legally entitled and the degree insufficient to acquit him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other that it is hard to draw the line . Human sympathy naturally plays its part ; not improperly , notwithstanding the legal theory that a juryman must attempt the impossible and dehumanize himself . It is , and ought to be , painful for a right-minded man to be obliged to send his fellow-creature to jail or to the gallows ; though I have rarely seen what seemed to me a miscarriage of justice from this cause . I have more than once , however , seen an obstinate man hold up a verdict for a long time where his sympathies were enlisted , but where there seemed no reasonable doubt about the guilt of the prisoner at the bar . In one case , a charge of burglary , where the guilt seemed to me clearly established , we were kept out all night by seven of the jury who insisted on acquittal , and the cause was apparently race prejudice . Three white men were being tried , and the main evidence was that of a negro accomplice , who had turned State 's witness , corroborated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me during the weary watches of the night , " I 'll never agree to send those white men to jail while that nigger gets off free ! " I fancy he would have made little trouble if the question had been to send all four to jail . Detective evidence seems rarely to receive much serious consideration in the jury room . In another case a white girl was accusing a negro of an attempt at felonious assault . Her own testimony showed that at the time of the occurrence there had been no thought of wrong on either side , but that what was merely a somewhat unseemly scuffle had been magnified by her parents into serious attempt at crime and that suggestion put into her head . Eleven of the jury in short order came to that conclusion , notwithstanding a little evident race prejudice ; but the twelfth juror frankly said that he wanted conviction simply on the ground that the accused was a negro . In fact , he had made that announcement at the noon lunch recess of court , before he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjournment for the night was at hand , the rest made a dead set at him and brought him in . Where one unreasonable man is holding up a verdict in which he ought to join , all sorts of pressure is often brought to bear and there appears to be no other way out . The judge locks the jury up indefinitely to force an agreement . In England , I believe , the jurors are confined in an unfurnished room , unheated in cold weather , and given neither food nor drink until they agree . They are starved out . Here they are fed and every reasonable effort is made for their comfort during this imprisonment , though I have had to sleep on hard wooden benches or chairs . Once , the only comfortable spot I could find was the judge 's highbacked chair , tilted back seductively on springs , with my feet propped up on a pile of law books on his desk ; we were not confined to one room during the night , but had the range of the court-house , under guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I told him he possessed the only berth in court suitable to a nap . He placidly replied , with his invariable courtesy , " I noticed this morning that somebody had been disturbing my desk " ( no doubt I had  | put his books back in wrong order ) . " I have several times told the county commissioners they ought to provide cot-beds for jurors ; I wish you would go to them and make complaint , and I will support it . " Since that time they have been provided in this court . Where simple argument fails , persuasion , and often angry denunciation , usually brings an obstinate man to terms after awhile , and after he sees the one or two others who have at first stood with him gradually fall off . It is hard for one man to stand out permanently against eleven others who are locked up in the one room with him and clamoring to be let out . Nobody likes to be isolated and most men shrink from staying in a hopeless minority . I have seen cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first defection from one side to the other was speedily followed by an agreement of the whole . Some men never seem to have any firmly settled conviction , but wait to see on which side preponderance lies . And then , more than once , I think a verdict was delayed past meal time by one or two men , simply to get a good dinner at public cost . Once we were taken , in charge of two bailiffs , to one of the leading hotels of Philadelphia and served with an elaborate mid-day dinner of seven or eight courses , at United States Government expense , in the most sumptuous private parlor of the house , a room which has often been the scene of distinguished social functions and where royalty has been entertained . Under the influence of that mollifying feeding an agreement was not very much longer delayed . It is fair to say , however , that a wish to dine at public cost had nothing to do with the long delay in this case , which was due solely to the sympathy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused person . He did not seem to want a verdict of acquittal either ; but simply a " hung jury , " a disagreement which should relieve him of a feeling of personal responsibility . A modification of the requirement of unanimity in a verdict has often been advocated as a reform . In civil cases there would not seem to be much danger in letting the judgment of nine men out of the twelve stand as the judgment of the court , reporting the divided vote as part of the verdict , so that if an appeal should be taken the figures of the vote might be considered by the appellate court . I believe in some of the newer States unanimity is not always required . In criminal trials ? and it is there that the trouble mostly arises ? the case seems to be somewhat different ; but in other than capital cases perhaps the judgment of ten might be taken without substantial risk of injustice . Where a man is on trial for his life , or for any crime punishable by long imprisonment even , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurymen seems to me in itself often to raise the question of a reasonable doubt of guilt . For evidence in criminal trials is often of a character hard to weigh justly in arriving at a conclusion as to truth . There would be nothing new in accepting the judgment of a divided jury . Even an appeal to Anglo-Saxon law , so dear to the heart of the theorist in jurisprudence , will furnish precedents , and we know how sacred a thing a precedent is in the eye of bench and bar . A legal writer quotes the law of Ethelred making the verdict of a two-thirds majority valid : " Let doom stand where thanes are of one voice : if they disagree , let that stand which VIII of them say ; and let those who are there outvoted pay each of them VI half marks . " Like many reformers , Ethelred ? or his adviser who may have framed the law ? perhaps had some private doubt as to the propriety of his own reform , and added the concluding provision imposing a substantial fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition and precedent are sometimes tyrannous things . One may imagine the panic of those unlucky jurors who found themselves in the fatal minority , and the scramble to change votes and escape being mulcted in " VI half marks " each . As the fine amounted to some twenty-five shillings or more in silver , and money was then vastly more valuable than now , it may easily have been a potent " discourager of hesitancy , " and the obstinate juror who stood out to the end would pay well for his amusement . The locking up of juries , actually imprisoning them , maybe necessary ; but any agreement reached in that way appears to correspond pretty closely in terms to what the law books call an agreement extorted " under duress of imprisonment , " which is fraudulent and invalid . The authority for  | it rests on the very old precedent of court practice ; and no doubt judges would find the most ample justification in law if the right were questioned , especially as there is nobody to decide on their own powers but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen , acting as part of a court of justice , to have his liberty taken away by a show of force ? for he is taken into custody , led into a room , and locked in forcibly by court officers ? and he might well ask himself whether he is capable of rendering a strictly impartial verdict under restraint . Perhaps that is one way of convincing the prisoner at the bar that he is being " tried by his peers . " In a recent murder trial in New York City , notorious over the whole civilized world , each juror was placed under arrest as he stepped into the jury-box , even before the case had opened , and he was kept a close prisoner ? unless fortunate enough to be rejected as a juror ? throughout the wearisome weeks of that trial . The excuse offered for this indignity ? for it is certainly that , disguise it how you will ? was that it was necessary to prevent some juryman being bribed ; but it does not seem unreasonable for an honest man to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more readily than the judge or the district attorney . Judges and district attorneys have been known to be bribed , or bribers , before now ; perhaps on the record quite as often as jurymen . Why not lock up the judge and district attorney along with the jury to prevent the possibility , or suspicion , of their being " reached " ? It would look to be simpler and more effective to buy up one judge or a prosecuting attorney , rather than twelve jurymen , which could not be done without the active assistance of the court officials themselves , and anything less would merely be the temporary relief of a mistrial . In any jury honestly drawn there will surely be at least a preponderance of honest men ready to resent and expose any attempt to corrupt them ; and as a matter of notoriety in trials where scandal has arisen , popular suspicion seems more often directed against the judge or court officials than against the jury . So that imprisonment of jurors during trial appears to have proved an ineffective way of assuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is surely a hardship and , if unnecessary , an injustice , if not a misuse of judicial power . In any event , it hardly seems calculated to bring conviction of the theory that " trial by jury " is the palladium of our liberties if it is publicly announced that jurors have to be imprisoned to prevent selling themselves out . As to the judges , considering that so many of them are elevated to the bench by political influence , or by personal political activity , we are to be congratulated on having a body of men generally of undoubted high character and containing so few who are objectionable . They are , without doubt , mostly hard-working , conscientious , able , and upright public officials . A few , a very few , possibly sometimes sell justice or allow themselves to be improperly influenced in its administration ; but that is an old story , as any one who dips into the history of jurisprudence in England and other lands may know . Selling of justice is extremely ancient , older than the parable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , but still ancient , there is in the Icelandic saga of " The Banded Men " an amusing tale told of a corruption of the court ? a sort of court of appeals , apparently ? and the details of the shifts and turns of the law are full of curious interest . It began with a criminal prosecution which was thrown out of court on a technical plea of a flaw in the indictment . The accused person was of known bad character and notoriously guilty of the crime with which he was charged ; but the prosecutor was the wealthiest man in Iceland , and two of the judges concocted a scheme , in which six others joined them , to bring about a forfeiture of his goods for their joint enrichment on the ground that he had brought his accusation to court illegally . Taking advantage of their own decision as to this , the eight of them " banded together " to spoil the unlucky litigant , who prepared to fly with what portable goods he could carry . He was approached , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand over a large sum in silver , promising to buy him a judgment in his favor . This able counsel first went separately to two of the most needy of the eight judges ? the " Banded Men " ? and bought them up privately , obtaining from each a promise to act if the other one would join him . Then by a series of ingenious  | legal manoeuvres he arranged that the decision of the court should lie in the hands of these two whom he had bought and whom the other six of " The Banded Men " were quite ready to trust to make the decision of forfeiture which was sure to incur popular odium , cunningly expecting to reap the benefit and escape the blame . However , when decision came to be rendered and it was found that a nominal fine was imposed , as the saga quaintly puts it , " the Banded Men were exceedingly ill-content with this ending of the case . " The two repentant conspirators justified their action on the same ground that the man who turns State 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fellow wrong-doers and do the right thing ? being paid for it ? than to continue in evil . From all of which we see that human nature in ancient Iceland was pretty much the same as it is in America , and elsewhere , to-day . The case itself recalls in some features the famous case of the conspiring oil refiners in New York State who were convicted of murder in blowing up an independent refinery and causing loss of life , carried it on appeal to every higher court in the State , the verdict of conviction being affirmed on every appeal , and finally , by a rare excess of judicial severity , were sentenced , for murder , to pay a fine of one thousand dollars each ! Having in mind ancient and modern instances of judicial malversation , only too frequent , though doubtless not in proportion to the talk about it , the honest juror , whom the court is benevolently trying to shield from a temptation to forswear himself , might ask with some show of justice why he should specially be picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether there is anything in the Constitutional provision that " Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime , whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States , " to save him from being locked up . He might ask , and no doubt " the court " would answer him quite to his satisfaction ; and show him , constructively , that however he might be in physical durance , as a theory of the law ? not to say a legal figment ? he was n't locked up , or imprisoned , or restrained of his liberty , or in duress at all ; but that really he was enjoying a very dignified position as a chief constituent of the court , under suspicion unfortunately , engaged in the solemn and important public function of trying a fellow " peer " for his life . Whether the person being tried has any right to object to a verdict rendered by a jury in the custody of tipstaves or bailiffs ? under legalized " duress of imprisonment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges would , no doubt , have scant patience to answer . As to " involuntary servitude , " being forced to serve against one 's will under lock and key is certainly a form of that forbidden thing in the ordinary usage of speech , however easy it may be to say that in the eye of the law it does not mean it . The whole matter ought to be definitely regulated by statute ; and it seems worth considering whether better results might not be had by leaving the jury to the natural liberty of free citizens . The " honor system " has been found to work very well with lads at college and to have promoted honesty in examinations ; is it more likely to fail in the case of mature men engaged in an important public duty ? The college lad when treated as a suspect is found often to yield to that suggestive influence , and , on the other hand , to respond well to the power of the suggestion that he can be trusted . The juryman is called upon to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an immature boy to respond to the suggestion of trust ? The jurpr of the better sort can hardly avoid a more or less conscious sense of indignity in being placed in custody ; and I think that is one of the reasons why he often tries to escape service and serves reluctantly when he is obliged to . There has been frequent complaint of the character of juries , often without justification ; but only selected names go upon the lists from which jurymen are drawn and the fault lies with those whose duty it is to make up the lists . If every member of the bar were obliged to serve a term as a juryman it would not hurt him , and if the judge were called upon occasionally to step down from the bench for the same service he would probably learn something of value in the conduct of his official duty . It should not compromise his dignity , if the importance of trial by jury is really so great as the text-books say . In any event , whatever makes for the real dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not be otherwise than of public benefit so long as we cling to the system .  | If indignity is unavoidable , by all means let us endure it patiently ; but if it is not , let us have better conditions . If the lawyer thinks the present treatment of juries is perfect , he is the very man to try it ; but his fellowmembers of the bar would doubtless challenge him every time he stepped into the box . If any reform is needed it is a question , with something to be said on both sides , whether it should be by legislative enactment or simply by the initiative of the judges in changing rules of court . It is undoubtedly the theory on which this republic was founded that the people should govern themselves by their own laws , enacted by legislative bodies whom they should elect for that purpose , rather than by courtmade law . The late James C. Carter , in his posthumous work , held strenuously that what he called " the unwritten law , " founded on " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and superior to the " written " or statute law ; but that is not at all the conviction which inspired the framers of this government . In the United States there is no law except what is sanctioned by some sort of legislative act by those who stand as representatives of the people . The Common Law of England is only law in these American States where it has been expressly so sanctioned , and in at least one State is not law . Indeed , in our early history so strong was the fear of English court decisions , which make up the body of the Common Law , as McMaster shows in his monumental " History of the People of the United States , " that in 1810 the Pennsylvania Legislature passed an act " forbidding the citation of any English decisions made since July fourth , 1776 . " This remained the law in Pennsylvania for twentyfive years , the act not being repealed until 1836 , as Dr. McMaster tells me . The courts and the judges are themselves creatures of statute , and perhaps any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished by enactment rather than be left to the discretion of judges of court . In the theory of this republic government is to be conducted by three separated and distinct departments : First , the legislative bodies are to make or change the law , acting as the elected representatives of " the sovereign people . " Second , the executive department is to execute the law and carry it into effect . Third , the judicial department is to interpret the law , when required , and to give judgment under the law after judicial examination , whether by jury trial or otherwise in the nature of the case . Now the judges of the court have held that without power to execute its judgments the court is impotent and its judgment futile and of none effect ; therefore as necessary to that postulate the judges have assumed executive power . Under the guise of interpretation they have often assumed legislative power as well , to set aside or annul enacted law , or change its effect , or to make new law . That seems to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges , in the main able and upright men , and those who have been incompetent or corrupt have been held in check by the others . Otherwise government of this republic , under the theory of the courts , would long ago have degenerated into an intolerable oligarchy . In present legal theory it is now , in the last analysis , a benevolent and righteous oligarchy of judges who , by mandamus or injunction or other process of court , may assume supreme executive or even legislative control . Dean Trickett , of the Dickinson School of Law , a distinguished writer on legal subjects , in the North American Review of August 16 , 1907 , holds that it was not the intention of the men who framed and adopted the Constitution to give power to the Supreme Court to nullify an act of Congress ; but , having assumed that power , who is to take it away ? Congress might repeal the act creating the Supreme Court , and the justices would , of course , go out of office immediately the repealer went into effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would create an interesting situation indeed . However , while there appear to be plenty of theoretic dangers to freedom from the assumptions of the courts , there has yet been nothing seriously to excite alarm as to judicial encroachments , not only because judges are mostly righteous and able , but also because they have proved rather curiously amenable to general public sentiment . This has been notably so in certain United States Supreme Court decisions ; though it might have been expected that these justices , being appointed for life , would be even more removed from the influence of popular opin-p ! IIIII ' P !  | ion than the elected judges . If it had not been for this susceptibility of the courts to public sentiment , it is hard to think just what might have happened before now . So if jurymen have any woes to complain of it may be quite unnecessary to appeal to the legislatures if they can enlist public interest on their side . But legislative action might , after all , be the shorter and easier method of reform . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public eye ; especially , no doubt , if the courts should proceed to nullify the act of the legislature . If trial by jury has outgrown its useful ness , as some of the legal profession appear to think , by all means let us abolish it . But if it is actually so important to liberty as we have been taught , surely the conditions under which it is applied to the well-being of society ought to be under constant and watchful scrutiny ; and anything which strengthens its power for good ought to be of the highest consideration , while whatever may weaken or hurt it is to be sternly resented . Either way it seems proper matter for some seriousness , and for careful reflection . Undoubtedly there is an existing tendency to hold it in frivolous regard , if not in contempt .
