THE source from which Japanese immigrants are drawn is the agricultural population . The Japanese , small as his country is , is essentially the son of the soil . In the days of feudalism the farmer ranked next only to the samurai in the social scale . This exaltation of the agricultural class was due to various circumstances . In the first place , peculiar moral conceptions , more or less prevalent in all countries before the advent of the industrial era , kept commerce in abeyance and assigned an unenviable position to the merchants . Commerce meant bargaining , and bargaining could not be completely dis sociated from chicanery and prevarication . So the samurai looked down with contempt upon traffic and traffickers , and deliberately nurtured scorn for money and the arts of moneymaking . Toward the farmer , however , his attitude was different . To him farming was one productive pursuit which could be free from sordid phases of commerce . In the second place , the policy of exclusion adopted under the old regime resulted in the commercial , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become selfsupporting , the country necessarily attached great importance to the men who tilled the soil and produced the daily necessaries of life . Moreover , the samurai , to be able to devote himsel f to the cultivation of martial arts and to a career of conquest , had to rely upon the farmer for the supply of provision for himself and for his retainers . Toward the last days of the military regime Japan enjoyed a period of peace of almost three centuries , uninterrupted by any serious warfare . Thus freed from the waste of war the country witnessed an unprecedented increase of population . And yet its doors were closed not only to those who rapped at their from without , but to those who wished to unlock them from within . With emigration forbidden , with the importation of foreign commodities placed under a ban , and with the group of small islands offering but one-twelfth of its total area for culti- vation , how did Japan manage to secure enough food-stuff to feed her ever-increasing population ? Only by developing farm ing into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the term is understood in our modern age , she knew but little , but the experience of centuries taught her how to wrest from the earth all that it could yield without impoverishing the soil . Thus agriculture was invested with the dignity of a fine art , and men who embraced the occupation were regarded not as mere tillers of the soil but as gentlemen with a keen sense of honor and self-respect . They were not even at liberty to quit their vocation and join the mercantile class , for this would mean ? a lowering of their prestige and the impairment of their dignity . Looked upon as a most important element in the body politic , the farmer of old Japan was nevertheless simple of heart and almost unconscious of the high esteem in which he was held . Frugal , contented , industrious , and devoted to the hearth , he was not unlike the Swiss farmer of whom Goldsmith sang : " Cheerful at morn , he wakes from short repose , Breathes the keen air as he goes . At night returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a shed , Smiles by his cheerful fire , and round surveys His children 's looks , that brighten at the blaze . " The abolition of feudalism afforded him a greater oppor tunity and wider fields of activity . The new regime removed the circumstances which kept his aspirations unawakened , and the farmer was now free not only to carve out his own career but to seek fortune beyond the narrow precincts of his native land . With the inauguration of a local self-government three decades ago he became as important a factor in the political as in the economic life of the country . This , then , is the sort of population from which most Japanese immigrants to these shores are derived . It is , therefore , but natural that the Japanese in America should show strong preference for farming and farm labor in spite of the great difficulties which they must experience in adjusting themselves to a method of agriculture totally foreign to them . In the past few years many well educated young men from Japan  | have taken to farming . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such " tenderfoots " may not , at first at any rate , be as successful as those settlers who are inured to farm life from their childhood , but have had no opportunity to receive modern education . Yet in the long run these educated Japanese agriculturists will prove more valuable assets to this country , because of their intelligence , their adaptability , their ability to imbibe American ideas and adopt American customs . California is of course the chief field of activity for Japanese farmers , but in almost every State whose agricultural resources are yet comparatively little exploited , Japanese have taken up farms . In 1912 they owned 31,812 acres of farm land and leased 225,046 acres . Distributed among various States the figures are as follows : It is estimated that about 41,000 Japanese , equivalent to some sixty per cent . of the entire Japanese population in continental United States , are engaged in agriculture . Of this total farming population about 5,000 are independent farmers while the remaining 36,000 are farm-hands employed by their compatriots or by American farmers . Even as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to various mercantile businesses , so thc Japanese shows peculiar preference for agricultural industries . In California , hc is mostly engaged in potato , bean , beet ,  | onion , and fruit culture ; in Washington and Oregon his chief interest is in orchard and dairy ranches ; in Texas he is almost exclusively engaged in the culture of rice ; in Idaho and Colorado he finds the sugar beet industry most profitable ; and in Florida he has begun to raise pineapples . On the outskirts of some of the larger cities on the Pacific Coast he has become a factor in truck gardening . In Seattle and Los Angeles in particular his garden products are important features in the public markets in point of both quantity and quality . At San Francisco he oper ates one of the largest nurseries on the Pacific Coast . In Idaho and Washington the Japanese , while doing con siderable farming , own no land . This is because those two States have not permitted foreigners to own land . In the spring of 1913 , however , the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land ownership to all aliens , Japanese not excluded , while the State of Washington revised its laws so that all foreigners are entitled to own urban land , though it still denies them the right to own rural land . It seems not without significance that these States adopted new laws without making any discrimination against the Japanese , just at the time when the California legislature was straining all its nerves to enact a law especially directed against the Japanese in the matter of land ownership . Indeed some of the sponsors for the anti-Japanese land bills in California volunteered to counsel the legislators of the neighboring States to follow the example they had set , and adopt a law depriving the Japanese of the right of land ownership . Oregon made no response ; Idaho and Wash ington repudiated their advice by passing a law in favor of the Japanese . Apart from such a magical catchword as " America for Americans , " or " California for Californians , " there is no plausible reason for prohibiting the Japanese from acquiring land . Such arguments as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been exploded . They argue that the Japanese does not know how to care for the soil , so that a farm worked by him for a few years becomes practically worthless . This is a calumny pure and simple . The Japanese , instead of ruining good soil , enriches a poor one , redeems waste  | land , and renovates impoverished farms . Back in his old country he never heard of such a thing as an abandoned farm , and he is bewildered to learn that in our Eastern States there are countless farms whose soils have been so impoverished that few care to cultivate them . No , the Japanese can not afford to abandon any farm , once he settles upon it . If he migrated from one section to another , deserting the old farm and taking up the new , as do many of our farmers , he would soon have to stand upon the brink of the ocean ? so small is his country . The habit of intensive cultivation , which he must perforce acquire in such a country , he naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is therefore but natural that the Japanese farmers in California should show unique skill and fastidiousness in cultivating their lands . Because of the care which they lavish on the soil , the farm rented to a Japanese com mands an unusually high price . This fact is unreservedly recog nized in the special report on the Japanese prepared a few years ago by the Commissioner of Labor of California , Mr. J. D. MacKenzie . The charge that the Japanese abuse the soil finds no indorsement either in the annual report of the Bureau of Labor of California or in the voluminous reports of the United States Immigration Commission of which Senator Dillingham was Chairman . Where the Japanese goes into farming on a rather small scale , utilizing the skill which he had acquired in his native country , he is generally successful . Not a few of them , however , have caught the " get-rich-quick " spirit of the strenuous West , and have embarked upon an agricultural enterprise of a specula tive nature for which they have neither experience nor means . Such undertakings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . True , there is George Shima , the Japanese " potato king , " who cultivates year after year six to ten thousand acres of potatoes . But Shima is a solitary figure . He has played the game with success because he had a strong financial backing . Such bonanza farming as was common in the earlier days of California is ab normal , and it seems desirable that the Japanese should adopt more conservative methods and practise farming on a modest scale .  | It has been contended that when a Japanese settles on a farm it always results in the lowering of price of the adjoining farms , because the white farmers do not desire to live in his neighborhood . Facts do not countenance such contentions . In the first place , the Japanese have in most cases settled or worked on undeveloped lands , whose fertility was problematical and whose price was naturally very low . They clear such lands and convert them into highly productive farms . The land about Fresno is of sandy soil and wad long regarded as almost worthless . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summers intensely hot , and the people who were accustomed to the milder climate of its coast territory did not care to settle in the neighborhood of Fresno . But the Japanese were induced to come , and the country soon became rich with raisins and wines . To the Japanese Fresno is indebted for its general prosperity and for the high price which its farm land now commands . At Florin , not far from Sacramento , it was also the Japanese who utilized the poorest lands in the vicinity and converted them into profitable strawberry gardens . The low lands in the Sacra mento Valley are damp and unhealthy , and in consequence remained long undeveloped . Again the Japanese were brought in , and the section now virtually flows with milk and honey . In Washington , Oregon , Idaho , Texas , and in almost every State where the Japanese is engaged in agriculture , it is much the same story . He often creates the value of land as he increases it . Where he enters into farming in a country already well developed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever the sentiment of urban communities toward their Japanese population , in the countryside there is little ill-feeling between the Japanese and American farmers . Where there is any ill-feeling the fault can in many cases be traced to the doors of white farmers , as I shall presently show . At the same time it must be admitted that most Japanese farmers , like their compatriots in the city , are not yet in a position to cultivate a refined taste . Their dwellings are not yet what they can be proud of , and their modes of living show little refinement , though they are fastidious and even extravagant both as to food and clothing . But no Japanese will admit that  | this is to be their ultimate condition . So far from it , they are ambitious not only to acquire wealth but to elevate their social standing . Eager to learn English , they are even more anxious to utilize the knowledge of the language they acquired in their efforts to understand our institutions and customs . When the hardships and trials inevitable in the initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will emerge from their present state of life . Time is not yet far back when even the Irish , among whom there are to-day talents and geniuses . America may well be proud of , lived in an infelicitous condition which their American neighbors made an object of ridicule and sarcasm . We used to sing : " There is a pig in the parlor , And that is Irish , too . " The pig has made an exit from the parlor of the Irishman , and in his place have appeared a piano , a talking machine , and a set of tasteful furniture . There is no reason why the Japanese should not go through similar stages of evolution . It is only some fifteen years since the Japanese started farming in this country , and it is unreasonable to expect them to live as the older settlers of other races live . The anti-Japanese agitators argue that the Japanese can live almost for nothing . The fact is that it costs the Japanese just as much to live as it costs any other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that he is , in a sense , a poor manager of household economy . Most Japanese are not satisfied with American diet alone , and to cater to their whimsical palates they loosen the purse strings for exotic edibles imported from their native country . Including duties and the cost of transportation the price of such food-stuffs is exorbitant . When they marry their wives demand flowing Japanese gowns as well as close-fitting American dresses . What is more serious , neither they nor their helpmeets know how to utilize for table such materials as can be easily obtained on the farm . If the Japanese farmer suppresses his peculiar craving for imported food-stuffs and learns to satisfy his palate with common American dishes ? if his wife , like the wives of American farmers , knows how to  | cure ham , churn butter , convert sour milk into breads and cakes , and cook eggs in a hundred and one wonderful ways , his cost of living will be greatly reduced . Then the money thus saved could go a long way toward the improvement of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the houses occupied by Japanese farmers , because during my trip through the farming districts of the Sacramento Valley I was grcatly disappointed with such houses . They are not houses but huts . In such places as Walnut Grove , Isleton , Grand Island , and Courtland , I fqund the conditions especially bad . In these places , as in many another section , the Chinese preceded the Japanese as farmhands or tenants . To quarter them the landrds put up camps , the cheapest possible structures that lumber nd nails could build . Never painted and invariably of unpianed tuber , these structures are far less attractive than the corn gibs or hay barns which are commonly seen in the farm country f the Middle West . When the Japanese came to take the place f Chinese , they were naturally given the same camps which ctr predecessors had vacated . Upon entering these dreary tnps one still finds mementoes of their former tenants in the numcrous pieces of red paper , containing monotonous Chinese Characters signifying " wealth , good luck , and longevity , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , and even on the ilings . " Why do n't you scrape off these hideous symbols of Mam n , and paint the walls and make the house look a bit more cent ? " I said to many of the Japanese farmers I talked with . " Oh , it 's no use , " they would always reply ; " it 's impossible paint those rough boards . We wo n't live in such miserable acks forever , we expect to build some day somewhere . " " Somewhere ? " I queried ; " why not build here at once ? Ou have been here long enough to save enough to put up a cit farmhouse . " " Because the place does n't belong to us . We are just tenants our term of lease is never longer than a year or two . And dM , you know what the labor unions at San Francisco and politicians at Sacramento are talking about us year in year We may have to get out any time . Why should we invest  | anything in this old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny of it , it would be rank foolishness to waste it as you suggest , when we do n't know what is going to become of us next year . As well dump it in the mud ! If our position were legally secure , why that is different . " It was extremely unfortunate that the Japanese came after the Chinese . The Chinese was submissive to the point of servility . He was easy to satisfy , and was happy sleeping and eating in hiA dismal camp . Had there not been in existence thousands of such huts vacated by the Chinese and waiting for new tenants , the Japanese might have built more respectable dwellings . The presence of the Chinese , moreover , had instilled in the bosoms of the Californians irremovable prejudice against all Oriental peoples . They had got the notion that Asiatics must come to their country , if they were to come at all , only to hew wood and draw water for them , and not to become independent and self-reliant . As long as , therefore , the Japanese walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for indepen dence , they were tolerated and even praised . But once the little brown men showed their mettle , Californians heaped upon them vituperations and slanders which they did not deserve . What success the Japanese farmers have achieved is due to naught but their perseverance , their temperance , their willingness to work . As Miss Alice Brown , for thirty-five years a resident of Florin , says , " the very fact that the Japanese is an industrious being and a highly successful producer gives white farmers spasms of alarm . They are taking our homes ' is the woeful wail , which means that the slothful must get to work . So , in their blindness , they would destroy the productivity of the Japanese and return to the past status of barren fields that their meagre and inferior product would meet no competition . It is blind , selfish greed that recognizes only self as a factor in the world 's struggle . It is ignorance and inhumanity that does not consider the larger whole . " What I have said about the mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for re stricting their rights . The Japanese , they argue , do not spend their earnings on American merchandise but buy Japanese goods ,  | u ? benefiting little the community in which they live . Ah ! the old theory of the pennywise . As a matter of fact , the Japanese patronizes American stores more than he patronizes Japanese dealers . But even if he sent all his profits to his native country , what of that ? His value to the community would still be con siderable . Take , for example , the case of Florin , which has been cited by the anti-Japanese legislators at Sacramento as a pretext for the need of laws discriminating against the Japanese . In the ' neighboring region of Florin the soil is a shallow bedrock , abounding in sloughs . The land has to be irrigated by means of well water conducted through ditches . Because of the great amount of money and labor required in the boring of wells and the levelling of land for irrigation , there was but little in ducement for the white farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was especially adapted to grapes and strawberries . efore the advent of the Japanese , the country was poor , its outt of fruits being extremely meagre . The vast fields had been ? wed to grain , but the fertility of the soil was so limited that ch succeeding year decreased the yield until the grain industry as no longer profitable . Thus the land was permitted to lie e , but when the Japanese came in its owners saw a chance to rn it into a profit , offering it to them on yearly payments for price they never would have obtained from the white investor . a year 's time the barren fields were changed into attractive rry gardens . With their usual foresight the Japanese plant ape vines along with strawberries , so that when the three sirs ' life of the strawberry ceases a productive vineyard takes N place . Their vines are robust and their berry plants luxuriant , end in comparison with them those raised by the white farmers look sadly neglected . The Japanese spare no pains in their torts to improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings the highest price . And to-day Florin boasts of shipping $15o,000 worth of rawberries annually . The shipment of grapes is also large . Who created this profitable industry but the Japanese ? He it Ass who put Florin on the map , a tiny sleepy town up to fourteen years ago . The opponents of the Japanese naturally ask :  | " What becomes of this money that the Japanese get ? " The answer is given by an American resident of Florin . He informs me that the Japanese strawberry growers of Florin annually pay the express company from $i5,000 to $20,000 . Then , the production of strawberries valued at $150,000 must confer a considerable profit upon the boxmakers , besides giving employ ment to the millhands . The railroad , too , shares in the grower 's profit , while the well-borer and the engine man are paid high wages . Finally , the storekeeper sells the Japanese growers and their employees provisions and sundry articles , for these eclectic folk from the Orient are no more satisfied with Japanese articles alone than they are satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last but not least , the local banker , who is always willing to advance cash for the Japanese , has due share in the profitable industry . No industry can be carried on without due investment . Farming means expenditure as well as profit-making . He indeed must be blind who fails to see that a strawberry in industry of $15o,000 confers a great benefit upon the community in which that industry is carried on . We think ill of the Russians because they ill-treat the Jews . The Jewish problem in Russia is a problem arising out of the contact of a wonderfully alert and adroit race with a peculiarly phlegmatic , dull people . The Russian peasants , ignorant and guileless , usually go to the wall when confronted with the finesse of the shrewd Jews whose characteristic business methods are too well known to require a comment . The Japanese question in California presents a totally different aspect . Here the relations of the Japanese with the white farmers are not relations between two races separated from each other by a chasm of intellectual discrepancy . Intellectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is neither inferiority nor superiority between them . The Ameri can , however , has the advantage over the Japanese in that he is conversant with English and is familiar with the farming methods and tools employed in this country . In the stratagems of bargaining , too , the American is , on the whole , more than the equal of the Japanese . I would be the last man to accept without much qualification such sweeping assertions as are made by Miss Alice Brown as to the relative moral integrity of the Japanese  | and American , but her words are worth hearing . Says this resident of Florin : " It is the whites that bear the record of shame and dishonor in dealing with the Japanese . It is no disgrace to swindle them in their ignorance , to sell them a worthless horse as a perfect animal for a round sum , to unload worthless things on them for a big price , and to overcharge them at every turn . It is these very same white tricksters who denounce the Japanese when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alert , brainy people , and they soon learn a means for self-defence . When they can no longer be exploited they are dishonest . It is the same old story of greed and the unscrupulous factor in the white man . " It is untiring industry and unwavering perseverance , and these alone , which crown Japanese enterprise with success where the white farmer reaps a failure . And yet are we to blame the Japanese in order to exonerate the indolent or shiftless whites , and connive at the oppression and persecution perpetrated in our midst , we who gallantly championed the cause of an abused race under the flag of another Government ?  |
