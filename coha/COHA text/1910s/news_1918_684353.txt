txt It is the conclusion of the Department of Justice , after investigating the Hog Island shipbuilding plant upon the request of Chairman HURLEY of the Shipping Board , that " the facts do not justify criminal process . " Mr. I HURLEY had suspected that there was " serious disorganization and negligence " at Hog Island . He called upon the Attorney General to turn on the light . The plant , including fifty shipways , was to cost $21,000,000 ; the bill is $61,000,000 , an increase of $40,000 , - 000 . Against the difference may be checked extra expenditure on account of unfavorable subsoil conditions and for longer ways and piers and additional shop and storage capacity asked for by the Emergency Fleet Corporation , which the Shipping Board had created , to get the work done . The Emergency Fleet Corporation , it must be understood , was to find a firm or company that would build the shipyard needed , and afterward the ships . A contract was made with the American International Corporation of New York . This corporation agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard upon the tract . It was to get its compensation from a 6 per cent . rental for the land , plus a percentage of the cost of building the yard and completing the ships , to which were to be added premiums for early deliveries and for savings in cost ; but it was stipulated that there would be penalties for delayed deliveries and for increased cost . A complicating post-contract arrangement was the understanding , unwritten according to the report , that STONE &; WEBSTER and the New York Shipbuilding Corporation were to be jointly interested in the benefits and burdens . The requisition for longer ways and piers and for more shop and storage capacity , together with the cost of dealing with newly discovered swampy subsoil conditions , would legitimately call for a revision upward of the original estimate of $21,000,000 , but how can the stretching of the total cost to $61,000,000 be accounted for ? There i was an accepted revision to $27,000 , - 000 on Nov. 27 , 1917 , ( the date of the contract was Sept. 13 , 1017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional item of $6,000,000 for further improvements approved . This would bring the revised estimate to $33,000,000 . There would remain an excess charge of $28,000,000 to be ex plained . ' On this point the report says : I. A , discrepancy of such magnitude i would seem to call for a clear explatiation from the agent , but this has not been furnished . Why was the agent not compelled to furnish it ? Were the assistants of the Attorney General and the civil engineer and naval constructor , who were called in , conducting a painstaking and thorough ' investigation , or did they flounder in a bog of administrative mismanagement worse than the Hog Island swamps ? The agent lent no helping hand . Says the report : The agent has taken the position that since this was not a commercial job , but a war job in which speed was of the essence : therefore , in the absence of positive misconduct or criminality , the question of cost was of minor importance . That is to say , an addition of $28 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The investigators admit that they ca n't understand why Hog Island should have cost so much , but perhaps the wonder is that it did n't cost more , since the agent considered that " the question of cost was of minor importance . " What is to be done about it ? The view of interested parties that " one of the greatest engineering feats of the age , " the magnitude of which the people are called upon to . admire and appreciate , cost no more than was necessary , can not be accepted without absolute demonstration . The arbitration plan recommended by the Department of Justice investigators should not be adopted until the Senate Commerce Committee , which , is to continue the inquiry after New Year 's , has gone to the bottom of this extraordinary business and elicited the last bit of evidence bearing upon the responsibility of the Hog Island builders for presenting such a huge bill to the Government . Uncle Sam is good pay , but he has no money to waste .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
