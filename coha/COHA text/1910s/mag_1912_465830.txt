I MET her first when I was seventeen and she fifteen . It was in a dream . No , I did not meet her ; I overtook her . It was in a Missourian village which I had never been in before , and was not in at that time , except dreamwise ; in the flesh I was on the Atlantic seaboard ten or twelve hundred miles away . The thing was sudden , and without preparation ? after the custom of dreams . There I was , crossing a wooden bridge that had a wooden rail and was untidy with scat ? tered wisps of hay , and there she was , five steps in front of me ; half a second previously neither of us was there . This was the exit of the village , which lay immediately behind us . Its last house was the blacksmith-shop ; and the peace ? ful clinking of the hammers ? a sound which nearly always seems remote , and is always touched with a spirit of loneli ? ness and a feeling of soft regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? was wafted to my ear over my shoulder ; in front of us was the winding country road , with woods on one side , and on the other a rail fence , with blackberry vines and hazel bushes crowding its angles ; on an upper rail a bluebird , and scurrying toward him along the same rail a fox-squirrel with his tail bent high like a shepherd 's crook ; heyond the fence a rich field of grain , and far away a farmer in shirt sleeves and straw hat wading knee-deep through it ; no other representative of life , and no noise at all ; everywhere a Sabbath still ? ness . I remember it all ? and the girl , too , and just how she walked , and how she was dressed . In the first moment I was five steps behind her ; in the next one I was at her side ? without either stepping or gliding ; it merely happened ; the trans ? fer ignored space . I noticed that , but not with any surprise ; it seemed a nat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put my arm around her waist and drew her close to me , for 1 loved her ; and although I did not know her , my behavior seemed to me quite natural and right , and I had no mis ? givings about it . She showed no sur ? prise , no distress , no displeasure , but put an arm around my waist , and turned up her face to mine with a happy welcome in it , and when I bent down to kiss her she received the kiss as if she was expect ? ing it , and as if it was quite natural for me to offer it and her to take it and have pleasure in it . The affection which I felt for her and which she manifestly felt for me was a quite simple fact ; but the quality of it was another matter . It was not the affection of brother and sis ? ter ? it was closer than that , more cling ? ing , more endearing , more reverent ; and it was not the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was some ? where between the two , and was finer than either , and more exquisite , more profoundly contenting . We often experi ? ence this strange and gracious thing in our dream-loves ; and we remember it as a feature of our childhood-loves , too . We strolled , along , across the bridge and down the road , chatting like the old ? est friends . She called me George , and that seemed natural and right , though it was not my name ; and I called her Alice , and she did not correct . me , though without doubt it was not her name . Everything that happened seemed just natural and to be expected . Once I said , " What a dear little hand it is ! " and without any words she laid it gratefully in mine for me to examine it . I did it , remarking upon its littleness , its delicate beauty , and its satin skin , then kissed it ; she put it up to her lips without saying anything and kissed it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of half a mile , we came to a log house , and entered it and found the table set and everything on it steaming hot ? a roast turkey , corn in the ear , butter-beans , and the rest of the usual things ? and a cat curled up asleep in a splint-bottomed chair by the fireplace ; but no people ; just emptiness and silence . She said she would look in the next room if I would wait for her . So I sat down , and she passed through a door , which closed behind her with a click of the latch . I waited and waited . Then I got up and followed , for I could not any longer bear to have her out of my sight . I passed through the door , and found my ? self in a strange sort of cemetery , a city of innumerable tombs and monuments stretching far and wide on every hand , and flushed with pink and gold lights flung from the sinking sun . I turned around , and the log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yonder down the lanes between the rows of tombs , calling Alice ; and presently the night closed down , and I could not find my way . Then I woke , in deep distress over my loss , and was in my bed in Philadelphia . And I was not seventeen , now , but nineteen . TEN years afterward , in another dream , I found her . I was seventeen again , and she was still fifteen . I was in a grassy place in the twilight deeps of a magnolia forest some miles above Natchez , Mis ? sissippi : the trees were snowed over with great blossoms , and the air was loaded with their rich and strenuous fragrance ; the ground was high . and through a rift in the wood a burnished patch of the river was visible in the distance . I was sitting on the grass , absorbed in thinking , when an arm was laid around my neck , and there was Alice sitting by my side and looking into my face . A deep and satisfied happiness and an unwordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no feeling of surprise ; and there was no sense of a time-lapse ; the ten years amounted to hardly even a yesterday ; indeed , to hardly even a noticeable frac ? tion of it . We dropped in the tranquilest way into affectionate caressings and pet ? tings , and chatted along without a refer ? ence to the separation ; which was natural , for I think we did not know there had been any that one might measure with either clock or almanac . She called me Jack and I called her Helen , and those seemed the right and proper names , and perhaps neither of us suspected that we had ever borne others ; or , if we did sus ? pect it , it was probably not a matter of consequence . She had been beautiful ten years be ? fore ; she was just as beautiful still ; girl ? ishly young and sweet and innocent , and she was still that now . She had had blue eyes , a hair of flossy gold before ; she had black hair now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not suggest change ; to me she was the same girl she was before , absolutely . It never occurred to me to ask what became of the log house ; I doubt if I even thought of it . We were living in a sim ? ple and natural and beautiful world where everything that happened was natural and right , and was not perplexed with the unexpected or with any forms of surprise , and so there was no occasion for explana ? tions and no interest attaching to such things . We had a dear and pleasant time to ? gether , and were like a couple of ignorant and contented children . Helen had a summer hat on She took it off present ? ly and said , " It was in the way ; now you can kiss me better . " It seemed to me merely a bit of courteous and con ? siderate wisdom , nothing more ; and a natural thing for her to think of and do . We went wandering through the woods , and came to a limpid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said : " I must not get my feet wet , dear ; carry me over . " I took her in my arms and gave her my hat to hold . This was to keep my own feet from getting wet . I did not know why this should have that effect ; I merely knew it ; and she knew it , too . I crossed the stream , and said I would go on carrying her , because it was so pleasant ; and she said it was pleasant to her , too , and wished we had thought of it sooner . It seemed to me a pity that we should have walked so far , both of us on foot , when we could have been having this higher enjoyment ; and I spoke of it regretfully , as a something lost which could never be got back . She was troubled about it , too , and said there must be some way to get it back ; and she would think . After musing deeply a little while she looked up radiant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back and start over again . " I can see , now , that that was no solu ? tion , but at the time it seemed luminous with intelligence , and I believed that there was not another little head in the world that could have worked out that difficult problem with such swiftness and success . I told her that , and it pleased her ; and she said she was glad it all happened , so that I could see how capable she was . After thinking a moment she added that it was " quite atreous . " The words seemed to mean something , T do not know why : in fact , it seemed to cover the whole ground and leave nothing more to say ; I admired the nice aptness and the flashing felicity of the phrase , and was filled with respect for the marvelous mind that had been able to engender it . I think less of it now . It is a notice ? able fact that the intellectual coinage of Dreamland often passes for more there than it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream-sweetheart threw off golden sayings which crumbled to ashes under my pencil when I was set ? ting them down in my note-book after breakfast . I carried her back and started over again ; and all the long afternoon I bore her in my arms , miles upon miles , and it never occurred to either of us that there was anything remarkable in a youth like me being able to carry that sweet bundle around half a day without some sense of fatigue or need of rest . There are many dream-worlds , but none is so rightly and reasonably and pleasantly arranged as that one . After dark we reached a great planta tion-house , and it was her home . I car ? ried her in , and the family knew me and I knew them , although we had not met before ; and the mother asked me with ill-disguised anxiety how much twelve times fourteen was , and I said a hundred and thirty-five , and she put it down on a piece of paper , saying it was her habit in the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory ; and her husband was offering me a chair , but noticed that Helen was asleep , so he said it would be best ? not to disturb her ; and he hacked me softly against a wardrobe and said I could stand more easily now ; then a negro came in , bowing humbly , with his slouch-hat in his hand , and asked me if I would have my measure taken . The question did not surprise me , but it confused me and wor ? ried me , and I said I should like to have advice about it . He started toward the door to call advisers ; then he and the family and the lights began to grow dim , and in a few moments the place was pitch dark ; but straightway there came a flood of moonlight and a gust of cold wind , and I found myself crossing a frozen lake , and my arms were empty . The wave of grief that swept through me woke me up , and I was sitting at my desk in the news ? paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock that I had been asleep less than two minutes . And what was of more consequence , I was twenty-nine years old . THAT was 1864 . The next year and the year after I had momentary glimpses of my dream-sweetheart , but nothing more . These are set down in my note-books under their proper dates , but with no talks nor other particulars added ; which is sufficient evidence to me that there were none to add . In both of these instances - there was the sudden meet ? ing and recognition , the eager approach , then the instant disappearance , leaving the world empty and of no worth . T remem ? ber the two images quite well ; in fact , I remember all the images of that spirit , and can bring them before me without help of my note-book . The habit of writing down my dreams of all sorts while they were fresh in my mind , and then studying them and rehearsing them and trying to find out what the source of dreams is , and which of the two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given me a good dream ? memory ? a thing which is not usual with people , for few drill the dream-memory , and no memory can be kept strong with ? out that . I spent a few months in the Hawaiian Islands in 1866 , and in October of that year I delivered my maiden lecture ; it was in San Francisco . In the following January I arrived in New York , and had just completed my thirty-first year . In that year I saw my platonic dream-sweet ? heart again . In this dream I was again standing on the stage of the Opera House in San Francisco , ready to lecture , and with the audience vividly individualized before me in the strong light . I began , spoke a few words , and stopped , cold with fright ; for I discovered that I had no subject , no text , nothing to talk about . I choked for a while , then got out a few words , a lame , poor attempt at humor . The house made no response . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another failure . There were a few scornful laughs ; otherwise the house was silent , unsmilingly austere , deeply offended . I was consuming with shame . In my distress I tried to work upon its pity . I began to make servile apologies , mixed with gross and ill-timed flatteries , and to beg and plead for for ? giveness ; this was too much , and the peo ? ple broke into insulting cries , whistlings , hootings , and cat-calls , and in the midst of this they rose and began to struggle in a confused mass toward the door . I stood dazed and helpless , looking out over this spectacle , and thinking how every ? body would be talking about it next day , and I could not show myself in the streets . When the house was become wholly empty and still , I sat down on the only chair that was on the stage and bent my head down on the reading-desk to shut out the look of that place . Soon that familiar dream-voice spoke my name , and swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered : " Agnes l " The next moment we two were loung ? ing up the blossomy gorge called the Tao Valley , in the Hawaiian Islands . I recognized , without any explanations , that Robert was not my name , but only a pet name , a common noun , and meant " dear " ; and both of us knew that Agnes was not a name , but only a pet name , a common noun , whose spirit was affec ? tionate , but not conveyable with exact ? ness in any but the dream-language . It was about the equivalent of " dear , " but the dream - vocabulary shaves meanings finer and closer than do the world 's day ? time dictionaries . We did not know why those words should have those mean ? ings ; we had used words which had no existence in any known language , and had expected them to be understood , and they were understood . In my note-books there are several letters from this dream-sweetheart , in some unknown tongue ? presumably dream-tongue ? with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of that tongue , then I could talk in short ? hand . Here is one of those letters ? the whole of it : " Rax oha tal . " Translation. ? " When you receive this it will remind you that I long to see your face and touch your hand , for the com ? fort of it and the peace . " It is swifter than waking thought ; for thought is not thought at all , but only a vague and formless fog until it is ar ? ticulated into words . We wandered far up the fairy gorge , gathering the beautiful flowers of the ginger - plant and talking affectionate things , and tying and retying each other 's ribbons , and cravats , which did n't need it ; and finally sat down in the shade of a tree and climbed the vine-hung precipices with our eyes , up and up and up toward the sky to where the drifting . scarfs of white mist clove them across and left the green summits floating pale and remote , like spectral islands wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earth and talked again . " How still it is ? and soft , and balmy , and reposeful ! I could never tire of it . You like it , do n't you , Robert ? " " Yes , and I like the whole region ? all the islands , Maui . It is a darling island . I have been here before . Have you ? " " Once , but it was n't an island then . " " What was it ? " " It was a sufa . " I understood . It was the dream-word for " part of a continent . " " What were the people like ? " " They had n't come yet . There were n't any . " " Do you know , Agnes ? that is Hale ? akala , the dead volcano , over there across the valley ; was it here in your friend 's time ? " " Yes , but it was burning . " " Do you travel much ? " " I think so . Not here much , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pretty there ? " She used a couple of dream-words for " You will go with me some time and you will see . " Non-committal , as one per ? ceives now , but I did not notice it then . A man-of-war-bird lit on her shoulder ; T put out my hand and caught it . Its feathers began to fall out , and it turned into a kitten ; then the kitten 's body began to contract itself to a ball and put out hairy . long legs , and soon it was a tarantula ; I was going to keep it , but it turned into a star-fish , and I threw it away . Agnes said it was not worth while to try to keep things ; there was no sta ? bility about them . I suggested rocks ; but she said a rock was like the rest ; it would n't stay . She picked up a stone , and it turned into a bat and flew away . These curious matters interested me , but that was all ; they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tao gorge talking , a lianaka came along who was wrinkled and bent and white-headed , and he stopped and talked to us in the native tongue , and we understood him without trouble and answered him in his own speech . He said he was a hundred and thirty years old , and he remembered Captain Cook well , and was present when he was murdered ; saw it with his own eyes , and also helped . Then he showed us his gun , which was of strange make , and he said it was his own invention and was to shoot arrows with , though one loaded it with powder and it had a per ? cussion lock . He said it would carry a hundred miles . It seemed a reasonable statement ; I had no fault to find with it , and it did not in any way surprise me . He loaded it and fired an arrow aloft , and it darted into the sky and vanished . Then he went his way , saying that the arrow would fall near us in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , not minding the rocks . I took the time , and we waited , re ? clining upon the mossy slant at the base of a tree , and gazing into the sky . By and by there was a hissing sound , fol ? lowed by a dull impact , and Agnes uttered a groan . She said , in a series of faint ? ing gasps : " Take me to your arms ? it passed through me ? hold me to your heart ? I am afraid to die ? closer ? closer . It is growing dark ? T can not see you . Du n't leave me ? where are you ? You are not gone ? You will not leave me ? I would not leave you . " Then her spirit passed ; she was clay in my arms . THE scene changed in an instant , and I was awake and crossing Bond Street in New York with a friend , and it was snowing hard . We had been talking , and there had been no observable gaps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more than two steps while I was asleep . I am satisfied that even the most elab ? orate and incident-crowded dream is sel ? dom more than a few seconds in length . It would not cost me very much of a strain to believe in Mohammed 's seventy-year dream , which began when he knocked his glass over , and ended in time for him to catch it before the water was spilled . Within a quarter of an hour I was in my quarters , undressed , ready for bed , and was jotting down my dream in my note-book . A striking thing happened now . I finished my notes , and was just going to turn out the gas when I was caught with a most strenuous gape , for it was very late and I was very drowsy . I fell asleep and dreamed again . What now follows occurred while I was asleep ; and when I woke again the gape had completed itself , but not long before , I think , for I was still on my feet . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , but I recognized the Parthenon from the pictures , although it had a fresh look and was in perfect repair . I passed by it and climbed a grassy hill toward a palatial sort of mansion which was built of red terra-cotta and had a spacious portico , whose roof was supported by a rank of fluted columns with Corinthian capitals . It was noonday , but I met no one . I passed into the house and entered the first room , It was very large and light , its walls were of polished and rich ? ly tinted and veined onyx , and its floor was a pictured pattern in soft colors laid in tiles . I noted the details of the fur ? niture and the ornaments ? a thing which I should not have been likely to do when awake ? and they took sharp hold and remained in my memory ; they are not really dim yet , and this was more than thirty years ago . There was a person present ? Agnes . I was not surprised to see her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tume , and her hair and eyes were dif ? ferent as to color from those she had had when she died in the Hawaiian Islands half an hour before , but to me she was exactly her own beautiful little self as I had always known her , and she was still fifteen , and I was seventeen once more . She was sitting on an ivory settee , crocheting something or other , and had her crewels in a shallow willow work ? basket in her lap . I sat down by her and we began to chat in the usual way . I remembered her death , but the pail , / and the grief and the bitterness which had been so sharp and so desolating to me at the moment that it happened had wholly passed from me now , and had left not a scar . I was grateful to have her back , but there was no realizable sense that she had ever been gone , and so it did not occur to me to speak about it , and she made no reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often died before , and knew that there was nothing lasting about it , and consequently nothing im ? portant enough in it to make conversation out of . When I think of that house and its belongings , I recognize what a master in taste and drawing and color and arrange ? ment is the dream-artist who resides in us . In my waking hours , when the in ? ferior artist in me is in command , I can not draw even the simplest picture with a pencil , nor do anything with a brush and colors ; I can not bring before my mind 's eye the detailed image of any building known to me except my own house at home ; of St. Paul 's , St. Peter 's , the Eiffel Tower , the Taj , the Capitol at Washington , I can reproduce only por ? tions , partial glimpses ; the same with VOL . CXXVI ? NO , 761.  - -  3 Niagara Falls , the Matterhorn , and other familiar things in nature ; I can not bring before my mind 's eye the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I have seen my family at breakfast within the past two hours ; I can not bring their images before me , I do not know how they look ; before me , as I write , I see a little grove of young trees in the garden ; high above them projects the slender lance of a young pine , beyond it is a glimpse of the upper half of a dull-white chimney covered by an A-shaped little roof shingled with brown-red tiles , and half a mile away is a hill-top densely wooded , and the red is cloven by a curved , wide vacancy , which is smooth and grass-clad ; I can not shut my eyes and repro ? duce that picture as a whole at all , nor any single detail of it except the grassy curve , and that but vaguely and fleet ? ingly . But my dream-artist can draw any ? thing , and do it perfectly ; he can paint with all the colors and all the shades , and do it with delicacy and truth ; he can place before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovels , moun ? tains , valleys , lakes , skies , glowing in sunlight or moonlight , or veiled in driv ? ing gusts of snow or rain , and he can set before me people who are intensely alive , and who feel , and express their feelings in their faces , and who also talk and laugh , sing and swear . And when I wake I can shut my eyes and bring back those people , and the scenery and the buildings ; and not only in general view , but often in nice detail . While Agnes and I sat talking in that grand Athens house , several stately Greeks en ? tered from another part of it , disputing warmly about something or other , and passed us by with courteous recognition ; and among them was Socrates . I recog ? nized him by his nose . A moment later the house and Agnes and Athens van ? ished away , and I was in my quarters in New York again and reaching for my note-book . IN our dreams ? I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ; we do see the things we seem to see ; the people , the horses , the cats , the dogs , the birds , the whales , are real , not chimeras ; they are living spirits , not shadows ; and they are immortal and in ? destructible . They go whither they will ; they visit all resorts , all points of in ? terest , even the twinkling suns that wander in the wastes of space . That is where those strange mountains are which slide from under our feet while we walk , and where those vast caverns are whose bewildering avenues close behind us and in front when we are lost , and shut us in . We know this because there are no such things here , and they must be there , because there is no other place . This tale is long enough , and I will close it now . In the forty-four years that I have known my Dreamland sweetheart , I have seen her once in two years on an average . Mainly these were glimpses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was so given to repairing herself and getting up doubt ? ful improvements in her hair and eyes . She was always fifteen , and looked it and acted it ; and I was always seventeen , and never felt a day older . To me she is a real person , not a fiction , and her sweet and innocent society he s been one of the prettiest and pleasantest experi ? ences of my life . I know that to you her talk will not seem of the first intel ? lectual order ; but you should hear her in Dreamland ? then you would see ! I SAW her a week ago , just for a mo ? ment . Fifteen , as usual , and I seven ? teen , instead of going on sixty-three , as I was when I went to sleep . We were in India , and Bombay was in sight ; also Windsor Castle , its towers and battle ? ments veiled in a delicate haze , and from it the Thames flowed , curving and wind-ing between its swarded banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no question about it , Eng ? land is the most beautiful of all the countries . " Her face lighted with approval , and she said , with that sweet and earnest ir ? relevance of hers : It is , because it is so marginal . " Then she disappeared . It was just as well ; she could probably have added nothing to that rounded and perfect statement without damaging its sym ? metry . This glimpse of her carries me back to Maui , and that time when I saw her gasp out her young life . That was a terrible thing to me at the time . It was preternaturally vivid ; and the pain and the grief and the misery of it to me transcended many sufferings that I have known in waking life . For everything in a dream is more deep and strong and sharp and real than is ever its pale imita ? tion in the unreal life which is ours when we go about awake and clothed with our artificial selves in this vague and dull-tinted artificial world . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tellect , perhaps , and go abroad into Dreamland clothed in our real selves , and aggrandized and enriched by the command over the mysterious mental magician who is here not our slave , but only our guest .
