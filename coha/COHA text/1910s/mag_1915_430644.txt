 | IF a man were to engage passage I from New York to Chicago on an ox-cart we should call him crazy . Hundreds of thousands of men are traveling in an ox-cart mind . Their relation to their work , daily life , ultimate goal , is that of a mental medieval , jogging , bumping , lagging along in an intellectual ox-cart over a stony road of ignorance and inertia . These men ? the majority of them ? have n't any system . System is the difference between the automobile and the ox-cart . The cart was not quick enough , roomy enough , easy enough , fine enough . So the automobile came by means of a system of experimentation , a system of construction , a system of capitalization , a system of advertising , a system of selling , a system of service . All advancement is by means of a system . Few minds are quick enough , roomy enough , easy enough , fine enough . And by the right combination of systems . any sane man could , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style of his intellect from an ox-cart to an automobile . You can Flake a month 's progress in a day when you know how . Time is measured not by how long we live but by how much we attempt . A science is the conclusion of a System . There is no science of law , of medicine , of theology , of education , or of marriage ; in these realms we find conflict , confusion , groping , erring , despairing ? because no system has yet been evolved . There is a science of accounting , of banking , of bricklaying , of merchandising , of a thousand trades and industries Where men work at a minimum of error and friction ? because a universal system based on experience ' has been adopted and is being maintained . A joyless , profitless job is merely systemless . " WOMAN 'S WORK IS NEVER DONE " We often hear that man works from sun to sun , while woman 's work is never done . Why ? Because woman 's work , generally speaking , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until done right . A wrong act is always unfinished . Man 's work is systematic ? woman 's haphazard . This explains the " servant " problem , the extravagance problem , the tired-mother problem , the food problem , and largely the health problem , the divorce problem , and other serious problems . It has taken the women of the world 1900 years of Christian civilization to produce their first readable , workable , reliable book on systematic housekeeping . Yet the home preceded all other trades and professions . Even to this day we have no book which tells a man how to be a thoroly efficient teacher , preacher or physician . Yet these ministers to mind , soul and body are the central figures in the community ; on them lie the great responsibilities of molding the men and women of tomorrow . A saint without a system is a fool , and a fool never yet convinced anybody . Most human failures are due to a lack of system . Wagner , the stupendous composer , was a pauper and by many considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of popular acclaim , gets $1000 a night and lives in a rose-bower of adoration . The great inventor Langley thought out the flying-machine , and died broken-hearted , of misunderstanding and persecution ; the Wright brothers , putting a system into Langley 's idea , charted the sky and brought the heavens into the grip of man . Edgar Allan Poe might have been a Colossus of literature , but he had not the system to overcome his weakness . A ten-point success is likely to be two points talent , three points character , five points system . There is consolation here for the man not born a genius . By system I do not mean the worship of detail , or the substitution of mechanism for humanism . System is inspired mechanism . System is experience condensed and applied . System is the substitution of choice for chance , intelligence for worry , composure for care . System is decrease of effort and increase of result . System is the conversion of drudgery into destiny thru the sustained power of a coherent purpose . Observe , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is neither first in time nor final in importance . System merely shows us how to do a thing , it does not tell us what to do , or why to do it . We are a compound of body , brain , heart and soul . The brain and the body should be made perfect machines , operating as regularly , easily , faultlessly , powerfully , as the finest automobile or electric plant . The desires of the heart should impel these twin-machines , but without waste of energy , sympathy , worry , sentimentality . The soul needs no system and will have no system . The soul must be free . But system is not only a material aid to efficiency but is even more a subtle aid to spirituality . System is to the soul as the track to the engine , the forge to the fire , the sail to the breeze . A good man plus a good system becomes a great man ; and a great man who is also good is better than a hundred good men who are merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do when you first wake up in the morning ? Your answer will imply how far you apprehend and use the right system of daily habits . The inefficient man wakes thus : he grunts , yawns , turns over sleepily , hunches up angrily , growls thickly " Hang that alarm clock ! " ? and with a petulant scowl goes to sleep again . This performance is bad for him , first because it undermines his will power , second because it demoralizes his schedule for the day . Dozing irresponsibly , he oversleeps . When some kind friend shakes him , he wakes with a start , slights his bath and exercize , shoots into his clothes , gulps down a hungerless breakfast in a panic lest he be late to work , and darts for his train after the manner of a frightened goose . Now , the first hour of the morning determines our physical and mental status for the day . If at nine o'clock we have our nerves , brain and stomach in a condition of turmoil , we reduce our thinking and working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If in addition we allow such irregularity to pervade our desk , office and routine , we further abridge our maximum output , , by perhaps thirty per cent more . Besides , our health , influence , character , will suffer to an equal extent . The man of power gets absolute control of his brain , heart and body before he starts his work . In order to have time to get this control , he plans to wake a half hour before he has to ( hurry enslaves ) . The efficient man has his sleep out , because he fixed the right quantity and quality of it beforehand . He takes five minutes ' exercize ? the kind that he has proved best for him . He finds himself in a healthy glow , and likes his bath even more than his breakfast . He keeps his fresh linen , shaving apparatus and other toilet accessories in such order and location as to reduce motions to the minimum . He follows a plan whereby his clothes  | are never buttonless , or his collars all cracked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does no fuming while he dresses . Our sensible man does not eat fried sausage one morning , oatmeal and bananas the next , sirloin and biscuits the next . He standardizes his breakfast . By this I mean that he studies and experiments until he finds just what kind of food , and how little of it , will keep him from starving till lunch time . Then he takes this breakfast , with but slight variations , every working day . Breakfast and luncheon for the brain worker should always be standardized , but dinner never standardized . We should live by an exact system , from the time we wake till the time we finish our day 's work ; after that , to blazes with the system ! I can do three times as much in a day as I could a few years ago . The secret lies chiefly in the fact that I have learned to get a clean grip on my work and myself during the first hour of the day . This control is mental , even more than physical . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endures . The average mortal never knows how much he can do . He never can know until he puts in his work a systematic method and a spiritual motive . A man recently drove an automobile at the rate of 100 miles an hour . A century ago this would have been called a miracle . Such a feat is possible now because the system of automobile construction has been made well nigh perfect , and because the man in the machine was out for a world 's record , which ambition gave him something approaching superhuman vision and control . You in your work may reasonably hope to become a world-leader ; but first you must have a faultless system , and a colossal aim . SCRUTINIZE YOUR HABITS Every human action is either habitual , or occasional , or independent , original and unforeseen . All habitual actions must be reduced to a system , based on the quickest , easiest and best mode of accomplishment . To discover and apply these various modes of improved action is one of the first steps in personal efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of women ( about one in three in New York State ) go to work every business morning . What is the best way to go to work ? In New York City one may travel by subway or " L " train , by surface car , by taxicab or carriage , or on foot . The ideal way is to walk to business . This , however , is impossible for the man who lives in upper New York five or ten miles away from his office . Most people therefore take the easiest and quickest route , with no regard to hygienic or psychological factors . A friend of mine , a noted efficiency expert , lives on a block with a subway station on the corner . I asked him what he considered the most approved way to get downtown . He answered , " Here is how I go ? judge for yourself . I walk a mile across the city , down a hill and over the Harlem River , to the nearest " L " station . Then I stand on the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air all the way to my office . The subway trip would save me twenty minutes ? and lose me a lot of health , buoyancy , clearbrained action , winning magnetism , and good old-fashioned appetite . " Here is a case where the quickest way is not the best . How many people would have sense enough to figure this out ? For answer , look at the mobs that regularly pile into the subway . All our daily habits should be scrutinized , analyzed , made to conform to standards of health , economy , productivity . Our occasional actions may also be reduced to a general system . based on principles of comfort and utility . Every housewife , every professional man or woman , every worker using brains as well as hands , finds it necessary to do certain things on certain days of the week or month . An essential is a memorandum book or calendar pad , covering each day in the year , and made to serve as an automatic memory . One of these belongs in the home , another in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to next week or next month , put it on the pad and forget it . Then plan each day to fit the pad . Every clerk , every housemaid , ev- ery employee in an ordinary line of business should be given a daily schedule of things to be done , with the time required to do each properly , and a memorandum concerning use of remaining time . If on a bright morning otherwise happy you tell Jane to wash the dishes , polish the silver , blacken the stove , whiten the woodwork , sweep the halls , dust the gimcracks , do the marketing , mind the baby , help with the sewing , bake some pies , and then prepare to get lunch ? you will have a mixtminded , sour-hearted Jane , with bits of undone or ill-done jobs presently scattered all over the place . But if you tell Jane to wash the dishes in 20 minutes and 43 seconds , polish the silver in 8:17 , blacken the stove in 5:34 , and so on to the end of the list ? you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scientific plan for a definite purpose . Then if you offer a small bonus for every time she breaks her own record ( without breaking the dishes or her reputation for thoroness ) you may soon have a paragon of a housemaid . SYSTEM MEANS COMMONSENSE Let us take another illustration of the need for system . There are always thousands of unemployed men in New York . I meet probably two a week , on the average . When a man accosts you on the street , says he is out of a job , ca n't get work , and wo n't you give him a lift , what do you do ? If you are soft-hearted ( and soft-headed ) you perhaps give him a quarter . If you are hard-hearted ( and soft-headed ) you give him nothing . If you are soft-hearted and hard-headed you give him the addresses of a number of free employment bureaus that you have looked up before , you put him on a car to go to the nearest , you pay his fare , and you wish him luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Municipal Employment Agency , make it their business to supply jobs for the jobless . If by searching out all these places ? which I can do in a couple of hours ? I can start 100 men a year toward the self-support and self-respect of salaried employees , am I not putting my philanthropy where it belongs , on a systematic basis of commonsense ? The only things in our lives that should not , can not , be reduced to system are the inspirational things . These , of course , are the real things . I would rather starve because inefficient than amass wealth because uninspired . Yet I have seen a case where a poet improved the quality his verse tremendously by forcing himself to go thru a period of business routine , and work , slave , endure , fight , sweat , faint from weariness , be scourged by oppression , and know what the multitudes have to bear . A poet who has never drudged is only half a poet ? and the poorer half , made of words ; the better half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems that the average person needs are the following : A health and longevity system ; a buying , spending and saving system ; a genius development system ; a social sincerity system ; a rational reading system ; a vital study system ; a sure promotion system ; a practical , broad-minded , zealoushearted church system ; a childlike play system ; a reverential , sympathetic , wise , clear and clean marriage system . How many of these systems do you need ? For a concrete example of personal system , let us take a man 's cravat . In the view of an inefficient man , all there is to a necktie is buying it , wearing it , wearing it out . In reality there are seven factors in a good cravat system ? ( 1 ) color , ( 2 ) weight , ( 3 ) cost , ( 4 ) preservation , ( 5 ) manner of tying , ( 6 ) method of repair , ( 7 ) final destiny . The color should match , or harmonize with , the suit of clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also blend with the owner 's peculiarities ? a green tie on a blue suit or a violet tie under red hair being a case of inefficient harmony . The weight should be sufficient to prevent the ruin of the fabric by a scarf-pin , but not sufficient to allow cracking from retained perspiration . The cost should be about half the set retail price ; once or twice a year most men 's shops have clearing-out sales , when fifty-cent and seventy-five-cent ties go for a quarter ; this is when every man should lay in a year 's supply . One 's common ties should perhaps be kept on a ring or rack near the dresser , and the best ties in a long box or bureau drawer , both being smoothed out and unwrinkled after being worn . The life of a scarf may be doubled by tying it when new with the large end as long as possible , leaving a section under the vest invisible , and protected ; as the exposed part gets shabby , draw this under the collar and tie the scarf with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilfully mended will last a third as long again . Finally , there are hosts of poor women who would gladly use the unspoiled ends of worn-out silk ties for cushionpillows , or for doll 's dresses the making of which would teach their little girls how to sew . A necktie is a trivial thing , but may become a great example . If by taking a little thought one can purchase all his ties for half the regular price and can double or treble the wearing qualities , may not the principles of economy , efficiency and satisfaction thus learned be an asset thru life ? One more illustration of system needed . Could you , with your eyes closed , lay your hand instantly on every one of your personal belongings ? in your home and in your office ? Could you , if you were suddenly to go blind , tell a friend where to locate each item pertaining to your work and your daily life ? A negative answer means that you need a filing system , to help you bring order out of chaos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of correspondence , bills , receipts , clippings , book notices , memoranda , notes , plans and ideas for improving work , and so forth , which to be handled properly must depend on a good filing system , dozens of them now being on the market . IF THERE IS A BETTER SYSTEM THAN YOURS , BORROW IT We have not touched upon the matter of a modern work system ? that would fill a volume in itself . The supreme fact to think over and act upon is this : Great numbers of people in your line of work have been studying out the very problems that baffle you , and somebody , somewhere , has doubtless arrived at the solution . How will you locate the man and learn the solution ? There are in the United States about 120,000 clergymen , 150,000 physicians . 1,200,000 teachers , 6 , - 000,000 farmers , 10,000,000 mechanics and manufacturers .

If the output and corresponding income of a bricklayer can be doubled by use of the right system ? a feat accomplished often since the development of scientific management , how much more can you achieve with your education , influence , environ-ment ? A dream as huge as a planet , a system as fine as a pin ? there you have the secret of the efficient man . What is your great life purpose ? How is your system of work speeding it on ?
