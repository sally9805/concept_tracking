txt RECOGNITION OF KOLCHAK . Ambassador Morris 's Report Considered the Bit of Evidence Needed . To the Editor of The New ' York Times : " . If recognition had been accorded three months ago the Kolchak Government a ? ? the dangers would not exist . " ( Report of Ambassador Morris to the United States State Department . ) What more is needed by the United States . Administration in order to recognize the All-Russian Government under Admiral Kolchak ? Three months have elapsed in an endless open and secret investigation , by a great many experts , official and vohinCary , of the situation in Siberia and the position of the Kolchak Government . They held a veritable trial on the meaning and intentions of this Government , forgetting entirely that it needs prompt help because it is in hard fighting against the , Bolsheviki . The Kolchak army did not receive in due time the war supplies , did not get moral support , and during three long months has hopelessly awaited recognition by the Allies . Meantime the Germans continued to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the cause of the temporary , we hope , reverses to the Kolchak army , as is testified by Ambassador Morris himself . This we hope , will be the last investigation of the situation . We are pleased indeed to hear from the Ambassador 's mouth the right Words about the situation , and particularly pleased by the assertion that if the Kolchak Government had been recognized three months ago there would be no dangers and failure on the Kolchak front . When I came just three months ago to this country , in my first interview in San Francisco newspapers , and later in New York newspapers , I emphasized the most important point-the necessity of immediate recognition of the Kolchak Government , and of prompt help to him by supplies and money .. What more is needed in order to i recognze the KolchakGovernment ? We should like to hear an open answer from those interested in the matter . But the best answer would be a solemn declaration by the United States Government for the recognition of the Kolchak Government , N. BORODIN . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the Editor of The New York Times : To a non-political female person the present situation at the Capitol is full of interest and amusement . We hear on the Republican side endless animadversions of our great Executive , because ; as they say , he has snubbed the Senate by not taking Cabot Lodge to Paris with him and failing to confide in Messrs . Knox , Borah , Poindexter , et al. , and of wholly ignoring not only the mild but the ferocious reservationists . Verily , ' t is a curious drama all around . Now we have the authority of the revered Abraham Lincoln far stating that this huge democracy of ours was founded as the exponent of a government " of the people , by . the people , and for the people . " And so Mr. Wilson is called " autocrat " on the one hand , " man of mystery " on the other ; " vacillating " and " immovable " ; at the same time , the fact remains that we never had eo hard-worked a President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence as he has done . Consider how constantly he has directly addressed Congress . How he has consulted business men , Mayors , Governors , financiers , labor leaders during his administration . Remember the laborious patience with which he toiled in Paris over the unspeakable snarl of warring interests around the peace table ! And now , like Peter the Hermit , he goes forth on his crusade for the League of Nations , upon the success of which depends the bulwark Wilson hopes to build , to protect the world from future cataclysms like the one which has just crushed the nations of Europe and Asia . It is the most magnificent exhibition of moral courage , combined with intellectual ability , that the world has seen LAURA . FAY SMITH . New York , Sept. 1 , 1919 . A Lesson In Fruit Farminel To the Editor of The New York Times : ? The farmer is getting his share of the general condemnation as a " profiteer " of the blackest type . To show that he is not always responsible , let me give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shipped two barrels , 844 pounds , of pears to a broker in New York . For these I was credited $8.54 Express came to 8.10 Balance , ( representing fruit , two men 's labor , cartage to station , and barrels ) .44 In explanation , I am told the packages arrived " in bad order , " they did not reach the market until Monday and so forth . Against which I can only say they were shipped by so-called " express " in ample time to catch the Friday afternoon train , the distance is exactly fifty miles and the barrels were new when packed . The inference is pretty obvious . I have several barrels more of these pears , several dozen of apples , still on the trees , but they will fall off and rot before I take the trouble to pick them , save a few for my own use . If any of our wiseacres can show me how to beat this kind of combination I am sure the information would be welcome , not only to myself but to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aug. 28 , 1919 . The Call to the Land To the Editor of The New York Times : Assuredly , the farmers must be the " chosen people . " The law declares them incapable of combining to restrain trade . Neither can they be guilty of profiteering . The only ** guaranteed price is that of wheat . The early morning dew bothers these chosen people , so the clock is returned to its old schedule . The fruit juices clause in the prohibition act is another concession to the farmer . Verily , " back to the land " doth look alluring . B. ORR . Jersey City , N. J. , Aug .
