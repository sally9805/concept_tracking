txt // have the elements of success , must have a supply of trained laborers at the call of the management for the purpose of running the machinery and handling the raw materials through their various stages . It is not only necessary for a factory to be located in the midst of a large population , but it is likewise essential that the population be one that can be depended upon to work efficiently and regularly . The two qualities , efficiency and regularity , are not always to be found in mere size of population . The most serious objections to the negro in the South is his unreliability as a worker in a plant . The writer knows of a number of iron plants located in the midst of a very considerable negro population , where the labor problem was one of grave concern . In two ways the negro can not be depended upon . He will invariably take several days for a recess after each pay day , thus crippling the plant by his absence , and he can not be made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the night turn he is likely to go to sleep at some critical time when alertness is necessary to preserve life and property . It is only by the most vigilant oversight that the negro can be kept from getting into trouble when he consents to be present at a plant . In some sections it has been found advisable to import foreign laborers to the Southern mines and mills rather than to attempt to work with the local supply of labor . The negroes are not alone in their unreliability as workers . In the mill districts of the Carolinas , one of the greatest difficulties with which the mill owner must contend , is absenteeism of the employees . footnote " There are probably enough workers in the various mill communities to man all of the machinery , but the great difficulty today with the cotton mill labor is that it is not constant and will not work every day in the week , no matter what the inducements may be . Every cotton mill in this state recognizes the fact that to have a full complement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle blows for the work to begin , it is practically necessary to carry a surplusage of from 20 to 25 per cent of spare help . ' " In a cotton mill in upper Carolina that has forty-seven weavers , who ought to make 564 days in a pay period , the president , to induce the maximum attendance of the weavers at their work , offered a premium for all who would report every day in the two weeks . In June there were 70 , x , = days lost out of the 564 that should have been worked . In August , with the same premium system in force , 1611 days were lost by the same help . This calculation does not account for the spare help that had to be used to fill in for the loss of time of the regular help . " ' The great source of expense in a factory is its labor bill . If the plant is well supplied with orders , the wages paid to the workers are a profitable investment . If , however , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to do is to cut down its most burdensome items of expense . The only time the laborer can be a profitable investment is when he is producing goods , so that it is absolutely essential for the prosperity of the plant , especially if it is an industry where there are fluctuations in orders and output , that the plant be so established that when bad times come , it can cut down its labor force to suit the limited requirements of such intervals , and yet be so placed that when good times return it can reemploy trained laborers . Mere numbers of people do not necessarily make a suitable labor environment , and what may be a good labor situation for one industry may be unfitted for another . Certain classes of production can employ only men , while there are others wherein women and children may be profitably engaged . The Anthracite Coal region offers employment to thousands of men , but women can not find work around mines . As a result , we find in mining sections a considerable population of available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recognizing the opportunity , and , as a result , we find located in the Sclmylk ill , Lehigh , and Susquehanna Valleys in Pennsylvania a number of silk mills , stocking factories , and other fabric industries which make use of this otherwise unemployed population . The real question which the manufacturer should consider is not " are there many people in a given community ? " but " will that community have available a sufficient amount of labor to suit my peculiar needs ? " 2 . Ready Accessibility to Repair Shops. ? If orders are plentiful , and a break occurs at any point in the system , a firm loses in shortened output and prestige , if not by actually forfeiting posted guarantees . So important is the question of adequate repair facilities in the iron and steel business that the large plants have entire sets of engines held in reserve to be ready for any unexpected breakdowns . A small plant can not afford to have reserve engines or duplicate apparatus to be ready for eventualities ; and , if it is so located that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inconveniently distant , it is liable to sustain severe losses through a mishap . IIence for a small plant , proximity to repair facilities is a highly desirable asset . If a plant is large , it need not consider the question of placing itself in the vicinity of repair houses , because it can better afford to have its own repair shops . Large steel plants , textile establishments , and other concerns invariably have their own repair equipment , and are constantly improving the mechanical end of their plants . In fact , if they are well organized and efficiently handled , the repair shops may do much more than merely act as repairing agents for the concern , and some plants have utilized their machine shops for the introduction of improvements through the entire establishment . The improvements , small as they are in individual items , amount in the aggregate to large savings for the firm , and the added expense that the repair // department requires for its upkeep is really a money-making investment for the firm , because it keeps the machines continuously running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output for a minimum expenditure of power and labor . 3 . Nearness to Good Banking and Credit Facilities. ? One of the most important assets a company may possess is good credit , without which it can hardly ever hope to advance during good times or even perpetuate its existence during stringent periods . A small concern is usually dependent upon nearby banks for its credit , and if it is inconveniently located , or is distant from good financial backing , it is putting itself into the business world with a severe handicap . If it is well known and near a number of good credit sources , it stands a much better chance of securing hacking on a reasonable basis than if it is dependent upon one institution that has little or no competition . A large concern is differently situated in the respect that its mere size gives it prestige in a wider financial circle , and enables it to get credit facilities in many ways and from many sources not open to small concerns . It can , therefore , practically ignore in its location local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be so large and important that it can dominate banks and financial institutions and largely create for itself a credit fortress ; but those organizations are few . Generally speaking , the smaller the plant , and the more local its market , the more unavoidable is its dependence upon local banks , and the more discriminating the care which must be exercised in its choice of a site . 4 , 5 . Ability to Build So As to Suit Special Needs of the Industry , and Ability to Expand Plant Cheaply. ? An organization , to realize its full measure of success , should build the plant in such a manner that the manufacturing process may be carried on with a minimum expenditure of time and material . The ideal plant is one that is adapted to // its special type of manufacturing . The ideal location is one that will permit such a plant to be built , and at the same time give it sufficient clearance space on all sides to permit additions to be made without necessitating a rearrangement of the machinery and equipment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in facilities . When a profitable business is increasing , a manufacturer can be in no worse position than to be unable to fill orders . If he does not fill them , rivals will soon appear in the field who will not only take his surplus business , but will become keen competitors for trade hitherto his own . Hence , if a plant is to be extended , it should be possible to make the enlargement in such a manner that at no time will there be any diminution in the output of the old plant until the new one can be utilized . It has been found that a single plant may be enlarged to a point where further extension does not tend toward economy , and where it is cheaper to build a new factory or plant than it is to keep on increasing the size of the old one . When a plant reaches those dimensions , expansion room does not need to be provided , but until those proportions are attained , an organization should endeavor to make provisions for future growth . To provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosperity of the concern , that it shall not burden itself at the beginning to provide for future prospects . It should not tie up much capital in a big plot of ground or large building in anticipation of future needs , because by so doing it is putting an unnecessary burden in fixed charges upon a present business , that should have no heavy expense at all . With such a load , the management can not experiment to improve the output , to cut costs in manufacturing , nor can it adopt a liberal policy to extend its market for the goods . One of the surest plans a concern can follow , to prevent it from ever requiring expansion room , is to incur a heavy // expense in securing a location that will permit future growth . In selecting a site , present demands should be amply satisfied . They should never be subordinated to future hopes . 6 , 7 . Low Rent and Taxes , and Freedom front Restrictive Ordinances or Onerous Legal or Other Regeiremeats. ? A selling organization must put itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be false economy to accept a cheap location if it were away from a much frequented situation . Frequented situations are almost invariably expensive . Taxes and rents are bound to be high , but the increased business that can be done in such a position will more than compensate for the heavy burden involved in the location . A manufacturing establishment has quite different conditions . Quality and quantity of output are the main factors which contribute to the success of a plant . The managers can not afford to stay out of the market , but it is not necessary to put the plant in an expensive location to have the goods-accessible to the consumer . The promoters should endeavor to locate in the best possible place that will allow of cheap manufacturing , and will give easy accessibility to the trade . The selling department , as a matter of fact , need not be in the plant at all , and in a great number of the largest concerns it is located in the commercial centers , far removed from the buildings which turn out the goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of a good selling location with economy in fixed charges for the producing part of the plant . Not only should care be exercised in locating away from high taxes and rents , but investigation should be made of the question of restrictive ordinances that may affect the plant . Manufacturing establishments are frequently annoyed and even seriously hampered by local ordinances which pre36 THE PRINCIPLES OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT vent them from carrying on their work in the manner most satisfactory to themselves . The people have a perfect right to pass laws and regulations which will make life pleasant in any given community . The property and welfare of a large number of people should not be sacrificed for any one group of citizens ; yet , on the other hand , the manufacturer can not afford to sustain restriction in output or unnecessary expense for some objection , either fancied or real , of the surrounding neighborhood . In selecting a site for a new plant , therefore , care should be exercised that the new factory shall not be the cause of hostile legislation . Some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal authorities of a large city to dispose of the garbage by an incinerating process . The contract was one satisfactory both to the municipality and to the officials of the concern . Fortified by these considerations , the corporation purchased an abandoned white lead works and erected expensive apparatus for the purpose of reducing their garbage . No objection was made to the new installation , but it had not been in operation one week before there was a veritable hurricane of vituperation heaped upon everyone connected with the plant and upon those who made the contract . Injunctions were issued , within a month the company became involved in scores of law-suits , and finally had to vacate the premises . 8 . Adequate Fire-Fighting Facilities and Low Insurance Rates. ? A manufacturer in selecting his site should take into consideration the fact that a fire can injure his building in one of two ways . It may either originate within the walls of his own structure or invade it from the outside . The internal and private fire-fighting facilities will be treated later . Here we shall note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country have poor fire-fighting faciliTHEORY // ties . As a consequence manufacturers in those districts pay insurance premiums disproportionate to the assessments , the structure of their buildings , and the nature of their business would otherwise demand . Insurance companies are very critical of the fire-fighting facilities of a community . In almost every town there is a fire-danger zone assessed at a higher rate than is the surrounding districts . In taking into consideration the public fire-fighting facilities , the manufacturer does well to examine carefully the following features : 1 . Water supply : By whom it is owned , its organization . Has the place high pressure mains ? Is there ever danger of water famines , and all other points which may in any way affect its efficiency in fighting a large or small conflagration. 2 . Fire department : Its organization , including the personnel , from the chiefs down to the least important man of the department . Is it a paid or volunteer company ? The extent and nature of the equipment of the fire stations , the number and location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couplings , and all other points which may affect the utility of the protection at a critical time . 3 . Fire-alarm system : Here the investigation turns on the number of alarms in the community , their location , efficiency , design , and other similar considerations . 4 . Fire department auxiliaries : Under this head are considered the efficiency of the police department , arrangement of the streets , the proximity to other communities which can give assistance , the possible value of such aid in time of need ; is the district menaced with overhead wires ? Are the building laws efficient and well executed ? Some cities have gone to the trouble and expense of installing within their fire-danger zones special water mains with equipment to keep the water pressure at a high point throughout the system . These mains are for fire use only . In the year 1900 , the insurance companies raised the fire // rates in Philadelphia 25 cents per $100 on all risks located in the congested district . In 1904 , a high pressure system , equivalent to twenty steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . The stationary pumps at the water front can deliver to the hydrants a water pressure of 300 pounds to the square inch . The plant is run by gas , and the entire system can be put into full operation in seven minutes . Only forty-five seconds are necessary for the pumps to develop 300 pounds pressure . The plant is capable of supplying fifteen 1-inch streams of water , which may be concentrated on any block within the protected district . When the plant was tested and accepted , the Fire Underwriters ' Association reduced the fire rates to the old basis . ' This is one of a number of examples which may be cited showing the importance of being in a good fire-fighting community . If a person is manufacturing a class of goods not especially inflammable , it is inadvisable for him to erect his works near another plant whose commodities are noted for their inflammability . Proximity to such a building forces the former manufacturer to take especial precautions in erecting his plant . It necessitates the use of fire walls and other expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance rate , while notwithstanding all these precautions his position is still precarious . CHAPTER IV THE IDEAL SITUATION THE type of manufacturing that is carried on by an organization determines to a very considerable degree the most favorable site for its plant . There may be three kinds of situations for plants , viz. : ( 1 ) country , ( 2 ) city , ( 3 ) suburbs , and each one of the three offers peculiar advantages . 1 . COUNTRY . The economic advantages offered by a country location are few in number , but for some industries they are exceedingly important . . The country offers , as inducements to the manufacturer , cheap land , low rents and taxes , and freedom from restrictive ordinances . These favorable considerations enable interested people to purchase sufficient territory to permit of the adaptation of a plant to the special requirements of the process , and at the same time allow them to provide for space enough to grow without making it necessary for them to tie up too much capital in unproductive ground . ffhe country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for industries . In the first place , it is hard to draw to sparsely settled sections a sufficient body of skilled laborers to make it possible to keep the plant continuously employed . A firm of stove founders once conceived the idea of erecting a plant in a small town at a considerable distance from any large city . They were exempted from taxes for a term of years and had many other favors granted to them , yet in spite of all the assistance they eventually had to abandon the plant on account of its inability to hold skilled labor in the district . If the industry is one where skilled 39 // labor is not an important factor , it is sometimes possible to recruit workers from the surrounding districts . The cotton manufacturers in the South soon exhausted the labor in the small towns wherein thy were located , and recruited their ranks from the back country by means of advertising throughout the district for workers . August Kohn in his book gives a number of illustrations of the advertising matter that was used , and speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting labor . i . The country offers very little inducement to working people to settle within the vicinity of a plant so situated , unless the plant is of considerable size . Another objection that may be offered to a country location is that it is not near supply houses or market , and repair shops are apt to be unhandy . No one can afford to let a plant stand idle at any time , least of all when supplied with orders ; so , if an accident happens to a running machine , the renewal parts should be available to make immediate repairs . If a plant is in the country , it is likely to be away from supply houses , and must , therefore , carry in stock a great many more duplicate parts of equipment than if it were in a large city . To carry duplicate parts , one must tie up money in unproductive material . The pieces may be used sooner or later , or it may happen that new machines will come in which can not use those parts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A large plant can ignore the necessity of keeping in contact with supply houses and repair shops and similar advantages , because its mere size will make it possible for it to keep a repair department and likewise make it profitable for it to carry sufficient supplies to be independent of any outside concern . The plants of large companies , like the United States Steel Corporation , l always have their own foundries // and repair shops as a part of the plant . The Gary plant at Gary , Indiana , has , in connection with its steel plant , foundries , boiler shops , machine shops , carpenter shops , and pattern shops , so that it is practically independent of all outside aid . So far as the market is concerned , to the manufacturer of steel rails , structural iron , or any large and heavy material whose products go over the entire country , nearness to a city is of minor consideration , because their markets are widely scattered . With such production , transportation facilities and switching privileges are the essential needs rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a city , the cost of living is greater than in the country , but the city offers to working people a larger number of economic and social advantages than does the country . Wages , as a rule , are higher , and there are more opportunities for advancement open to the ambitious person , because city evening schools and other educational advantages present means of self-improvement that are not as a rule offered to country dwellers . Commercial houses in large cities afford attractive employment to women and girls in the way of stenographic positions , clerical work , and bookkeeping , while the large department stores employ hundreds of girls as sales people . When a working family is located in a large city , every one in the family has a greater opportunity of securing employment . The family is not so dependent upon the earnings of the older male members as it is when located in the country . Many industries peculiarly adapted to the employment of women and girls find that a city location is by far the more desirable . Textiles , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons for this being that women and children are more readily procured for employment . The northeastern part of Philadelphia is a great textile center , very largely // because of the location there of large numbers of shipyards , machine shops , foundries , steel works , saw works , leather curing , and other plants which employ men almost exclusively . Besides the fact that working people can get work more readily in the city , there is another consideration . The city offers more entertainment than does the country . The amusement and social side of life is usually more pleasant in the city than in the country . There is more gaiety in the town . Aside from the question of labor , the city location is better for being near to a market . This is an exceedingly important consideration for industries directly dependent to a greater or less extent upon other plants , e.g. , box factories , yarn mills , etc . Industries which are varied by styles or tastes of people do better if located in town . Small manufacturers can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They can learn of selling markets more readily , and can make quicker deliveries because of better express service . A third manifest advantage of a city location , especially for a small plant , is , as we have already seen , that it will be near to repair shops and supply houses . In addition to being near supply houses and repair shops , a city environment usually contributes the advantage of local banking and credit-obtaining facilities . These latter items are of great importance to small concerns . A large plant , to carry on any of its important schemes , must be able to secure financial backing from the great money centers ; hence , so far as credit is affected , location is not a matter of material concern . Moreover , a large organization can , either directly or indirectly , establish local banks and thus create for itself a credit source of considerable importance . To the smaller plant neither access to the large money centers nor ability to establish and dominate banks is possible . It must depend // upon friendly outsiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of the enterprise . If a small organization is near only one bank , it may have to consent to hard borrowing terms . If it is near many , it will have a much better chance to get reasonable concessions which will help it along the road of continued prosperity . The main disadvantages of the city are high land cost , entailing large rents and taxes and a liability of being compelled to obey municipal ordinances which may restrict the output of the concern or increase its running expenses . To summarize the entire situation , if there were no other place than a city or the country to establish a plant , a general statement might be made that for a small plant a city location is better , while for a large concern a country site would be more advantageous . 3 . Suuuims. ? The suburbs of large cities , however , offer a third situation . The suburbs possess the advantage of being able to combine to a great extent the advantages of both the city and the country . In the suburbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unduly burden the concern to provide for future growth ; and restrictive ordinances are likewise usually less frequent than in the cities . Labor is easily persuaded to come to the outskirts of large cities , because , as a rule , rents are lower and living is cheaper , while at the same time the trolley-car , telephone , and other conveniences have made it possible for the suburbanite to partake of the advantages of the city . Suburban locations are likewise liable to be in the region of good railway facilities . Large cities are apt to be the meeting-places of a number of railways , and many communities have built belt lines connecting these various roads , making it possible for the suburban manufacturer to have the choice of several lines by which he can ship his goods . Where belt lines are not in existence , it is much easier for the suburban manufacturer to obtain private sidings to coin44 THE PRINCIPLES OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT 6 peting railways than it is in either city or remote country locations . The suburbs can provide for the other considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to markets , banks , and credit facilities ? nearly , if not quite , as well as the city itself . In addition to the advantages naturally coincident with a location either in country , city , or suburbs , there are frequently other inducements offered by various bodies to encourage the industrial development of the community . Railroads are very anxious to have factories locate along their lines . The two bodies , the local community , and the railroad company , work in harmony , although each is working for its particular end , the former to secure plants , the latter to obtain traffic . The railroads have organized industrial departments which they call by various navies . The officials in charge of these departments keep on file all available information relating to the natural and artificial advantages of the towns and districts tapped by their lines . The artificial advantages of a town or district are those favors and concessions granted by the residents of the place to any newcomers who may be induced to bring a factory or some other kind of institution within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of manufacturing plants . Much of the recent increase in Southern prosperity has been due to the location of profitable cotton mills . " The addition of such an industry as cotton manufacturing could not but increase the value of real estate in Spartanburg County very greatly for several reasons . " 1 . The cotton mills have been located in all parts of the county . There have arisen small towns wherever the mills have been erected , and the property , which was formerly on the market as farming lands , is now sold on the basis of city lots , which has elevated values very much . The mills located in the vicinity of the larger towns have developed the outskirts of these towns ; so that // the property has become very valuable , while before the coming of the mills the property was not rated as city property . -2 . The enormous increase in the annual income of the county of Spartanburg , caused by the coming of the mills , has caused a general prosperity , and desirable property was soon purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity came the desire to.own homes and real estate . With ready purchasers always in sight there was a constant demand for real estate , and with the demand came the increase in value . " 3 . The dividends annually paid out in Spartanburg go to swell the bank accounts of the people in the county , and this money is soon reinvested . Real estate is considered an excellent investment in Spartanburg , and many of the dollars paid out by the mills go to purchase real estate . There is always a demand for good real estate , and there is a large amount of property changing hands in this county each year . " 1 What is true of South Carolina and the cotton mills is likewise true of other parts of the country , and , as a result , communities scattered all over this land offer various inducements to factory managers . These inducements may be classified under the following heads , viz. : ( 1 ) free land , ( 2 ) free building , ( 3 ) exemption from taxes , ( 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( 6 ) miscellaneous favors. ( 1 ) Free Land. ? The Boards of Trade of many towns have committees appointed whose work is to advertise the advantages of their particular localities . These committees keep informed of new projects proposed by various outside concerns , and they endeavor to secure the interest of the promoters by presenting to them the advantages of their town , and at the same time these Board of Trade workers endeavor to secure the active co-operation of the citizens by having them contribute money for the purpose of investing in factory sites which will be at the disposal of the Board of Trade , to give to companies that are looking for a factory location . Sometimes promoters can interest a group of citizens to col46 THE PRINCIPLES OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT lest sufficient funds to purchase a s ite for the it enterprise . Of course the citizens who will be interested in securing a factory site and are willing to contribute , will be the ones most likely to form the membership of a local Board of Trade ; but this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade 's action and the citizens ' action is that the one is a systematic endeavor , while the other is an occasional one . In some cases the town itself may appropriate money to secure factory sites ; and , in some other instances , a private citizen may give a piece of land for the same purpose . It is far more common , however , for the land to be contributed by the Board of Trade or the citizens acting as a body on some special occasion . ( 2 ) Free Building. ? Some years back it was not uncommon for the Boards of Trade and other organizations to encourage the location of factories by providing buildings . This building ) night be given outright to the factory owners , but more usually the arrangements were as follows : The townspeople were informed what type of building was desired , and they would erect the structure according to the specifications and then lease the building to the promoters of the enterprise for a sum of money which might or might not be nominal . It , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination of the lease , the factory managers then had the option of buying the building for a fixed sum provided for in the contract , and usually they willingly paid this amount . ( 3 ) Exen ? ption from Taxes. ? Tax exemption is probably the most common form of concession given to prospective manufacturers . The release from tax payments extends from one year to a decade , and in some cases even longer , although the latter is not common . This tax exemption as a rule means only municipal tax . It does not relieve the concern from the payment of state or county levies . ( 4 ) Subscriptions to Stock. ? Sometimes the citizens in // it community are not only anxious to have various kinds of factories locate within their borders , but are willing and even desire to invest in a proposed scheme if the promoters will locate in their vicinity . Frequent instances are on record in which some enterprising individual has enlisted the support of a community and put up a plant with the money supplied either wholly or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of agreements with the promoters . In some cases the promoter becomes merely the managing em ployee of the concern , being remunerated by regular salary ; and in case the plant is a success , he is given , at the end of it certain time , a percentage of the capital stock by vote of the board of directors . At other times the inhabitants sub-scribe to the stock and become stockholders in the firm , but do not have sufficient control of the enterprise to have more than one or two representatives on the board of directors . ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) Cask Boners and Miscellaneous Eavors. ? In some rare cases communities offer cash inducements . An ilhistration of such a concession is afforded in Urbana , Illinois . When the Big Four Railroad Company desired to build its car and repair shops for the Peoria division , the towns along the line started an active competition . Urbana secured the shops by offering a bonus of $40,000 . Other inducements granted are sometimes free gas , or free power for a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a plant as one of its inducements . The c citizens of another town are now contemplating the building of a belt line to connect competing railroads , and are offer ing factory sites at a very moderate cost along the proposed belt line . There are numbers of other inducements of a ininor nature , all of which are given to secure an industrial population . These artificial inducements are not peculiar to any sec tion of the country , nor to either country , suburbs , or city , although it is more common for the country or small town 4$ THE PRINCIPLES OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT communities to make the offers than for the large centers of population . When a person is contemplating the building of a factory , it is well indeed for him to secure all the possible concessions and inducements that a district will yield ; but if the natural advantages are not present , it is a poor plan to take advantage of some extraordinary offer . The artificial inducement may give the organization a start ; but unless the natural factors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant will then have to struggle along under a severe handicap and must eventually fail . The artificial factors should be considered only when they supplement natural advantages , and should never be the determining consideration in making a factory location . CHAPTER V BUSINESS CONCENTRATION AND INTEGRATION WITHIN the past decade , there has been in the United States a remarkable development of industrial activities . The year 1898 marks the opening of the era of widespread plant consolidations . Between that time and June 30 , 1900 , of the 185 industrial consolidations which then controlled 2,040 active plants , no less than 112 had been consummated within those thirty months . ' In Moody 's Jl ( ontal for the year 1908 there are recorded about 400 industrial organizations which , if we include the bonded indebtedness , have a capitalization exceeding $5,000,000,000 . The total investnients represented in industrials in the United States is no h , ss than $12,686,000,000.2 When we consider the enornious number of plants and establishments these investments ' Must represent , and realize that stockholders are ever clamoring for dividends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great demand . No one can reasonably hold a person responsible for the successful running of an enterprise unless the organization is in such a condition that the person in charge can have a fair chance to administer the affairs of the firm profitably . The capitalization of prospective earnings has been one 49 // of the most fruitful causes of industrial shipwrecks . Enterprising promoters have endeavored to assure the prosperity of their projects by concentrating into one organization all the larger rival interests , thus obtaining a practical monopoly . In some instances this scheme has turned out successfully ; in others , the subscribers to the projects have found the schemes to be merely expensive methods of purchasing richly engraved paper . A plant to be a profit-making investment should be able to manufacture goods at the least possible outlay , and dispose of them to an ever-ready market . It should not be burdened with a load of fixed charges in the way of a heavy bonded indebtedness or preference dividends , neither should its official salary list be unduly large nor its administrative expenses excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device to inveigle money from the confiding public , he will not concern himself seriously about the soundness of the corporation 's standing , provided he is able to sell its securities , and is safe from criminal prosecution . Sound business policy does not consist in gathering together a heterogeneous lot of plants and factories to create a large corporation . The size of the company should be a mere incident in the general scheme of instituting a profit-making creation . Indeed , to increase the size without at the same time acquiring compensating advantages weakens the company . The burdens of management are heavily increased unless the widening scope of the plant 's activities means possibilities of obtaining cheaper raw materials , of developing less expensive means of production , or of obtaining better and more secure markets . Financiers should carry out the idea of business integration rather than that of excessive concentration . Business , integration is the process whereby the owners of an enterprise secure a more or less complete control of all the steps of manufacturing and distributing a commodity from the raw // materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , means the assembling of like plants for the purpose of eliminating selling competition.2 Consolidation means a combination of both integration and concentration . All large corporations are to some extent a combination of both integration and concentration ; but as a general proposition no combination can be secure in its position unless some form of integration is dominant in its consolidating process . In our recent development there have been brought to prominent notice five classes of consolidation , and each one has many successful concerns represented in its ranks . These classes may be stated as follows : 1 . The complete integration of the manufacturing process , wherein the product is made under the direction of one management from the securing and preparing of the raw material to the placing of the finished goods on the market . 2 . The integration of conveyance and manufacturing , and the concentration of factories . Here the producer does not own the sources of raw material , but controls the cheapest possible means by which raw materials can be conveyed from the sources of supply to the manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible phase to the making of finished products from the raw materials . 3 . An integration and concentration of factories and distributing houses . In this case , the manufacturer does not own , neither does he control , the sources of supplies or the transportation facilities . He builds or acquires plants which are specially adapted to handling the products of various sec-1 // tions where the raw commodities are made . The presence of these large plants in a community does not necessarily imply that the organization will force unfair price concessions from the producers of the raw goods . In fact , it may even raise prices , but in so doing it is assured that rival concerns must pay at least an equally high amount for the same or for even an inferior quality . In addition to securing the goods on this basis , the firms further guard themselves by developing great selling departments by which they reach the consumer directly , and always keep an outlet for their manufactured products . 4 . Integration wherein the manufacturers secure profits by utilizing all possible by-products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . 5 . Integration and concentration wherein the product is protected by patents and distinguishing trademarks , and a market is created for the goods by wide-spread advertising . As the market expands , plants are erected at strategic points to facilitate selling and lower distributive expenses . The United States Steel Corporation is the classic example of the first of these combinations . When it was organized in 1901 it included thirteen different organizations in part or whole , and since that time it has acquired no less than twenty large corporations . If we examine into the properties that have been acquired by the steel corporation , we shall note one feature that reflects the profound judgment of the moving spirits in that great organization . In every case where an acquisition has been made , the properties acquired have been ones which will contribute to the importance of the organization in one of several ways . 1 . Give it better supplies of raw material which will be used in the manufacture of iron and steel products . 2 . Give it better transportation facilities and cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills , and likewise of taking the finished product away . // Give it an outlet for its own products by making fin ishing plants which will change its unfinished goods into commodities that can be directly consumed . Give it control of complete units which are situated at strategic points with respect to market and raw materials . The map ( Fig. 5 ) shows the extent of the corporation 's properties and the types of plants and possessions it holds . Even if we are skeptical of the high values placed upon the following inventories , we can not fail to be impressed with the types of properties . The industry is completely in tegrated . The following tables have been taken from Jinn sey 's Magazine and the " Eighth Annual Report of the Steel Corporation . " The first one shows an inventory of the properties of the corporation . The second one compares the production of the properties for the years 1908 and 1909 . In looking over the first table we are struck by the mere physical bigness of the corporation . The second one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one we see the possession of all material necessary to change crude material into any grade or kind of finished material , from pig-iron into the most highly finished steel product . The second table shows us what these plants produce . It tells us that the corporation is ready to market all kinds of materials . // The United States Steel Corporation , with its tremendous possessions , is capable of controlling about 60 per cent of the steel output of the country . If its rivals should ever begin an aggressive onslaught on its markets , the company could easily defend itself by meeting all cuts in prices . Indeed , with its great possessions and equipment , the United States Steel Corporation could carry warfare into the enemy 's camp and reduce prices to a ruinous figure for all outsiders . In spite of a number of strong temptations the company has pursued a very commendable price policy . After the 1907 panic the Steel Trust was the last concern to attempt to secure orders by cutting prices , and it finally lowered only as a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company has solved its market problem by securing control of the raw materials and the transportation facilities , and by placing complete producing units in such positions that they are accessible at many consuming points . The Standard Oil Company is the best representative of the second typo of consolidation . This organization obtains its raw materials by leasing oil lands and securing exclusive purchase options on the output of oil fields . It does not attempt to buy outright great stretches of oil-producing territory , but rather seeks to maintain its position by developing along two lines , viz. : 1 . It has obtained the best and cheapest means for the handling and the transportation of petroleum from the fields to the refineries , and from refineries to the markets . 2 . It has the most complete set of refineries in existence , and has located them at strategic points throughout the country . In the distribution of petroleum the Standard Oil Company employs 8,000 miles of trunk pipe lines , with 75,000 miles of feeders from wells ; storage tanks for crude oil , holding 82 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America and // 2,000 abroad ; 60 bulk steamers for ocean traffic and 12 for foreign coasting trade , with 150 steamers and barges at home ; 3,000 tank stations in America and 5,000 elsewhere . ' The managers of the concern have developed refining apparatus which makes feasible every possible saving , and enables the preparation of all by-products . The process of manufacture does not end with the mere making of the oil . The cans which are destined to carry illumination into the peasant huts of rugged Italy , and the barrels which will hold lubricant for the shops of our own mid-continent are all made in the refineries . The map ( Fig. 6 ) on the following page is compiled from the report of the Commissioner of Corporations , entitled " The Transportation of Petroleum . " On it are shown the location of the refineries of the Standard Oil Company and its competitors , and likewise the oil fields , pipe lines , and the territory supplied by the refineries of the Standard Oil Company . It is interesting to note the advantage that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . The seaboard territory has its most important points at Portland , Me. , Boston , Providence , New London , Wilson Point , Conn. , Richmond , Wilmington , Charleston , Savannah , and Jacksonville , all reached by boat . From these ports the oil is distributed inland to the local territories by rail . The following excerpt is from the text of the report above cited : 2 " ADVANTAGES DUE TO GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF REFINERIES. ? The great advantages which the Standard Oil Company enjoys over its competitors with respect to transportation are undoubtedly in part the direct outgrowth of the enormous scale on which it conducts business and of the favorable location of its refineries . They are in some degree , at least , natural advantages . // Disregarding the que'stion of the origin of the power of the Standard Oil Company , and considering only its present position , the advantages which it possesses with respect to transportation are certainly in part independent of any present discriminations from railroad companies . " In the first place , the fact that the Standard Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competitor who has only one . Even were it not for the transportation of crude oil by trunk pipe lines to long distances , and if the refineries were all in or near the oil fields , by having several refineries the Standard Oil Company would still be nearer to many markets than its competitors . Thus , by operating refineries in the oil fields of Pennsylvania , Ohio , Texas , Kansas , Colorado and California , it could supply each section of the country from the nearest plant , and could save much in the cost of transportation as compared with a refiner restricted to a single distributing point . " ADVANTAGES DUE TO PIPE LINE TRANSPORTATION. ? ThiS advantage of location is , however , very greatly increased by the use of trunk pipe lines to transport crude oil to refineries much nearer to great centers of consumption than the oil fields themselves . The Standard operates enormous refineries at the sea-board . These are much nearer to several great centers of population than the majority of competing refineries , and they also offer the advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standard 's great refinery at Whiting is several hundred miles nearer to the markets of the West than most of the independent refineries . " The advantage of the location of the sea-board refineries , and of the Whiting refinery , grows out of the fact that the cost of pipe line transportation to them from the oil fields is much less than the cost of rail transportation , which the competitors have for the most part to pay in order to reach the same points . " This quotation has added significance , because it is taken from a document hostile to the Standard Oil Company . The report clearly shows that the founders of the organization saw two things : the importance of developing the cheapest methods of transportation and the advantages of strategic locations . It is those two factors wlich will account for its permanent success . An excellent illustration of the third class of consolida62 THE PRINCIPLES OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT Lion is afforded by the American Tobacco Company . This concern , according to the report of the Commissioner of Corporations in 1909 , consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including bonds . This would be reduced to the net amount of $316,000,000 , of stocks and bonds in the hands of the public if we were to eliminate duplication of intercompany ownership of securities . ' The American Tobacco Company began its monopolistic combination in 1890 with the union of the five principal cigarette manufacturers in the country , in this way securing control of 90 per cent of the cigarette business of the United States . In 1891 , it began the policy of extending its dominion over other fields of the tobacco industry . By 1894 , it started a vigorous campaign to secure the plug-tobacco business , and by 1898 the competitors of the American Tobacco Company were willing to be absorbed . After it had secured control of the cigarette and plug business , a powerful group of financiers , among whom were Thomas F. Ryan , P. A. B. Widener , and others bought up the Blackwell 's Durham Tobacco Company , which was an important manufacturer of smoking tobacco , and the National Cigarette Tobacco Company . In addition to those companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Liggett &; Meyers Tobacco Company , the control of which was exceedingly important to the American Tobacco Company . The American Tobacco Company at once realized the importance of the movement , and willingly made concessions by which this new combination was made a part of the old . A further integration and concentration was made in 1900 by the acquisition of the American Snuff Company , which included all the important American and Continental companies doing // business in this country . Further absorption was brought about in 1904 , when the foreign tobacco interests became a part of the American Tobacco Company . In 1901 , the tobacco combination took another step toward integration by the organization of the American Cigar Company . By 1906 , it had about 15 per cent of the cigar output of the United States ; but it has not been so successful in dominating the cigar business as it was in the cigarette , smoking tobacco , plug tobacco , and snuff businesses . In 1898 , the tobacco combination , to secure for itself a sure means of distributing its goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 1906 , it owned stock in the following corporations engaged in jobbing cigars and tobaccos : i M. Blaskower Company , San Francisco , Cal . R. D. Burnett Cigar Company , Birmingham , Ala . Cliff Weil Cigar Company , Richmond , Va . J. &; B. Moos , Chicago , Ill . J. &; B. Moos Company , Cincinnati , Ohio . Le Compt , Dusel &; Goodloe , Philadelphia , Pa . J. J. Goodrum Tobacco Company , Atlanta , Ga . Louisiana Tobacco Company , New Orleans , La . Smokers ' Paradise Company , Atlantic City , N. J. Jordan , Gibson &; Baum , Memphis , Tenn . Not only has the American Tobacco Company entrenched itself in the jobbing business , but it has even gone farther by securing the control of powerful retail stores . In 1901 , a concern by the name of the United Cigar Stores Company was incorporated in New Jersey . In 1906 , it had an outstanding capital of $1,950,000 , of which the tobacco combination held all the preferred stock and bonds and $340,000 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of its control . In addition to the United Cigar Stores Company of New Jersey , the American Tobacco Company was controlling , through the United Cigar Stores Company , the following subsidiary corporations : United Cigar Stores Company ( Incorporated ) , of Illinois . United Cigar Stores Company ( Incorporated ) , of Rhode Island . United Cigar Stores Company Agency . The Royal Company . Moebs Cigar Stores Company . William Baeder &; Co . United Merchants Realty and Improvement Company . The total number of stores owned and controlled by these companies , including the parent company , amounted , in 1906 , to 392.2 In addition to this there were a number of premium stations , depots , and the National Cigar Stands Company , which was closely affiliated with the American Tobacco Company by heavy loans made by the latter company . The National Cigar Stands Company on March 2 , 1907 , had 2,062 contracts in force with retail druggists throughout the country.3 This does not complete the retail connections controlled by the Tobacco Combination . Jobbing houses do a retail business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely affiliated with the large corporations . The most important of these concerns are the Acker , Merrall &; Condit Company of New York City , which operates ten stores in New York and has branches in Asbury Park , Baltimore , Md. , Far Rockaway , Flushing , Greenwich , Conn. , and seven other stores in the immediate vicinity of New York City . // Besides the Acker Company , the Tobacco Combination con-trols : Cliff Weil Company ( Incorporated ) , Richmond , Va . J. J. Goodrum Tobacco Company , Atlanta , Ga . R. D. Burnett Cigar Company , Birmingham , Ala . Le Compt , Dusel &; Goodloe , Philadelphia , Pa . Further integration of the Tobacco Combination 's busi-ness is evident in its ownership of concerns which manufac-ture tobacco accessories . The following list of companies engaged in contributory enterprises , in addition to the above mentioned , is taken from the commissioner 's report : 2 MacAndrews &; Forbes Company , Manufacturers of Lico-rice Paste . They have almost a complete monopoly of this important raw material for the tobacco business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company . Golden Belt Manufacturing Company . Conley Foil Company . Johnston Tin Foil and Metal Company . American Machine and Foundry Company . New Jersey Machine Company . International Cigar Machinery Company . Standard Tobacco Stemmer Company . Garson Vending Machine Company . Kentucky Tobacco Product Company . Kentucky Tobacco Extract Company . Manhattan Briar Pipe Company . Baltimore Briar Pipe Company . Amsterdam Supply Company . Thomas Cusack Company , a bill-posting concern . Florodora'Tag Company.3 // In looking over this list of factories and enterprises which the Tol r ( ( acco Combination owns and controls , one can not help being impressed with the substantial unity of its acquisitions . Those factories which do not make some form of tobacco , manufacture something which is exceedingly useful for the tobacco producer . The tin-foil company make the wrapping for the various kinds of products . The box company 's entire product is used in casing the output . The various ingredients necessary for the production of the tobacco are likewise under their control , as one can see from their ownership of the licorice business . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but advertising concerns . The Florodora Tag Company formerly did an immense business in the distribution of premiums . When it does not actually make the products it takes means to secure the raw materials at the lowest possible cost . The Amsterdam Supply Company was organized for the sole purpose of acting as a purchasing agent for the American Tobacco Company . The by-product type of integration must have two essentials before a firm can afford to spend money on equipment to work up its subsidiary material . 1 . It must have the assurance that the market conditions will be such that the by-products will always have a ready sale . 2 . It must have a main industry sufficiently large to provide enough material to keep the by-product plants continually running . As a consequence those industries that have developed the by-product features are almost invariably large concerns , and they are usually very active in developing their business by various schemes to keep their names before the public and create a demand for their goods . The beef-packing industries present the most widely known example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the by-products obtained in the course of slaughtering is a task in itself . The average live weight of a beef is between 1,000 and 1,100 pounds , while the dressed weight ranges between 575 and 650 pounds . l Within a recent period , only the hides and tallow of the 450 pounds of non-edible material were saved . At present every ounce of this waste product is compelled to yield some tribute to the packer . From the horns and hoofs are made various grades of glues , buttons , and hair-pins , and they are made the basis for the manufacture of cyanide and chrome . The albumin in the blood is used to make an insoluble printers ' ink . It is also used by tanners to finish leather , and by sugar refiners to make possible the inviting whiteness of their product . Dried blood , bones , tankage , and the ground waste of hoof and horn scraps make a fertilizer rich in nitrogen which , when combined with acid phosphate , becomes the source by which otherwise infertile soil is made to bring forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the packing-house sheep is made into fabrics to clothe us , but before it is given to the textile worker , the oil is extracted , making the non-shrinking basis of wool soap and also the essence of various soothing skin lotions and toilet preparations designed to beautify the users . If we are sick , our jaded appetite may he tempted to accept gelatine extracted from the bones of calves ; if convalescent , our system may be induced to increase in strength by absorbing " Soluble Beef , " the predigested and concentrated substance of meat . The intestines of the animals are the casings for sausage which is made from meat otherwise unsalable . The gun we carry on a hunting trip is hardened with bone carbon , the handle of the knife which we use to dress our game is from the packing house . If camp fare disagrees with our // stomach , we can vary our diet with beef extract and allay the pains of indigestion with pepsin and pancreatin . The baby starts out in life using a bone-capped nursing bottle and teething @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gift of hair , the switch on the end of the beef 's tail will be offered to supply the deficiency . Collar buttons , pipe stems , and dice , brewers ' isinglass , and brushes , soap and glycerine , washing powder , and sand paper are all products sent forth from the various departments of these great concerns . So minutely has the by-product feature been carried out that the glands of 100,000 sheep are carefully preserved and treated to produce one pound of suprarenalin , a substance whose astringent qualities have proven invaluable in delicate surgical operations . ' The National Biscuit Company and the Singer Manufacturing Company are two good examples of the fifth type of integration . Both concerns have fortified every distinguishing feature and improvement about their articles by patents and trademarks . Both concerns have been very careful to guard the quality of their goods , and neither forgets that advertising is necessary for publicity . Each one has built plants at various places to make easier the distribution of products to the consumers located in various districts . The National Biscuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . 2 The Singer Company has plants not only in the United States , but also in Canada and Scotland . ' It is a common practice for concerns to erect plants in foreign countries when duties on their products are high , because in so doing they avoid the tariff charges , and are thus able to compete with the foreign manufacturers on more equal grounds . // In actual practice almost every large concern is successful , because it has utilized to a greater or less extent several of the above-mentioned methods of integration . None of the companies in the above illustrations are successful exclusively because of their characteristic type of integration . The United States Steel Corporation , for instance , derives a large part of its income from its extensive by-product manufacturing , while the packing houses are exceedingly careful to cultivate every possible market . They advertise their goods broadcast , and have their agents everywhere drumming up trade . The question that the directors have to decide is , how far shall we push expenditures along any one line of consolidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manufacture give as large a return as the same amount spent in advertising ? Will lowering the cost increase our trade or profits so much as changing our selling methods or securing control of raw materials ? In the last analysis , all of these consolidations seek to do one thing ? to secure sufficient control of the market to assure the manufacturer a profitable outlet for his goods . Some types of industries can secure this control most readily by obtaining the sources of raw materials , some by cutting factory costs , and others can get it only by developing the selling department to a high degree of efficiency . All are struggling for the patronage of the public , and the strongest appeal any one of them can make is to give the best value for the lowest price . When one secures control of the raw materials , he can make the lowest price in any community simply by compelling his rivals to pay a higher amount for the crude products . If , however , the supply of raw materials is such that all can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture with the least cost is in the strongest position to gain the market , provided all other things are equal . In many instances , the best methods of carrying on // an industry are so generally known that the rival interests have little or no advantage over each other in that respect . In those cases , the victory goes to either the one who has lowest distribution expenses and sells the cheapest , or to the one who by judicious advertising or other means secures a reputation for giving superior quality for standard prices . CHAPTER VI BUSINESS SPECIALIZATION IN the last chapter it was stated that consolidation could take place in the field of raw materials , manufacturing and selling . To secure control of raw materials is a financial problem that requires a different solution in every individual case . The manufacturing and selling phases of any business must be handled after the plant has been located and constructed . In another chapter it will be shown that even the most economical construction of a plant is almost entirely dependent upon the peculiarities of the processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The university of a generation ago had few departments , as a rule ; but those departments taught a great many branches . At that time a man could be Professor of Natural Philosophy , and within that domain he gave instruction in Geology , Chemistry , Physics , Physical Geography , Mineralogy , Meteorology , and perhaps a half dozen other allied branches . A professor of Political Economy would be likely to teach Economic History , Economic Theory , Public Finance , Private Finance , Transportation , Sociology , and an almost indefinite number of the derived topics . How different is the university of to-day . Natural Philosophy has vanished from all curricula . Even geology is broken up into Historical Geology , Paleontology , Inorganic Geology , and a half dozen other subdivisions . He is a bold man who pretends to know more than one or two of those subdivisions with any great degree of completeness . The science of Political Economy has been broken up into Economics and Sociol-71 // ogy , and in those two orders of social science we find specialists who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their general division . At the present time we have professors of Transportation , of Insurance , of Farm Economics , Accountancy , Industry , Commerce , Finance , and a host of others . In the past we had the tendency to hit only the high places in our sciences . We were broad but not deep . Our institutions of learning have carried out the idea of specialization in education to exceedingly fine limits , and it has resulted in incalculable good to the cause of knowledge . While the specialization has been going on in the higher institutions another movement has been taking place . The universities are getting into closer and more sympathetic relations with the high schools , and even with the grade schools , until , at the present time , in some states the entire school system is gradually getting welded into one big unit which has for its object the most perfect training that is possible to give each child in a community . Twenty years ago , in the majority of industries , the plants were about as general in the scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a number of large concerns that have been in existence for over thirty years might be cited to show the great changes that have taken place in the character of their activities . Formerly , machine shops did every grade of work on the floors of a single building . One shop in an eastern city built printing presses , blowing engines , water turbines , marine engines , mill engines , mining machinery , pumps ; in fact , everything conceivable in the machinery line for which they could obtain an order . Textile establishments in days gone oy manufactured a great variety of fabrics . One concern made ingrain carpets , Brussels carpets , velvets , suiting material , and many other types of fabrics . Knitting mills commonly made all kinds of stockings , underwear , and other knitted goods . Paper // mills of the past turned out all grades of pulp materials , from the coarsest straw board to the finest writing and drawing papers . Shoe factories never thought of restricting themselves to any particular grade or kind of footwear . At the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one plant . Machine shops now confine their energies to the building of one or two classes of machinery . If a company is engaged in several lines of activity , it has a special shop or department for building each commodity . One concern builds nothing but cranes , another only milling machines , some plants construct planers and shapers , others locomotives . In the field of electrical equipment , plants may limit themselves to special sizes of certain goods . One concern now doing a profitable business confines itself to the building of motors of a few small sizes , and will not accept orders for larger ones . In textiles , no thoroughly trained manager would risk funds in attempting to manufacture a great variety of goods under one roof . There are mills which confine their energies to the making of ingrain carpets , others make only rugs . One firm has invested over $1,000,000 in equipping an immense building whose only output is lace curtains . The knitting mill has been succeeded by the stocking and underwear factories . Some plants have even gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , women 's , or children 's hosiery , and a few concerns have gone to the extreme limit of specialization by making only one or two grades of men 's socks . Shoe manufacturing is known everywhere as a specialized business . At present , the greatest factories make either men 's or women 's and children 's shoes , and not a very great number of grades at that . Several concerns confine their energies to the production of one or two qualities of footwear , and endeavor to secure an immense market for their output by giving the consumer the choice of a great number of different styles . By specializing their outputs , factories // can give such excellent quality and style for so low a price that once established , rivals will find it difficult to break into their domains . Like tendencies are evidenced in the paper business . No longer do single plants manufacture a great variety of pulp material . Mills are now very apt to specialize on newspaper , bond paper , wrapping stock , or some particular kind of fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same change has taken place . The tendency is not confined to any selected group of activity . It is the expression of an ideal which is influencing our modern civilization . If we are to exist , we must conserve our forces . We set aside great tracts of land for forest reserves , the government is appointing commissions to draw up plans to husband our coal , vast sums of money are being spent to make the barren deserts fruitful fields . The states and the United States support great agricultural colleges and numerous experimental stations for the purpose of finding out for the farmer how he can save his land for future generations and yet get from it the maximum yield . In manufacturing , the entrepreneur has long seen that his rewards depend upon methods of effectively handling raw materials and labor , and he has hit upon specialization to attain economy in manufacture . Specialization aids in a number of ways : 1 . It reduces the preliminary costs incurred in all manufacturing . 2 . It makes possible the extensive use of highly specialized machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplifies managerial problems . 4 . It makes worth while the introduction of numerous small savings . Specialization is one of the greatest possible aids to industrial economy . How this is accomplished , is well illusBUSINESS // trated in the building of a steam engine . In order to build a steam engine of several hundred horsepower in an unspecialized plant , the builders must proceed as follows : The prospective purchasers of the engine advertise for bids on engines of the capacity desired , and they give the necessary data as to the work that the engine is expected to do . The concern desiring to secure the contract makes out drawings and sketches showing the type of engine they offer and the way it will look when completed . On these sketches the advantageous features of their engines are shown , and these sketches are frequently painted in water colors . They always represent considerable work on the part of the drafting department . If the firm secures the contract , the chief engineer makes out the general specifications , such as the sizes of the cylinders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve gearing , and other main requirements . The chief draftsman then takes the job in hand and allots the working out of the various details to under-draftsmen . These under-draftsmen calculate the amount of material that must go into the engine , figure out the sizes of the various parts , and show clearly the proper allowances to obtain the proper valve movements . They must see that all moving joints are properly provided with lubricating devices , so that there will be no binding at any point , yet the movements must not be so free that leakage of steam can occur in any place . The throttle-valves and other parts likely to be frequently used must be put in accessible places . Provision for taking indicator cards must be made , so that it will not be dangerous for one to make tests of the engine while it is running . Proper clearance must be provided for all moving parts . The oiling system should be such that lubrication can take place without ' undue waste of oil , and without involving danger to the attendant . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine , so that it can run // successfully , but care must also be taken to see that its parts are constructed in such a manner that the engine can be put together . The writer remembers an instance where several bolts were so placed that it was impossible to get a wrench on the nuts . As a consequence , the bolts were useless , but it fortunately happened that if left-handed threads were cut on the bolts the nuts could be tightened , and it was not necessary to redesign the whole part after the castings had reached the machine shop . When the drawings of all the details are made and a general drawing showing the placing of all the different elements is completed , tracings must be made of everything . These tracings are inked in with great care , the different parts shaded and the dimensions of every piece indicated . After the tracings are all completed , every part must be carefully gone over and checked by some responsible person . This person is much like a proofreader . He looks out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to happen , in the construction of the engine ; and if he finds any inaccuracy , he must report it and see that it is corrected before the plans leave the drawing-room . After the tracing is checked and everything is seen to be correct , the tracings are turned over to the blue-printer , and a number of blue print copies of every drawing in the engine are made . The blue prints are then turned over to the construction departments . The first step in building the engine begins in the pattern shop . The pattern shop is the place where the various shapes of the proposed castings are made in wood which will serve the molders as the basis for the construction of the molds The drawings in the pattern shop are first carefully gone over by the foreman who determines which parts are to be made by the various workmen . The workmen are then given the drawings and are expected to read them and make from them the correct form in wood . To do this is no simple matter . A // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drawings , in the first place , are often very complicated , and it requires considerable imagination to see in those conventional lines the picture of a form . The workmen 's ingenuity is further tested by the fact that he must always remember that the wooden pattern must be reproduced in metal . The metal that is poured into the molds made by the patterns is in a molten condition . The patternmaker must take into consideration that his pattern must be so built that after the sand is rammed tightly around it , it can be withdrawn without spoiling the mold . He must not forget to make the pattern large enough to give the casting sufficient material to permit of cutting and trimming in the machine shop . In the cooling there is considerable shrinkage of metal , and unless great care is exercised in making the patterns , cracks will develop in the castings . In the foundry , the molds must be built to suit the patterns in question . Some of the minor molds may be made in casting machines , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great number of pieces are made . After the castings have been made , they are cleaned and passed on to the machine shop . The machine shop foreman will have in his office the complete set of prints of the engine . He will have the task of determining the order in which the various parts shall be finished . He will ascertain the machines best fitted to carry on the various machining processes on the different castings . In these machining steps , considerable time is lost in getting the pieces set up on the tools which are to make the engine parts ready for assembling . Every time each piece passes to a different tool or to a different step in the process , the various workmen in charge of the steps must decide upon the best way to handle the piece , the proper cuts to make on it , and , in general , its method of treatment . Several years ago there were shops where fully 30 per cent // of the time consumed in machining and assembling the parts was used up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was wasted , but nevertheless , the greater part of the loss was due to the fact that the firms were work-ing on new contracts most of the time , and could use little of the former work and material . Imagine the same engine going through an establishment which has been specially constructed for the purpose of build-ing engines of that class and horsepower . In the first place , the engineering and drawing expenses are reduced to an almost insignificant item for each order , because one set of drawings with a few alterations does for a number of engines . The pattern cost for each becomes an almost negligible item for the same reason . In the foundry it is worth while to construct special molding devices , which make the molding cost for each engine much smaller than it possibly can be when only one or two engines are constructed . In the ma-chine shop , the foreman can work out a general scheme for the machining of the parts , and they pass from one tool to another without the necessity of any special direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of handling the engine parts . In the locomotive business , boring mills are built for the one purpose of handling locomotive driving wheels . Special planers are designed to use in making the frames of the locomotives . In fact , every part of the engine is made on a specially designed machine . Jigs and other auxiliary devices are built which reduce the work of finish-ing the parts to a mere mechanical routine , and to a very great extent eliminate the possibility of error . In erecting the engines , economies can be introduced by training men to do certain parts and keeping them at a few tasks . When things are done on a large scale , specialized plants can be erected for the sole purpose of making one product . Every little feature in the process can be studied minutely , // and economies which would be ' insignificant on one or two become very valuable savings on one hundred or more . One of the greatest money-saving devices known to the modern manager is the interchangeable part . The inter-changeable part is the device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings that have been noted above . With it , management becomes a question not of determining the best method of handling each new contract , but the best method of doing each little detail . The introduction of the interchangeable part has made it possible for American man ufacturers to sell locomotives in Europe and far-off China . It is the reason why thousands of people within our own borders carry the dollar watch . Specialization has , nevertheless , its limitations . A man ufacturer will do well to investigate carefully the extent to which he confines his energies to the turning out of a single article . One can invest a large amount of capital in a plant which will reduce the output cost many per cent , but if the plant is specialized to such a degree that it can manufacture only one product , the investor may lose every cent he puts into the concern by the introduction of a new commodity that may capture his market . Thousands of dollars were lost by bicycle manufacturers when the bicycle craze died down . A good rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit in plants which manufacture necessaries , or partly finished products whose demand is not affected by any great improvements , things like flour , sugar , steel rails , steel plates , and articles of a similar nature . In goods liable to be improved and changed , the specialization of the equipment may be carried with safety to the point where an improve ment or change in the product will not render useless the appliances of the establishment . One may , for example , safely specialize a loom to the point where it will make goods of a certain width and quality , but it would not be safe for the managers to install equipment which could turn out only // cloth of a single pattern or coloring . It would even be safer for the loom to have some range of variation in width and quality . If a product is of an ephemeral nature , specialization should not be carried past the point where the old machinery can be adapted to the manufacture of new things . Toy factories are never safe in investing large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out only one kind of toy . In a word , there is a limit to specialization , and the nature of the goods should determine the danger point for the manufacturer . PART TWO THE EQUIPMENT OF THE PLANT CHAPTER VII CONTINUOUS INDUSTRIES , SYNTHETICAL AFTER the questions of location , integration , and specialization have been settled for any particular business , there arise the more technical problems affecting the successful activity of the concern . How shall we build the plant so that it will make integration and specialization possible ? Can the plant be run in any kind of a building ? The answer is emphatically , No . Even if a business has been placed in its most suitable environment , it can not carry out the plans of integration and specialization unless it is properly housed . Neither can good management be possible unless the building is properly adapted to the work and the workers . Every one has noticed that plants for different industries vary greatly in their structures and layouts . Every industry can be carried on best in a structure adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , it will be seen that there are two factors that play exceedingly important parts in determining the nature of the structure which will house the plant , viz. : 1 . The type of manufacturing industry . 2 . The nature of the goods handled . From the standpoint of the industry one may have two kinds of manufacturing : 1 . Continuous . 2 . Assembling . A continuous industry is one in which the product is all received at one place and the operations to change the raw 83 // material into finished goods are performed in a continuous manner on the entire mass of material . The raw materials go into one end of the plant and pass through various machines and processes without halting at any stage for other finished parts to be brought to them . When such articles thus manufactured are finished , they are completed as a whole , and not in sections that must be put together . There are two classes of continuous industries : ( a ) The synthetical. ( b ) The analytical . In chemistry the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bringing together various ingredients . In our food and clothes we consume things which have gone through synthetical processes . A bowl of soup and a piece of bread are results of synthesis , as are also stockings and steel rails . A subdivision of the synthetical class of industries may indicate whether the industry produces incidental by-products or not . A very important influence is exercised on the layout of plants if it must handle by-products in the course of its manufacturing . The non-by-product industries are an exceedingly important group in the United States . In 1905 , the textiles alone contributed nearly $2,150,000,000 to the wealth of the country . In addition , the tobacco , clay , paper , and printing and other industries , all non-by-product in type , added another $2,000,000,000 to this sum . In brief , more than one-quarter of our consumable wealth was made up of products coming from factories of this nature . ' Since the textile industries are the most important class of this non-by-product group , their plants are instructive . Into such plants are brought raw materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Any single textile industry may be regarded as a unit industry in the sense that the entire plant is devoted to the production of one thing only ? the working up of certain fibers . This does not mean , however , that there is no wasting of the raw materials as they go through the various manufacturing steps . In every textile plant the cleaning and handling of the material causes some loss in every machine . In cotton manufacturing , the subject of the utilization of cotton-mill waste is becoming one of increasing importance. , Figure 7 shows the steps through which cotton passes to be made into its different finished products . While the material is passing through the various machines , waste occurs in dropping from the opener and scutch machines , the brush-strips from the cylinders and duffer cards , the card-room sweepings , and comber waste ; the bobbin waste , from fly frames and spinning machines , the hard ends from cop bobbins ; and there is also the oily waste . The quantity wasted varies with the conditions and the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ability of the operator , and the character of the products manufactured . The aggregate average of this loss amounts to about 8 per cent of the raw cotton worked . It has been estimated that for the entire United States the mill waste would total to the figures of 175 , 000 , 000 pounds , about 87,500 short tons.2 These figures are impressive . To rework all this waste in the United States would keep 1,000,000 spindles employed 52 weeks in a year.3 Great as it is in the aggregate , however , few mills find it profitable to rework their waste material , the reason being that the waste of each machine is different , and requires unlike treatment , if not different machinery , to make it a salable product . Waste spinning is an // industry by itself , and requires as much skill in all of its branches as does the manufacturing of a higher grade of goods . As a consequence , the textile manufacturer finds it more profitable to sell his waste product for what it will bring , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of products . // In order to understand the requirements of an ideal textile plant it is necessary first of all to know the steps in the manufacturing process . The working up of cotton offers an excellent illustration of a textile industry . The diagram ( Fig. 7 ) on page 86 shows the steps in the manufacture of cotton goods from the bound bale to the cloth . ' The machines carry the fiber through twelve main steps . 1 . Loosening Out the Fibers So That They May Be Cleaned. ? This is done by the bale-opener or bale-breaker and the mixing machines . The cotton , in order to be made suitable for transportation , has been tightly compressed , and as a consequence , it is very closely matted and quite lumpy when it comes out of the bale . In order to make it fit to enter the cleaning and carding machines , it is put through the mixers and openers where the lumps are teased out and the cotton itself is made into the form of a broad , loose sheet of indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next step . 2 . Cleaning. ? The cleaning of the fiber is usually done by air blast in scutchers , but the fiber is as yet in a rather crisscross , loosely matted condition , and in that state is unsuited to the making of thread . In order to fit it for the threads , the fibers must go through the next process . 3 . Paralleling the Fibers. ? The main work of paralleling is done in the carding and drawing machines . Some cleaning , of course , goes on in the carding machine , but it starts the step of paralleling the fibers , which is continued by the drawing frame . After the fibers are made parallel , they come off the drawing machine in the form of a very loose sliver , which could hardly be used for spinning , so it must pass on for some further operations . 4 . Attenuating the Slivers or Strands. ? The strands are attenuated on the various clubbing frames or roving devices . // It is in these stages of the process that there arises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of product . Very fine goods go through a very great number of machines , while the coarser grades pass through but one or two . When the strands have been attenuated and slightly twisted in order to prevent matting , before they are spun , they pass on to the fifth step . 5 . Spinning. ? Spinning is the process of making the loose strand into a compactly spun thread , and is done by twisting the strands a great number of ti rues . There are two kinds of spinning machines , the mule spinner and the ring spinner . The former attenuates while it is spinning , and is used on high-grade products . The ring spinner is used on inferior grades of yarns , and does not attenuate so evenly as does the mule . 6 . Doubling and Winding. ? From the spinning machines are sent forth single strands of yarn . To make a strong and serviceable thread , two or more of these single strands are twisted together on various twining and doubling machines . These machines likewise wind it on different kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different purposes , as knitting and the like . 7 . Reeling. ? If the yarn is to be dyed or is to have any further preparation before it is woven , it is made up into skeins on the reeling machine ; and if it is to be sent out to be dyed , or is to be sold as yarn , it is made up into bundles to facilitate transportation . 8 . Dyeing . In this step the yarn is given its color . After it is colored and dried it is then ready for the final steps of cloth-making. 9 . Pirn Winding. ? In this step the dyed yarn is wound in a form so that it can be put into a shuttle , which will be easy to use in the loom to make the cross threads of the cloth . 10 . Warping. ? The preparing of the longitudinal threads // of the cloth in such a manner that they can be put into the loom . 11 . Weaving. ? The interlacing of the shuttle or filling threads with the warp threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finishing process the woven cloth is cleaned , starched , and treated in various ways to fit it for its particular market . The diagram shows how direct the process of manufacture is . The building , therefore , best adapted to carrying on the cotton industry is one in which the machinery is arranged in a direct line from the bale breaker to the finishing room . There are two possible ways of building a plant so that this end can be accomplished . It can be built over a great stretch of territory , with the receiving department at one end and the shipping department at the other , and the goods may pass in a generally horizontal line through the plant . Another form of plant is one in wh ich the floor space is limited to within comparatively narrow bounds , but the structure is made high , so that the goods will pass in a more or less vertical direction . The diagrams in Fig. 8 show examples of both types of plant . The textile industry is one in which the labor problem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Th is makes it desirable to locate the plant within the vicinity of a large population , but where land values are bound to be high . As a consequence , textile establishments are usually built on the vertical plan in order to bring their fixed charges in taxes , rentals , etc. , down to as low a level as their location permits . On account of the weight of the material handled and the comparative lightness of the machinery , there is no engineering difficulty connected with the building of the structure , and no great expense is involved in elevating the goods . The cost of handling the goods is so small compared with the savings due to the high structure that textile plants have long since been made tall structures . // There are , however , some disadvantages in a high building , especially if it be in a crowded city . It is very apt to be so located as to have some difficulty in securing all the light desirable for the carrying on of the processes within // the plant . Until tale spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used ; but when the spinning and winding steps commence , a well-lighted room is required . In warping and weaving it is even more necessary . On account of the lighting problem , textile plants have frequently been compelled to vary the sequence of the operations in such a way as to put the most delicate operations in the parts of the building where they can get the maximum amount of light . The textile industries afford an example of the continuous industries of the non-by-product type , and the characteristics of the layout and structure of those plants can be applied equally well to industries of a similar character . These characteristics are , in brief : 1 . The plants may be built either high or low , without necessarily affecting the continuity of the process . Hence they may be built in congested districts without incurring rental and taxes unduly high or other overhead expenses which would become oppressive . 2 . They should be well lighted and ventilated , and must use large window space . 3 . The wash-rooms and lavatories should be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important industry of the by-product type is the iron and steel group . The production of this one group amounted in 1905 to nearly $2,180,000,000.1 It affords from its importance and natural characteristics the best example of the continuous synthetic industry of the by-product type . In a previous chapter , it was shown how completely the steel industry is integrated . This integration has been carried so far that nearly every plant is a complete unit in the sense that it starts out with the raw material and ends with the finished product . // Three main ingredients enter into the production of steel , iron ore , coke , and limestone . The iron ore is a compound consisting of one or several oxides of iron mixed with a considerable proportion of other materials , known under the general name of gangue . The coke has the quality of extracting the oxygen contents from the ore , and leaving behind the iron in a metallic state , but intimately mixed with the molten gangue . Limestone has the quality of dissolving this nonmetallic content , and separating it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore will have a greater or less percentage of sulphur or phosphorus associated with it in some form or other . If it contains the former , the ore must be treated to a roasting process , to burn out the deleterious content before it can be fit for the blast furnace . Phosphoric iron receives its treatment farther along in the steel furnace itself . The diagram on page 93 gives some idea of the steps in the preparation of iron and steel products ( Fig. 9 ) . A few years ago nearly all coke was prepared in the vicinity of the coal mines , in bee-hive ovens , which did not yield any by-products . This was following out the well-known principle that all unnecessary ingredients of the raw material should be removed at the source of supply in order to save freight rates . Within the past few years , however , it has been found that the products so carelessly lost by the bee-hive oven are by no means worthless . Probably people were thoughtless of the by-products in coal because of the location of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the richest natural gas region in the world . Heat and power were given with such a free hand by nature that the iron masters could not afford to trouble themselves about saving the riches in coal . Since the opening of the Pittsburg district , great changes have taken place in the steel industry . It has moved away from the regions of natural gas , and the gas itself has largely given out . Heat can no longer be had for the mere tapping of the ground , // but must be secured by a more costly method . Human ingenuity has been equal to the occasion ; the bright luminous flame that burst from the top of the old bee-hive oven was a beacon inviting the scientist to explore an unknown world of wealth . The gases which served to make useless flames are now carefully husbanded and burnt where they will create wealth for the owners . Coke is now made on the grounds of the steel plant and in by-product ovens . Chemistry has revealed the fact that coal can be made to produce three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonia , and tar . The latest type of the by-product coke oven saves all three of those products . The gas is collected and purified and sent to the various parts of the plant for heating and power purposes . The tar is merely collected and sold . In America the greater percentage of the tar is purchased by people who have been instrumental in installing the by-product ovens , and is worked up by them into various substances , as , for example , aniline , creosote , and pitch , each one of those products being a representative of the three main divisions , into which the tar can be broken , viz. : light oils , heavy oils , and pitch . The ammonia which is driven off from the coal appears largely in the form of a sulphate and , after being purified , is largely used as a fertilizer . As a result apparatus to purify the gas , collect the tar , and treat the ammonia is connected with the coking department of the steel plant . Limestone does not require any preliminary treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furnace . It is , however , the basis of the slag , which comes from the blast furnace and which yields some further by-products . The manufacturing of steel goods from the raw materials is a continuous process ; but a steel plant , unlike a textile establishment , is not handling light goods . The units handled weigh tons instead of pounds . The raw material has to // be accumulated in great masses in order to keep sufficient stock for all seasons of the year . During the winter months , owing to the freezing of the lakes , ore transportation is largely suspended . Moreover , the forming processes of steel require many passages through fiery furnaces , making it impossible to use anything but the most stable and heat-resisting build ing material . The first requisite demanded by the nature of the material and the character of the process is sufficient ground space to make provision for heavy foundations and ample room for machinery , furnaces , soaking pits , and all the subsidiary plants that are necessary parts of a plant . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana , shows what present requirements are . The dimensions indicated on the map ( Fig. 10 ) give one some idea of the gigantic proportions of its grounds . The engi neers of this plant introduced every possible improvement that experience has demonstrated profitable . The ore is brought in by lake vessels and unloaded by machinery to the great stock piles and the charging bins . Railroad connec tions enable the coke and 1 itnestone to be unloaded from the cars into the respective receptacles without any unnecessary handling . The blast furnaces are the apparatus which manufactures the iron ore into pig-iron . They are charged from the top by means of skip hoists , the buckets of which are filled by means of gravity with ore , limestone , and coke , from the bins above mentioned . The blast furnace derives its name from the fact that it receives its air for fuel combustion under heavy pressure from powerful engines . This air is admitted into the bottom of the furnace at certain openings called tuyeres . In order to make it more efficient as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special devices called stoves , which are frequently as high as the furnace itself . The stoves // are usually arranged in batteries of four to each furnace . While three of them are being heated by the waste gases from the furnace , the fourth stove is giving up its heat to the entering blast . // Three products come from the blast furnace : 1 . Pig-iron , which goes onward for its final treatment , eventually becoming the steel rail or some other finished material . This is tapped out of the lower part of the furnace from time to time as the process goes on . 2 . Gas , which is given off from the top of the furnace and is carried away by the downcomer . This gas contains sufficient combustible material in it to make it a very valuable by-product , and is now extensively used in heating the stoves of the furnace , and for power purposes . 3 . Slag , which at one time was a source of expense to carry away , but is now made into cement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is carried onward in a molten state by great ladles to large mixing devices , where it is blended with the charges from other blast furnaces , and made sufficiently homogeneous to warrant its being taken to the steel furnaces . The steel furnaces may be one of two types ? the open-hearth steel furnace which is now being more commonly used throughout the country because of the superior quality of the steel it produces , or the Bessemer converter , which was at one time mainly used in steel manufacture on account of the rapidity with which it converted pig-iron into steel . In either case the location of the plant , which does the changing of the pig-iron into steel , should be in a direct industrial line from the blast furnaces and mixing box , so that there will be no loss of time or waste of heat . " Intra-works transportation plays a mighty part in this thrifty hurry . The switch track , indeed , is the vital factor in Gary 's scheme . Other steel plants may adopt its gas engines , copy its enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have to rebuild from the bare ground up to attain the economies secured at Gary by the arrangement of furnaces and mills . The placing of these was dictated by the speed a laboring locomotive can make on a curving switch track . To relieve the locomotive and achieve speed , the right angle was abolished in locating the various units . Instead of setting the // blast furnaces parallel or at right angles to the tracks serving them , they were placed at an angle of 22 degrees , allowing a 200-foot radius for the entering switch . A train of 40-ton ladle cars can negotiate that swiftly , easily with little outlay of power and no danger of accident . Reversing on the main track , they will rush away to the open hearths on long , easy curves of 800 feet radius . What goes in at the near end of each unit goes out at the other , one step nearer finished product . There is no backing up , ' except of empty ladles or cars . From the casting floor of the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thence to the soaking pits and the ordeal of the rolls . Between blast furnaces and open hearths the angle to be overcome is only 57 degrees ; between the latter and the soaking pits about 70 degrees . The shortest curve in the 175 miles of track , which will serve the mills , has a radius of 200 feet ; nearly all are upwards of 400 feet . The elevated approaches to the furnaces and mills were planned with the same canny regard for speed where speed is vital ; elsewhere they are a compromise between economy of space and of power . The company 's locomotives will do the switching ? the cost will depend on how fast they can move a load , how little coal and time . they consume . Continuous gravity tracks at the shipping platforms allow the shifting of loaded cars without engines . Analysis of the work 's transportation can go no further than to say that it embodies the most advanced railway practice . Switch and service tracks , except those at the blast furnaces , are continuous ; blockades are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cars is uninterrupted . The same principle obtains in the Kirk ' classification and storage yards , and in the locomotive house , through which tracks and pits run at an angle , abolishing the turn table . These individual savings , multiplied daily a thousand times , make tremendous economies . " In the steel furnace , the molten pig-iron is brought into contact with air , and in this way the excess carbon in the iron is removed , to give the metal the properties of mild steel . When that stage is reached , the blast is turned off and the reducing process ceases . The furnace is then emptied of its steel contents into a great ladle , which is carried over to // the molds . The molds are placed on trucks , set on an industrial railway , and after the steel is emptied from the ladle into these molds , it goes back for another ladleful , while the locomotive hauls away the steel-filled molds whose contents are soon to harden into ingots . By the time the ingots arrive at the steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molds . This removal is done by a device called the stripper , which automatically removes the casing and sets it on another car , by which it is returned , to be used in molding another lot of metal . The ingots , highly heated , remain standing on the trucks ready to be hauled to the soaking pits , into which they are placed in order to be kept hot until they are ready for the rolls . Tlie waiting period is not long ; some unseen power uncovers tie top of one of the pits , a pair of giant tongs lifts the mass ' of dripping steel from the flaming cavity , and lightly waltzes it through the air to a little truck into which it is gently placed . The truck , as soon as loaded , automatically carries the great ingot on to the roll tables , which pass the mass of metal to and fro between two sets of rolls , one pair of which is placed horizontally and the other vertically . By a few passes the sizzling metal is reduced from ingot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom is taken automatically by rolling tables and carrying devices either to another soaking pit , where it is reheated before entering the rail mills , or it goes directly from the first pair of rolls to the rail mill . The rail mill consists of three steel cylinders set horizontally one upon the other . The bloom is put between the two lower rolls and is drawn through . When it gets through , the roll table on the other side of the rapidly revolving shaping cylinders tips upward and carries with it the partly formed rail , and then automatically pushes the latter into the upper set of rolls , which now draw it back to the other side , and the other table tips up to receive the more nearly formed rail . // This process is repeated until seven or more passes are made , and the steel bloom becomes a great long steel rail . After it makes its last pass it is carried on to the saws where the ends are trimmed off , and then the revolving gang saws , at a single sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the . still red-hot steel ribbon . After that , automatic devices carry the rails to the cooling tables , where they remain until they attain the atmospheric temperature . When cooled they are ready to receive the fishplu.te holes . These are put in by drilling machines . Three or more individual drills are grouped with a few inches intervening between centers , and then the two gangs of drills are distanced from each other by the length of the rail . The rail is placed in position , and the mere pulling of a lever starts all the drills in both gangs simultaneously , and the holes are cut in a few minutes , making the rail ready for shipment . Here , again , the ever-present carrying devices are ready to do their work . As soon as the holes are cut , a traveling chain slides the rail gently into a freight car , which is waiting to receive it to carry it to the consumer . CHAPTER VIII CONTINUOUS INDUSTRIES , ANALYTICAL THE preceding chapter considered the kinds of plants suitable for carrying on synthetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large group of con tinuous industries , which may be designated Analytical . An analyst is one who separates a body of matter into its constituent pasts , or breaks it down into its original ele ments . The process is not confined to the treatment of physi cal bodies . A judge is called a keen analyst when he takes a mass of data presented by contending lawyers , and separates it in such a manner as to reveal the true significance of the evidence . This is as truly an analytical process as is the fil tration of water . The judge separates the true from the false in evidence , just as the filter extracts the impurities from the water . Non-by-product and by-product industries may be in either the analytical group or in the synthetical class . The non-by-product group of analytical industries in 1905 con tributed more than $2,500,000,000 to the wealth of the country , mainly in the form of food products ( not including meat packing ) , liquors and beverages , and lumber products . ' Liquors and beverages are properly placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extractive industries . In the industries discussed in the preceding chapter , the materials handled in the process of manufacture were of such a nature that there had to be a considerable expenditure of time and labor or power in conveying the partly finished // goods from one machine or step in the process to another . In a textile establishment trucks and elevators are very extensively used , while in a steel mill the conveying machinery is unique for its elaborateness . In the analytical group of industries , the larger number can utilize exceedinglycheap means to convey materials from step to step in the manufacturing process . Two conditions conspire to make this possible : 1 . In many of those industries gravity can be extensively used in conveyance. 2 . The processes are of such a nature that the goods , as a rule , are handled in bulk or in continuous , unbroken streams rather than in individual units . Matter may be gaseous , liquid , or solid . The handling of the solid is the most difficult and expensive ; but if the solids consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such goods may , in fact , be handled as easily as liquids . Liquids are very easily handled in bulk . They can be concentrated at a single point , as at the bottom of a building , and then , by means of pumps , be forced through pipes to the top of the structure . From this elevated position they can be passed by gravity through the various steps of the process from the beginning all the way to the shipping-room . Sugar-refining affords an excellent illustration of an industry of the non-by-product type which handles solids and liquids . Raw sugar comes to the United States in large quantities from abroad . The large refineries are usually located at some seaport where it is possible to unload the sugar directly from the vessel into the storage house . The raw sugar is carried in the hold of the vessels in bags of various descriptions , and is hoisted out by a steam windlass in lots of several hundred pounds at a time . From thence it is weighed in the presence of government inspectors who determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is P // carried to the storage house by means of rapidly moving traveling cranes . These cranes stack the sugar in immense piles away from the weather , where it is kept until ready for use . In order to refine the raw sugar it is dissolved in crude molasses , which is then heated to the melting point . This is usually done on the first floor in close proximity to the storage sheds . ( See Figs. 11 and 12 . ) From thence it is pumped to the top of the building and treated in the defecator with some reagents , which coagulate the various impurities and neutralize any vegetable acids in the sugar solution . When the coagulation is complete , the solution is run to the floor below , where it passes through coarse canvas bags , which strain out foreign substances . The solution , although now freed from the grosser impurities , would still give a yield of rather unappetizing appearance if not further purified before crystallization . In order to remove all extraneous matter it passes another story downward through large bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorless liquid , occasionally slightly tinged with yellow . After it has passed through the bone black filters the solution is ready for crystallization . The crystallization is done on the next floor below . Here are placed large enclosed vessels connected with an exhaust which reduces the pressure in the vessel to a very low point . These enclosed vessels are known as vacuum pans in which the solution is boiled in order to crystallize the sugar from it . The task of boiling the sugar until it reaches the proper point for crystallization is one that requires care and experience on the part of the operator , and as a rule he is one of the best paid men in the plant . After the solution has been boiled until it has reached the proper condition , it is run into cooling and mixing tanks to crystallize . These tanks are situated on the floor below the vacuum pans and contain a semi-liquid paste of syrup and // granulated sugar . To make the complete separation of the crystals from the syrup the pasty mass is dropped into centrifugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolve at a high speed , and fling the liquid material through their porous sides , leaving behind the granulated sugar . At this point in the process , any yellowness which may tinge the sugar is removed by the slight addition of some ultramarine to the sugar as it is being whizzed in the machine . From the centrifugal machines the sugar is passed to another floor , where it is placed in large drying and granulating cylinders heated by hot air . After it is dried and granulated it is rim into bins , and from them , by gravity , into barrels and other containers in which it is sold to the consumer . ( See Figs. 11 and 12 . ) Gravity is likewise used in cleaning the apparatus of the refinery . The bone black or char filters become clogged with impurities , so that it is necessary to clean them out at frequent intervals . This is accomplished in a very ingenious manner . The char contents of the clogged filter are dropped through a series of heated cylinders , which first dry the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the impurities in the char become charred themselves , and as a consequence the impurities actually become the means of purifying succeeding lots of sugar . ( See Fig. 11 . ) It is evident that a sugar refinery must be a very high building if it is to take advantage of the gravity method of conveyance . This is usually the case ; and , inasmuch as there are few steps in the process which require a great amount of light and observation on the part of the worker , one will usually find that sugar refineries are tall , somber-looking buildings . They must all have great storage-rooms in order to contain the raw sugar and also to hold their finished products , because the goods come from afar , and the manufacturer must keep on hand a great quantity of goods in // order to keep his plant running uniformly throughout the year . The diagrams 11 and 12 show the layout and elevation of one of the largest sugar refineries in the United States . In connection with a great many refineries there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cases for the finished sugar . The shipping room of the sugar refinery should be so placed that the finished sugar will come into the department with the least possible trucking cost . The room should also be so placed that the goods can be put into wagons or cars without any unnecessary handling . The diagram shows how closely the refinery has held to this ideal . The packing , storage , and shipping departments are located right on the corner of the public street and railroad , and goods can be put into the freight car with even less handling than it takes to load the wagons which distribute the products to the local grocers . Another well-known industry of the analytical type which handles solids exclusively and uses the gravity means of conveyance is flour milling . The rapidity with which flour is made and the cheapness with which it is handled is a neverending source of interest to the student of industrial management . One can go through a mill that manufactures thousands of barrels a day and find some few dozen men supplying all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour-making are as follows : 1 . Cleaning. ? Here the grain is not only separated into good and bad lots , but has all foreign matter from dust to twigs and nails taken out of it . 2 . Grinding. ? At this stage the different qualities of flour are obtained by separating out of the grain its various envelopes of nutritive matter and grinding them between different series of rolls . 3 . Screening or Bolting. ? In this step the various grades // and sizes are separated after they have passed through the rolls . 4 . Purifying. ? The purifier extracts from the finely ground grain the light flaky cellulose technically known as " bees ' wing . " This bees ' wing has become so intimately mixed with the flour that it can not be taken out by the screens . The work is done by means of a gentle air blast , which is strong enough to remove the bees ' wing but not the flour particles . This leaves the flour purified of all foreign matter . 5 . Packing. ? Here the flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 6 . Storage and Shipping . In order to take advantage of the gravity method , conveying buckets carry the grain to the top of a high , almost windowless structure , where it is cleaned of its impurities in preparation for the grinding . Several grinding processes take place , and after each grinding the grain is bolted . On account of these many grinding and bolting steps , it is uneconomical to build a mill so high that gravity will do all the conveying work from the beginning to the end of the process . Considerable saving in power and space is obtained by keeping the cleaning , grinding , screening , and purifying apparatus on different floors . This makes necessary some reconveying of the partly ground grain to upper floors , but the general line of passage is not broken . One great stream of grain starts from the top of the building , and after a few eddying currents on the downward flow , finally emerges from the last machine as white flour ready for the baker . The by-product industries of the analytical type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil refining , about $2,000,000,000 annually . ' The meat-packing industry alone accounts for $914,000 , 000 of this // ; unount . ' It offers one of the best examples of an industry of this type . In meat packing , large units are handled . It would be an exceedingly difficult matter to handle the products of the packing house as grain is handled . The packing establishments have introduced such remarkable economies into their business that it is noted the world over for its perfection in organization ; and the buildings have been made to fit the process in a most remarkable way . The packing house , as in all industries , one of the important problems , is the passing of goods from department to department with the least possible outlay of power . It has l , i+cn seen how some other industries solve the problem . The manager of the packing house does not handle goods that can $ e pumped or conveyed by belts and run through machines in bulk , as is done in cotton spinning or flour manufacturing . His task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . A mi.scut will lower the value of the product , perhaps enough to destroy the profit in that step of the process , and even cause an absolute loss on the entire carcass . It has been said that in the packing house everything about the animal is saved save his dying groan . A person can appreciate the full significance of this statement when he realizes the refinements of the savings . The first step in the process of meat packing is to drive the animal to the top floor of the building , where it is stunned . The succeeding steps in the process are as follows : After the animal is knocked on the head it is dropped from the stunning platform to the floor . Here the animal is shackled and lifted by means of a power pulley to the bleeding rail , where its throat is opened and allowed to bleed for six minutes . At the end of that time the head is removed and the carcass allowed to bleed for ten minutes more . By // this time it is ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this dissection carried on with the animal hung by its hind feet from an elevated rail . The rail was slightly inclined so that the mere weight of the carcass would move it onward . With this arrangement the workman had to walk with the moving animal while he was working upon it . More , over , the animal , being hung in this way , was somewhat inconveniently placed for some of the dressing steps . In order to place it equally conveniently for all dressing steps , and to eliminate the walking on the part of the operator , the Armour Company has installed a moving table , 216 feet in length , on which the animal is deftly dropped on its back after it is beheaded . The workmen stand on this moving table , make their cuts on the animal , and then move back to the new animal as it comes from the preceding worker . In this way while they are cutting the animal , they are stationary with respect to it , yet the animal is going on its onward course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped into a chute or opening by which it is carried by gravity to the place where it will receive further treatment . The carcass itself moves onward . After all the trimming has been done on the tables it is lifted automatically from the table to overhead traveling hooks . These hooks are run on trolleys , and the track is inclined . Here the dressing is continued , and the animal is washed , cleaned , split , and eventually weighed . All the time these operations are going on it is gradually approaching the cooler . Fig . No. 13 is taken from one of the large packing houses in Chicago , and shows graphically how well the firm has kept in mind the adaptation of the building to its purposes . The entrance for the animal is so placed that by the time its carcass is prepared no unnecessary traveling is required to enable it to have cheap shipment either for long distance by railroad , or for local trade by teams . // The photograph on the other page ( Fig. 14 ) shows the tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the apparently heterogeneous arrangement of storehouses , power houses , laboratories , stables , and other 9 // departments . ' The plants do not have the most economical layouts . The writer , in speaking to a number of the officials of the various concerns , has been told that there are hundreds of places where improvements could be made . Any concern having a clear spot of ground sufficiently large would rebuild its plant in quite a different way . The present grouping of buildings has resulted from meeting the nteds of the mo-ment . Idealism had to be sacrificed to present exigencies . However , the arrangement and grouping of the buildings with all of their defects indicate several noteworthy fea tures : 1 . The various killing departments have maintained the theoretical ideals of structure of buildings . In the cattle , sheep , and hog-killing establishments the animal supplies its own motive power to the plant from the unloading pens , and // the buildings into which they run are well arranged to handle the cattle from the slaughtering to the shipping . The various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that are most dependent upon these main sections , are situated in close proxnnity to main departments . The auxiliary plants which manufacture the acces sories necessary to carry on the main business are placed near the buildings , which use their output ; the can manu facturing plant being placed conveniently between the lard , butterine , and oleo department and the canning department . The departments which are not in such intimate con-tact with the more active business and yet which are abso lutely dependent upon the main killing departments , are placed near the various killing departments , but not in any particular rotative order , as , for example , the pickling and storage departments . The derivative industries , as , for example , the but terine and oleo plants , lard refineries , and the like are put as near the killing establishments as is possible without interfering with the other more important subsidiary in dustries . The derivative industries , as the fertilizer plants , which create offensive odors , are placed on the outlying boundaries of the plant . The power house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the power house would be to place it as near the departments requiring the most steam , namely , the tanking house , bone house , and oil house , which , according to Mr. Wilder , are the largest consumers . ' A close inspection of the photograph will show , however , that in a number of cases there are deviations from the best practice , as recognized by modern managers . The printing // establishment , for instance , is backed by the house which manufactures digestive ferments . On its right side , is the beef extracting and soda fountain supply department , while on the other is the timekeeper 's office and the emergency hospital . The various pickling and storage houses are scattered all over the plant , some of them quite a distance from either railroad siding or the plants which give them their material . Even the shipping department is open to some criticism . The beef and sheep shipping-room is located at one place , the hog shipping at another , while the products from the canning and curing departments must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( See Nos. 22 and 24 , Fig. 14 . ) CHAPTER IX ASSEMBLING INDUSTRIES BESIDES those kinds of manufacturing wherein there is a continuous action upon the entire mass all the time the goods are being treated , there is the Assembling type . An assembling industry is one wherein the final product is made by first producing the various ingredients or parts , and then assembling them together . This type of an industry requires a manufacturing department , men or operators to make parts , and another set of producers who join these parts . Examples of these industries are shoe manufacturing , toy manufacturing , locomotive making , engine building , ship building , piano making , and clothing making . According to the Census reports of 1905 this assembling class of industries in the United States yielded over $4,000 , - 000,000 worth of products . ' Four of the fourteen groups into which the census report classifies industries , including leather and its finished products , metal products , vehicles , and shipbuilding , had by far the larger part of their production made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural implements lumber group gave $170,000,000 worth in furniture . Iron and steel added a total of nearly $800,000,000 of assembled goods in machinery products , and the textile group gave over $800,000,000 worth // in men 's and women 's clothing , fur goods , hats and caps , millinery , men 's furnishings , and corsets . ' These industries divide themselves into two typical classes , which in a measure correspond to the non-by-product plant and the by-product plant in the analytical industries , except that in the by-product plant the material is taken from the goods , while in the assembling process the subsidiary plants contribute to the main material . The assembling industries are here divided into these two groups which are considered separately : 1 . Direct producing industries wherein the goods are received , worked upon , and assembled without the intervention or using of any intermediary steps which do not finally show in the finished goods . Examples of these are afforded by shoemaking , toy manufacturing , piano producing , and by many other industries . 2 . Indirect industries wherein vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns , molds , and other auxiliary supplies before the product can be obtained ; as for example , machine and tool manufacturing , shipbuilding , locomotive making , general machine shops , and electrical supply plants . One characteristic of the assembling industries of both classes is that the goods they produce are made up of a great number of parts , each one of . which must be separately handled and treated , and adjusted to all the other parts of the completed article . A simple-looking instrument , like a piano , is made up of several hundred pieces , which must be carefully adjusted to each other to evolve the perfect instrument . The individual pieces are themselves made up of parts . The keyboard apparatus consists of a key and hammer . A key is made of about eight pieces . The hammer has seven pieces . A full piano has fifty-two white keys and // thirty-six black . In addition , there are the strings , pivots , sounding boards , and a great many other parts which in themselves are made up of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trustworthy article , all of these things must be handled with discriminating care and deftness . Machinery can cut the lumber , it can twist the strings , smooth the ivory , make the felt , it can plane the pieces , but it can not assemble them without intelligent guidance . Another characteristic common to both types of assembling manufacturing . is that in these industries , more than in any others , a very large amount of the work must be done by human labor . Assembling industry plants , as a rule , have far more operatives to an establishment of a given size than does any other group of plants . This is due to the fact that , as a rule , the assembling plants manufacture direct consumption goods which are designed to give immediate personal satisfaction to the consumer . It , is true that wheat grinding produces a consumable product in the form of flour , but the public does not get any immediate satisfaction from the flour . It must go through the bakery and be assembled with other ingredients , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes a consumable product . The manufacturing of pig-iron makes a consumable product for the foundryman , but the cast pig-iron in itself would be of little utility unless it passed through the foundry and machine shop to produce locomotives which can haul trains , or engines which can supply power to run looms . The products of assembling industries are in themselves objects more or less complicated in their construction and essentially specialized in their nature . They have a great amount of individuality . They are complex and various in construction . In many cases it would be unprofitable in the first place to make machines to do much of the work ; because the machines would have to be altered at frequent intervals on account of the changes in styles and of the rapid improve-1 // ments which are constantly being made in the construction of these direct consumption goods . In the second place , machines to do the work would have to be so complicated that long periods of time would be required to evolve and develop a profitable machine . The assembling industries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery of a more or less general nature to do work of more than one kind or size . These machines of necessity require operatives who can adapt them to do new work , and who must guide and direct them while they are running . These two characteristics at once bring up exceedingly important questions : 1 . How shall the various manufacturing departments be arranged with respect to the assembling department so that there will be a minimum amount of handling of the pieces ? 2 . How shall the plant be built so that a comparatively large number of workers will find room and convenient facilities for doing their work ? It has been seen in the two preceding chapters that the straight-line method of moving material through plants is the theoretical ideal for cheap production ; and it has been shown how various types of plants have adhered to the ideal and have adapted their structures accordingly . What is true of the continuous industries is also true of the assembling industries . The straight-line method of manufacture is , if considered from the absolute standpoint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departments so arranged that there will be no retracing of steps or backward movement of the parts in their passage through the plant . Fig. 8 shows how the straight-line ideal may apparently be varied and yet be rigidly adhered to in plant construction . The diagram likewise indicates in a similar manner how the straight-line method may be applied to the assembling processes . ( See Nos. 4 ; 5 , 6 , 11 , 12 , and 13 , Fig. 8 . ) The // question of providing room for the employees will naturally modify the geometric line , and the figure shows how the straight industrial line is maintained in many plants and yet opportunity is given for the employees to carry on their work . If it comes to a question of deciding between departing from the straight industrial line and locating a certain department or set of machines so that they will be more convenient for the employees , it is usually better to depart from the industrial line rather than make conditions such that the output of the employees will be limited by external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing industry . Factory shoes are usually made in two dozen lots , each company confining itself to a more or less limited number of styles and values of shoes . In some cases , the styles made by a concern will be a dozen or even less ; and then , on the other hand , they may extend into the scores . To produce a shoe requires : 1 . The Cutting of the Material for Uppers. ? The leather forming the upper portion of the shoe is cut to certain patterns which vary with the style of the shoe . The linings are likewise cut from special cloth . 2 . Skiving or Leveling. ? The edges of the leather are then put through a skiving machine , which levels them off so that they may be neatly turned , thus presenting a finished edge on all open parts . 3 . Turning . The skived leather is then passed over to a machine which applies cement to the inside of the beveled edge and deftly turns the leather over and gives it its finished appearance . 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other parts , which are put in for ornamental purposes , are dyed in the leather at this stage by means of a Power Tip Press . 5 . Sewing. ? The different parts of the upper are sewn to120 THE PRINCIPLES OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT gether on special sewing machines ; and the cloth lining is likewise stitched to the leather . 6 . Eyeletting . The eyelets and hooks are next inserted , or buttons are attached at this stage of the process . The rapidity with which this is done is remarkable . One machine will place perfectly all the hooks and eyes in a pair of shoes within the space of five seconds . 7 . Stiffening Toe. ? This is done by cementing a piece of pulp board material between the under part of the tip and the lining to prevent the shoe from curling up on the end . 8 . Blocking Sole Leather . Dies are made for different sizes and shapes , and the outsole is cut from heavy hide by means of a powerful press . 9 . Blocking Insole . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inferior grade of leather is used . 10 . Rounding Soles. ? The roughly died out insole and the outsole are separately reduced to exactly the desired shape on a specially designed machine called the Planet Rounding Machine . 11 . Evening Insole. ? The insole is passed through a little machine which reduces it to an absolutely even thickness . 12 . Splitting Outsole . This is an operation similar to the evening , but the machine is heavier on account of the heavier leather that must be shaved and cut . Both machines make all soles uniform in thickness . 13 . Rolling Outsole . The outsole is passed through a heavy rolling machine where it is subjected to tons of pressure between heavy rolls . This brings the fibers very closely together , and greatly increases the wear of the shoe . 14 . Channeling Insole . In this operation a little slit is cut along the edge of the insole , extending about half an inch in toward its center . At the same time a little channel is cut in the leather so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be smoothly drawn over after the insole is attached to the welt and upper . // 15 . Cutting Heels. ? The heel pieces are died out from small scraps of leather . 16 . Cementing Heels. ? The small pieces are firmly cemented together , and one piece especially selected is fastened to the top of the heel , thus giving a good base for nailing it to the shoe . 17 . Compressing Heel. ? The heel is put under great pressure to give it exact form , and to increase its wearing qualities . 18 . Inserting Insole. ? The insole is now attached to the last , and the last is put inside the upper , and a pulling over machine in the hands of a skilled operator is used to adjust the last to the upper . 19 . Lasting. ? When the last is properly adjusted , the shoe is taken to the lasting machine , where the upper is neatly stretched over the entire last . This operation is one of the most difficult and important in the shoemaking process . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its wearing qualities are greatly impaired . The machine works with almost human ingenuity . It has a set of fingers which grab the leather , pull it over the last , and then it inserts , at frequent intervals , tacks to hold the leather in shape . 20 . Welting. ? The welt is now sewed from the inside lip of the insole so that the needle passes through lip , upper , and welt . In this way all three are securely united , and the welt protrudes beyond the edge of the shoe . Just before the sewing has been done , the tacks , which were driven into the last to hold the upper in place , are withdrawn . 21 . Trimming. ? The surplus portions of the lip , upper , and welt , are now neatly trimmed off , and the welt is made to stand out evenly from the shoe . After this is done , the tacks which held the insole to the last are withdrawn . 22 . Attaching Outsole. ? The outsole is covered with ce122 THE PRINCIPLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insole and welt by means of a heavy machine . 23 . Trimming Sole. ? The portions of the sole extending beyond the welt are trimmed off so that both welt and sole make an even edge . At the same time a flap and channel are cut around the edge of the outsole , as was done in the insole. 24 . Opening Channel. ? The cut channel is opened out on a channel-opening machine , making it ready to receive the stitch . 25 . Stitching. ? The sole is firmly stitched to the welt on a powerful stitching machine . 26 . Closing Channel. ? The inside of the channel is coated with cement , and the flap is smoothly drawn over so that the stitches are entirely hidden . 27 . Leveling Sole. ? The sole is put under heavy pressure on a leveling machine , which subjects it to a rolling process , smoothing the bottom . - 28 . Tacking Upper. ? The portion of the sole designed w receive the heel is not sewn to the welt . At this stage it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails being turned by a steel plate on the heel of the last . 29 . Heeling. ? The heel is now nailed to the shoe and the bottom cap put on the heel . 30 . Finishing. ? This consists of several steps , all tending to give the shoe its final form and finish . 31 . Packing and Shipping . The diagram on page 123 ( Fig. 15 ) shows graphically the relationship of these various steps to each other . The great number of operations necessary to produce a shoe makes it important to order the processes in the most economical manner . The ideal order of arrangement is the straight , industrial line . The assembling industry may be regarded as a river fed from many sources , the shipping room corresponding to the mouth of the stream . The ideal plant // is one which will make the rivulets flow into the main channel as soon as possible , and yet not flow in until all is ready for their absorption , otherwise they will hinder progress . ( See Fig. 17. ) // Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and since it is important that it be in the midst of a large labor supply and easily accessible to good markets , both local and distant , it is necessary to place the plant in either a city or suburban location . Consequently , the plant can not be spread over too much territory , because not only would it unnecessarily increase the interest charges on the property , but would also increase the burdens of heating and power transmission . The general form and structure of a shoe factory is characteristic of almost all of the plants of the direct producing group . The establishments are units in themselves , having few if any outbuildings . The indirect assembling industries differ greatly in their plant construction from those just considered . Nearly all machinery-making plants require at least three comparatively large auxiliary divisions aside from the machine shop , namely , the drawing-room , pattern shop , and foundry . If the plant is very extensive , these auxiliary departments may increase until they include a carpenter shop , brass foundry , blacksmith shop , boiler shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition to these directly contributing plants one will almost invariably find a pattern storage shed , a lumber shed , power house , boiler house , and possibly paint shed , drying kilns , and other departments of more or less importance . The building of a vessel probably offers the most complete set of operations common to any assembling industry of the indirect type . To construct a ship it must , first of all , be designed in the engineers ' offices and drawing-rooms . Here the shape , size , and specifications for the hull , machinery , and boilers are drawn up . The arrangement of the compartments in the vessel for carrying passengers , cargo , and coal , and for receiving the propelling equipment is shown . The furnishings and equipment of all the various departments of // the vessel are specified , and detailed drawings are made of every part of the hull , machinery , and equipment . The drawings are then sent into the three main divisions of the plant , each one of which carries out its assignments according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the Hull , the Boiler , and the Motive Power 1 ) i visions . A. HULL DIVISION . 1 . Forms and Templets Making. ? In the mold loft of the yard are received the drawings of all hull parts , and iii here are made all the forms and templets which are to he used as guides by the workmen in constructing the hull . 2 . Keel and Rib Cutting and Shaping. ? All the framework of the vessel is cut from the structural iron and bent into shape . 3 . Plate Shearing , Bending , and Punehing. ? The plates which are to make the hull of the vessel are cut out in a mach ine called shears and shaped in bending rolls , and the rivet holes are put in by powerful punches . 4 . Keel Laying and Ribbing. ? The foundation framework for the ship is made by laying a heavy piece of structu ml iron the entire length of the vessel , and from it at right angles are set radiating ribs of varying shapes and lengths , so that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the designed shape and size . 5 . Fitting Plates. ? The plates which have been previously punched and shaped are now fitted to the ribs and to each other , the rivet holes are reamed out , and rivets inserted to hind the plates together . All plates that are to be below the water line are usually hand riveted , but above the water line machine riveters do the work . 6 . Piping . When the framework begins to be covered , the pipe and steam fitters put in all the piping necessary to // supply the complex organization of the vessel . In it are put sewage systems , steampipe lines for heating the compartments , and conveying steam from the boilers to the engines , the plumbing for carrying hot and cold water for the convenience of the passengers , and all piping necessary to supply the machinery with water inlets and exhaust outlets . 7 . Joinery Work. ? While the piping is going in and the hull is being still further completed , the wood work is introduced , and the carpenters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , window casings , paneling , and all other fittings specified by the contract . 8 . Wiring. ? While the fittings are being installed , electricians wire the vessel throughout . 9 . Caulking. ? At this stage all the seams are made water-tight by having a tool go over and swell the edges of the steel plates firmly against the side of the piece to which they are attached . B. BOILER DIVISION . 1 . Laying Out. ? The plates are laid out on a floor and marked for the shaping operations necessary to make the boiler. 2 . Punching. ? The plates are punched for the rivets . 3 . Flanging and Bending. ? In order to make a boilershell , the two headpieces must be turned over like the lid of a baking-powder can , and slipped into a cylindrical piece of steel , thus making a complete cylindrical boiler after all the parts have been riveted together . The turning of the flange in an inch and a half steel , which is the thickness of some of the boiler shells , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boiler-head flanging machine . The steel is highly heated , firmly held between the two disks and then the edge is revolved against a roll . In a very few minutes a complete bend or flange is turned over . 4 . Fitting and Riveting. ? The plates , which have preASSEMBLING // viously been punched , are now put in place , the holes are reamed out , and the rivets inserted . Inserting Tubes. ? In order to present a large heating surface to the water , the boilers are filled with a great multi tude of tubes through which the hot gases flow in their course from the fire box to the stack . Caulking. ? Here all the seams are made steam-tight 1 ) y a process similar to the one used on the hull of the vessel . Installing in Ilull. ? The finished boiler is now in-stalled in the hull , the fire boxes are attached , and non-con ducting material is put around all exposed radiating surfaces to economize heat . C. MOTIVE POWER DIVISION . PATTERN MAKING. ? In the pattern shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in wood so that the molder can have a form to which he can build his mold to construct the casting . The making of patterns is very exacting work , requiring highly skilled mechanics to read the drawings and interpret them accurately . As a result there is comparatively little division of labor and no elab orate equipment in the pattern shop . FOUNDRY OR MOLDING DEPARTMENT . Making the Mold . In the foundry the conditions are much like those in the pattern shop , only here unskilled labor can be used to a much greater degree . Moreover , the units handled in the foundry are manifold heavier than those in the pattern shop , and there is very little assembling done in the foundry . The process briefly consists of inserting the pattern in proper supports and then tightly ramming sand around it . After the sand is fixed in shape the pattern is withdrawn and the mold is smoothed off and coated with some surfacing material , which will prevent the sand from caving in when the molten iron is poured into it . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow , the mold // must be filled in with some solid material , the size of the hole desired in the casting . These fillers are technically known as cores , and the cores are made apart from the molds , dried in ovens , and then set into the molds after the pattern is withdrawn . The core is then anchored to prevent it from shifting when the metal is poured around it . The mold is then assembled and bolted together ready for the next step . 8 . Casting. ? After the mold is fixed the casting is made by pouring the molten metal into openings reserved for its reception at various parts of the mold . The filled mold is allowed to stand until the metal has solidified and cooled . 4 . Cleaning Castings. ? After the metal has cooled , the mold is withdrawn from around the casting and the adhering portions of sand are chipped off by means of air hammers in the hands of a rather unskilled class of workmen . M. MACHINE SHor. ? When the cleaned casting is re-ceived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing calls for , and is covered with a scale which makes perfect joints impossible between the parts . Hence the pieces of iron must be cut , smoothed , and adjusted to each other until they make a perfect fit throughout the entire mechan-ism . The steps in the process are : Laying Out. ? Here the rough casting is picked up by a crane and carried to a large , smooth , level table where lines are accurately drawn , according to the drawings showing the exact amounts that must be trimmed off in order to make tight joints . Planing or Finishing Straight Surfaces. ? The cast-ings have their straight surfaces cut and smoothed on a series of tools known as planers , milling machines , shapers , and the like . The usual practice is to smooth off one surface and use that as a basis for accurately cutting the other sides . The large pieces are cut off on planers ( see P , Fig. 21 ) and large milling machines . Small pieces are handled on shapers , small boring and milling machines , millers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pieces. ? Two kinds of round surfaces may be cut , convex surfaces which are represented I ) y the forms of shafts and other similar pieces , and concave surfaces as represented by the inside of cylinders and the I ike . Shafts and such bodies are usually cut on machine tools , known as lathes . The piece to be cut is firmly held between two centers , and is revolved toward the cutting tool . The concave surfaces are usually treated on a boring mill , either verticle ( see BM , Fig. 21 ) or horizontal ( Fig. 16 ) , although much of this work may be done on lathes . Finishing Irregular Pieces. ? The cutting of gear teeth , t he putting in of keyways , the drilling of holes and the mak i ng of slots , the finishing of surfaces having compound curves , ) l lid any number of incidental operations which must be done // in the shop , are performed on special machines designed for such purposes , as , for instance , gear-cutters , keyway cutters , drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portable , Blotters , and other special machines . 5 . Making of Bolts , Nuts , and Small Parts. ? Besides the main castings which must be finished off and fitted , there are hundreds of bolts and nuts , small rods , oil cups , tubes , piping , washers , keys , and other pieces of greater or less size necessary around the engine , in order to hold the pieces together , oil them properly , and to provide for the taking up of wear and other incidental work necessary to make the engine run , and keep it in condition while it is running . These things are made on special machines , the most important of which are the turret lathe , which is largely used to make nuts and bolts of large size , and an automatic screwmaking machine which makes bolts and screws from the straight rod of steel . This latter machine does its work absolutely without the intervention of human labor after the bar of steel has been inserted . 0 . After All the Parts are Machined , They Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizes the thousands of pieces that go into a marine engine , when one knows that the weight of some of these parts is twenty tons or more , while the dimensions of others are less than that of a cent , one can appreciate the fact that ingenuity must be exercised in designing , building , and placing the tools so that the parts will make one direct line from the beginning to the end of their passage . Machine-shop structure has long been a matter of grave consideration on the part of architects and engineers . At the present time the gallery type is the approved one for a machine-shop building . In this design there are three main divisions of the shop . ( See Figs. 17 and 21 . ) Sections A and C have two stories . B is kept clear of a second floor to allow for the passage of one or more large cranes which handle // heavy castings . In some plants two tracks are made for the cranes , one of which is superimposed above the other , the more powerful crane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material in the shop . The lower track may have several cranes of smaller capacity . The small parts are carried by means of elevators to the upper floors of the sides A and C. Here they are put through the various machines necessary to get them into the finished shape ; and as each step is performed , they are moved forward in the direction of the erecting floor , so that by the time they are completed , they are ready to be lowered to the assembling or erecting floor . The heavy parts are laid out on laying-off tables and then given over to the planers , millers , lathes , and other tools on the lower floor . The machines also are arranged so that every succeeding operation means bringing the large piece nearer to the assembling space . The placing of the erecting floor in such relative position with regard to the remainder of the shop has several advan-tages : 1 . It is in one of the best lighted parts of the shop . 2 . There are no floors above to interfere with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is in a place where all parts of the floor are easily reached , so that one can get to any part of the work under construction . 4 . It is under the heaviest cranes , so that all parts can be readily handled . 5 . It is the converging point for all material that goes into the finished product . 6 . It is accessible for shipping purposes . In connection with a machine shop it is always necessary to reserve a considerable portion of space for tool and store rooms . The machines and workmen are hourly in need of supplies and tools for their various jobs . Good practice places // those divisions in a portion of the shop where the space taken will not hamper the continuity of the process , and yet will be most accessible to those operatives whose duties require the greatest number of changes in tools . In the shipbuilding plant under consideration there are two erecting floors , one for large work and the other for small work . The general course of the parts for both large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant is one worthy of careful consideration . If a small engine has been erected under space A , the heavy crane above this floor can pick up the entire engine and transfer it to the launchways without the necessity of taking any of the engine apart . ( See Fig. 17 . ) If a big vessel is being built , the engines are erected on the large erecting floor , and when completed are separated into as large divisions as can conveniently be handled by the crane . They are then lifted to cars on the tracks TT , and hauled to the launchways , where another crane lifts them from the cars and carries them to the vessels . Fig. 17 shows the arrangement of one of the most recently constructed shipyards in the United States . It does not possess a foundry , but otherwise its equipment is complete , and it is one of the best arranged plants in existence for inter-departmental communication . An overhead crane with a capacity of 100 tons can run the entire length of the combined boiler and machine shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other respects , too , it is well arranged . If , at any time , it should be desirable to add a foundry , it could be added to the right of the diagram as a continuation of the machine-shop building . For convenience of working it is ideal . All divisions , even the shipyard , are under cover , so that inclement weather need never hinder construction . The arrowed lines show the general course of work through the various departments to the launched ship . The short railway connection across the shops // enables the ship cranes to handle anything that comes out of either of the two shops , so that from the time the goods are received from the outside world until the launched vessel is ready to steam down the river there is one straight continuous line of work with little if any retracing of steps . The shipyard considered above is an example of an assembling industry . The plant , however , with its construction , excellent as it is , does not have many railway connections for handling its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary in shipbuilding , for the river is the avenue by which the finished commodity is distributed . If a plant is handling a product to be distributed by land , its railroad connections should be superior to those shown above . It is also true that if its product is of such a nature that it can be transported from department to department by means of railroads instead of cranes , the former is perhaps preferable . The three preceding chapters have considered the kinds of industries and the ideal methods of adapting plants to meet their needs . The key to success in building a plant is to make it handle the work in the cheapest manner ; and the cheapest manner is the one which will send the goods from the beginning to the end of the course with the least expenditure of time and labor . The architect , however , is foolish , indeed , if he does not recognize that there are conditions that may modify his ideal plans . Every manufacturer appreciates the fact that to erect the cheapest building possible he must spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may never occur . This subject will be reserved for the next chapter . CHAPTER X FIRE PRECAUTION , AND ITS EFFECT ON LAYOUT AND STRUCTURE A WELL-DESIGNED establishment may deviate widely from the plans just considered , and yet be the best possible one that can be constructed to suit existing conditions , a fact amply illustrated by plants known the world over for their economy in production . Apparently these plants violate nearly every recognized principle that has been laid down for the industries of their class . The Standard Oil Company , for instance , has refineries erected at various points throughout the country , and their arrangement individually manifests a most scattered and ground-wasting design . From the industrial and chemical standpoints , oil refining is a continuous analytical industry having to do with the handling of liquids . In many respects it is similar to sugar refining . The crude oil is received and heated , and from it are first driven off gas and the light oils . The residue is passed on to other stills and subjected to further heating and condensing operations until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , volatile illuminating oil known as " water whi.te , " a heavier grade called " standard white , " another grade designated as " straw white , " machinery or lubricating oil , paraffine oils , petrolatum , or vaseline , cylinder oil , refined paraffine , and coke . There are , of course , other products from the refineries made by further separation and treatment of the native petroleum , but they are all obtained by the same means ? successive distillation , filter pressing , or sweating the crude oil and its derivatives . The 135 // ideal structure for an oil plant may appear to be one with the lines of a sugar refinery , a high building situated near waterways and railroad facilities . Why , then , do engineers of the oil-refining business so waste space and power ? Because oil is so inflammable that it must be kept as far from flames as possible . One can not be too careful , for in every plant there are occasional outbreaks of fire in some portions . So great is the fire danger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume the risk . Fire seems bound to break out somewhere in the establishment in the course of time , and if the departments are not isolated , an entire plant , worth millions of dollars , may become a heap of scrap metal and rubbish . On account of the great danger , an oil refinery must be situated in some remote section apart from other valuable property . It must have a large area , its buildings must be widely separated , and every precaution taken against fire loss . Fig. 18 gives some idea of the scattered way in which the divisions of the distilling departments are situated , and shows , also , the way in which buildings are separated . A gas-making establishment affords another illustration of a plant which can protect itself from fire only by building on large stretches of ground and in remote quarters . Gas is a product more inflammable than oil , but the raw material is not so susceptible to ignition . Let a fire once occur in a gas plant and the results may be calamitous . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rise in temperature or a carelessly struck match will give a vivid flash and a terrific explosion . The proof of a fire is not a mass of flame , but a lot of bent plates and twisted beams of iron . For ordinary kinds of manufacturing the causes of fire may be divided into the common and the special hazards . The common hazards include those fires which may occur in any kind of a building , whether it be a department store or a machine shop , a slaughtering establishment , or a cotton // mill . The special hazards include the fires which grow out of some risk peculiar to a plant of any particular type . A good classification of the common and special hazards is found below , copied from an article by Henry A. Fiske , entitled " Causes of Fire . " " The Common Hazards may be divided into the following gen eral classes and sub-classes : // The Special Hazards will vary according to the class of risk , but may be divided into the following general divisions : Storage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or General Manufacture . Finishing . Waste Material . While some classes of manufacturing risks will have only one or two of the above groups , others will include all of the divisions . Besides the two general classes of causes , i.e. , Common and Special Hazards , may be noted the Exposure and Incendiary fires , which hardly admit of any general classification , and are not in-cluded in these tables . " 1 The relative importance of these classes in causing fires may be judged from this table : // The main causes of fire are bad housekeeping and carelessness . Twenty per cent of all fires can be traced to the fact that the owners of plants permitted the accumulation of dirt , oily waste , and other easily inflammable material . From the above table no less than 7 per cent of the common hazard outbreaks are due directly to rubbish and sweepings and oily waste , while among the special hazards 10 per cent are the result of the improper disposition of waste materials . Fires due to the lighting apparatus are to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incandescent bulbs are safer than arc lamps ; and , if the wiring and lights are properly installed , electric illumination is , from the insurance point of view , preferable to any other kind . An electric fire is almost invariably due to faulty installation , lack of care in maintenance , or the careless use of the electric lamp . Power fires are commonly caused by poorly hung shaftings , by shaftings not being properly watched , by hot bearings , and loose pulleys . Belt holes running between the main floors of a building are very dangerous risks , because the friction of the belt is apt to start a fire , and the holes between the floors are ideal means to promote its spread . Boiler and fuel fires can be almost completely eliminated by taking care to detach the boiler-room from the main building and to construct it of non-inflammable material throughout . Among the special hazards the table shows that about 26 per cent of the fires have been caused in the making or actual manufacturing process . Few fires are the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business acts in combination with some common oversight . For example , in a cotton mill the principal hazards are in the openers or scutchers , where foreign material , coming in contact with the steel teeth , causes sparks which ignite loose cotton . Place the scutcher on a clean floor and the fire will have little chance to spread // before it iu quenched . In the card-rooms the air is permeated with fine cotton , and the floors are apt to gather accumulations within a very short time . If here an electric short circuit takes place , or there is a badly installed electric light , a fire is almost inevitable . Flour-mill records show the following : Fires due to spontaneous combustion of stock and dust explosions , 12 per cent , conveyers 4 per cent , grinding 8 per cent , cleaning machines 4 per cent , and special miscellaneous hazards 1 per cent . Contrasted with that , 71 per cent of the fires are due to common causes . ' In foundries special hazards total 82 per cent , in which the cupola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent , core ovens 9 per cent , molding and casting 12 per cent , miscellaneous special hazards 12 per cent , and the ordinary causes make up but 18 per cent.2 Shoe factories have 19 per cent of their fires caused in cementing , 6 per cent in bottoming , 3 per cent in waxing heels , 6 per cent in naphtha and naphtha blacking , 4 per cent in the waste chute , with 11 per cent due to miscellaneous accidents , and 51 per cent due to common causes.3 Although on many occasions fire would not occur were carelessness not evident , the object of the builder of a factory is to construct his plant in such a way that an occasional oversight will not result in the destruction of his property . At the present time there are two types of factory construction which succeed in limiting combustion ? slow burning , and fire proof . The slow-burning type received its highest development in New England among the textile factories , where it is // generally known as mill construction . Mill construction is less costly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , with reasonable care it makes a safe building . The principles of mill construction involve ten ideas . 1 . There shall be no openings between floors , either to admit belts , stairways , elevator shafts , or for any purpose whatsoever . 2 . There must be no concealed places in floors or walls which will permit of the hidden development of a fire . This necessitates the using of very heavy floor timbers , spaced from eight to twelve feet apart , and the floors must be constructed of three to four inch planks with single or doubletop boarding . Thus all the joists are exposed and readily accessible to hose or sprinkler water . 3 . The floors must not only be free from large openings , but they must be as nearly air and water tight as possible . This demands , besides the use of the heavy timber mentioned above , that the lumber must be well seasoned and laid down in a skilful manner . 4 . The outside walls of the building should be so built of brick or concrete that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division walls are to be carried at least three feet above the roof to prevent flames from leaping over . It is also desirable to have these walls winged on either side of the building to prevent a possible fire from leaping around the edges . 5 . If there must be openings in walls between departments , they are to be protected with heavy fire doors or wireglass windows , or fireproof shutters on the windows . These are designed to confine a fire to its place of origin . 6 . The elevator shafts , stairways , and necessary passageways between the floors must be entirely enclosed in solid , brick walls on all sides opening into the plant . The only exception to this is in the belt tower , where sufficient space // must be allowed in the wall to permit the shaft or belting to go through . The belting , however , does not pass from one floor to the other . Even in the belt tower there is no direct communication between floors . 7 . The power house of the plant must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in height . The height of the fabricating building must not exceed five stories , or sixty-five feet above the ground level . 8 . Stacks , flues , and chimneys must be of brick or some approved fireproof material . 9 . The roof must be flat and smooth , with just sufficient pitch to provide for proper drainage , and must be covered with metal , gravel , or approved composition . Cornices should be composed of incombustible material . 10 . The building should be divided up into fire sections , each one not exceeding 5,000 square feet , unless adequately equipped with sprinklers . Fig. 19 shows a sketch of the general protective schemes used in a slow-burning building . Mill construction , while often effective , has , partly through lack of care and partly through the expensiveness of lumber , fallen into disfavor , and is beginning to yield place to fireproof construction . In the fireproof building , all the precautions taken in mill construction are employed , but instead of using timber in any part , it must use either brick , terra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fire-resisting material ; and , moreover , all steel , iron , or other metallic material which is likely to bend or weaken in the presence of heat , must be adequately covered with non-conducting fireproof material , which will not permit these supports to bend or crumble in the presence of fire . The doors and windows of the fireproof building must be made of other than combustible material . Everything should be unburnable , and at the same time the structure should be so made that there will be no spaces or cavities to permit of the accumulaFIRE // tion of material away from easy view . No section , however small , should be built in such a way that water or any other extinguishing material can not be quickly and accurately ap-plied. 1 44 THE PRINCIPLES OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT For a number of years there has been much discussion of the question of the best building material for factory purposes . At one time , brick-mill construction was considered by far the most acceptable . There seems to be a tendency , however , within recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it is proving to have very satisfactory fireproof qualities , and is cheaper than structural steel propoily reinforced and covered with insulation . The Turner Construction Company states of some structures it recently erected : " The cost of these buildings , according to estimates , made by the Bush Terminal Company , based upon authoritative sources , was something over 10 per cent less than what the same structure would have cost in first-class structural steel . The cost as compared to mill Construction was found to be in excess of not over 5 per cent . " The Robert Gair Company , a large paper goods concern , has two buildings which contrast the value of the older style of protection with the fireproof design . Across the street from the new building , erected by the Turner Construction Company , are two slow-burning , mill-construction buildings of large size . " Under the same conditions of ownership , occupancy , usage , sprinklers , installations , contents and exposure hazards , the rates on the mill-constructed buildings are 21.4 cents on the building and 65.6 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the building and 29.6 cents on the contents . Furthermore , the officials of the Gair Company are the authority for the statement that the building saves them probably $5,000 a year in eliminating vermin loss . " With regard to the cost of construction , the mill buildings have about a 5 per cent difference in their favor , while the concrete cost 20 per cent less than structural steel properly guarded . The photograph ( Fig. 20 ) shows an interesting fire test which well contrasts the lasting powers of the two types of building in case of fire . The fire started on the fourth // floor of the reinforced concrete building , and burnt itself out without spreading to any of the other floors above or below . It did , however , break through a wall opening into the building next door and completely burned out the two upper floors and ruined the entire contents of the structure . According to the Trussed Concrete Steel Company , " special attention is called to the fact that in the Kahn System Building the sprinkler system was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas in the mill-constructed building the sprinkler system was in good condition . . . . Had the fire doors been in place between the old and new structures , the fire would undoubtedly have burned itself out without getting into the mill constructed building . " For some time , concrete buildings were regarded with disfavor by insurance men because of their liability to collapse while in course of erection . Insurance Engineering reports a number of such disasters , but investigation has proved that the fault has been due to poor workmanship and inferior design rather than to any inherent weakness in the properly reinforced material . Until concrete , reinforced or not , has completely hardened or set , it must be supported in casings because of its more or less fluid condition . If careless inspectors and unscrupulous contractors neglect this necessary precaution , there is grave danger that their penny wisdom may cause the death of some workers and be the means of their own financial ruin . Aside from the material which makes up the body of the building , manufacturers and others seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effective protector . For twelve years , the National Fire Protective Association has a record of 6,064 fires in sprinkled risks where the heat was sufficient to operate the sprinklers . Sixtyseven per cent , or 4,039 , of these fires were practically or entirely extinguished by the sprinklers . Twenty-seven per cent , or 1,647 , were held in check so that additional help put them // out at a small loss . Only 6 per cent , or 378 , of the fires were uncontrolled by the sprinkler system . A careful study was made of the unsuccessful . systems , and the following table shows the causes : The automatic sprinkler consists of a series of pipes ar-ranged in a systematic manner under the ceilings of the rooms with valves placed at regular intervals which are closed with some easily fusible metal . In case of a fire the tempera-ture of the room will soon rise to the point where the metal melts , opening the valve and causing it to throw out a spray of water . In order to have an effective sprinkler protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so constructed and the sprink-lers so distributed that there will be no parts either concealed or otherwise out of range of the quenching stream . There must he a constant supply of water great in volume and sufficiently high . in pressure to make it always possible to guarantee that the water will reach its designed range at any time . The pipes must have adequate diameter to permit of // the passage of enough water to the valves , and the valves must be freely acting at all times . 4 . Care must be taken that the water does not freeze in the pipes , and that acid fumes or chemicals do not affect the working of the valves . If either one of these things operate , the most expensive and elaborate system may prove utterly worthless . The Crosby-Fiske Handbook contains diagrains of a number of distributing schemes showing both the approved And unapproved method of arranging the pipes . No less than 125 sprinkler valves are also pictured , and of that number only seven are approved by the Fire Underwriters ' Association of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the risk makes it impossible to prevent water from freezing in the danger zone , there has been devised the dry sprinkler system . In the dry sprinkler system air is pumped into the pipes in order to back the water into a non-freezing zone . In the presence of excessive heat the sealing metal on the valves will melt as in the ordinary system . In a few moments the air will escape through the resulting openings in the spraying devices followed by a stream of water . In order to keep up the pressure in the sprinkler system two schemes can be used , the gravity tank and the pressure tank . The gravity tank is the older of the two ideas , and is ample for all ordinary cases . Such a tank , according to the underwriters ' specifications , must have a capacity of at least 5,000 gallons . Ten thousand gallons is urged , and tanks with capacities of over one hundred thousand gallons are not uncommon . The minimum height requirement for the tank is not less than 25 feet above the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erecting the tank . In establishments which are all enclosed within the same set of walls , and in places where the ground is limited , a common scheme is to perch it on top of the main building itself . // This place is objectionable because it tends to weaken the building . Insurance companies are opposed to having buildings topped with much weight , unless extra precautions are taken to strengthen the holding walls . A later and more approved plan is to have special structural work provided for the gravity tanks . Where there are a number of buildings , or extensive grounds , a special tower is frequently constructed for the vessel . The pressure tank is an automatic device consisting usually of a cylindrical tank placed horizontally and located in the upper stories of the building . Its capacity varies from 4,500 to 9,000 gallons of water or more , and it is kept two thirds full of water . The other third consists of air under pressure , always over 75 pounds to the square inch , and frequently reaching 150 and more . Connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and the other for water , so , whenever the pressure drops down or the water begins to flow out , the replenishing of both air and liquid can readily take place . Many establishments do not have sprinkler systems , but nearly all do take the precaution to install fire hose . To make a hose system efficient there must be a constant supply of water under considerable pressure . This is usually maintained by either a gravity or pressure tank , as described above . There must also be installed a piping system , to which are fitted frequent outlets for hose connection . Good practice demands that the outlets shall be between 100 and 200 feet apart , and that the length of the hose shall be from 50 to 100 feet , neatly folded on swinging racks . The effectiveness of hose protection depends upon two things , a constant supply of water under pressure at the hose coupling and people with presence of mind around to use it when occasion arises . Aside from the sprinkler system and the hose , there are two types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire pail . There are several types of chemical fire extinguishers , namely , the liquid hand extinguisher enclosed in three-gallon upset tanks , the chemical tank on wheels , built usually in 40 to 60 gallon sizes , stationary chemical tanks , and dry powder extinguishers . The most effective chemical extinguisher is the small upset tank combination . It plays a jet of extinguishing fluid some forty feet for nearly one minute . The extinguishing material usually contains carbonic-acid gas and sulphate of soda in solution . When it comes in contact with the burning mass , soda salts are deposited forming a coat of material which tends to exclude air and retard combustion . While in operation a considerable pressure is generated in the extinguisher . At ordinary temperature a pressure of 125 pounds accumulates within the tank , and if for any cause whatever the nozzle becomes closed , 200 pounds and over may be reached . One can see how a cheap extinguisher may be a very dangerous instrument in the hands of an operator , because any concealed weakness makes it liable to explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the fire underwriters , while the dry-powder extinguishers , according to the CrosbyFiske handbook , have been the subject of the following circular of the National Fire Protective Association . " In view of the fact that several so-called fire extinguishers , consisting generally of sheet-metal tubes filled with mixtures of bicarbonate of soda and other materials in powdered form , have been widely advertised as suitable for use for fire extingu fishing purposes , this committee has to report that in its opinion all forms of dry-powder fire extinguishers are inferior for general use , that attempts to extinguish fires with them may cause delay in the use of water and other approved extinguishing agents , and therefore their introduction should not be encouraged . " ' // No matter how well protected a plant is , it should always be so equipped that human beings can be informed at once when a fire is starting . Even if we have an automatic extinguisher , there should be some quick means of giving an alarm . In one case a sprinkler system operated so effectively that it flooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire itself . It is also advisable to have a sprinkler alarm in order to notify people that a fire is in progress , because it is by no means impossible for a fire to get utterly beyond control of the sprinkler system within a very brief period of tune . The sooner human aid is attracted , the better it is for all concerned , because other means can be taken to quench the fire , and after it is extinguished , all unnecessary water damage can be prevented by turning off the water . It is advisable to have a sprinkler alarm for another reason . Sometimes the sprinklers accidentally break or leak , causing water to flow when there is no fire at all . Where there is no sprinkler system , automatic fire alarms are especially desirable . There are many kinds of such devices on the market . One common scheme of fire signalling is to place thermostats from ten to twelve feet apart at all portions of a risk . Fire alarms are used for all kinds of purposes . Some are put on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing , others are installed in coal bunkers which are liable to catch fire through spontaneous combustion . The general principle of the alarm is to have an electrical circuit , which is susceptible of being closed by the expansion of two pieces of natal in the presence of heat . To be effective they must work at all times of danger , and to keep them in working condition they have to be subjected to periodic inspection . In largo risks , it is not advisable to depend exclusively upon automatic signaling devices . Supplemental protection is afforded by human watchmen who , from the standpoint of efficiency , may prove of doubtful value . In one plant an old // employee was given such a place . His conception of the duties of the position was to stroll around the building sev-eral times during the early evening . By ten or eleven o'clock he felt assured that no self-respecting fire would intrude any later , so , arranging for himself a comfortable couch he spent the remaining watching hours in sleep . His case was not an uncommon one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of making watchmen service trustworthy , and that is to install time-recording devices at all portions of a risk where inspection should be nude . The first time-recording clocks installed , were put in for the purpose of keeping accurate tali on the fire watchman . If a watchman is efficient and conscientious , he is one of the best fire pro-tective devices known , but unless he is , his utility is uncer-tain . The fire watchman usually visits both the inside and the outside of the risk , and makes a connecting link between the inside and outside fire protection . Outside fire protection may consist of automatic sprinklers located over windows or other openings . It may be a device which w ill send a cur-tain of water over an exposed wall . In general , however , the outside protection consists in placing water mains and fire plugs or hydrants in such places that they will adequately cover the entire risk . Good hose should be kept in the vicinity of all fire hydrants , enclosed in such a way that it will be safe from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . The watchman should be quick and intelli-gent , He should , on discovering a fire , immediately turn in the alarm and then try to extinguish the flame . The efficiency of the outside fire protection , aside from the automatic devices , depends upon three things : the water supply , the effectiveness of the watchman and firemen , and the efficiency of the hose . Great care must be taken of fire hose , because cheap hose is likely to break at the most critical moment , and is never // dependable . Fire underwriters and insurance companies inspect the various makes of hose on the market . On good tried material they set their stamp of approval , so that no one need unwittingly use defective material . The proper way to keep the hose is to place it in houses installed within the vicinity of the hydrants or fire plugs . Here also fire underwriters make it easy for one to use the best plans because they have drawn up careful specifications for hose houses .. Many plants have well-drilled fire companies organized from among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some insurance companies insist upon frequent unannounced drills , because no matter how good and efficient the appliances are , they may prove utterly worthless in the hands of a nervous or incompetent crew . Protection to property is important , but safety to life is vital . Fire escapes are installed for the purpose of providing sure exits to the employees in case a plant becomes ignited . Two types of devices are common , the exterior and interior enclosed fire escapes . The former is an iron stairway attached to the outside walls of the building , so arranged that easy and safe exit can be made through the windows and doors of every floor . The latter is a completely enclosed shaft running the entire height of the building . ( See Fig. 19 , FE . ) In this shaft are placed the stairways , and frequently the passenger elevator , if the plant possesses one . Connection is made to each floor by means of an iron platform extending from a door on the outside wall of the shaft to another door some distance away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this way there is no direct connection between the enclosed shaft and the building , yet there is easy communication to the street from all parts of the structure . CHAPTER XI THE BUILDING AND THE WORKERS MAN is like other animals ? best results require pleasant , healthful surroundings . If compelled to work in a dark , cold , or repelling environment , his output will suffer . The comforts with in the building and a spirit of hearty cooperation arnong all the departments influence the physical state and mental attitude of the employees . Comforts can be provided when the building is being erected by providing for five things : 1 . Abundant light . 2 . Sufficient heat . 3 . Good ventilation . 4 . Adequate space for workers . 5 . Convenient toilet and wash rooms . 1 . ABUNDANT LmnT. ? There are many operations in almost every line of manufacturing , for which abundant light is an imperative necessity . Without it the workmen are hampered in their activity and can produce neither good work nor a large quantity . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the building in more or less dark corners , the managers should so arrange their machinery that those which require the greater light will be in the more desirable sections . Before the time of the steel frame , factory buildings had to be made with a comparatively small amount of window space in order to give proper strength to the structure ; and the higher the building , the more massive had to be the masonry for the lower stories . Steel structural work overlaid with brick made possible better natural lighting . A brick , 153 // steel frame factory building can allow as much as 50 per cent window space without endangering the strength of the structure . Still more recently , reinforced concrete has been used quite extensively , and with increasing favor ; because it is if anything cheaper than the steel structure , and likewise permits of quite as much window space . ( See Fig. 20 . ) The old style machine shops , like factory buildings , were very deficient in window space compared with their modern prototypes ; but sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even worse . In a shop that was not by any means ideally lighted , the management decided that they needed some more storage room for iron plates and other heavy materials . They appealed to the city councils to have the street closed , which separated two of their departments . When that measure was put through they erected a shed against the wall of the machine shop covering nearly all of the windows of one side of the building . It is true that the shed was open on the street side , but its long slanting roof covered the windows , and darkened the machine shop . The two methods of lighting a structure are by windows from the side or from the roof . Roof lighting has been used for many years . Fig. 21 illustrates a skylighted room . The objection to skylights is that shops thus lighted may be exceedingly warm on account of the direct rays of the sun . If the ceilings are high , however , the discomfort is less , although high ceilings will not obviate the unpleasant results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects have adopted the scheme of lighting their buildings from the top by means of the saw-tooth roof . The saw-tooth light openings are usually faced to the north . In this way the light is admitted , but the direct rays of the sun are excluded for the greater portion of the day . The saw-tooth window is not strictly a skylight , but it has all the advantages of the skylight without its disadvantages . // Light should be provided for the plant by day , by night , and for such times of the day as outside light is inadequate for the work in hand . A great many methods of artificial lighting are advertised . The four common forms of electric lighting are the flaming arc light , the mercury lamp , the c ) mmon incandescent bulb , and the ordinary electric are . Tl e flaming and mercury lamps give very good satisfaction , and are less expensive to maintain than the common incandesr'ent and arc forms . They are , however , more expensive to install . The artificial light in any plant should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any flickering or unevenness of the light nor disturbed by the casting of shadows . Two great objections to the are light are its shadows and its flickering . The incandescent lamp gives a steady light , but it casts shadows , and in many cases is not powerful enough to give thorough satisfaction . The ideal light is one which most nearly approaches daylight in its intensity and diffuses the rays evenly during its entire time of running . The flaming arc light and the mercury light approach these ideals , and in general make a superior means of illumination . 2 . SUFFICIENT HEAT. ? The heating of buildings has tested the ingenuity of engineers and owners for many years . It depends of course very largely upon the type of manufacturing that goes on within the building , to what extent the various departments shall be heated . A foundry or blacksmith shop can get along with considerably less heat than a machine shop or textile mill . In any case , however , it is a short-sighted policy for the management of a plant to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heating a plant during cold weather is more than paid for by the increased capacity of the workers . Several means of heating a plant may be installed : ( 1 ) Hot Air from , Furnaces Direct. ? This method is little employed and is very expensive on account of its great // wasting of fuel , and is unsatisfactory because it is hard to distribute the heat . The writer knows of one instance where a plant was heated in this way with large furnaces . During cold weather it was almost impossible to get all of the rooms comfortably warm during the entire day . The workers in the poorly heated sections would sit with chilled hands trying to perform their tasks , but their best efforts were ineffective , and during and after cold spells the operatives would frequently be detained at home to nurse colds and other maladies resulting from their exposure . ( 2 ) Hot Water. ? Hot-water systems of heating are economical in small plants . They have objections in that they do not aid ventilation , and if the system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it requires a great amount of heat and a considerable length of time to get the system working to its full efficiency . ( 3 ) Steam Heating. ? The most economical and generally used system of heating in plants and workshops is to utilize the exhaust steam from the engine , supplemented by live steam from the boiler , whenever ne ss ; iry . Steam heat has the advantage of being easy to apply at any point by the mere insertion of a coil of pipe . The objection to it is that it does not actively aid ventilation ; but under the best of conditions special means must be taken to properly ventilate a building which has a large number of occupants . Steam heating is much more quick in its action than any other system , and is easily handled . Aside from the question of expense the ideal system of heating is one which works hand in hand with the ventilating system . Properly handled , the combination of the steam and hot-air systems succeeds in doing this . A scheme that is used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public character , is to have an arrangement something like the one shown in Fig. 22 . The Steam pipes are placed in front of the air port . The cool air from the outside enters // the port , passes through the filter screen , between the steam pipes , and from thence to the rooms . In certain plants , like textile establishments , it is necessary to have a considerable percentage of moisture in the air in order to get the best results in working the fiber . To do this humidifiers may be placed at the spray chamber , where water is sprayed through the air , giving it any degree of moisture required , and then the moist air is passed to the heating coils . This scheme heats the room with hot air by means of steam pipes . The air is conducted to the rooms by flues carefully covered to prevent the radiation of heat until it reaches the room . This scheme gives , when properly run , an ideal system . It is , however , expensive to install and to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heating but also for air circulation . A cheaper means of keeping the rooms moist in textile plants is to use the humidifiers directly . The humidifier is a spraying arrangement located at various parts of the rooms , which sends forth a fine , atomized spray of water or steam to the degree required by the conditions of the process . 3 . VENTILATION. ? A well-ventilated room should be free from bad air , and flying particles of dust . A number of devices may be used , the most common of which is to open the windows at the top and bottom at various places throughout the mill or factory . This scheme is unsatisfactory ; the change of air is too slow . If ordinary conditions of warmth are to be maintained during cold weather , certain portions of the room get too much air , others not enough , and drafts are liable to give the workers colds . Proper ventilation in grinding rooms and in special places is of vital importance to the employees . A grinder 's life is comparatively short , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rigid laws regarding the installation of blowers and other ventilating apparatus . The Illinois law for 1897 requires that hoods and hoppers shall // be placed over grinding wheels in order to catch the dust and refuse , which must be drawn away by a current of air to the outside of the building . New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Massachusetts , and all of the industrial states have similar laws . One can not emphasize too much the advantage of abundant light , adequate heat , and good ventilation . It has a measurable influence , and has the psychological effect of making the place inviting . One can hardly appreciate the full significance of this until one has worked in different kinds of plants . Where conditions are unfavorable , extra effort must be made to do the work . The gloom and unpleasantness of the surroundings lowers vitality , and makes both men and officials irascible and displeased with conditions . Little annoyances in the work which would be passed over without any comment whatever , are just sufficient to cause loss of temper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts , but they feel the effects of these surroundings . 4 . ADEQUATE SPACE FOR THE WORKERS. ? Workmen must have sufficient space in which to perform their operations . A floor crowded with machinery is a menace to their safety . Every machine should have abundant clearance space on all sides , so that the pieces can be handled readily and with safety , and no workman should be so placed that the passing to and fro of anyone will distract his attention . Everyone should have a convenient place to lay his tools where they will not be interfered with by his fellows , and will not annoy anyone in his vicinity . No exact rule can be established as to the amount of space that should be allotted to each man . There ought to be no undue crowding . No one likes to feel that he is in any way an annoyance to those around him . If one has room enough so that he can not reasonably feel annoyed at the presence of those around him , and can perform his work with safety to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true sense of the word . 12 // 5 . CONVENIENT TOILET AND WASH ROOMS. ? Every plant , whether engaging women or men , should provide the employees with convenient facilities for washing their hands and faces , and for disposing of their clothing while they are at work . Personal experience proves that the actual amount of money saved by offering decent facilities more than makes up the interest on the capital expended in the installation of conveniences . No desirable workman , no self-respecting girl , cares to go through the streets laden with the dirt and grime of his or her occupation , or in shop clothing if there is any distance to go and the work is of an unpleasant nature . The manufacturer might as well recognize first as last that good employees are self-respecting ones , and that self-respecting people give attention to their personal appearance . If washing facilities are not provided , employees will provide substitutes , and will steal an unnecessary amount of time to complete their ablutions by stealth . Foremen very often quietly permit such breaches of discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so exceedingly difficult to correct the abuse in the absence of any regularly provided place . If wash-rooms are provided for all , no one need take any minutes during the working day to secure water in his private bucket . If , in addition to wash-rooms , individual lockers for the employees ' clothing are installed within those apartments set aside for washing , decisive action can be consistently taken to prevent time stealing ; because foremen will have no excuse for permitting any laxness of discipline . If the washrooms are kept closed until quitting time , so that no one can get to his clothing until he is entitled to leave , there will be no object in stealing time . To what extent should an employer interest himself in caring for his employees ? Should a concern invest money to provide dinners and other comforts for the men at a low rate or at cost ? In the writer 's opinion , the question to what extent welfare work should be carried on depends entirely // upon what the plant is manufacturing and its class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring the employment of cheap labor will find it questionable economy to make investments of this character . Poorly paid workmen are , as a rule , ignorant . They can not afford to pay a sufficient price for their meals to make restaurants profitable investments for employers . It is also a questionable policy to give things to workmen for less than they cost , because by so doing the firm is making an open confession that it is either overcharging the public for its goods , or underpaying the men , and there is distinct danger that the firm will undertake duties belonging to the community at large rather than to the company . If a firm employs a class of labor whose patronage will make a restaurant and other activities a burdenless or profitable enterprise for the firm , the management might well consider the installation of such service . There are concerns in this country which give themselves a great deal of free advertising by letting the public know how well they treat their employees . Certain health-food concerns are open for inspection the year round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are showered upon the employees . Concerns of this character are in a distinctively different class than the ordinary competitive business . They can afford to carry on their philanthropies because the public pays for them . If one cares to do a little mental arithmetic he can prove it for himself . There are two very widely advertised articles on the market , one of which gives less than a pound ? to be exact , 14 ounces ? of wheat in a certain product which is sold retail at twelve cents per package . If Ave count 196 pounds of grain to the barrel and imagine that all the wheat ground goes into the flour , which is far from true , we find that a barrel of flour costs the consumers of that food about $25 . Another concern gives seven ounces of grain for ten cents , making it on the // flour basis worth about $50 per barrel . Selling their products at such famine prices , of course such concerns can afford to pose as philanthropists , but a machine shop , textile estah1ishnient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It neither pays as advertising nor in increased output on the part of the workers . Intelligent workmen as a class are not unreasonable . They want fair treatment and like to be put into surroundings nn.here they can respect themselves . They do not desire to he made objects of charity . They do appreciate efforts on the part of the management to get into close touch with them , they do like to work in pleasant surroundings , and are grateful to the firm that brings them into a better and closer understanding with fellow workers and employers . Man is a social animal , and prefers to work in a place where there is good fellowship ; but there is a distinct line to be drawn between efforts which really cost the employer nothing and do not lower the workman 's self-respect in accepting them , and the other kind which makes the employee conscious of a condescension on the part of the giver . CHAPTER XII THE POWER PROBLEM POWER is one of the prime causes determining the location of industries . Certain districts in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of falling bodies of water . A waterfall is the cheapest known form of energy . That does not necessarily mean that it will give the cheapest power to a prospective manufacturer . A high drop and a great mass of water are merely the raw materials from which to obtain energy to turn the wheels of a factory . A thing is cheap only when a small expenditure of money puts it into consumable form . To convert the wasting energy of a roaring cataract into productive income requires investments in several things . 1 . Land Around the Falls. ? The people who desire to use the waterfall must secure the land on both sides of the falls before they have a clear title to use the power ; and , if the stream is navigable , further permission from the state and federal authorities must he obtained . So far as purely engineering considerations are concerned , water-power equipment demands : ( a ) Space for a dam or reservoir for storing the water , in almost every case . At Niagara Falls and some other places a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general rule . ( b ) Power-house site . ( c ) A canal or trench to conduct the water from the river above the falls through the turbine to the stream below the falls . 163 // In many cases where a dam is necessary no land is needed for the site of the power house , the penstock , and flumes . It depends very largely upon the type of plant that is to be built and the nature of the falls as to how much land is actually necessary ; but some must be purchased in any event , and it frequently happens that the amount is quite considerable . 2 . The second item of investment is the hydraulic machinery . The main parts of the water-power equipment for a water turbine usually consist of a dam which may cost thousands of dollars , a long tube called the penstock or down flume , which leads the water from the head race to the turbine , the turbine itself , and the draft tube or draw pipe which connects the turbine with the tail race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-power plant , however , as it may be part of the dam ; and , if instead of a turbine the hydraulic engine happens to be an impulse wheel , there is no draft tube . After the power has been generated it must be transmitted . If the turbines can not be directly connected to the machinery , the manufacturer must invest in expensive electrical equipment to carry the power to his plant . In spite of these necessary investments water power has a number of advantages over any other form of energy . It is cheap to produce , because it requires neither the purchase nor handling of fuel . The mechanism is simple and can be kept in running order by a smaller number of people than is necessary in a steam plant . No space is taken up by boiler plants or by storage houses for fuel and ashes . Water power is naturally clean . There are no smoke ordinances to fear nor ashes to handle . Its disadvantages , while few , are sometimes important . A heavy investment may be necessary before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require so little power that it is not worth his while to make an in-i // vestment which will utilize even a small fraction of the cascade . Unless one wants to consume a fairly large amount of energy , the force of falling water is not cheap in spite of the fact that in large quantities it is possibly the least expensive power generated . This accounts for the fact that in the vicinity of a great many of the larger falls throughout the country , large power plants have been installed which manufacture power for sale . Small manufacturers may find it profitable to purchase power as needed . The advantages of purchasing power are considerable . Buyers are relieved of the necessity of securing the water rights , they need burden themselves neither with interest charges on the investments in power plant and transmitting equipment , nor with salaries to power-generating employees , nor with expenses for repairs or maintenance ; and portions of the buildings which would otherwise be taken up by a private power plant can be devoted to manufacturing . If a small manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power during the time the power plant has its peak or heavy loads , very low terms may be obtained . The power houses find it highly advantageous to keep a constant load on their machinery , and in order to induce people to distribute their consumption , they will make considerable concessions to those who are willing to agree to use power when the burden on the power house would otherwise be light . Even if a plant can not adjust its power consumption so that it can get these very low rates , it may still be profitable to purchase power . In such cases , however , the purchaser of power should take precautions to guarantee to himself a constant supply at all times . Ordinarily , conditions are such that a manufacturer can neither use a waterfall nor purchase his motive force . He must transform the lowest known form of energy , heat , into power . Two types of heat engines are known , the direct combus166 THE PRINCIPLES OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT tion , represented by gas , gasoline , and oil units , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between the two great classes of energy transformers is that in the former case the fuel is directly introduced into the cylinder and there exploded by a spark or flame causing consequent expansion of the gases so generated and heated . In the latter , the fuel first converts water into gas under pressure , and then utilizes the expansive force of the steam to convert the heat units into mechanical energy . If a plant is small , the gasoline engine is an exceedingly cheap power generator , and the probabilities are that this engine will become much more popular than it is even now . The gasoline engine is cheap to install and easy to run , although the fuel is somewhat dangerous to handle , and insurance companies are inclined to look upon it with disfavor . Within recent years , the gas engine has become an exceedingly popular form of motive power . Two general kinds are in use , those which utilize the ordinary gas from street mains , and those which consume producer gas . The former engine was the first used , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to install , it being necessary only to mount the engine on . a small base , and to make proper connections with the gas supply ; no ground space is required for a boiler , no chimney is needed , nor is it necessary to store fuel . There are no boiler repairs , no handling of ashes , and the cost of maintenance and attendance is low . The objections to the engines are their noise , bad odor , and , if the price of gas is high , their excessive fuel cost . At one time , all gas engines were run from the town lighting supply , and the owner of the engine had to pay the full domestic rate for his power fuel . This , of course , makes the gas engine an expensive apparatus if the amount of horse power consumed exceeds twenty or thirty horse power . In some sections of this country where natural gas is used , the old style gas engine is still the most profitable form of power // for a moderate sized factory . The city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for power purposes at a rate as low as ten cents per thousand cubic feet ; and in that locality the gas engine is a very popular means of power generation . Cheap gas is hard to get from ordinary town supplies . If a manufacturer is to use more than twenty to thirty horse power his gas engine becomes an expensive in strument with such a source of fuel . Chemists for a long time bent their energies toward the securing of a cheaper form of gas directly from the coal , and the results of their investigations developed that a cheap gas could be obtained in the form of producer gas . Engineers have also been able to design engines which can utilize this kind of fuel . Technically , producer gas is understood to mean the gas obtained by the partial combustion of fuel in a gas producer . The ordinary producer gas is usually made by driving air with or without the addition of steam or water vapor through a deep bed of incandescent fuel in a closed producer . Such gas is very poor for illuminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calorific power of one cubic meter of an average sample of semi-water gas is 1,432 calories , while the same amount of ordinary sixteen candle-power illuminating gas is 5,693 calories . ' Improve ments have been carried on in making and using this pro ducer gas so that at the present time the producer gas engine is a serious rival to the steam engine for both small and large units . Wherever gas is produced as a by-product , the gas engine is superior to the steam engine . Within the past few years , steel plants and other establishments , which in the course of their work develop gas , have found the gas engine the cheap est forri of power in existence . The Gary Steel plant in its // power houses has adopted the gas engine . Their electric power station is equipped entirely with gas engines as the prime movers . Their blowing engines are likewise gas driven . Some of the recent gas engines are as large as 2,000 II . P. , and on the continent of Europe there are twin tandem engines which develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in its infancy , it is demonstrating an efficiency which in the near future will give it first place among the economical heat engines . In the first place , by using the gas directly in its cylinders it saves a great deal more heat than does the most economical steam engine , because the latter must burn the gas under boilers and then utilize the steam . A gas-engine plant takes up about one half to two thirds the space necessary for a steam plant , which uses the most compact type of steam engine . The large unit gas engines , however , are economical only where the gas is developed as a by-product in some other part of the plant . Under these conditions , it is cheaper to burn the gas directly in the engine than it is to transform its heat energy into steam and thence into mechanical power . If , however , the plant does not produce gas incidentally to its other manufacturing work , or if the plant needs a boiler for heating , it is questionable whether steam power is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered , the reciprocating steam engine and the turbine . The reciprocating steam engine attained a high stage of development years before the turbine engine was even regarded as a commercial possibility . The steam turbine has , however , now demonstrated its efficiency , and in time it will probably displace the reciprocating engine . It may , for a while , dispute the field with // the gas engine . The steam turbine possesses the following advantages : 1 . It makes a great initial saving in foundation costs . 2 . Compared with the reciprocating engine it requires small floor space . 3 . Its oil consumption is very low , and as no oil is consumed in the cylinders , the condensing water may be used directly in the boiler . Its disadvantages , as compared with the reciprocating engine , are as follows : 1 . The first cost of engine is greater for equivalent horse power . 2 . If it does not operate with a condensing plant , it is wasteful in power . 3 . The condensing plant necessary for a turbine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 4 . Its high speed makes it disadvantageous for direct connection with certain electrical generators , and high speed seems as yet to be necessary to develop the greatest economy in the turbine . An economical steam plant , whether it be reciprocating or turbine , has a large number of subsidiary appliances to reduce power cost . Three kinds of economies may be introduced into the steam plant . 1 . Those which make the water more suitable for steam purposes . 2 . Those which make the boiler and furnace more efficient . 3 . Those which make the engine more efficient . Water contains either organic or inorganic impurities held in suspension or in solution . If they are suspended impurities , they can be removed readily by a filtering process . If , however , the impurities are soluble , complications arise in handling the water question . The common and most undesirable impurities found in
