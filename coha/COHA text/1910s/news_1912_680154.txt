txt What the Latter Would Find Out if He Could See the Levy Imposed . In his speech at the workingmen 's dinner on Wednesday night Gov . Wilson touched upon the tariff Issue , Insisting that if the people only knew how much they are paying in Indirect taxes through the tariff they would soon put an end to tariff abuses . This point was illustrated by the picture of the returning tourist to his dear America and his experience at the American Custom House after running the gauntlet of all the revenue-producing stations in the effete Old World . In the opinion of Gov . Wilson , the anger of such an American when forced to pay up at the Custom House would tell how angry all the people would be if they had to pay over to a customs officer the ' tariff taxes they actually pay on each thing they buy . That would bring the tariff home to the people in a way they I could understand . If the people could learn their tariff lesson in this way , the whole tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will learn it some day somehow is as certain as death and taxes , and the beneficiaries of the present jughandled system , if they were wise , would not wait dor the storm to break . Power is never so surely intrenched that it can not be broken . This is the history of the world . es . In the Democratic Textbook for 1912 , the " best seller " of the day , so to say , many examples are given of the terrible drain of the protective system upon the resources of the people . The total tariff tax of the average family in the United States is about $115 annually , and of this sum only $16 goes to the Government , for the support of which the tax is ostensibly laid ; the remainder is the rake-off of the trusts , which are under the protection of the Government . Revenue is essential , of course , to the support of the Government , and the only method the Government has of raising revenue is by taxation . The average family would not object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government going , or twice or three times that amount , if so much were necesI sary for its economic administration ; but what the people object to is the additional tax of $99 which each average family is now forced to pay for the benefit of the special interests . ore It has been carefully and accurately estimated that a just revision of the tariff downward would save the consumers in this country not less than $2,000,000,000 the year , which would be more than $22 for every man , woman , and child in the country . It is one of the monstrous results of the present tariff that it cuts the people both ways ? " a cumin ' an'a gwine , " as they say in Georgia  --  the trusts , which have been built up by the tariff for the protection of American industry , sticking the domestic consumers for all the business will stand and selling their " surplus products " to foreign customers at lower prices than their regular output is sold for in or own beautiful " home market . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign markets , reshipped to the United States , paying ' freight both ways , and delivered to buyers here for less than the same goods can be purchased at home in the first instance . It is claimed by The System that this can be done because only the surplus is disposed of in foreign markets , which claim was somewhat disfigured by Gov . Marshall when he offered the suggestion that the direct product be marketed abroad and the surplus be kept at home . Of course , it will be protested by the beneficiaries of the present method of handling the surplus that this Is trifling with a very sacred subject , but this is the plan many of the plain people of the fields have followed for years In disposing of their crops . It often happens , as a cloud of witnesses would testify , that the family has to get along with " the leavings , " which is only another name for " surplus . " while the main crops are sold to outside buyers . If the people who vote would only think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist upon tearing down the tariff wall . Some examples of the ininquities of the present tariff law will show them the unfairness of the whole system . The cheapest woolen blankets  --  the sort the plain people must have  --  pay a duty of 165.42 per cent ; the dearest  --  the kind the rich can afford  --  pay a duty of 104.15 per cent . Flannels that are worth not more than 40 cents the pound  --  the sort the working people must have  --  are taxed 143.67 per cent. ; flannels over 70 cents the pound  --  the sort that Lady Vere de Vere demands  --  are taxed 76.37 per cent . Stockings , worth from $1 to $1.50 the dozen  --  the sort that Jerry Simpson wore I after he became a statesman  --  are taxed 76.37 per cent. ; stockings , worth from $2 to .3 the dozen , are taxed 59 per cent . The cheapest underwear is taxed 56.90 per cent. ; the dearest , 50 per cent . Even the useful and sometimes festive but always dangerous shotgun worth from $5 to $10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $10 is taxed 45.46 per cent . The same inequalities run through nearly the whole law . The things that the most people must have are the things that are taxed the highest , with the result that the least able are compelled to bear the heaviest part of the load . Gov . Wilson would like to run every American voter through an American Custom House so that he might find by actual personal , experience exactly how much he pays for the support of the Government and how much for the benefit of the special interests . ? .. The taxpayers do not see It . they make no " returns " as in the case of their ordinary property , they do not step up to the tax collector 's office and pay so much money over the counter ; but they feel it in all their bones , in the higher cost of living , in the necessities more than in the luxuries . Time taxpayers do not pass through the Custom Houses where the duties are collected , but they pay the freight just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will suffice : Eleven Yards of a fancy wash fabric which is manufactured in the United States for $1.06 and in England for $1.11 , is sold in England for $1.87 and in the United States for $2.75 . A cotton curtain scrim found in many American homes pays the manufacturer a good profit at 6 cents the yard sold , to the print works . The print works sell it to the jobber at 101.3 cents , the Jobber sells it to the retailer at 121/2 cents , whose profit must be added before it reaches the consumer . In England the same thing is sold at 15.22 cents . " Under the Republican protective tariff system the American farmer is consgelled to buy in the greatest monopoly market in the world , and to sell in the cheapest market . " Gov . Wilson would like to run all the taxpayers through the Custom House , just once , so that they might sea for themselves and feel fort , themselves exactly what tribute is being exacted of them , not for the support of their Government , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which holds them under subjection .
