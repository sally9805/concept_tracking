txt As the college drives follow one another with bewildering rapidity , they are developing a new technique . Chief emphasis is , of course , still laid upon the insufficiency of salaries , which is forcing our professors in increasing numbers into commercial life , with the result that the average of character and ability in the university stands to be dangerously lowered . This is the central and vital fact in the situation ; but there is a limit beyond which the public can not be counted upon to respond to even the saddest ' of tales . The new method is to lay stress upon the peculiar service which the individual institution renders to the community . Thus the Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers the use of its laboratories and its researchers to all manufacturing and commercial houses that contribute to its fund . The importance of scientific research to a nation 's industry does not need to be emphasized . It was the German chemist who laid the foundation of the supremacy in trade which once stood so easily within the nation 's grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technique of industry which threatened downfall . The United States stands between the two , but considerably nearer the level of Great Britain than that of Germany . Our many and excellent technical universities collaborate with our manufacturers as far as they are able ; but even before the war they were hampered by a lack of equipment and of skilled researchers . The institute 's call is for $4,000,000 , to match a gift of an equal amount which an anonymous donor has offered on condition that it be doubled . In return for each contribution the individual or firm has the right to make use of the institute 's plant and staff . One of the foremost technical schools of the world is thus retained as if it were a firm of consulting engineers . From the ' other end of the educational gamut , Princeton is making a similar bid . A " university " in the English rather than in the German sense of the word , it has been loyal to the ideal which makes character and sound culture the chief aim , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American universities which has striven consciously and intelligently to foster a soundly human and democratic tone in undergraduate life . Its system of " preceptors " marks an era in the development of intimate and personal teaching in small groups , as distinguished from teaching which is conducted only in large lecture courses . Now Princeton is developing a system of " student advisers , " the aim of which is to give each undergraduate , from the moment he enters , a designated member of the Faculty who is his guide , philosopher , and friend in all that pertains to his college course . The system has been tried elsewhere ; but it has been too little serviceable because the labor on the part of the Faculty was voluntary and unpaid . It is the aim at Princeton to make the board Of student advisers thoroughly efficient . The man who has , or who intends to have , a son at Princeton is offered a personal and tangible return for his contribution . The new method has a further advantage in that , so to speak , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Bryn Mawr has launched its drive  --  may well take heed of the methods employed by the different drive committees .
