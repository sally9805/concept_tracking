txt It is the habit of those who contend that Mr. Tarr 's Tariff Board must be waited for to say the final word on the reduction of taxation to cite the excellent service of the German Board of Experts . The analogy limps . There are several points of difference which make the Taft board likely to be less efficient than the German one . In the first place , our tariff is much more complicated . The German tariff system is not only simpler , but is devised rather to promote foreign trade than to suppress it . It is the system under which the remarkable expansion of commerce and of industries serving foreign markets has been carried on . It is true that the agrarian provisions r-of the tariff are oppressive to the public generally , and especially to the labor class , and undoubtedly hamper production by increasing the cost o ; living . But everything practicable has been done to offset the disadvantages from this source , and this is one of the ' chief functions of the German Tariff Board . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such scope . But the chief feature of difference , lies in the fact that the German board is not hampered by directions to follow the absurd principle so ardently admired by Mr. Tarr , namely , to ascertain the difference in the cost of production at home and abroad . That Is a hopeless task . It might be possible to find approximately the actual cost of producing a yard Of woolen goods in one factory in the United States and the approximate cost of producing the same quantity in one mill ony . But . the cost of production in another mill in the same town in this country would net be the same . It might be changed by each or all of a. dozen elements  --  the free capital available , the ' skill of the , supervision , the excellence of machinery , the avoidance of waste , ancteven , in very great degree , by the important but quite indefinite element of the good-will between employers and employed . Like differ. ; enees exist in Germany . ' When - You finally come to a- statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and American goods you can only gay that one is greater or less than the other without any exact knowledge of I either . You are lost In a maze of unknown quantities . Again , one of the functions of the German experts is to study the relations of the tariff on foreign importations to all the elements of industrial ' and commercial legislation and to gen- , eral conditions . This includes the constant study of transportation and its ' rates ; of navigation by canal or ocean , its cost , its facilities , and its regulation ; of premiums , rebates , subsidies ; of combinations in every branch of activity where they exist ; and of the extensive influence of Chambers of Commerce . It even extends indirectly to the elaborate system of vocational schools . The tariff experts are , indeed , but a part the great system of expert investigation , supervision , and construction which first Prussia and ' now the Empire has developed . It may well be that , in time , the United States will evolve a like system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing remotely approaching it . It would be a costly error to submit our tariff legislation at this stage to the sole or controlling , , guidance of the gentlemen whom Mr. Tarr has employed as a Tariff Board .
