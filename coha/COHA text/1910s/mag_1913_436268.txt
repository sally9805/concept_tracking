HE is the most remarkable man in many respects that the South has ever produced , and it is doubtful if the records of a lordlier life than his can be found in the history of our Republic . He has never moved as other men , never worked by ordinary standards . He has been kingly in all his ways , lavish in his opinions , disdaining all expediency or deliberation , and moving to his ambitions with a princely assumption that has never been gainsaid by the people , and seldom by circumstances . ' This paragraph , printed in a Georgia paper at the time of Toombs 's death , for all its extravagance of eulogy , strikes a good note for beginning the study of him . There was something lordly in the man , something com .11-landing ; and it is a matter of the greatest interest to see why his achievements did not correspond to his ap ( k. , parent gifts . All agree that his physique was most impressive . Constant riding and other vigorous exercise kept him in excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill . Mrs. Davis 's admirable portrait of him should be borne in mind . ' Mr. Toombs was over six feet tall , with broad shoulders ; his fine head set well on his shoulders , and was covered with long , glossy black hair , which , when speaking , he managed to toss about so as to recall the memory of Danton . His coloring was good , and 208 his teeth brilliantly white , but his mouth was somewhat pendulous and subtracted from the rest of the strong face . His eyes were magnificent , dark , and flashing , and they had a certain lawless way of ranging about that was indicative of his character . His hand , were beautiful and kept like those of a fashionable woman . ' These physical qualities must he taken into account in considering Toombs 's speaking , and it was in eech that his greatest strength lay . hough his enunciation was too thick nd harsh , Alexander Stephens considered him to be one of the greatest stump orators of any age or country . All the vigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager enthusiasm of that passionate temperament were poured into his words . He spoke tdsonyjnee , if possible ; if not , to overwhelm . For the man was essentially a fighter and would yield to no one . His college life , in the late twenties , was in the main a record of unruly pranks , ending in a hasty requeh for honorable dismissal before some exceptional enormity became known to the authorities . A little later he earned the title of captain by serving under General Scott in the Creek War . The chief fighting of Toombs 's early life , however , was done at the bar . lie threw himself into the study of law with the passion which he showed in everything . At first he did not succeed in practice . Perhaps clients distrusted his too combative qualities . But his energy , enthusiasm , and splendid gif of speech soon overcame this coldness , and wealt h began to pour in upon hi in a steady stream . He not only had ' passion for the contest of the courthouse , ' but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . He would bear down opposition by the rush and vehemence of his oratory ; hut , if necessary , he could also analyze a complicated question , financial or other , in its minutest details . No one was more voluble where speech seemed indicated ; yet when circumstances required brevity , he could eliminate every superfluous word . In one instance his adversary had exhausted the court , the jury , and the subject . Toombs simply rose and said : ' May it please your Honor , Seizin , Marriage , Death , Dower , ' sat down , and won his case . Few lawyers of that day kept out of politics . None was less likely to keep out of them than Toombs . He early began to devote his thoughts and his tongue to what he considered the welfare of his country , and he continued to do so , in one way or another , almost till his death . But to Toombs the essential of politics was always opposition . Heaven knows , there is enough tight in this world , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw a rascal 's head , he hit it , and few even determined optimists will deny that he might be kept busy . I can not vouch for the following comment on him . But if not true , it is well invented . ' Revolution was the one instinct of his nature , absolute as that of sex in other men . " Do you mean revolution ? " a gentleman once asked of him in my presence . " Revolution , yes ; always , and ever , and from the first , revolution . Revolutionary times , " he added ; " there are , and there will be no good times but revolutionary times . " ' Thus , both as representative and senator , Toombs 's voice was usually hearcflaudin the negalive . Curiously enough , he and Alexander Stephens were intimate friends and their course was apt to be the same , but from very different motives . Stephens 's cool intellect always saw the doubts , the modifications , affecting any popular course of action . Toombs , also , had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure pleasure of o position itself . To begin with , he hated the party system . ' A nursery of faction , ' he called it . It was not recognized by the Constitution . Why should he recognize it ? Acting on this principle , he fought friends as well as foes . If the common cry was war , this panoplied herald of good tidings could raise his trumpet voice for peace . Why should we fight England over a boundary ? He was for peace ? for honorable peace . ' It is the mother of all the hopes and virtues of mankind . ' Why should we annex Texas and plunder Mexico ? Greed , greed , all greed . ' A people who go to war without just and sufficient cause , with no other motive than pride and the love of glory , are enemies to the human race , and deserve the execration of all mankind . What , then , must be the judgment of a war for plunder ? ' With domestic matters there was the same strenuous ardor in attacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be respected , if not respectable . He speaks of ' members of the two Houses of Congress who come here three months in one year and eight months in another ? which is about three times too long in my judgment . ' Public improvements and public facilities which tended to abridge the rights of the individual ? he would have none of them . The post office ? a dubious thing , the post office . ' I do not think it right , before God , for me to make another man pay my expenses . ' Rivers , harbors ! What are they compared to corruption ? ' Instead of leaving the taxes or the money in the pockets of the people , you have spent nine months in endeavoring to squander and in arranging to have more to squander in the next Congress . ' Railroads ! Why , our old Roman virtue will not allow us even to approve of one to benefit our own home town . Then there are pensions , a pestilent legacy of a heroic struggle . The old soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , will refuse them . Hurt my popularity ? What do I care for my popularity ? do you suppose I am here to please myself ? I had rather be at ilome , on my farm , with my wife , my slaves , and my cattle . Another thing , the cry of Americanism , Know-Nothingism . I scorn it to your faces . And you may turn me down , if you like . Are not Catholics as good as Protesttants , if they serve God ? So he spoke out , in the height of the fanatical fury ; and openly gave a large subscription to a Catholic church . Everywhere it was the individual against the mob , high or low , forward or backward . The rich were not to be favored at the expense of the poor . At the same time , let his enemies criticize his own lavish living and see what they would get . Who would say that he had not earned his money ? He had a right to spend it as he chose . Perish such demagogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his candor and audacity . As for that mysterious phantom , the money power , which broods like a shadow over the young twentieth century , this Boanerges of liberty divined , detected , and defied it sixty years ago , in a little different form , but in words which might come from the White House to-day . ' I have perceived that this mischief is widespread , this comp. tion greater , this tendency to the destruction of the country more danger . ous . The tendency to place the whole government under the money power of the nation is greater and greater . ' And while many of these protests were uttered in the name of the sacred principle of State Rights , let that principle itself once impose any obnoxious restraint , and its sanctity became as questionable as that of any other . Thus , in opposing certain obstructions to a projected scheme , he cries out : Public opinion will take them away , even though a sovereign state may stand up for them . Nothing else can reach Pennsylvania in this matter but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it has done elsewhere . ' And the public opinion of the world was shortly to prevail in the states of the Confederacy , in spite of Toombs and thousands like him , with their inviolable sovereignty . In all these various causes of opposition there was the same impetuous ardor of argument , the same splendid fury of invective , which , backed by the masterful presence and the thunderous voice , must have gone a long way to produce submission , if not conviction , / Listen to the manner in which he upbraids the Senate for sloth and hesitancy . ' Are we incapable of deciding subjects here ? Why , sir , the gravest questions of peace and war and finance and everything concerning a great government , are decided in almost all countries in one sitting . Here , after years of labor , seas of words , boundless , illimitable seas of words , and speeches to enlighten others , we come now to what I trust is a consummation of this difficulty , and we are asked for time because gentlemen do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand it any better . ' But of course all other disputes and battles were trifling and of minor significance compared to the great struggle between slavery and abolition , between North and South . The opportunities given by such a conflict were things of ecstasy to a nature like Toombs 's , and he breathed the fiery atmosphere as if it were his native ( ' lime . Scene after scene is depicted in which he stood out alone against a howling mob , bellowing what pleased him without regard to what please them , and in the end overcoming ha Ind by mere force of temperament . Toombs 's power in this regard was divined by Stephens long before the act sal crisis came , and the latter gives striking account of sending his frien to New York to face a bitterly hostile audience , and of the way in which Toombs , partly by clever ruse , partly by overmastering argument , succeeded in gaining a hearing and more than a hearing . Then there was the furious contest over the speakership of the House , in 1849 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no majority vote could be secured , and Toombs insisted that the House , not yet formally organized , could take no action in the matter . Members proceeded to take action . Toombs protested . Members shouted him down . He would not be shouted down . ' You may cry " Order , " gentlemen , until the heavens fall ; you can not take this place from me . ' Confusion increased , ' says the biographer . ' Members called out to encourage Mr. Toombs , and others to put him down . In the midst of this Babel he continued to speak , his black hair thrown back , his face flushed , and his eyes blazing like suns . ' He continued to speak , and in the end they heard him . It was a disgraceful exhibition , said the Northern papers . No doubt it was ; yet one can not help agreeing with Stephens that it was a splendid physical and oratorical achievement . Even more notable , though the opposition was moral , not physical , was Toombs 's defense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The actual audience was decorous enough ; but when one thinks of the man and the place , of all he represented and of the passionate anti-slavery spirit boiling about him , the ? erasion stands out as picturesque , to say the least . Not less characteristic , in view of all it meant , is the coolness of his testimony concerning the assault made by Brooks upon Charles Sumner . Toombs was charged with having given Brooks the support of his presence , if not more . His answer , not merely to the indignant Senate , but to the angry mil lions of the insulted North , is startlin in its imperturbable insolence . ' As f rendering Mr. Sumner any assistan I did not do it . As to what was sai some gentlemen present condemned i in Mr. Brooks ; I stated to him , or t some of my own friends , probably , tha I approved it . That is my opinion . And again : So far as relates to inter fering , or giving assistance , he is right . I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that side . ' So we come to the break and the great parting . But before considering Toombs 's activity in this , let us look at some of the other elements of his character . For the more I study these prominent men of the Civil War period , and indeed the prominent men of any period , the more I see that their great ! ness consists largely in a balance of qualities ; that is , even when they have one quality in marked excess , it is tempered , restrained , and modified by a striking makeweight of its opposites . Thus , so far , we have seen Toombs as a fighter , riotous , rebellious , exulting in the extravagant and often ill-timed display of violence , almost a sort of SIR ROBERT TOOMBS political mountebank . Yet he was also something far more than this , and something far different . He had a splendid sense of humor . This , as might be expected , was often rough , noisy , and boisterous , and did him damage ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a great boy , as when , at Taylor 's suggestion , he switched off in the dark a train-load of Governor Brown 's pet state troops for a fight in South Carolina . He used a shrewd and savage wit in assailing his political adversaries . ' You have heard what the gentleman says about my coming home to practice law . He promises , if elected to Congress , he will not leave his seat . Ii leave you to judge , fellow-citizens , hether your interests in Washington ll be best protected by his continued esence or his occasional absence . ' me one urged that an antagonist had ade at least one good appointment . That may be , ' answered Toombs , ' but hat was not the reason it was made . aeon was not accused of selling injusagice . He was eternally damned for selling justice . ' The same shining vivacity of repartee seems to have been always ready , in private society as in public gatherings . That keen and passionate tongue must indeed have been somewhat dreaded . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dining with General Scott and told of a woman who rushed about in a steamer explosion , crying , ' Save the red-headed man , save the red-headed man . ' The red-headed man was saved , but the woman appeared quite indifferent . ' He owes me ten thousand dollars , ' she explained . ' General , ' said Toombs , turning to Scott , ' the Union owes you ten thousand dollars . ' These outbursts must have done Toombs more harm than anyone else , as when he remarked carelessly , ' We are the gentlemen of this country , ' and gave rise to William Whitmore 's pamphlet of The Cavalier Dismounted ; or when he stuffed an innocent English peer with monstrous tales of slave-holding obliquity which were afterwards recorded in print to the serious discredit of the narrator . Yet there is general agreement that Toombs was one of the most brilliant and fascinating of talkers , and Linton Stephens , no bad judge , says , ' Toombs , or Tom Thomas , can , and frequently do , speak more witticisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The sunniest , the sweetest , the most winning picture of Toombs and his laughter is that admirably given by Mrs. Davis . ' During the time of the highest excitement over the compromise measures , when Mr. Toombs was on his feet twenty times a day , he rose at daylight , took French lessons with his daughter , and became a good French scholar so far as reading the language went . He would sit with his hands full of the reporters ' notes on his speeches for correction , with Le Mielecin Malgr ? Lui in the other hand , roaring over.the play . I said to him , " I do not see how you can enjoy that so much . " He answered , " Whatever the Almighty lets his geniuses create , lie makes some one to enjoy : these plays take all the soreness out of me . " ' Something to love here , is there not ? And if the man liked laughter , he liked sunshine and quiet also ; country air , and trees , and flowers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spacious garden , with chards and vineyards , was to him n unfailing source of recreation and Leasure . ' He was a practical farmer , oo , himself superintended vast plantations and had an army of slaves under his charge . Alexander Stephens , an unimpeachable witness , tells us that ' his plantation discipline and his treatment of his slaves was on a perfect system of reason , justice , and humanity , looking as much to the welfare of his dependents as to his own pecuniary interests , ' and that ' his system and its success were wonderful . He would have as overseers only men of sobriety , good sense , and humanity . ' In the personal relations of life also , Toombs seems to have been full of charm . One vice he had , the taste for alcohol , which in later years overcame him disastrously . But even this , throughout his active life , he could and did control when necessary , and in any case it was but a feature of his strong social instinct and his love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southerner , he was ready to entertain everybody , and protested against the establishment of a hotel in his home town . ' If a respectable man comes to town , he can stay at my house . If he is at respectable , we do n't want him here at all . ' He was sensitive , emotional , ready to respond to any stimulus of / all or pathos . ' In speaking or the death of Mr. Brooks the other day in the Senate , he broke out in weeping and had to stop , ' writes Stephens . Toombs 's religious experience seems to have been somewhat elementary , but sincere . It was amusingly mixed with the impetuosity which character-ized hint in everything . When his wife was dying , he had some talks on serious subjects with the family doctor , who was anxious to put him in the right way . ' Why , doctor , I am a prayerful man . I read the Bible and the Prayer Book every day . ' Then why not be baptized , general ? Baptize Baptize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Especially attractive is Toombs 's af-fection for his wife , and the tenderness apparent in the few published frag-ments of his letters to her . She was a woman well worth his attachment , and the perfect marital fidelity empha-sized by all his biographers is distinctly srewd noticeable in a man of such a vigorous and impetuous temperament , beset at all times by so many temptations . The frankness , sincerity , and genuine hu-mility of his nature show well in a pas-sage written to Mrs. Toombs after their daughter 's death . ' God bless you ! Pray for me , that I may be a better man in the new year than in all the old ones before in my time . ' And equally attractive is the following expression of gratitude after twenty years of mar-riage . ' I know for whatever success in life I may have had , whatever evil I may have avoided , or whatever good I may have done , I am indebted to the beautiful , pure , true hearted little girl , who on the 18th November , 1830 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wives . ' Toombs 's excellent balancing t its were by no means confined to dom tic and social life . We have seen so ethingconstantly tempered by h , y of his headlong fury ; but tiliiiitAs foresight , restraint and moderation , when these qualities were clearly called for by circumstances . We have already heard Stephens testify that his friend was an admirable man of business . Adversaries even asserted that ' he loaned like a prince and collected like a Shylock . ' Certain it is that he had a remarkable grasp of finance , could unravel a complicated web of figures with precision and rapidity , and seize and clarify the essential features of the most bewildering business tangle . In his profession I have before referred to his immense labor in getting at the facts . He was quick to grasp essential points , but he did not neglect supplementing them by details which were essential also . ' Reading the report of a case , or an author on any subject , he at once seizes upon the real ideas , gleaning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as intuition , ' says Stephens . And when the material was thus once prepared , it was presented to the court , with vigor and passion , indeed , but also with method and thoughtful intelligence . ' As a lawyer , I have never seen his equal before judge and jury , ' adds the same excellent authority . And in law he was as-honest as he was able . ' An able laAryer and an honest man , ' writes Mr. Rhodes ; ' though harsh and intolerant in expression , he was frank in purpose . ' Good stories are told , illustrating his absolute probity and determination to keep his hands clean . ' Yes , you can recover in this suit , ' he said once to a client , ' but you ought not to do so . This is a case in which law and justice are on opposite sides . ' And on the client 's insisting , Toombs remarked , ' Then you must hire some one else to assist you in your damned rascality . ' Again , a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . ' Well , ' said Toombs , ' I should have charged a thousand dollars ; but you ought to have five thousand , for you did a great many things I could not have done . ' And to the end of his life he boasted that he had never had a dirty shilling in his pocket . Even in politics we find these curious contradictions of moderation and sagacity mingling with the ardor and violence of Toombs 's general temperament . It was said of him that he was ' violent in speech but safe in counsel , ' and many things prove that it was so . To one who has been startled ' by the vehemence of some particular outburst , the full reading of many of his speeches is a revelation of dignity , sobriety , and common sense . In nu-1 merous instances the course he recom- mended dand urged and followed was the course of moderation and fairness . Thus , in 1851 , he supported Clay and Webster in the Compromise measures , making himself extremely obnoxious to the Southern fire-eaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this action by the moderate Whigs can not be too much insisted upon . They roused the wrath of the violent partisans in all sections , and Webster , at least , earned the hatred and contempt of a large number of his constituents . Yet it would be easy to maintain that the patriotic course of that group of Whig leaders in 1851 saved the Union , not only then , but forever . They delayed the conflict for ten years , and during those ten years the North had time to accumulate the resources which , even so , were barely sufficient to enable it to overcome . Again , in the great Kansas struggle , Toombs 's voice was given for moderation and prudence . Senator Toombs introduced a bill which , in fairness to the free-state settlers , went far beyond the measures that earlier in the session had been drawn by Douglas , ' says Mr. Rhodes . And elsewhere , ' When Toombs said he was willing to take the will of the people of Kansas in a proper and just manner and abide by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had the Whig love of the Union . ' Still another curious case of Toombs 's moderation is the Boston speech above referred to . In going straight into the centre of the hostile country and speaking on the subject of bitterest contention , slavery , he nas indulging all his native instincts of combativeness . But once there , the speech he made was a model of simple , honest , reasonable statement of the very best that could be said for his fellons and for himself . No more persuasive , more manly , more human argument for Negro servitude was ever uttered than Toombs presented in the headquarters of abolition on the platform of Tremont Temple in 1856. //And so , when we come to the last great crisis of all , we find Toombs , the revolutionist , the hothead , the fire- eater , not doing his best at all times and at every opportunity to foment sedition and urge an outbreak , but keeping his temper , counseling moderation , anxious , to the very end , to cling to the , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , / he had his moments of forgetfulness . ' Toombs has just delivered a speech of the most abusive and inflammatory character of sic Judge Douglas . He spoke like a madman and acted like a fanatic , ' writes Stephens . Yet , during much of the time , his counsel was for restraint , deliberation , and endurance as long as endurance was possible . With calm foresight he deprecated any contemptuous assertion that the people of either section of the Union would be found cowardly when the crisis came . ' Sir , if there shall ever be civil war in this country , when honest men shall set about cutting each other 's throats , those who are least to be depended on in a fight will be the people who set them at it . ' So late as December , 1860 , he earned the of the violent party in his own state by opposing immediate secession . He thought that definite action should be fixed for March 4 , yet even to this he adds the admirable words : I certainly would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me in principle , but who were more hopeful of redress from the aggressors than I am , especially if any such active measures should be taken by the wrongdoers as promised to give us redress in the Union . ' It is only when he is forced to abandon hope that he commits himself in final and characteristically decisive language . ' I will tell you , on the faith of a true man , that all further looking to the North for security for your constitutional rights ought to be abandoned . . . . Secession by the 4th day of March next should be thundered from the ballotbox by the unanimous voice of Georgia on the 2d day of January next . ' The object sought would have been less objectionable to the North . It would , after two years of war , have been gained by a special treaty because it was strictly constitutional . . . . But Davis , Davis ? I know not why he was elected President of the Confederacy , except that he never succeeded in anything he undertook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not imagine Toombs succeeding at the head of a great government . Is it possible that one so utterly untrained to obey should ever have been able to command ? Those who are inclined to Stephens 's view should consider well the little scene depicted by the diarist , Jones , as occurring in the War Office at Montgomery , when the Confederacy was hardly born . Toombs was holding forth to members of the cabinet ? in a public office , mind you , before the gaping clerks . ' He was most emphatic in the advocacy of his policy , and bold almost to rashness in his denunciation of the mainly defensive idea . He was opposed to all delays as fraught with danger . . . . He was for making the war as terrible as possible from the beginning . It was to be no child 's play . . . . He denounced with bitterness the neglect of the authorities in Virginia . The enemy should not have been permitted to cross the Potomac . . . . Virginia alone could have raised and thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the Susquehanna . But she , to avoid responsibility , had been telegraphing Davis to come to the rescue ; and if he ( Toombs ) had been in Davis 's place , he would have taken the responsibility . ' This is the tongue which , Stephens thinks , could have saved the Confederacy ! Well , he did not become President , at any rate , and it is to be noted that he characteristically gave his hearty support to the election of Davis . What happened further ? Davis , who realized how mighty a power the man had been , was ready to offer him a place in the cabinet , the most honorable , if not the most important . And Toombs became Secretary of State . He held the position about four months . His biographer implies that , having put everything in the best possible shape , he sought a more active life . This is not the general view . Some maintain that he had not the system or the practical gifts for managing so great an office , and they cite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Depart . ment under his hat . They misjudge him . We have already seen that heisas master of all the details of handling a great plantation , and that in these he could be systematic enough . Such of his state papers and dispatches as have been printed are admirable in their vigor , brevity , and point . The true explanation his failure is supplied by Mrs. Chesnut in her usual terse and vivid fashion : IncompatibiP ity of temper . Mr. T. rides too high a horse ; that is , for so despotic a person as Jeff Davis . ' And Toombs himself indicates the same condition of things in a letter to his wife referring to a later suggestion that he should be Secretary of War , ? a post , by the way , for which Stephens considered him peculiarly qualified : ' I thought I had been very explicit on that point . I would not he Mr. Davis 's chief clerk . His Secretary of War can never be anything else .... So far as I am concerned , Mr. Davis will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks I pant for it , poor fool . ' There remains the army . Here , at least , Toombs should have shone out Did he ? A friend who knew him well said of him : ' He had one ambition , and that to the highest office within the Confederacy . That could not be gratified . He had another , to be Comman- der-in-Chief of the armies . That could not be gratified . He had no more . ' As to the ambitions , who shall say ? The fact is that the disappointed statesman plunged into a military career with headlong energy , and that he came out of it pretty much as he had come out of the political . Why ? Certain excellent military qualities he had , undoubtedly . He was brave ; rashly , extravagantly brave . He had the gift of inspiring others with his bravery . History will not forget his magnificent defense of the bridge at Antietam . General Lee 's praise of any man is the most enduring badge of glory , and Lee said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by greatly superior forces , and maintained its position with distinguished gallantry . ' Also , Toombs was beloved by the men of his brigade and took excellent care of them . He looked out for their health and comfort in every possible way . ' Whether against Johnston , Longstreet , or Hill , the First Brigade , First Division , was sure of a fearless champion in the person of its commander , ' says the ardent biographer . The biographer seems to overlook the somewhat extraordinary sound of commending an officer with so much enthusiasm for his bellicose attitude against his own superiors . But here , as everywhere , we meet in Toombs the same old defect . He was a splendid in di% idual fighter ; but he could not learn that lighting , like everything else , to be fruitful and efficient , requires , first of all , subordination . He could not learn discipline . Thus , one of his sick soldiers was refused hospital on account of some technicality . Toombs was told that the rules were fixed by General Johnston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke out in his emphatic fashion . ' You have been too rash , ' protested his own surgeon , ' you will be arrested . ' Johnston did not arrest him , because he liked Toombs and was generous himself . But another commander would have done so . Again , Toombs was fond of holding forth , even to the common soldiers , on the proper conduct of the war . If he disapproved of the action of his , superiors , he did not hesitate to say so , and often without very thorough knowledge of what his superiors were aiming at . He hated West Point because it meant discipline and training , and he hated Davis because Davis supported West Point . When the general rejoined his regiment after arrest , he is said to have cried out , Go it , boys ! II am with you again . Jeff Davis cant make a general , but it takes God id mighty to make a soldier . ' Comment is needless . Nor did he hesitate at direct disobedience , when it suited him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Days ' battles , made against Lee 's explicit orders , is a doubtful case , because Toombs claimed to have instructions from his immediate , superior . But in the campaign of Second Bull Run , Toombs 's brigade was ordered by Longstreet to guard a certain ford . Longstreet 's delicious , patronizing account of the affair should be read in full . Toombs was absent at the time , dining with a friend . When he returned , he swore that nobody should put his men in an exposed position like that without his knowledge , and ordered them back to camp , for which piece of independence , with accompanying bravado , Longstreet very properly arrested him . And ready as he was to criticize others , this fiery spirit had no notion of being criticized himself . D. H. Hill , not distinguished for his soft tongue , rode up in the middle of an action , and not understanding the circumstances , blamed Toombs for the conduct of his troops . ' You are always crying out , fight , fight , ' said Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Toombs resented it bitterly and would have insisted on a duel , if Hill would have met him . It is hardly necessary to follow Toombs the soldier any further . Many fine things are told of him , notably his whole-hearted submission when taken back to duty after his arrest by Long-street . Longstreet liked him , as indeed did everyone , and is said to have remarked of him admiringly that he needed only discipline to make him a reat general . Perhaps he needed some her things ; but discipline was the c ying need of his whole life , and it is i deed pathetic to see such exceptional fts falling , falling , by rapid stages , f om the candidacy for president to a tty and insignificant position in the eorgia militia . Mrs. Chesnut sums up his career with splendid vividness , if perhaps a little too vividly : ' Toombs is ready for another revolution , and curses freely every Confederate from the President to a horseboy . He thinks there is a conspiracy against him in the army . Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Toombs falls with it , what distanche has left to fall . In his own opinion , at any rate , the North was thirsting for his blood , and the melodramatic incidents of his escape from capture must have afforded him infinite pleasure : flights , disguises , concealments , thrilling hints of treachery , also the protection of lovely and intellectual young women . He was a . Chesterfield with ladies , ' says his biographer . ' The general would walk to ) and fro along the shaded walks and pour forth , in his matchless way , the secret history of ate ruin of the Confederate hopes . ' I wish I could have heard him ! And now comes the last curiosity in this extraordinary career . Before the war , in times of organized society , the man had stood forth a splendid rebel . Then , when rebellion became the fashion and had spread to everybody about him , he sank into complete insignificance . Comparative peace was restored , comparative organization ; and immediately , as a rebel and a fighter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . turned from his brief exile in Europe , he struck in at once with vehement battle against all the sins and errors of carpetbag reconstruction . It certainly was a fine opportunity ! How he must have luxuriated in the tempest of epithets which he hurled against the dominant party that was over-riding him and his fellows . ' Its tyranny , its corruption , its treachery to the Caucasian race , its patronage of vice , of fraud , of crime and criminals .
