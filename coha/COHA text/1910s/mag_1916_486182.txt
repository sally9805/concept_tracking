To appreciate the immense significance of the steps towards peace taken by the German Government it is only necessary to recall what its attitude has been for more than a year past . It has been an absolute non possumus . Germany could never take the initiative . She was , to be sure , ready for an " honorable " peace , but not hers was the responsibility of beginning the negotiations . Again and again the German Chancellor has washed his hands in the presence of the whole world . Germany could only fight on and wait for the Allies to make the first proposals . But now Germany makes them . We seem , therefore , to have before us proof that the pro ? longed strain and the demonstrated impossibility of a complete victory for German arms have impelled the German rulers to do what six months ago they declared that they could not'do  --  that is , make definite advances for peace . The demand for peace upon any reasonable terms must have been stronger among the German people than we knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship-owners have been moving quietly but insistently to seek an end to conditions which are more and more threatening them with ruin . Remarkable utterances by German publicists have recently been allowed to appear in the German press . Thus in the Berliner Tageblatt , not long since , a member of the Reichstag , Herr Gothein , had some very frank comments upon the terms of peace as outlined by Lord Grey and Lloyd George . Especially as regards their proposal of a " League of Nations " to keep the peace , he declared that " this is a pacifist programme with which every state can agree after the terrible experiences of this war . " And on Germany 's aims and the possibility of an early peace , Herr O-othein was very explicit : We do not strive for world-mastery . We wish to destroy or oppress no nation . We will gladly submit national disputes and differences of opinion to international courts of justice . Therefore , if this is also the peace aim of England , the war need not go- on ; there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men ; Europe need not plunge further into spiritual and economic ruin . In another issue of the same newspaper , the Tageblatt , Dr. Dernburg had a significant article . It contained not merely professions but at least one confession . He admitted that Germany had not done what she should , before the war , to prevent war . Here are his words : With the utmost conviction , I declare that the German nation wants with all its power to avoid such terrible happenings as the present world-war , and it wants all means to be brought into action which can help in this matter . We have never cut a good figure at the Hague Conference , not , perhaps , because we were not in the right , but because we shouted ' our own opinions of the proposals made there with such brutal coolness that the other side , which consisted of the leading men of the other nations of the world , was deeply offended That was certainly nothing to boast about , and certainly not diplomacy . In the whole matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of statesmen , as it is the duty of impartial observers , to discriminate between form and substance . The form of the German note was offensive . It was couched in the language of a haughty victor . Reading it , as also in following the Chancellor 's speech down to its closing sentences , one would think that an unquestioned conquerer was about to announce the conditions on which he would spare the lives of enemies absolutely at his mercy . But this was only the embroidery of it , only the Hohenzollern way . Behind all the boastfulness lies the plain fact that Germany has an intense desire to stop fighting . Coming forward with all the flourishes of a Germania trinmphans , she is actually a suppliant for peace . In her attitude to-day stands confessed the truth that the aims and hopes with which the German rulers entered into this war have been frustrated . Germany can neither impose her will upon Europe nor dictate a peace . She has set out to seek the best terms she can get . Let no one be blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German oratory . It is said that the German approaches to the Allies are insincere . They are described as a trick to fool neutrals , a trap to catch the Allies . The German note , with its studied vagueness , is pictured as a master-stroke of unscrupulous diplomacy . Well , even . granting all this , the course for the Allies to pursue is plain . What is the best way to expose a trick ? Why , by acting in straightforward good faith . How can a Machiavellian diplomat be easiest confounded ? By opposing him with the weapons of frankness and of truth . The Allies would not in. the least weaken their position if they responded to the German inquiry that they would be glad to receive Germany 's offer of peace . When they know what the terms are , they will be perfectly free to say what they think of them . Germany will be sure to ask at first more than she expected to get . The hope of an agreement would lie in continuing to discuss the possibilities . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum terms in such a way as to command the approval of all neutral nations and so turn the tables upon the alleged wonderfully adroit German diplomacy . The days which have passed since the German Government astonished the world by proposing to " enter forthwith into negotiations for peace " have made several things clear . One is that the German proposal will not be rejected on sight , with scorn and contumely . At first , there were outcries from irresponsible English and French newspapers , and from a few men in public life , which seemed to advocate flinging Germany 's offer back in her face . Thin attitude was due in part , it is probable , to premature and unfounded accounts of what the German terms would be . But apart from this , there was much ferocious talk about its being impossible to listen to anything from Germany except an unqualified and abject surrender . Even to-day , from Russia , there comes language of that tenor . It is not , however , the prevailing tone . It surely is not the tone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round to the view that whatever plan Germany puts forward to end the war must be considered on its merits . We are not saying that the Allies should go into a peace conference blindfold . They will be quite right in first demanding a sight of the terms of peace to which the German note refers . If they knew the conditions which Germany would propose. various courses would be open to them . They could declare that the terms were , as a whole , inadmissible , but that certain parts were reasonably satisfactory . Then they could either invite further discussion or lay down explicitly their own minimum terms of peace . And if the question then arose on what stipulations they would consent to enter a peace conference , they might , with the applause of mankind , lay down one indispensable condition  --  namely , that both parties should agree , before even debating anything else , that Belgium was to be evacuated and restored . If Germany should refuse to accept this necessary preliminary , then it would be she who would be put hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no time to stand on ceremonies and technicalities , or to take counsel of fears rather than of hope . Speculation how far Germany 's peace proffers indicate " weakness " will not get the world forward . Little is to he gained by comparative tests of " strength , " as shown in the willingness to consider peace . It is not strength so much as common-sense and common humanity that should engage the thoughts of statesmen on both sides . If the professed objects of the war can be reasonably attained by the Allies without further bloodshed and devastation , will any sane man accuse them of " weakness " if they grasp at the opportunity ? This is not a time for diplomatic punctilio . The ordinary forms of national folly should be rigorously excluded from the high debate on a possible peace in Europe . The fearful responsibility resting upon all the Governments concerned ought not , indeed , to lead them to relax their vigilance in safeguarding their own and providing for the long future , but neither ought it to fill them with needless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for is the statesmanship of simple faith , and of a clear-sightedness which will not forget the goal in too great concern over the exact means of . arriving at it . A REMINDER OF THE UNEARNED DECREMENT . The Sale of Madison Square Garden , under the hammer , to satisfy a mortgage , presents in a conspicuous and interesting instance a phenomenon that is quietly going on , upon a large scale , in a number of sections of New York and other cities , - without attracting much public attention . The highest bid that could be got for the property was $2,000,000 , although the mortgage debt that it was sold to satisfy was $2,475 , - 000 , and there was a second mortgage of $650,000 . The price paid by the recent owners when they bought the property from the Madison Square Garden Company in 1911 was $3,375,000 . Thus these owners , who , as is well known , have been carrying the property at an annual loss  --  as had the preceding owners  --  find at the end of the five years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In this particular instance it may be said that this experience is due to the peculiar character of the building and its uses . But everybody knows that throughout very considerable sections of the city the same kind of experience has been gone through , and this in the case of properties which at one time seemed not only fully established in business desirability , but apparently destined to steady increase of value . The case of Twenty-third Street has recently been particularly noticed ; and the story of Sixth Avenue presents an even more impressive instance . But there are older instances to which we have become so accustomed that we take no notice of them at all . Both on the lower West Side and on the lower East Side , there is a wide belt stretching for miles upon which stagnation or worse has been plainly written for a generation and more . And there are very good residential regions uptown in which a large proportion of the property is worth far less now than it was two or three decades ago . Some of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value in the future ; but in the meanwhile heavy losses are incurred by those who have invested in it , and there is no doubt that a large part of it will register a heavy net loss , when interest , as well as taxes and upkeep , is taken into account , no matter how far in the future the balance may be struck . What common observation tells us is am .. ply confirmed by the figures of assessment of land values . That these are kept up to true values as closely as possible in the Borough of Manhattan , we all know . On consulting the last report of the Tax Department we find that the total assessment of taxable land values for the Borough'of Manhattan was practically the same on January 1 , 1916 , as it had been on January 1 , 1912 , the figures being $3,134,000,000 and $3,128 , - 000,000 respectively . Accordingly , the great increases which we know to have taken place in certain rapidly rising spots , and the moderate increases which have occurred in other localities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . Just where these are situated , it would require much research to determine ; but a slight indication may suffice to give an idea of them . For the three-year period 1913-16 , figures are given for certain major divisions of the various boroughs . One of these , in Manhattan , is Section 3 , extending across the island from Fourteenth to Fortieth Street . Here the land values declined from $737,000,000 in 1913 to $672,000,000 in 1916 ; and evidently this loss of $65,000,000 means a much heavier loss than this in the places that suffered the loss , since there are , even within this district , a number of places where there has been a marked gain . This element in the story of real-estate values has an important bearing not only on the equity of the single-tax principle , but on its practical operation . Under that principle , applied in its fulness , the owner of city real estate would not profit by any advance in the value of the site , since that would be absorbed by the increased tax ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners in case of declining values , which does not seem to be contemplated by single-taxers  --  any decline in the site-value would be a dead loss to the owner . This state of things would of necessity make the business of building a wholly different kind of enterprise from what it now is ; and rents would have to cover the risk of loss if the enterprise were to be justified . At the present time , of course , that risk has to be taken into account ; but the prospect of profit is set against it , with the net result ( as a rule ) of a favorable balance . The consequence is that in a vast number of cases owners are satisfied with rents- yielding distinctly less than normal return on investment ; while under the single tax the opposite would be the case . Over and above this , the psychological effect of the prospect of gain as a stimulus to enterprise must be reckoned as a big factor . There is one more point to which attention should be directed . When the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in any enhancement of the value of the land , is compelled to pay taxes keeping pace with that enhancement , he stands to lose not only when the land declines in value , but also when it rises in value . For if he has built a house intended for the uses appropriate to its value to-day , the chances are that the kind of building required to suit the uses of the land when it has doubled or trebled in value is totally different . In that case , in order to meet the new taxation , he will be compelled to tear down the house , and will lose every cent that the house is worth . At present , of course , over against this loss stands his gain in the land . And it is to be noted that , even though there might be a practicable method of compensation for loss caused by decrease of land value , it , is hard to imagine any workable way of compensating owners for loss caused by increase of land value  --  in other words , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove to be in the course of time . WOMEN ACTUALLY IN OFFICE . That the West was much less surprised than the East by the election of a woman to Congress may be assumed not only from the greater progress of woman suffrage there , but from the frequency with which women have come to be elected to office In suffrage States . Particularly in Nebraska , Colorado , and Montana women hold municipal and county offices . In Colorado a woman is now State Superintendent of Education . In Kansas , at the last election , there were 258 women candidates , and within a few months 155 women will take charge of various local offices . Twelve years ago less than ten women held office in Kansas ; now the State has only seventeen counties in which some woman has not been elected . It is natural to find that 59 are superintendents of public instruction ; but there are also 47 registers of deeds , 15 county treasurers , three probate judges , and even one coroner . In many States of the Middle West women have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number in suffrage States who are clerks of court is ' large . All this has taken place so quietly as to argue its entire naturalness . In general , the women seek either educational offices or those that require clerical ability . The campaign for such offices is usually confined to newspaper advertisements or notices , and the women have been chosen simply because they were regarded as better than the men who competed with them . It is not the distinction that has appealed , but simply the chance to open a new livelihood and a new field of service . It is probable that the amount of office-holding by women will increase markedly in suffrage States , especially in branches relating to health , charities and correction , and general social service . This does not warrant the fears of those who believe , with Frederic Harrison , that women would make a foolish attempt to achieve what are really the lesser honorswithin their grasp . Nor is there justification for those who are ready to claim for woman an exaggerated share in public administration . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large share of such activities because they brought to them a different focus and valuation from those of man , one more unselfish and " racial , " and because society needed this " binocular vision . " The Western women have not proceeded on theories of this sort . They have merely shown that  --  to use phrases of Julia Ward Howe 's ? " women of sound intellect , of reputable life , having the same stake and interest in the well-being of the community that others have , " wish to demonstrate their ability to advance that well-being in certain offices . The continued election of women to minor offices may be taken as showing that suffrage has increased the number of those from whom fit choices can be made . There is no evidence that the offices are more poorly administered than before . And the entrance of women into fields like that of county education has lessened the contentious spirit of party politics and personal struggle . When women venture Into the contest , the electorate studies the merits of the candidates more closely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public service . Office-holding is a stimulus to the interest of women in the local governmental affairs in which they can be immediately useful . We know something of the activities of women 's clubs in bettering the conditions of the reformatory and prison in Kansas . In a State where women hold office , the vast body of them who would never think of doing so will still find a new impulse to the study of governmental affairs . An Ella Flagg Young is the means of making thousands of women think of the schools . The concern of women with justice and charity , with public recreation , with libraries and museums , with fire and police protection . with city planning , with municipal efficiency , may thus be heightened in any smaller city . In the country a few women in county office will heighten the regard for community centres and better schools . The due bounds of office-holding by women are hardly to be defined , but will be felt instinctively . That they will not often be passed , we may depend upon voters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of women 's interests in Congress , and prominent as women like Ella Flagg Young , Katharine B. Davis , and Julia Lathrop have become , the number of women in high office will long be comparatively few . JUDGES AND PROFESSORS . An unusual contribution to the discussion of academic freedom was made in an article in the Nation of December 7 by the professor of law in Northwestern University , J. H. Wigmore . As throwing light upon the principle of academic freedom , he urges the analogy of a legal principle which " has for three centuries stood the test of experience and received universal support " ? namely , the principle of " the judge 's immunity from civil action by a party claiming to have been wrongfully treated by the judge . " The reason for this immunity is that " were the rule otherwise , for the sake of reaching the one judge in a hundred who might act corruptly or maliciously , the ninety-and-nine honest and competent judges would be likely to be harassed continually by complaints alleging this malice or corruptness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the honest judge 's peace of mind would be gone . " In like manner , " the protection of the competent thinker in that unhampered research and discussion which , alone leads to the discovery of scientific truth " can not be attained if the protection be limited to the competent thinker . Academic freedom is of such importance that one feels tempted to welcome this confirmation of its validity drawn from a different province of thought and action . But while the analogy adduced by Professor Wig-more is in some respects useful , we can not accept it as conclusive . The reasons for maintaining professorial independence are not identical with those for maintaining judicial independence . The power with which the judge is clothed , the duty daily confronting him of deciding authoritatively questions at issue between man and man or between the individual and the state , the finality or quasi-finality of his decisions , the vital necessity that these decisions shall , so far as is humanly possible , command the respect of all parties , however strongly their interests or passions may be affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity attaching to him in the exercise of his functions and the limitations imposed upon him in his outside activities . Professor Wigmore would transfer to the professor , with but slight qualification , both the judge 's immunity within his special province and the restraint upon undertakings outside it . But no such public necessity can be alleged either for giving the professor unlimited immunity in the ? classroom or for limiting him outside it as exists in the case of a judge . It is true that nothing short of grave and unmistakable incompetency should be allowed to disturb a professor 's tenure ; and accordingly arbitrary removal by trustees should be impossible , and removal by any process should be an extremely rare occurrence . But this is rather because under any other state of things the professor 's calling can not he what it should be , than because of that danger of constant harassment against which the judge , owing to the peculiar character of his duties and his powers , stands in such imperative need of being protected . When we come to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the analogy becomes of practical moment . Judicial immunity , he says , suggests two limitations upon the professor 's immunity : first , that he " should be protected only so long as he keeps within his own jurisdiction , " that is , within the field covered by his professorship ; and secondly , that " the utterance must have been made while doing some act of the strictly academic function , oral or written . " We are at a loss to see any reason for thus marking off professors as a class apart ; and the adoption of such a view would carry with it public injury . A professor neither is , nor should be , as a rule , a man consecrated exclusively to the pursuit of his specialty . Besides being a scholar , he is a teacher ; and the power of a teacher , especially a great teacher , in the development of both the mind and the character of students , is largely dependent on his personality . To impose upon a professor ardently interested in a public question the restraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personality ; to have it understood that these restraints existed would be to lower in the minds of all students the human standing of all professors . Still greater would be the loss that the nation would suffer in such a limitation of the breadth and freedom with which opinions on vital questions could be uttered by one of the few classes of men whose intellectual training , whose ideals , and whose conditions of work are calculated to make their utterances from time to time a salutary corrective of current opinion or an impressive protest against wrong accomplished or threatened . One does not , nowadays , turn naturally to Germany , for example ; but it was there , in the older day , that the tradition of academic freedom was best represented , and we trust that something of it yet survives . At all events , it was still strong enough twenty-five years ago to account for , the splendid protest made bythe faculties of all or most of the Prussian universities against a reactionary bill relating to the common schools , which was known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest had been confined to the professors of pedagogy , or if others could have signed it only at the risk of their professional lives , the bill would have become a law ; but the professors killed it , and not one of them lost his head .
