WTyke &age; of Queen Gophetua HEN the first dazzle of be- wildered happiness in her new estate had faded from her eyes , and the miracle of her startling metamorphosis from a wandering beggar-maid to a great Queen on a throne was beginning to lose a little of its wonder and to take its place among the accepted realities of life , Queen Cophetua became growingly conscious of some dim dissatisfaction and unrest in her heart . Indeed , she had all that the world could give , and surely all that a woman 's heart is supposed to desire . The King 's love was still hers as when he found her at dawn by the pool in the forest ; and in exchange for the tattered rags which had barely concealed the water-lily whiteness of her body , countless wardrobes were filled with garments of every variety of subtle design and exquisite fabric , textures light as the golden sun , purple as the wine-dark sea , iridescent as the rainbow , and soft as summer clouds ? the better to set off her strange beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year the King brought her a new and priceless jewel to hang about her reek , or wear upon her moonbeam hands , or to shine in the fragrant night of her hair . Ah ! what a magical wooing that had been in the depths of the forest , that strange morning ! The sun was hardly above the tops of the trees , when she had awakened from sleep at the mossy foot of a giant beech , and its first beams were casting a solemn enchantment across a great pool of water-lilies and filling their ivory cups with strange gold . She had lain still a while , watching , through her sleepy eyelids , the unfolding marvel of the dawn ; and then rousing herself , she had knelt by the pool , and letting down her long hair that fell almost to her feet , had combed and braided it , with the pool for her mirror ? a mirror with water-lilies for its frame . And as she gazed at herself in the clear water , with a girlish happiness in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , startled , she saw beside her own face in the mirror the face of a beautiful young knight , so it seemed , bending over her shoulder . In fear and maiden modesty ? for her hair was only half braided , and , whiter than any waterlily in the pond , her bosom glowed bare in the morning sunlight ? she turned around , and met the eyes of the King . Without moving , each gazed at the other as in a dream ? eyes lost fathomdeep in eyes . At last the King found voice to speak . " You must be a fairy ? " he had said , " for surely you are too beautiful to be human . " " Nay , my lord , " she had answered , " I am but a poor girl that wanders with my lute yonder from village to village and town to town , singing my little songs . " " You shall wander no more , " said the King . " Come with me , and you shall sit upon a throne and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But she could not answer a word , for fear and joy . And therewith the King took her by the hand , and set her upon his horse that was grazing hard by ; and , mounting behind ber , he rode with her in his arms to the city , and all the while her eyes looked up into his eyes , as she leaned upon his shoulder , and his eyes looked deep down into hers ? but they spake not a word . Only once , at the edge of the forest , he had bent down and kissed her on the lips . and it seemed to both , as if heaven with all its stars was falling into their hearts . As they rode through the city to the palace , surrounded by wondering crowds , she nestled closer to his side , like a frightened bird , and like a wild bird 's were her great eyes gazing up into his in a terror of joy . Not once did she move them to right or left , for all the murmur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aught but her water-lily face as they wended thus in a dream through the crowded streets , and at length came to the marble steps of the palace . Then the King , leaping from his horse , took her tenderly in his arms and carried her lightly up the marble steps . Upon the topmost step he set her down , and taking her hand in his , as she stood timidly by his side , he turned his face to the multitude and spake . " Lo ! my people , " he said , " this is your Queen , whom God has sent to me by a divine miracle , to rule over your hearts from this day forth , as she holds rule over mine . My people , salute your Queen ! " And therewith the King knelt on one knee to his beggar-maid and kissed her hand ; and all the people knelt likewise , with bowed heads , and a great cry went up . " Our Queen ! Our Queen ! " Then the King and Queen passed into the palace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber hung with tapestries and furnished with many mirrors , and they took from off her white body the tattered gown she had worn in the forest , and robed her in perfumed linen and cloth of gold , and set jewels at her throat and in her hair ; and at evening in the cathedral , before the high altar , in the presence of all the people , the King placed a sapphire beautiful as the evening star upon her finger , and the twain became man and wife ; and the moon rose and the little beggar maid was a Queen and lay in a great King 's arms . On the morrow the King summoned a famous worker in metals attached to his court , and commanded him to make a beautiful coffer of beaten gold , in which to place the little ragged robe of his beggar-maid ; for it was very sacred to him because of his great love . After due time , the coffer was finished , and it was acclaimed the masterpiece of the great artificer who had made it . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . On one side was the poolwith the water-lilies , and the beggar-maid braiding her hair on its brink . And on another she was riding on horseback with the King through the forest . And on another she was standing by his side on the steps of the palace before all the people . And on the fourth side she was kneeling by the King 's side before the high altar in the cathedral . The King placed the coffer in a secret gallery attached to the royal apartments , and very tenderly he placed therein the little tattered gown , and the lute with which his Queen was wont to wander from village to village and town to town , singing her little songs . Often at evening , when his heart brimmed over with the tenderness of his love , he would persuade his Queen to doff her beautiful royal garments and clothe herself again in that little tattered gown , through the rents of which her white body showed whiter than any water-lilies . And , however rich or exquisite the other garments she wore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she looked most beautiful . In them he loved her best . But this had been a while ago , and though , as has been said , the King 's love was still hers as when he bad met her that strange morning in the forest , and though every day he brought her a new and priceless jewel to hang about her neck , or wear upon her moonbeam hands , or to shine in the fragrant night of her hair , it was many months since he had asked her to wear for him the little tattered gown . Was the miracle of their love beginning to lose a little of its wonder for him too , was it beginning to take its place among the accepted realities of life ? Sometimes the Queen fancied that he seemed a little impatient with her elfin bird-like ways , as though , in his heart , he was beginning to wish that she was more in harmony with the folk around her , more like the worldly court ladies , with their great manners and artificial smiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long while , she had never changed . She was still the wild gipsy-hearted child the King had found braiding her hair that morning by the lilied pool . Often she would steal away by herself and enter that secret gallery , and lift the lid of the golden coffer , and look wistfully at the little tattered robe , and run her hands over the cracked strings of her little lute . There was a long window in the gallery , from which , far away , she could see the great green cloud of the forest ; and as the days went by , she often found herself seated at this window , gazing in its direction , with vague unformed feelings of sadness in her heart . One day , as she sat there at the window , an impulse came over her that she could not resist , and swiftly she slipped off her beautiful garments , and taking the little robe from the coffer , clothed herself in the rags that the King had loved . And she took the old lute in her hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she danced , too , an elfin dance , all alone there in the still gallery , danced as the apple blossoms dance on the spring winds , or the autumn leaves dance in the depths of the forest . Suddenly she ceased in alarm . The King had entered the gallery unperceived , and was watching her with sad eyes . " Are you weary of being a Queen ? " said he , sadly . For answer she threw herself on his breast and wept bitterly , she knew not why . " Oh . I love you ! I love you , " she gobbed , " but this life is not real " And the King went from her with a heavy heart . And from day to day an unspoken sorrow lay between them ; and from day to day the King 's words haunted the Queen witis a more insistent refrain : " Are you weary of being a Queen ? " Was she weary of being a Queen ? And so the days went by . One day as the Queen passed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothed in tatters as she had once been , seated on the lowest step , selling flowers ? water-lilies . The Queen stopped . " Where did you gather your water lilies , child ? " she asked . " I gathered them from a pool in the great forest yonder , " answered the girl , with a curtsy . " Give me one of them , " said the Queen , with a sob in her voice , and she slipped a piece of gold into the girl 's hand , and fled back into the palace . That night , as she lay awake by her sleeping King , she rose silently and stole into the secret gallery . There , with tears running down her cheeks , she dressed herself in the little tattered gown and took the lute in her hand , and then stole back and pressed a last kiss on the brow of her sleeping King , who still slept on . But at sunrise the King awoke , with a sudden fear in his heart , and lot where his Queen had lain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the depths of the forest , a beggar-maid was braiding her hair , with a pool of water-lilies for her mirror . ix 876akez of acaubowi It was a bleak November morning in the dreary little village of Twelve-trees . Nature herself seemed hopeless and disgusted with the universe , as the chill mists stole wearily among the bare trees , and the boughs dripped with a clammy moisture that had nothing of the energy of tears . Twelve-trees was a poor little village at the best of times , but the past summer had been more than usually unkind to it , and the lean wheat-fields and the ragged orchards had been leaner and more ragged than ever before ? so said the memory of the oldest villagers . There was very little to eat in the village of Twelve-trees , and practically no money at all . Some of the inhabitants found consolation in the fact that at the Inn of the Blessed Rood the cider - kegs still held out against despair . But this was no comfort to the gaunt and shivering children left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their innocent little games . Even the heart of childhood felt the shadows that November morning in the dreary little village of Twelve - trees , and even the dogs and the cats of the village seemed to be under the same spell of gloom , and moved about with a dank hopelessness , evidently expecting nothing in the shape of discarded fish or transfiguring smells . There was no life in the long , dishevelled High Street . No one seemed to think it worth while to get up and work . There was nothing to get up for , and no work worth doing . So , naturally , in all this echoing emptiness , this lack of excitement , anything that happened attracted a gratefully alert attention ? even from those cats and dogs so sadly prowling amid the dejected refuse of the village . Presently , amid all the November numbness , the blank nothingness of the damp deserted street , there was to be seen approaching from the south a curious little figure of an old man , trundling at his side a strange apparatus resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old umbrellas under one arm . Evidently was an itinerant knife-grinder and umbrellamender . As he proceeded up the street , he called out some strange singsong , the words of which it was impossible to distinguish . But , though his cry was melancholy , his old puckered and wizened face seemed to be alight with some inner and inextinguishable gladness , and his electrical blue eyes , startlingly set in a network of wrinkles , were as full of laughter as a boy 's . His cry attracted a weary face here and there at window and door ; but , seeing nothing but an old knifegrinder , the faces lost interest and immediately disappeared . The children , however , being less sophisticated , were filled with a grateful curiosity toward the stranger , and left the chill doorsteps and trooped about him in wonder . A little girl , with tears making channels down her pale unwashed face , caught the old man 's eye . " Little one , " he said , with a magical smile , and a voice all reassuring love , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you what I can make of it . " And he touched the child 's face with his hand , and caught one of her tears on his finger , and placed it glittering on his wheel . Then , working a pedal with his foot , the wheel began to move so swiftly that one could see nothing but its whirling ; and as it whirled , wonderful colored rays began to rise from it , so that presently the dreary street seemed full of rainbows . The sad houses were lit up with a fairy radiance , and the faces of the children were all laughter again . " Well , little one , " he said , when the wheel stopped whirling , " did you like what I made out of that sad little tear ? " And the children laughed , and begged him to do some other trick for them . At that moment there came down the street a poor old half-witted woman , indescribably dirty and bedraggled , talking to herself and laughing in a creepy way . The village knew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make cruel sport of her . As she came near , they began to jeer at her , with the heartlessness of young unknowing things . But the strange old man who had made rainbows out of the little girl 's tear suddenly stopped them . " Stay , children , " he said , " and watch . " And , as he said this , his wheel went whirling again ; and as it whirled , a light shot out from it , so that it illuminated the poor old woman , and in its radiance she became strangely transfigured . In place of Crazy Sal , whom they had been accustomed to mock , the children saw a beautiful young girl , all blushes and bright eyes and pretty ribbons ; and so great was the murmur of their surprise that it drew to the door-steps their fathers and mothers , who also saw Crazy Sal as none of them had ever seen her before ? except a very old man who remembered her as a beautiful young girl , and remembered too how her mind had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sweetheart , a sailor , had been drowned in the North Sea . " Who and what are you ? " said this old man , stepping out a little in front of the gathering crowd . " Are you a wizard , that you change a child 's tears into laughter , and turn an old halfwitted woman back to a young girl ? You must be of the devil . . . " " Give me an ear of corn from your last harvest , " answered the old knifegrinder , " and let me put it on my wheel . " And an ear of corn was brought to him , and once more his wheel went whirring , and again that strange light shot out from it , and spread far past the houses over the fields beyond ; and , lo ! to the astonished sad eyes of the weary farmers , they appeared waving with golden grain , waiting for the scythe . And again , as the wheel stopped whirring , the old man who had remembered Crazy Sal as a young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What and who are you ? Are you a wizard that you change a child 's tears into laughter , and turn an old halfwitted woman back to a young girl , and make of a barren glebe a waving corn-field ? " And the man with the strange wheel answered : " I am the maker of rainbows . I am the alchemist of hope . To me November is always May , tears are always laughter that is going to be , and darkness is light misunderstood . The sad heart makes its own sorrow , the happy heart makes its own joy . The harvest is made by the harvestman ? and there is nothing hard or black or weary that is not waiting for the magic touch of hope to become soft as a spring flower , bright as the morning star , and valiant as a young runner in the dawn . " But the village of Twelve-trees was not to be convinced by such words made out of moonshine . Only the children believed in the laughing old man with the strange wheel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainbows ! Much good are rainbows to a starving village . " The old maker of rainbows took their taunts in silence , and made ready to go his way ; but as he started once more along the road he said , with a cynical smile : " Have you never heard that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . . . " " A pot of gold ? " cried out the whole village of Twelve-trees . " Yes , " he answered , " a pot of gold ! I know where it is , and I am going to find it . " And he moved on his way . Then the villagers looked at one another , and said over and over again , " A pot of gold ! " And they took cloaks and walkingstaves and set out to accompany the old visitor ; but when they reachedthe outskirts of the village there was no sign of him . He had mysteriously disappeared . But the children never forgot the rainbows . the ( 93uvez of 4ozzo.o On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of May , the little market-town of Beethorpe was startled by the sound of a trumpet . Beethorpe was an ancient town , mysteriously sown , centuries ago , like a wandering thistle-down of human life , amid the silence and the nibbling sheep of the great chalk downs . It stood in a hollow of the long smooth billows of pale pasture that suavely melted into the sky on every side . The evening was so still that the little river running across the threshold of the town , and encircling what remained of its old walls , was the noisiest thing to be heard , dominating with its talkative murmur the bedtime hum of the High Street . Suddenly , as the flamboyance of the sky was on the edge of fading , and the world beginning to wear a forlorn , forgotten look , a trumpet sounded from the western heights above the town , as though the sunset itself had spoken ; and the people in Beethorpe , looking up , saw three horsemen against the lurid sky . Three times the trumpet blew . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the summons , and looking to the west with sleepy bewilderment , asked themselves : Was it the last trumpet ? Or was it the long-threatened invasion of the king of France ? Again the trumpet blew , and then the braver of the young men of the town hastened up the hill to learn its meaning . As they approached the horsemen they perceived that the centre of the three was a young man of great nobility of bearing , richly but sombrely dressed , and with a dark , beautiful face filled with a proud melancholy . He kept his eyes on the fading sunset , sitting motionless upon his horse , apparently oblivious of the commotion his arrival had caused . The horseman on his right hand was clad after the manner of a herald , and the horseman on his left hand was clad after the manner of a steward . And the three horsemen sat motionless , awaiting the bewildered ambassadors of Beethorpe . When these had approached near enough , the herald once more set the trumpet to his lips and blew ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud voice : " To the Folk of Beethorpe ? Greeting from the High and Mighty Lord , Mortimer of the Marches . " Whereas our heart has gone out toward the sorrows of our people in the counties and towns and villages of our domain , we hereby issue proclamation that whosoever hath a sorrow , let him or her bring it forth ; and we , out of our private purse , will purchase the said sorrow , according to its value ? that the hearts of our people be lightened of their burdens . " And when the herald had finished reading , be blew again upon the trumpet three times ; and the villagers looked at one another in bewilderment ? but some ran down the bill to tell their neighbors of the strange proposal of their lord . Thus , presently , nearly all the village of Beethorpe was making its way up the hill to where those three horsemen loomed against the evening sky . Never was such a sorrowful company . Up the hill they came , carrying their sorrows in their hands ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rummaged old drawers and forgotten cupboards , and even run hurriedly into the churchyard . Lord Mortimer of the Marches sat his horse with the same austere indifference , his melancholy profile against the fading sky . Only those who stood near to him noted a kindly ironic flicker of a smile in his eyes , as he saw , apparently seeing nothing , the poor little raked-up sorrows of his village of Beethorpe . He was a fantastic young lord of many sorrows . His heart had been broken in a very strange way . Death and Pity were his closest friends . He was so sad himself that he had come to realize that sorrow is the only sincerity of life . Thus sorrow had become a kind of passion with him , even a kind of connoisseurship ; and he had come , so to say , to be a collector of sorrows . It was partly pityand partly an odd form of dilettanteism ? for his own sad heart made him pitiful for and companionable with any other sad heart ; but the sincerity of his sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time sternly critical of , and sadly amused by , the hypocrisies of sorrow . So , as he sat his horse and gazed at the sunset , he smiled sadly to himself as he heard , without seeming to hear , the small insincere sorrows of his village of Beethorpe -- sorrows forgotten long ago , but suddenly rediscovered in old drawers and unopened cupboards , at the sound of his lordship 's trumpet and the promise of his strange proclamation . Was there a sorrow in the world that no money could buy ? It was to find such a sorrow that Lord Mortimer thus fantastically rode from village to village of his estates , with herald and steward . The unpurchasable sorrow ! the sorrow no gold can gild , no jewel can buy ! Far and wide he had ridden over his estates , seeking so rare a sorrow ; but as yet he had found no sorrow that could not be bought with a little bag of gold and silver coins . So he sat his horse , while the villagers of Beethorpe were paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the steward understood the mind of his master , and , without troubling him , paid each weeping and whimpering peasant as he thought fit . In another great bag the steward had collected the sorrows of the village of Beethorpe ; and , by this , the moon was rising , and , with another blast of trumpet by way of farewell , the three horsemen took the road again to Lord Mortimer 's castle . When , out of the great leathern bag , in Lord Mortimer 's cabinet , they poured upon the table the sorrows of Beetborpe , the young lord smiled to himself , turning over one sorrow after the other , as though they had been precious stones ? for there was not one genuine sorrow among them . But , later , there came news to him that there was one real sorrow in Beethorpe ; and he rode alone on horseback to the village , and found a beautiful girl laying flowers on a grave . She was so TAPESTRIES beautiful that he forgot his ancient grief , and he thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . " Maiden , " said he , " let me buy your sorrow ? with three counties and seven castles . " And the girl looked up at him from the grave , with eyes of forget-me-not , and said : " My lord , you mistake . This is not sorrow . It is my only joy . " Die Man with gometking in. kio : " ? 7ye Once on a time toward the end of February , when the snow still festered in the New York streets , and the wind blew cruelly from river to river , a strange figure made a somewhat stormtossed progress along Forty - second Street , walking toward the East Side . He was a tall , distinguished , curiously sad-looking man , with longish hair growing gray , and clothes which , though they had been brushed many times , still proclaimed aloud a . Bond Street tailor . As he walked along he had evidently some trouble with one of his eyes , which he rubbed from time to time , as though a cinder , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last he held a handkerchief to it as he walked along . But whatever the trouble was , it did not seem to interfere with a keen and kindly vision that noted every object and character of the thronged street . Now and again strangers , in that noisy and bewildering quarter , would ask direction from him , and he never failed to stop with an aristocratic painstaking courtesy and set them on their way . Nervous old ladies with bundles at perilous crossings found his arm ready to pilot them safely to the other side . There was about him a curious gentleness which , after a while , did not fail to attract the attention of enterprising boys and observing beggars , for whom as he walked along , evidently sorely troubled with his eye , he did not fail to find pennies and kind words . At last he had become so noticeable for these oddities of behavior that as he went along he had collected quite an escort of miscellaneous individuals , ragged children with pale precocious faces , voluble old Irishwomen with bedraggled petticoats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " respectable " people , curiously hovering on the skirts of the strange crowd . From some of these last came at length unkindly comments . The man was evidently crazy ? more probably he was drunk . But it was plainly evident that he had something the matter with his eye . At last a kindly individual suggested that he should go to a drug-store and get the drug clerk to look at his eye . To this the stranger assented , and , accompanied by his motley escort , he entered a drug-store and put himself into the hands of the clerk , while the crowd thronged the door and glared through the windows , wondering what was the matter with the eccentric gentleman , who , after all , was very free with his pence and had so kind a tongue . A policeman did not , of course , fail to elbow himself into the store , to inquire what was the matter . Meanwhile the drug clerk proceeded to lift up the stranger 's eyelid in a professional manner , searching for the extraneous particle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange announcement . The something in the stranger 's eye was ? Pity . No wonder it had caused such a sensation in the pitiless city .
