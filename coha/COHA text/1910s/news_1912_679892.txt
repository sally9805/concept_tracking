txt Assena blyman Vert , special counsel for M. L. Towns , who obtained the habeas corpus writ under which Foulke E. Brand : , the Schiff burglar , will be taken to New York on Monday , was permitted to see the prisoner this afternoon . After two hours ' conference Mr. Vert left for New York to-night to confer with Mr. Towns . Permission for Mr. Vert to see Brandt was telephoned from Sing Sing by Prison Supt. Scott . The first that Brandt knew of the writ was when Mr. Vert told him . Nu other outsider than the Assemblyman has been permitted to see him . He is still umng clerical work in the Warden 's private office . Warden Keiser has not yet returned from Buffalo , but , if he returns in time ' will personally take the prisoner to New York , leaving here Monday at 11 A. M .. Court Order to Get at Brandt . On the application of Mr. Towns , Supreme Court Justice Gerard signed yesterday an order directing the Warden of Clinton Prison to admit Assemblyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Towns said : " Immediately after hearing that counsel for Brandt could not get into Clinton Prison I endeavored to locate Col. Scott , the Superintendent of Prisons , and ask that he direct Warden Keiser to allow counsel to see Brandt . I was unable to locate him at Auburn , but finally got him on the telephone at Sing Sing . This was about 11 o'clock in the morning , and I told him that Brandt 's counsel had not been allowed to see the prisoner , although he was told that he could see any one else . I also telephoned to the Governor , but was unable to obtain any satisfaction . Col. Scott told me that he would like to have an order directing him to admit counsel to see Brandt , and I telephoned Mr. Vert to obtain such an order from Supreme Court Justice Kellogg in Plattsburg . " Later I was informed that Justice Kellogg could not be located , so I went to see Justice Gerard at his home , and made my application to him there . He signed the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott , who , in turn , instructed Warden Keiser to allow Mr. Vert to enter . Mr. Vert saiv Brandt , and left Dannemora for this city at 5 o'clock . " I have absolutely no desire to attack any one , as this is not a personal fight , but there is no reason at all for the action of the prison authorities , supported by the Governor , in a most high-handed proceeding . " In my endeavors to speak to Gov . Dix I held a conversation over the ' phone with a person who says he is Mr. de Kay , the Governor 's secretary . I explained the situation to him , telling him that my representative was at the prison doors ; that the Warden himself was not to be seen on account of an alleged illness , and that his assistant refused to let my representative see Brandt . De Kay wanted to know what was my hurry , and why we could n't wait . When I said that immediate action was necessary he went off , held a conversation with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any order except to the Warden , land refused to issue it to any one else . Attack on Governor 's Secretary . " if I mistake not , this is the very same de Kay that I have seen in visions of Mars and Ajax defying the lightning . He is the same vision in gold lace and feathers I have seen at the various functions of the Governor of this great Democratic State . Probably de Kay believes that this is a military Government In which the rights of common civilians are subordinated to the tinsel of the tin soldier . A great soldier is de Kay , who never smelt powoe ? except upon his lady 's cheek . Ali that remains to be done now , however , is for Justice Gerard to either send Brandt back to prison or remand him to the Tombs to await trial . We want to see Brandt in exactly the same position he was before he was practically robbed of his rights and spirited off to jail for a term of thiry years . You might also mention that Brandt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on Tuesday , as reported . Tuesday is the date upon which oral arguments will be held . " Justice Gerard 's order is as follows : Ordered that Harry M. Keieer , Warden of Clinton Prison , permit Hon. Charles J. Vert , Wm , is a member of the Legislature and one of the counsel in this case , forthwith to have access to Brandt in said prison , and to take his statement and affidavit for use in this or other judicial proceedings . Whitman Off to Washington . Early yesterday Carl Fisher Hansen called at District Attorney Whitman 's office and went into consultation with Mr. Whitman at once . Mr. Hansen was Brandt 's Attorney at the time he was sentenced by Judge Rosalsky in 1907 . At the close of the conference both Mr. Hansen and Mr. Whitman refused to discuss the case , bUt it was learned that the subject of the conference was the mysterious disappearance of the book in the Tombs in which the lawyers register their names . This book , it is believed , might contain some valuable information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day Mr. Whitman left hastily for Washington , refusing to make ally statement . It is understood that Mr. Whitman went to confer with - United States . Senator Knute Nelson of Minnesota , who recently said that he had some valuable information to give regarding a lawyer who ' . had acted in the Brandt case .
