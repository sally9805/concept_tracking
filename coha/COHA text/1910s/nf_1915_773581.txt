txt // human , and they recognised the divine only so far as it could be humanly expressed . Hence to a classic Greek the thought of God becoming man presented no difficulties . In fact the thought existed . His gods were men already . He had but to emphasise the human side of the transaction , and all that would happen would be that his Pantheon would receive an Apollo the more . So far as the idea of incarnation goes , that would have been in keeping with all his notions of the fitness of things and the proper place of man in the universe . Widely different , however , would be the reception of this doctrine iii the East . To an Oriental it would of course have constituted an express recognition of that material state of being , the very idea of which was abhorrent to him . Nature , matter , the world as we see it , the reason and intellect of man which deal with these phenomena , everything in short which is anathema to the East , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of salvation , is by the Incarnation guaranteed and ensured for ever . In short , though it is true that Christianity contains something of the East and something of the West yet it is very evident that , so long as East remained exclusively East and West exclusively West , neither would have had anything to do with it . It was too material for the East and too spiritual for the West . For a new thought to take hold the mind of the world must be prepared for it ; that is to say , there must exist predisposing causes and influences leading men in the direction of the new thought , and tending to develop in them the faculties which shall recognise it . The mingling of East and West , of which we have been speaking , was in this sense apparently a necessary preparation for the acceptance of Christianity . Necessarily , considering the limitations of human nature , it had to precede the announcement of the new religion . In effect it is certain , on independent evidence of which the testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or THE CLASSIC POINT OF VIEW r4 ' was in full process of occurring , long before Christianity appeared upon the scene at all , and that it was continued and carried on for several centuries altogether independently of Christianity . If we set aside the Christian religion altogether , we can still watch the mellowing of pagan thought , we can still see it beating against the bars of a too finite intellectualism . We can see , at this crisis of its own discontent and yearning , the East brought into touch and contact with it , and subsequently we can trace the development of systems of philosophy arising naturally out of this fusion and penetrated by that full sense of the spiritual and the infinite which is what makes the difference between mediaeval and classic life . But if Christianity did not bring about the union of spirit and intellect , it is in a very great degree responsible for the continuance of their union . Circumstances brought the two together , but Christianity has held them together . It held them together owing to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself doctrines appropriate to either . It contained a provision , the greatest concession ever made to materialism , which fully justified this human state of being and with it the intellectual faculty in man which controls that state of being . But , on the other hand , it contained another provision which insisted equally inexorably on the transitory nature of all earthly phenomena and on the ultimate and final reality of a purely spiritual existence . So long , therefore , as these doctrines could be maintained inviolate it followed that all Christians must acquiesce in that union of East and West which had originally upheld the imposition of the faith . In other words , they pledged themselves to the equal development of the spiritual and intellectual sides of man 's nature which in the old world had been separately cultivated . It was impossible to reject either since both were implicit in accepted religion , yet the effort to reject one or other constitutes henceforth the history of Christianity . As a matter of fact the result of the opening up // of communication with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly westward that the difficulty was how to restrain and set bounds to its operations . The most dangerous and powerful of the first divisions within the Church sprang , as the reader is aware , from the uncontrollable inclination of the mystical emotional element to sweep away all forms and definitions and resolve religion into abstract rapture . The problem before the Church ? for it was the Church which the decline of the Imperial power and the new vitality in spiritual ideas combined to place in a position of authority  --  - was to admit the warming , vitalising influence of Eastern emotionalism while checking its tendency to dissolve constructive forms . Whether the task was a possible one or not , it was not achieved . The ultimate result of the attempts to reconcile the two was to accentuate their division . The East retired upon itself and the old barriers separating it from the West arose once more . It would be idle to speculate on the effects , both on East and West , of the estrangement that followed . How much might the intellectualism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held ; how much might the emotionalism of the East have done for the West ? Does it not seem as if the first split , which threw the East back on emotion only and the West back on reason only , were at the root of most of what is false and ill-balanced in the subsequent life of both ? The heavy weight of Western materialism , the barrenness of Oriental speculation groping in the void ? would either have attained the growth they did if the union between thought and emotion had been preserved ? Those terrible early heresies split more than the Church , they split man 's life asunder . I hope the reader will pardon me for dealing so cursorily with such large views , but it is impossible to follow the changes and vagaries of art from the pagan into the modern era unless we take with us a rough idea of the change in mental outlook which was occurring at that // time . The points I wish to emphasise are these . First , that during what is known as the classic epoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that all its operations and effects partook of the clearly defined and firmly outlined character which distinguishes intellectual processes . Second , that there came a time when to this intellectual Western thought was added the spiritual thought of the East , and that henceforth Western thought lost its precision and clearness , and became coloured and suffused with all kinds of mystical divinations , which naturally also took effect in art and all other modes of utterance in which life expresses itself . The third point I have touched upon ? that Christianity , by the establishment of a Church pledged to preserve its original doctrines , took it upon itself to perpetuate this interfusion of ideas ? is one we shall have to recur to later . ( REEK SCULPTURE The perfection wit lc which sculpture , the art of definition , expresses Greek ideas . The obvious limitations which ( reek sculpture shares with Greek thought . Greek thought sapped by Eastern ideas and the effect of this upon sculpture . IF , with the ideas just suggested of Greek life and Greek thought in our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the art so exactly and so evidently bears out and accentuates the life and thought that a laboured comparison may well seem superfluous . Greek art is essentially , as all have recognised , an art of form . It is true the Greeks used colour and used it freely , but they invariably conceived of colour as a merely descriptive agent and as strictly subordinate to the requirements of form . Colour used in this manner is , of course , form 's most able lieutenant . Colour one object blue and another red and the eye distinguishes at a glance the limits of either ; or relieve a blue pattern on a red background and immediately it shows up with the same distinctness . All people , therefore , who have a true instinct for form , and whose impulse it is to articulate form vividly , will assuredly use colour freely in this way , as an attribute of form and a means of defining it . But they never will use it emotionally , or permit it for a moment to pass under the control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whose hands it may indeed develop a more sensuous and emotionally enriched capacity of its own , 144 1 // but at the expense of the clear thought which form is able to communicate . It was thus that the Greeks used colour . They used it in their architecture to differentiate between the various clear-cut members of the structure , and in this way they threw up into heightened relief the delicate and pure outline of every salient moulding . They used it with graphic effect on their pottery , and it is indeed remarkable how , even in the rude age of the art , before form itself had attained to anything like its full measure of varied expressiveness , the use and value of colour as a means of articulation was instinctively divined . Whether drawn in white upon a dark ground , or in red or brown upon a light ground , the power of a sharp contrast is equally in the artist 's mind . The folds of a black garment are defined in threadlike lines of a paler tint , and each most minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legibility of the design , is shown , with an almost sparkling clearness , by the firmness with which its own colour is limited by its dimensions . This use of colour is a Greek tradition . Precisely the same rule holds with regard to the Pompeian decorations of Graeco-Roman art . In these , too , the sense for form is delicate and sensitive to an unusual degree , and the use of colour is strictly limited to the articulation of form . In nothing is the innate tendency and bias of the Greek mind towards distinct and concrete modes of articulation more apparent than in the place which sculpture occupied in the public esteem . The Greek people , it may be said , lisped in sculpture . It was the popular and universal art . " The multitude of votive offerings which filled the , local shrines of Greece , Cyprus , or Rhodes , and for the most part took the form of statues and statuettes , in which , rude as they are , Professor Gardner already remarks the characteristic Greek tendency towards anthropomorphism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its primitive stage of development . " But most clearly perhaps does the character of the Greek L // intelligence show itself in the treatment which Greek sculpture accords to subjects which , in their own nature , are more or less involved in mystery , to such subjects as divinity , death , and the attributes and ideas of spiritual existence . Those who possess within themselves the faculty which , after its own fashion , divines and dimly apprehends the nature of the spiritual , must always distrust and always be on their guard against the merely humanly intelligible interpretation of those subjects which intellect affords . Thus the Eastern philosophy , which in its essence is purely spiritual , is , as has been pointed out , constantly on the watch against any kind of definition designed to adapt its idea to the human understanding , and by so doing to mutilate , as was very clearly seen , its own spiritual nature . Nothing positive was ever permitted to be spoken of spiritual being . No specification , however subtle , could really grasp and enclose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final comment . That impalpable essence could be curtailed to none of the forms or formulas of mortal speech or mortal art . " The atman is silence . " The same caution reveals itself wherever a spiritual idea is present . The Jewish imagination , inspired by its own high conception of a supreme Divinity , was in perpetual alarm lest this conception should be frittered away by adaptation of it to human intelligence . To guard against this danger the practice of formulating or defining was solemnly banned , and the prohibition " Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image " was promulgated as a divine ordinance . Similarly , after East and West had split asunder , the determined and bitter iconoclastic agitation , which raised the destruction of images to a dogma of the faith , reproduced and reapplied what had ever been an essential attribute of the Eastern point of view . Turning once more to Greek sculpture , it is at once apparent that no misgivings of this nature affected the Greek imagination . The Greeks were never troubled // by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fashion of divinity were inadequate or inappropriate . If we did not know already that they regarded their gods and goddesses merely as glorified men and women , and were perfectly satisfied with the reports of them which human reason and human experience could suggest , we should be made aware of the fact by contemplating their statues . In the firm outlines and accurate proportions of these marble figures is no least hint of uncertainty , or the slightest intimation that there existed in the artist 's mind the least intuition of his subject which his chisel could not precisely define . There is perhaps no better way , for one who would really grasp the Greek point of view , to attain his object , than by meditatively contemplating the sculptured representations of the Greek divinities . The human , the material , aspect of the undertaking , which is bound by the very nature of art to claim its share in all such enterprises , in these cases claims the absolute control and direction of the work . Take away what is human and material and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything and left nothing . Let the reader think himself into the position of men to whose spiritual needs these representations respond and are sufficient . What now is his state of mind ? He is one to whom the idea of divinity suggests nothing more than reason and the experience a man may gather in the world can pronounce upon and appraise . Of that kind of spiritual vision which belongs to the spiritual faculty and which , blurred and uncertain as it is , possesses so strange a power of transforming the value of earthly objects and earthly estimates , there is here not a trace . " Speak not to me comfortably of death , great Odysseus , " says the shade of Achilles ; " I would rather be a serf bound to the soil , the hireling of a man with little land or wealth , than bear sway over all the departed . " Beyond this human life , this life of natural law and reason , the Greek could not penetrate . He had not the faculty which could give him I // glimpses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge . He had rather be a slave here , here where he shone so , than reign in that other kingdom which was never more to him than " the Shades . " The same limitation is apparent in another field of Greek sculpture , that which commemorates the dead . No one passing down the Street of Tombs at Athens , or reviewing any collection of sepulchral figures , would guess , were it not for the inscriptions , that the sculpture had anything to do with death . The action depicted is usually one of a quite ordinary and everyday character . There are no recumbent figures with eyes closed and hands clasped . The departed one is represented as engaged on some usual household occupation , or talking to a friend , or tying up her hair . The nearest suggestion of the forbidden subject I recollect is a grave hand-clasp , which seems to presage a long separation . Thus far the Greek goes , but no farther . Death is both a plain fact and a mystery . To die is to go hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . These are the obvious , this-side-of-the-grave facts about it . But what about the other side ? What awakening perhaps awaits it ? What kind of experiences , incomprehensible to our finite senses , will it encounter ? Most races have hankered after answers to these questions , and in treating of Death have suggested certain solutions . Some show the departed soul , encountered by the gods and goddesses of the next world , being crowned with wreaths and offered refreshments , as after an arduous journey , or being introduced , with heavenly courtesy , to the occupants of celestial halls . Sometimes the carving of skulls and cross-bones suggests the contempt in which this mortal state should be held , while one of the most touching and usual mediaeval designs represents two angels , one at the head and one at the foot of the bier , drawing back the curtain from the recumbent figure , as though the moment of awakening had arrived . 1 // The Greeks knew nothing of all this . They had no wish to pry into the beyond . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not appeal to them . This is their limitation . At the end of the human tether they stop dead . They walk straight and firmly up to the door of the sepulchre , but they never roll away the stone . Yet within their limits how perfect and complete do they appear ! Consider their dignity , their composure , their serenity even in face of the awful mystery of death . Here are no tears , no howls , no wringing of hands and tearing of hair : They nothing common did , nor mean , Upon that memorable scene . The power they had trusted all along upheld them here . In death as in life reason is their stay . To bear the inevitable with fortitude and composure should be the aim of a rational being . If there is nothing here beyond reason , the reason is of the noblest and loftiest quality . Greek sculpture , then , does not attain to any purely spiritual significance ; that has to be cancelled . But it does attain to the expression of a very noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures of Greek sculpture of the prime , the figures of gods and the figures of men and women , testify to this ideal either by attaining or by aiming at it ; and this ideal , like all reason 's products , is intelligible and consistent and can immediately be recognised . It is in fact the same ideal as is indicated by Greek philosophy , Greek thought , Greek poetry . Harmonious proportion , perfect symmetry , and that lofty unity of character which arises from the due relation of the parts to the whole and is the expression of the control of a central , clear-seeing intelligence ? these are the leading traits of the Greek ideal character as drawn by Greek thought . Out of Greek poetry and philosophy and oratory , and all such hints and sidelights as seem to // cast light on the subject , carve for yourself the figure of the perfect Greek as Greek thought conceived him ; and then , with that image in your mind , turn your gaze upon Greek sculpture . Is not the image come to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophers are struggling the very thought also with which the sculptors are struggling ? Here it is we touch the secret of the profound attraction which the art of sculpture exercised over the Greek mind . Veil the truth as we will it remains a truth , that the art of man has made visible nothing save what the mind of man has believed in . The Greeks were enamoured of sculpture because it represented to them in terms of form that which they all aspired to be . The virtues which seemed to them highest , the temperament which seemed most worthy of a man , were the virtues and the temperament which their sculpture incarnated . Hence the ennobling influence of the art and its essentially , in Greek eyes , religious character . It was a constant incentive and exhortation to the Greeks to realise their own ideal . What these things were they themselves would fain be if they could . So that marble and bronze joined with poetry and philosophy in leading the race on to the attainment of the same goal . All were agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal to the mind , while art recommended it to the eye . But at the same time it is important to notice that sculpture could only do this for the Greeks on the condition that their ideas never outran its own possibilities . Greek ideas , being always intellectual , are always definite , always clear-cut . That is what fits them so well for sculpture . They are already a sort of sculpture . As ideas they have all the qualities of exact form . Even the moral and ethical ideas which inspired the Greek ideal were of this character . They were intellect 's highest , but they were purely intellectual still . No tinge of mystery clung about them . They could give a clear account of themselves . They could conform to // the conditions of sculpture . They could express themselves in terms of form . Hence the moment of the Greek prime , when the Greek intellect , fully developed , fully in command of life , was yet untried and untroubled by any surmises or intuitions from another source , was the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning it could best express , seemed to reach a perfection and a completeness which it has never before or since attained . This happy state of things for sculpture , however , lasted only so long as Greek intellectualism remained unruffled and sufficient for itself . The day came when this intellectual self-sufficiency could no longer maintain itself , when it was obliged to give ground to a sense of spiritual unrest and anxiety not in keeping with the full meaning of the word classic , and not in keeping with Greek life at its most typical moment . It is in this respect , some critics tell us , that Euripides , born 48o B.C. , differs from Sophocles , who was fifteen years his senior ; the latter being pure Greek while the former is touched already with a breath of the coming change . But in any case the following century saw the Hellenistic movement in full swing , while the conquests of Alexander in that century opened a breach through which the spiritual ideas of the East flooded steadily Westward . The two causes to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched upon . They are , first , the wearing out of the intellectual habit of thought which had given its character to the classic epoch , and , second , the opening up , by the Eastern penetration , of just the order of ideas which the Greek mind was beginning to feel the lack of . If we were able to trace the hidden and subconscious impulses which move human nature , it is probable we should find that the adventure of Alexander was the outcome of some inward discontent and sense of insufficiency of the prevailing cast of thought of the West , and of a restless hunger and craving for what only the East could supply . // It is at any rate important to notice that intellectualism had worked itself out in the West , and had by its own efforts reached the point where the spiritual contribution was necessary to its own further progress , before the secrets of Oriental philosophy were divulged to it . What now is the general character of the sculpture of this later , Hellenistic , period ? It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and principles of the art , and i he introduction of a style more emotional , romantic , and experimental in motive than the pure classic epoch would have tolerated . Furtwangler and Urlichs , in accounting for this change , lay stress on the cosmopolitan nature of an art of which the centres were the new cities and settlements of the East ? Seleucia , Antioch , Rhodes , Pergamos , Alexandria ? rather than , as heretofore , Greece itself , and particularly Athens . They dwell upon " the effective realism and dramatic depth " of scenes and figures which " seize and stir the nerves of the spectator . " Full of this spirit of emotion is what they consider the most important work of the period , the famous Nike of Samothrace . " On the prow of a ship the tall slender goddess shares the tumult of the sea-battle , and announces the victory with a blast of the trumpet , which only stirs the fighters to a more passionate and battle - thirsty mood . " Of the same emotional order of art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen barbarian who , with a last effort , still struggles to advance . " His expression is full of energy , combined with the painful consciousness of defeat . The expression of the eyes is wonderfully telling , his wide-open mouth shows the upper teeth , his forehead is contracted over the eyes . " Whether or not this is a correct interpretation of what the sculptor meant to express , it is at least certain that what he was chiefly concerned and interested in was in experimenting in the capacity for emotional expression latent in the human countenance . This is a marked peculiarity of the Hellenistic style and the first to strike the attention // of a spectator . Every kind of expression is essayed , but chiefly those which convey longing and doubt and stormy trouble of soul . The passing from the sternly serene figures of the classic age into this prevailing state of mental agitation is like passing from harboured waters into the broken and turbulent surf of the outer sea . The reader is sure to be struck by the modern appearance and character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is remarkable that all the examples which , in the days before the classic ideal was correctly appreciated , were instinctively seized upon by northern Europe as examples of the Greek prime , such as the Laocoon , the Apollo Belvedere , the Venus de ' Medici , and the Dying Gaul , were of the later and more consciously emotional period which so much more nearly approximates to our own point of view . But though the character of Hellenistic art and the contrast between it and Hellenic art are not difficult to seize , yet I can not find among critics any satisfactory account of the influences which led to the new development . Stress is laid , no doubt , on the rise of the Eastern cities , but there is no apparent reason on the face of things why a Greek of Alexandria or Pergamos should not adopt the same standpoint and the same artistic ideals as a Greek of Athens . Mr. Short is satisfied with arguing that " the old civic pride which had found vent in the Parthenon marble was impossible in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question in the semi-oriental kingdom . " But this does not quite meet the difficulty . A vigorous civic pride may induce to artistic activity , but as a matter of fact the Hellenistic cities were as actively creative as the Hellenic . What we have to explain is a change in the inward spirit and character of art , and this the " civic pride " argument does not elucidate . Civic pride and a vigorous political life were as much and more the characteristics of mediaeval French and English communes as of classic Greek cities , and they did equally result in a very marked creative // activity , but so far from the mediaeval style of art resembling Hellenic , it much more closely resembled the art of the Hellenistic age in which , as we are assured , civic pride had ceased to exist . Can it really be affirmed that there is anything more popular , more democratic , more smacking of the ideas of citizenship in the composed and almost cold figures of the great age than in such more emotional and more vividly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth is that what we must look out for is an inward mental change corresponding to the outward visible change . It has been pointed out that the earlier sculpture , the purely classic sculpture , was the characteristic expression of the one really great element in classic culture , its high and serene intellectualism . Greek sculpture of the prime is inspired by the same ideas and principles as Greek thought of the prime . It is the embodiment of a national ideal . It can not be too often repeated or too steadily borne in mind that the very principles which the Greeks aspired to live by , and frame their conduct on , are principles which can be immediately , and without any change whatsoever , applied to art . The watchwords which were always in the mouths of Greek thinkers ? unity , symmetry , proportion , and the like ? were directly relevant to the arts of form , and have been , indeed , always used as a critical standard especially bearing on Greek art . This is why Greek art bore the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly concerned in it , but because the intellectual gospel which the Greeks intensely believed in had incarnated itself in these visible forms and proportions . Having then realised what that particular style of sculpture stood for , when the sculpture goes we shall know that the predisposing cause must also have gone . The predisposing cause in this case was an ethical system , so purely intellectual and precisely defined that it could be translated just as it was into terms of form . It was the change in this ethical system which broke up classic // art . Classic art lasted so long as the great thought which classicalism had brought into the world ? the thought of intellectual self-sufficiency ? lasted . It passed when the thought passed . What is seen in the troubled and broken experiments of the Hellenistic style is the passing of that thought . That thought , of intellect 's sufficiency , is breaking down , can no longer maintain itself , serves no longer as an inspiration for art . It is not that men carve at Antioch , or Rhodes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters , but what thought they have it in their minds to express . That thought is not yet clear ; but this at least is clear , that they will no longer proclaim the sufficiency of an intellectual code of ethics . They will no longer assert that an accurately-thought-out line of conduct and ideas contains the gospel of life . So they break from the old classic tradition , signalising in the act the downfall of what is still the most precious attribute in classic culture . They went their ways , and it is not in the confusion which ensues easy to distinguish a positive aim . But at least something like a common tendency or bias is discernible . The most notable characteristic of the new style is , as I have said , its predisposition towards what is emotional and its hankering after exhibitions of strong feeling , physical , mental , and spiritual . This is the trait which is positive in Hellenistic art , and which shows that it is not merely a revolt against an order of ideas no longer believed in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own . It is seeking to contribute something which the old classic style lacked . The emotional and spiritual impulses which the classic age so sternly disavowed , the seeking after unknown things , the groping in the void , the anxiety and the perturbation of soul which the classic mind above all things reprehended , are now the constant subjects of speculation and themes of art . It is the moment when the intermingling of Eastern and Western ideas , which was permanently to change the character and thoughts of humanity , is first apparent in its visible effects . It CHAPTER IX GREEK ARCHITECTURE Architecture is in parlicular tilt . art in which the Greeks endeavoured to embody their system of thought-out and reasoned ethics . Among the Greeks the ethical principles of thought and philosophy were applied without change to the sphere of art . It was this which permitted art to give a perfect rendering of the Greek ideal . THE reader will remember that in an earlier chapter we pointed out the difference between the interior and exterior points of view . We imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects along the shore , and again we imagined ourselves contemplating the colours of an autumn beech-wood or looking out from its edge at the individual features of the landscape . The change from one point of view to the other , we said , was a change of mind , a change of mood . One set of faculties , the intellectual faculties , were roused to deal with the objects of the exterior view , while another set of faculties , the emotional faculties , were roused to deal with the interior scene . Doric and Byzantine architecture are perfectly typical of this difference . In the account given of Byzantine architecture nothing was said about its exterior aspect ; the description was wholly of its interior effect . Such a treatment was reasonable ; for there is no such thing really as a Byzantine exterior ; that is to say , the style has defined no specific mode of external construction . Its marble panelling and arcades and coloured disks were reserved especially for the walls of palaces , but the // great churches of the style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Venetians , in their opulence , desired to enrich the exterior of St. Mark 's they were driven , so destitute was the style they were dealing with of any notion of outside treatment , to Gothic or even Moorish sources to help themselves out . Even that most striking architectural feature , the dome , never seems to have been treated by Byzantine architects with the least regard to its external appearance . Taking the Byzantine churches of Constantinople , Greece , Italy , and Sicily which the present writer has seen , together with those of Asia Minor of which he has seen illustrations , he is quite unable , from the general survey , to divine from their outside view any points of agreement or any common aim . Often they are mere bald , square , almost windowless boxes of brick masonry , with a low irrelevant dome rising timidly over the top . Almost invariably they have a raw and unfinished air , as if the builders had knocked off work before completing their task . St. Sophia from the outside suggests a circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumble of brick walls from any apparent architectural intention . Londoners have been made to suffer quite recently for this limitation in Byzantine art . The architect of Westminster Cathedral , so long as he was dealing with the inside of the church , could proceed with confidence , but externally he had nothing to guide him , and the result has been what we see . But if Byzantine architecture has no outside , Doric architecture has no inside . It is meant simply to be looked at . There was , of course , the cella , the enclosure within the peristyle containing the image of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated , but this scarcely forms part of the architectural effect of the building . It was of inconsiderable size , apparently ill lit , and it seems doubtful if it was ever used for purposes of public worship . Mr. Simpson observes that the interior of even the largest Greek temple was so small ( about the size of an ordinary English parish church ) , that it could not possibly have // accommodated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate in the celebrations . These took place outside , round the altar in the courtyard , the entrance doors of the temple being thrown open to allow as many people as possible to see the shrine within . " Thus even in the act of worship the crowd was excluded . " This curious lack of interior space and exclusion of the people from the mysteries and emotions of worship must appear to us strange and unnatural ; but we must remember that it did not suit the cast of the Greek mind to press enquiry beyond a certain point . The clear definition of certain intelligible ideas , which the architecture in its form and proportions embodied , was all that the Greek desired . That appeal was addressed to his understanding , the only faculty which he valued in himself . He had no desire to pass on , to penetrate to the interior view , to drug himself ( as he would have put it ) with spiritual aspirations or steep his soul in the syrup of Eastern mysticism . The , clear , distinct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential characteristic of the Greek mind , and was indeed the basis of the classic order of civilisation . Its first effects are to be seen in the choice of the temple site . We , when we use the word site , commonly have in our minds a position favourable for seeing from , not a position favourable for looking at . The words " a beautiful site " conjure up an idea of a house well situated , from which we can command lovely views and prospects of the surrounding scenery . To the Greeks the phrase meant something quite different . It meant , not a point from which the surrounding country might be seen , but a point which the surrounding country could see . And the use made of the phrase was in accordance with this definition , for such a place , in Greek hands , was appropriated , not to the private uses of magnates and millionaires , but to some national shrine or temple in which the whole community was interested . It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance and // dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remnants of Greek architecture by this method of placing . The blurred impressions we receive from Nature are condensed and accentuated by art . The ordinary landscape , with distinct objects raised in relief , does indeed appeal to the mind , to intellect , to thought ; yet all this is vague ; these intellectual suggestions wander over the prospect , but it is difficult to grasp them , difficult to bring them to a head . It needs some masterpiece of art , as a temple rightly placed , to focus them . It is the general character of the regard which we cast upon a view , its readiness to observe and report things of meaning , which makes the appeal of the temple irresistible . The building sums up a mood . The eye fixes on it with a delight that has in it the feeling of a solution . It satisfies the mental expectation which every more or less imperfectly articulated form in the landscape has roused yet failed to satisfy . All detached pieces of architecture , isolated in the general view , have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess it to a singular extent . It often seems as if Nature herself had arranged her own geography with a view to their convenience , and , in the modelling of her hills and valleys , been guided by the purpose of affording to these ideal constructions the most advantageous positions possible . Standing as they do they appear to preside over the scenery , the irregular and wild beauty of which finds in these ordered and stately structures an otherwise unuttered climax of expression . The site is part of the temple 's influence , and the two remain inseparable in memory . Segesta stands in the midst of gaunt and barren hills . A long walk from the nearest railway station leads over these hills , and coming round the shoulder of the last range a view is disclosed of a long valley stretching in among the mountains that enclose it and tower above it on either hand . From the side of one of the main ridges a short spur is thrust forward into the valley , the end of which 16o FORM AND COLOUR forms a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the large mountains bent round it and the valley leading up to it , it forms a natural cynosure and attracts the eye from a great distance . No trace remains of the classic city save this one building . The landscape is an extraordinarily wild and lonely one , the only sign of life being an occasional shepherd boy climbing with his goats among the rocks and tufts of asphodel Nevertheless the temple , raised upon its natural pedestal , still dominates the landscape , and claims a silent homage from the surrounding scenery . And yet more effective even than Segesta is the row of temples at Girgenti , standing along the cliff overlooking the sea . Inland the ground dips into a wide hollow before sloping up steeply to the heights which once carried the ancient city of Agrigentum , and this hollow , facing south and sheltered from the north , teems with a vegetation which in April and May seems to combine the prodigal richness of a tropical climate with the vigour and freshness of northern seasons . The delicious green of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vines , the black , massive caroob trees , the glistening foliage and glowing fruit of the orange and lemon groves form a thicket of the utmost luxuriance and variety , to which gigantic olives , locally reputed to be survivals from the Greek age , add the soft grey of their foliage and the strength of their gnarled trunks . Great trailing gourds cumber the earth or climb the trees , whence they hang down their flaccid v ' yellow blossoms . The air is fragrant with the scent of orange blossom , and an endless variety of wild flowers twinkle through the young wheat which covers the G ground . This sheltered valley , nourished by its rich volcanic soil and breathed on by warm sea breezes , strikes one as the spoiled child and petted darling of Nature . There appears , as you wander through the enchanted covet , nothing lacking to complete its beauty , until through // gaps in the foliage , between orange groves and olives , you catch a glimpse of the long dark-brown ridge of the cliff , and , close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacinia , lifting its level architraves against the clear blue of the sky . But no sooner do these constructions appear than the scene of enchantment you have passed through becomes , as it were , an accessory to the superior significance of the objects now disclosed , its purpose being merely to lead up to the stately row of buildings ranged along the cliff , visible alike in salient relief from the city and from the sea . It is unnecessary to multiply instances of this care of the Greeks in the choice of sites . The most famous example , as the reader knows , is the Acropolis at Athens , an eminence of precisely the right height and dimensions , rising sharply from the plain and commanding the attention not only of the town and its environs , but of the encircling mountains , of the fertile valley leading to the Piraeus , and of the blue expanse of the Gulf of Aegina ruffled in old days by the Athenian fleets . So perfectly adapted is this feature for the purpose for which it has been used that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not something to do with the choice of the position for the city , which seems to have drawn hither from its more natural site near the Piraeus , in order that it might take advantage of such an opportunity for the proper display of its precious works of art . However that may be , it is evident that in the placing of their temples the Greeks were only carrying out to its logical conclusion the same principles which they constantly applied to the detail of their architecture . They were but reiterating their guiding maxim that every touch must tell , that , as the disposition of every part must be regulated by a strict regard for its easy and perfect display , so the disposition of the whole must be guided by the same consideration . What a single metope was to the frieze , what the frieze was to the entire entablature , what the entablature was to the whole temple , that the // temple itself was to the landscape . The conception was altogether a Greek one . With seven hills to choose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such was the Greek idea of a site . It is an idea of course exclusively applicable to the external style of architecture , to a style , that is , of which the whole virtue consisted in its aspect . Those who asked of architecture the representation of an interior mood of contemplation and prayer might obtain their appropriate site in the thronged streets and alleys of a city . Better for them , since the building must be entered ere its best influence could be felt , that it should be in the midst of dwellings than set apart upon a hill . As a rule Christian churches follow this impulse . To be accessible is their chief care ; to mingle among the lives of the poor , just as the religion they embody should mingle , is their endeavour . Were you to tell a Christian builder that the chief merit and capacity for good of his temple consisted in its outward aspect , that far more important than its call to prayer , its provision for meditation , the sacred music of its choir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible and tangible proportions and calculated symmetry of its structural forms ? were you to tell him this you would appear to him little other than an idiot or a blasphemer . He would suggest that to make such a claim was in itself a proof of intellectual arrogance and pride amounting to a repudiation of the whole teaching of Christianity . And , speaking from the Christian point of view , he would be right , for Christianity is itself essentially emotional , and therefore of the interior order . But he would not be right from the pagan point of view , for paganism was essentially intellectual , and therefore of the exterior order . It is , I think , Ruskin who points out how lovely is the spectacle of a Christian church rising out of the midst of the hovels of the people , which cluster round it and seem to lean against it for support . We // should like to hear a Greek 's remarks on the suggestion that his temple might be similarly adorned . His language , we take it , would at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited to substitute structural proportion for the purposes of prayer . The truth is the two points of view are separated by so profound a chasm that they can not understand each other . The Christian has come to rely so much upon a spiritual source of edification that he can not understand what intellectual edification means ; while the Greek relies so much upon intellectual edification that he can not understand what spiritual edification means . " What , " the first would ask , " are these cold calculations of reason to me ? Do they speak to the soul ? Do they , temporal as they are and bounded by our earthly state , open up to my spiritual vision the vistas of eternity and suffuse my being with a consciousness of spiritual life ? " " No , " the other would reply , " they undertake to perform no such tricks . There is no mystery about my art , and my temples shelter no god that can do for a man more than a man can do for himself . But if you would lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this human state you would conform to the dictates of the highest human faculty , then study and observe well the proportions of our temples and the pose of our statues , for nothing more than these will help you to realise the beauty of the ideal which you pursue . " The best of which paganism was mentally capable ? its intellectual lucidity and disinterestedness , traits still perpetuated in the meaning we give to the word classic as applied to literature ? was perfectly embodied in Greek art . It is important that we should make an effort to realise ? for we need to make the effort , the idea being naturally foreign to us ? that the sanctity of influence which the Greeks attributed to noble architecture was something totally different from the sanctity of influence which we attribute to it . Could we conduct a Greek of the classic meridian into the solemn interior , darkened with shadow and enriched with colour , of a Byzantine // or Gothic church , it is certain that , so far from being impressed , or so far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would shrink with aversion from so intimate and powerful an advocacy of all those vague , indefinite , emotional impulses which it was in part the purpose of all his philosophy to withstand . " Get thee behind me , Satan , " he would exclaim , conscious of the intoxicating effect of their dangerous eloquence . He would rush forth , as one flying from evil spirits . " Give me back , " lie would cry , " the art that was my own , the art that incarnated the thoughts I held of most value , the art of pure form and perfect proportion , which sustained and calnied and upheld me by presenting to my eyes the very aspect and image of the intellectual ideal I was striving after . " Such would have been his prayer . The beauty , the precious and valuable quality in his architecture , that for which he laboured so patiently and so long , was simply the look of it . It was the actual arrangement of the marble blocks of column and entablature that took effect , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was the message , the exhortation , they delivered , and to which the Greeks were never tired of attending . They preached precisely what Greek sculpture had preached ; they preached the value , the beauty of those ethical ideas which Greek thought had singled out as guides to human conduct . That sense of proportion , of symmetry , that steadfast reference of all details and every day of life to the realisation of a perfect whole , the calmness and serenity of self-knowledge , the unity which is the result of the action of a central intelligence directing every part to one common climax , all these traits and qualities which are the guiding traits and qualities of Greek philosophy , and which the whole Greek race , each individual according to the measure of his intelligence , may be said to have been aiming at and endeavouring to realise as a matter of conduct and character , are also the traits and qualities inherent in the only style of archiGREEK // tecture which is intimately associated with the Greek genius . While we survey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must all the while bear in mind this essential fact in regard to it  --  the fact that it is an embodiment of the Greek religion of intellectualism . This is the key to its interpretation . There is nothing in the temple that is not explained by reference to the idea which governs it . In the very method of construction it adopts , the nature of the governing idea is apparent . The Greeks , we are to remember , had a definite message to deliver , which imposed upon them the need of speaking with the utmost possible curtness and precision . Now there is only one mode of construction which can articulate with perfect clearness , and that is the trabeated , or column and lintel , mode . This is the intellectual method of building par excellence , and this therefore , by reason of what they had to say , the Greeks were driven to adopt . We will show the reader in two words in what the intellectual supremacy of the trabeated principle consists . The principle itself begins and ends in uprights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any cattle-shed in the corner of a field is constructed on the same lines . Nevertheless in this simplicity lies its intellectual opportunity . It will perhaps be remembered that in an earlier chapter we pointed out that the intellectual character of Western architecture consisted in its recognition of the fact that form in architecture is function , that what each feature is doing , the force it is exerting , the pressure it is resisting , the weight it is supporting , is already its ideal form , which we , according to the measure of our brains , have to turn into its real form . Form , in short , is but the embodiment in visible dimensions of what each structural feature does or is . It is usual to call architecture a study in form and stop there . But to be comprehensible it is necessary to ask the question , // But this being so it is evident that the constructive method employed must admit of a clear definition of function ; that is to say , must admit of the various stresses and forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses this qualification . For instance , the arched method of construction does not possess it . Arcuated constructions , at least in the West , do , no doubt , aim at defining function , but they attain only a moderate degree of success owing to the fact that the arch principle does not distinguish clearly the limits of its own operations . It does not separate support from burden . The arch itself is a mere part of the wall it sustains . Moreover , the pressure exerted by the superincumbent weight is not directly vertical , but is flung off by the arch to right and left , much as the bows of a ship fling off the resisting waves . The pressure is partly downward and partly lateral , and is partly therefore withstood by the columns beneath and partly by the side walls and buttresses without . But how this is done , what relation weights have to support , or where the line between the two is to be drawn are questions which must necessarily remain a mystery . The structural method employed in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this feature and that , and the consequence is that , functions being more or less indefinite , the forms which embody them are also indefinite in a like degree . This is where the advantage of such a mode of construction as the column and lintel comes in , for in this case the bearing member , or column , and the weight borne , or lintel , are contrasted in the full degree of vertical and horizontal , or in the full degree , if we like so to put it , of active and passive , the one being an exercise of active strength , the other an exercise of passive weight . Each is so distinct from the other that a glance can distinguish the limits of either . This is an example of clearly articulated function , and it follows , of course , that function being perfectly definite the forms which embody it are definite in a like perfection . // From this it ensues that the latter medium , the medium of column and lintel , is particularly appropriate when the thought which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is what we are always driven back upon , for it is this original thought which chooses the kind of construction answering to its own nature , and sharing in the extent of its own vagueness or clearness . The clear thought leads to the evolution or choice of a clear structural principle , and the choice of a clear structural principle leads to the articulation of exact forms . But the thought is the source . No ethical principle is more often insisted upon by the Greeks than the principle of just proportion . The realisation of the beauty of proportion and the endeavour to achieve it , is at the root of the Greek hatred of all that is excessive or exaggerated , of all that is lopsided or eccentric , of all that , whether through under- or overdevelopment , impairs sane and natural growth . None knew better than they that health consists in the sense of proportion which assures an harmonious culture . This was a corner-stone of their ethical system , but there is no spiritual vagueness about it whatever . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , a truth which can admirably express itself by means of the trabeated principle , but which can not at all adequately express itself by means of the arcuated principle . How purely intellectual the Greek aesthetic sense , or feeling for beauty , was is perhaps best shown by a consideration of those slight and imperceptible refinements which constitute the mystery of Greek architecture . The subject is a complicated one and demands a separate volume for its adequate treatment . It will be sufficient here to indicate the general character of these refinements , and for that purpose the best feature to select perhaps is the shaft . The height of the Parthenon shafts is about 34 feet 3 inches , their diameter at the base being 6 feet 3 inches , and at the summit 4 feet zo inches . These // measurements are approximate only , for they are all liable to a slight variation , the columns being not all exactly the same height nor exactly of the same size . The first inflection I wish to call attention to is their entasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , the column tapers considerably , the top diameter being 17 inches less than the bottom . But the reduction is not effected by a straight slant . The lines of the sides do not lie evenly between their extreme points , but are very slightly rounded or curved . In the case of the Parthenon the curve at its greatest amounts to of the height of the column , or approximately to threequarters of an inch . It will seem to the reader that so minute an inflection applied to so large a bulk of masonry , being in itself practically imperceptible , must argue an extraordinary fastidiousness and delicacy of vision in the Greek race . Yet though the presence of the curve is not directly noticeable its absence would be felt at once . It corrects the meagre and skinny appearance which a straight-sided column would have ; at the same time it is not pronounced enough to call attention to itself , and unless the column were subjected to exact measurements its presence would remain unsuspected . But as yet we are only at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to an inflection . It is not a plain curve , or segment of a very large circle , but is given the outline known as a hyperbola . For some distance from the summit of the column the deviation from the straight is imperceptible ; it then emerges more boldly , and at a distance of one-third of the column 's height from the ground attains its maximum deviation of three-quarters of an inch , from which point it diminishes again towards the base . I beg the reader to pause here and consider this curious feature until he has grasped its character . The column 's height is over 34 feet . The curvature , or bulge , to be applied to it amounts only to three-quarters of an inch . Yet this wonderfully delicate addition itself // receives a yet more delicate and subtle inflection , imparting finally to the column a pear-shaped form , the upper portion shooting up out of a thickened lower portion . The entire deviation is worked out in invisible dimensions . When it is further considered how great must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each marble drum to the shape required by a design of such subtlety , we may form some idea of the very high value which the Greeks attached to the refining process . But in what does that value consist ? The very word " refine " implies , not so much an original creation as an enhancement of an already existing factor . Doric refinements are an enhancement of a Western law of art . They do not originate any motives of their own , but add a keener edge of expression to forces already in operation . It will be observed that the Western law as we have hitherto defined it ? the law that form is function ? is no more than an engineering or mechanical proposition . It affords a standard of perfect utility and honesty of construction , and it necessitates an accurate knowledge of the forces at work . If these practical and material considerations constitute the basis of all good architecture and are a prime test of its quality , it is because architecture itself is so very largely a practical and material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mere mechanical excellence though it is its alpha is not quite its omega . In Greek work art takes the matter up where mechanics laid it down . Mechanics superintended the construction and , within narrow limits , the form of each structural feature . It ensured the business-like efficiency and simplicity of the building , the clear-cut , accurate shape of its parts , and its entire freedom from irrelevant additions or enrichments . Then came the artist . But he did not go off into any independent fantasticalities of his own , or arrogate to himself a superior knowledge and ideas different from those of ordinary people , or pretend that 17o FORM AND COLOUR " art " was a highly specialised subject not responsible to the ordinary laws of life . He endorsed all that the engineer had done ; more than that , he found his own inspiration in what the engineer had done . The temple itself ? its structural necessities , its mechanical fitness ? was his law too , was indeed his law even more than the engineer 's . Only he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient , but that each feature should so express its . efficiency and seem so visibly endowed with it as to appear to take actually a living and conscious part in the whole design . Thus the trifling and minute entasis , or swelling of the column , which we have been considering , adds nothing to the column 's mechanical efficiency , but it makes that efficiency evident , it draws it out and gives it expression . To this is due that aspect of vigorous and elastic strength which the columns possess , and which has so often attracted the admiration of critics . You would say that they put forth their strength consciously . Not only does their function dictate their form , but it is turned into a living motive , the form of the column being actually animated with the intention of fulfilling the duty allotted to it . And so with other matters . The platform on which the temple stands would serve as well if it were perfectly flat . But the artist has added , here too , a slight convex curvature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches in the front in a width of zoi feet , and about 4 inches on the side in a length of 228 feet . Flat it would have been unrelated to the temple and unaware of what it was itself doing , but its slightly rounded cushion-shape designs it for the burden it is to receive , and seems , as in the case of the columns , to animate it with the consciousness of the purpose for which it was created . Or , to consider larger and combined features , take the peristyle of shafts which is the main feature of this kind of architecture ; obviously if the shafts stood at exactly the same intervals from each other , though they would carry their burden as efficiently as they do now , // yet they would not seem united in the knowledge of what they were doing . The colonnade might extend indefinitely . It would know nothing of its own beginning or ending . As it is it begins with two short steps , the end columns being nearer together than the rest , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a halt with two more short steps . The consequence is that the colonnade appears to be no mere line of columns cut to the required length , but an entity , an organic feature , designed to its present dimensions and actively co - operating in the scheme of the composition . This impression , again , is further developed by the slight inward slant imparted to the columns of the peristyle , all the columns leaning inward in such a way as to form the base of an invisible pyramid , which , if the present columns were extended upward , would meet in a point at an immense distance above the centre of the temple . Such an inflection can add nothing to the actual utility of the peristyle , but the impulse to cluster together in the performance of a common task is a motive which , operating upon all the columns , inspires them with a living consciousness of the duty they are performing . All these expedients are extremely subtle and involve immense labour in their execution . They are also from the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are aesthetically of extraordinary effect , since they ensure that the whole structure , far from being a mere mechanical and lifeless arrangement , shall appear to be a living organism , life being breathed into all its parts by their mutual knowledge of the task in hand . This is the work of the artist , and the reader will see that in each and every case it is but the carrying one step farther of the work of the engineer , and consists but in a further emphasising of the great law that form is function . I can not but point out how closely art , in thus relying for effect on the emphasising of a quite common and matter-of-fact motive , resembles the highest literature . // Matthew Arnold , in one of his essays , speaks of the " subtle heightening " in which the accent of great poetry resides , and which is so slight an addition to common speech that it is elusive and almost escapes analysis . Indeed , it is just the greatest of all poetry which seems to be divided from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose is Shakespeare . lie was a man , take him for all in all , I shall not look upon his like again . It is scarcely different from everyday speech , but it is a little different from it . It is separated from everyday speech by just t hat narrow margin , that subtle and scarcely tangible heightening , in which the accent of the greatest poetry consists . It is strange , but this is what is inimitable . " I shall not look upon his like again , " you will say , why , what is there in that ? Any one could have written that . No , only one man could have written it . Poetic poetry , poetry which employs the exotic language and images which the conscious cultivation of the art has generated , is imitable . But the poetry which is content imperceptibly to heighten the simplicity and directness of the speech of daily life is beyond the reach of all but the immortals . The reader will see how close is the analogy between poetry of this order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost indistinguishable curves anti inflections which penetrate a Doric temple , and change the most simple and direct construction possible ? a construction of which every cattle-shed , as I have said , is an illustration ? into noble architecture ? what are they but an example , in a sister art , of that " subtle heightening " which turns ordinary speech into noble poetry ? Our first instinct in face of such architecture and such poetry is to take it at its face value , to think that because it is simple it is easy . Not until our taste is matured do we attain the knowledge that it is the complicated and elaborate which are easy and the // simple which is difficult . The Greek was content with the simplest structural proposition which exists , a proposition instinctively adopted by every child playing with its wooden bricks . This he selected , and this , by the means we have briefly hinted at , he subtly transfigured , devoting to the process endless labour and thought and generations of delicate experiment , until , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt for his needs , an instrument which could express with firm and clear decision the firm and clear ideas of an intellectual philosophy . I would beg finally the reader to place himself in the position of a citizen dwelling in such a typical Greek town as Agrigentum , and who had , always in full view , the row of temples we have spoken of raised upon their rocky terrace or cliff overlooking the sea to the south . Such a noble and choice position , it need scarcely be said , would , in the case of a modern seaside town , be appropriated by one or two big hotels , or by the more pretentious of the houses of the richest citizens . In the case of the Greek town they were dedicated to the temple , which no other structures were permitted to approach . The evident immense age of the gnarled and hollow olives , which grow in the valley between the cliff and the city , would seem to show that this intermediate space , so lovely in its varied foliage to-day , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , perhaps , much as at present in plantations and gardens . In any case the line of temples along the sea-cliff would be the most conspicuous objects visible to the inland city . They would stand in a row , at a mile 's distance , right across its southern horizon , as though poised and stationed with the calculated object of attracting a constant regard . To what end , then , was this preparation and careful provision directed ? What does the reader , one of the Greek citizens of twenty-five centuries ago , see as he looks out southward at those raised and isolated structures ? He sees buildings which fulfil a purpose no living English174 FORM AND COLOUR man has ever associated with architecture , buildings which embody in their own proportion his own highest dreams and aspirations , buildings which appeal , not to any superficial sentiment or mere cultivated taste , but which draw him to them by the strong sympathy which attracts like to like . This architecture is no less than a visible manifestation , an actual embodiment in its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Greek would himself be if he could , and which , in so far as he is worthy of the name of Greek , he is ever tending to become . He has been taught , you have been taught , let me rather say to my Greek reader , to have distinct ideas on this all-important subject . You have been taught to carry with you in your mind a reasoned conception of the kind of man you would wish to be . The conception is an intellectual one ; that is to say , every trait or attribute it possesses is to be thought and reasoned out , and to be intellectually justified . But you have not been left to your own devices alone to construct this character , this image of what you would be . The whole of your race has helped you . All the finest Greek minds , poets , philosophers , historians , orators , have participated in the task . There have never been any divisions of opinion , or conflict , or wrangling over this business . So long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race , to formulate in ordered sequence the attributes of a perfectly rational character . In truth it is this which makes men Greeks . This is the distinguishing note of the Greek race . You , reader , would not be the Greek you feel yourself to be if you could entertain a thought which was contrary to this high rational endeavour , or which refused to be bounded by the limits it prescribed . But from the list of your aiders and abettors I have omitted one of the chief . Poets and philosophers , historians and orators have aided and combined in the task of the representation of the Greek ideal character ; but more important perhaps than any of these , to a race // of such keen aesthetic susceptibility , has been the aid of the artist . He alone could give visible and tangible form to the idea . He alone could represent and render an abstract vision in concrete terms . He alone could appeal to the sense of sight and bring the testimony of sight , that this is beautiful , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , when you look out from Agrigentum 's terraces at the temples along the cliff , what you are looking at is no mere experiment in the art of building . Rather what you are really looking at is yourself ; only not yourself , as you are , weak and frail , distracted by vain desires , and often false , or half false , to the knowledge within you ; but yourself made perfect , the self you are struggling to realise ; nay , more than that , the self that your whole nation is struggling to realise . Human nature yearns after the things which further its development , and so do you yearn after those perfect structures in which the precepts of your intellectual faith arc incarnated . You have forgone much in restricting yourself to these limits , but at least within these limits all things work in unison . Above all , the relations betwixt life and art are enormously simplified by the ease with which you are able to employ your laws of life as laws of art . Without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophers for your guidance in life and conduct are applied by your artists as the guiding principles of art . That harmony and symmetry which your thinkers make so much of , that unity which is their final aim , that stern aversion to frivolous and eccentric motives , and to every feeble or random impulse that might distract attention from the main design ? what are all these but the principles by which Doric architecture is governed , and the effects of which it undertakes 4o render visible in terms of form ? " Thou art the end and realisation of all my endeavours . To be like thee , to attain what thou attainest , and overcome what thou hast overcome has been my desire all // my life long . As I gaze at thee let the beauty of thy perfect shape entice and draw me , so that I too by the same means may attain a similar result . Oh let the craving I have after the virtues of my race be strengthened and purified by thy example , and let my faltering and feeble endeavours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In thee I see what I would be ; grant me to be that which I see . " Such , perhaps , was the prayer , whether spoken or felt , which the Greeks breathed as they contemplated the clustered columns of their temples raised in view of the city and outlined against the sky . CHAPTER X EAST AND WEST How the experiences of a traveller bear out the conclusions already arrived at . Oriental life , in all its aspects , its crowds , towns , bazaars , etc. , is made up of emotion and colour , while the familiar aspects of Western life are altogether composed of intellectual conceptions and definite forms . IT has been attempted , in the two preceding sections , to describe the essential characteristics and essential differences of Eastern and Western thought as expressed in terms of Eastern and Western art ; I should like , however , before passing on , to render the distinction clearer by describing it in terms of actual life . The difference between East and West is not now so radical as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salient to be readily intelligible , and to bear out what has been already written . The European traveller , as he journeys Eastward , finds himself with the first sight of an Eastern port at the beginning of a totally new experience in life and character . Some inkling of the nature of this experience may occur to him even from the first glimpse of the gay and painted boats , with coloured sails , that dance out to meet the steamer , their swarthy crews laughing , shouting , singing , and quarrelling , each boat a focus of vivid colour and blindly impulsive human emotion , which , discharged on to the deck , becomes a rainbow-tinted , frantically energetic crowd of porters and hotel messengers , who at once dazzle your eyes and threaten to tear you and your luggage to pieces . // // All this colour , all this vivacity , are new . And when later you stroll through the narrow labyrinth of native streets , or wander in the covered , dimly-lit bazaars , these same attributes seem to pursue you . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every little tunnel of a shop , stuffed with glowing carpets , or tissues , or gleaming metal , or festoons of yellow and crimson slippers , and disgorging some of its rich contents on to the passage , is a blot of colour ; every figure carries splashes of it in sash and turban ; so that the whole scene and busy crowd are shot with its gleams . Equally , whether gathered into patches or broken up into moving particles among hurrying figures , colour constitutes to the eye the dominating quality of the scene . But not less present to the mental perception is the human quality of an intense emotional sensibility , an emotional sensibility which manifests itself in countless different , often contradictory , ways and moods and actions , yet invariably , as you watch each individual with intentness , declares itself as the governing impulse in his character . The Oriental rage , a rage of hissing accents and blazing eyes and wildly tossing limbs and convulsed features , and fangs showing through the drawn-up lips , is not more entirely an affair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman might perhaps mistake for dulness or lethargy until he observed the quick , stealthy passing of beads through nervous fingers and noticed how clearly the light burns in the dark speculative eyes . It is a state , indeed , as far as possible removed from lethargy , for never is the Oriental more sentient than in these hours when action and thought and conversation arc banished that he may enjoy to the full the mere emotional sense of being . Moreover , even those usual passers-by , who walk up and down and exchange greetings and go about the ordinary affairs of life , seem to the eye of our traveller , now grown acute , to be governed by the same kind of emotional EAST AND WEST 17 ' ) instincts and motives . Their most ordinary movements are strangely inconsequent , and they never seem to be possessed by the same purpose for more than an instant or two at a time . They drift up and down , aimlessly crooning a monotonous chant , or break into sudden fits of gossip and laughter , or stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wander on , all with the impulsiveness of children , and acting evidently on the mere caprice of the moment . Indeed , so soaked are they in impulse and feeling that it is impossible for them to help for an instant giving off that quality , and their gait and attitudes and features and voices and glances all bear witness , sometimes strongly and passionately , sometimes lightly and fitfully , to the emotional sensibility which reigns within . These two characteristics meet the traveller at the portals of the East and abide with him so long as his stay lasts . Together they make up in main outline the experience to which he looks back . No matter whether his intimacy with Oriental life be long or short , close or casual , it resolves itself at last into these two ingredients . All the dim bazaars he has visited , all the gorgeous garments that have fluttered before his eyes , all the languid , yellow twilights and jungle-tangle of blossom and creeper he has encountered will be summed up for him , and float back upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his dealings with men , so puzzling and baffling , all that he has gleaned in knowledge of Oriental customs and manners , all that was typical in their views of conduct and of life , will seem in the same way to emerge from that profound emotional quality which is of the essence of the Oriental temperament . The last impression does but confirm the first . Colour and emotion , he says to himself , as the painted boats and gesticulating crews recede from his departing steamer , colour and emotion make up the East . But though this may be true , and though colour and emotion do , perhaps , constitute the essentials in the character of Eastern life , its possession of which makes 18o FORM AND COLOUR that life seem strange to us , yet they do not alone comprise the whole difference between East and West . The whole difference between East and West is made up , not only of what the East has which the West lacks , but of what the East lacks which the West possesses . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new interpretation of life , but that he has left behind the interpretation with which he was familiar . The Eastern crowd is odd and strange to him partly because it possesses its own peculiar character of a dreamy or impulsive emotionalism , but partly also because it is wanting in the qualities that make up the character of a Western crowd . Instinctively he contrasts the fitful motions of Orientals with the steady walk and businesslike manners of his own countrymen , and the very curtness of the contrast assures him that the West , though it may not have emotional sensibility , has equally definable characteristics of its own . What is the quality he remembers that reigns in London streets ? There is much bustle and movement there , but there is bustle and movement in Eastern streets . Yes , but the bustle and movement of the West is directed to definite purposes . Its energy is subject to no spasmodic impulses and no vague abstraction , but is all turned strictly to account . Much is being done , many things are being attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own business in hand and is intent on it . Even pleasure - seekers go about their pleasure in this business-like way , and pay visits and dine and go to half a dozen balls a night with as methodical an energy as if they were interviewing clients or visiting patients . This is all plain enough , but , of course , all this orderly and disciplined energy in outward behaviour is but the reflex of a corresponding quality in the Western mind . The movements of the European are decisive and orderly because he has a clear mental grasp of the things he means to do . In his mind he carries a plan of action , in obedience // to which he maps out his time , not for hours only , but for weeks and months in advance ; a plan of action duly and carefully thought out , and so not liable to capricious ' alteration . In the same way you will find that all his ideas and opinions relating to life are formed and definite , and that he has convictions on all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , because , like his plans , they are supported by reasons which seem to him good . Here we have evidently at work , as the motive power of conduct , not the emotional but the intellectual faculty . We can easily , by the help of such a contrast , see that the whole life of the average European is formed , as it were , on an intellectual rather than on an emotional basis . Doubtless this is more the case with some nations than with others , but it is the case with all Western nations as contrasted with the East . All Western nations live more or less from the mind , and are perpetually busy with the plans of action laid down by the mind . Reason is the only guide the West acknowledges . We must " he reasonable , " we must " listen to reason , " we must " hear both sides , " we must " get at the facts . " The struggle to obtain a distinct intellectual conception of the conditions under which we live , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ideas , is a passion with us . Any labourer or artisan will argue with his fellows by the hour on Tariff Reform or the Constitution of the House of Lords . Limited as his views may be , they are , in their nature , intellectual views . Vague as his grip of facts may be , it is , as far as it goes , an intellectual grip . Nay , is not all that the European means by the word liberty , so sacred a word in his eyes , the right to reason and to make what he conceives to be reason prevail ? Liberty as we know it in the West does not flourish in the East . It involves arrangement and method and co-operation and argument and compromise , and these are processes of the intellect . It belongs to those steady walkers who carry plans in their heads . This tough intellectual faculty , so visible in the very // make and shape of the Western man , in the steady eye and square jaw , the robust frame and firm step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind , and which are the physical essentials for carrying into effect the decisions of the mind ? this faculty , I think , is that which the West possesses and which the dreamy-eyed , supple-limbed East lacks . The East has its seers and prophets . The West has its politicians and men of science . The East feels . The West thinks . This is the human difference . And then what about that other difference which so much strikes our Eastern traveller ? What have we in the West to set against the vivid , prevalent , rich colour that gleams and glows through Eastern life ? We have form . Form is to Western life what colour is to Eastern . It is the expression which Western life is constantly and involuntarily seeking . We have but to glance along the streets of any of our towns to see how natural and inevitable this mode of expression in the West is . The quality of Western architecture is unmistakable . I do not pretend that it is always , or even that it is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark a constructive race . There is nothing slovenly or vague about it . The facades rise exactly perpendicular , each stone is shaped and fitted with mathematical precision , every moulding and lintel and pediment and pilaster is cut and adjusted with stern accuracy . Modern architecture is in many ways unsatisfactory , and to many people it is disappointing to contemplate the monotonous repetitions of Rome 's dull and pompous ostentation , which , under professional auspices , are made to fulfil the functions of vital architecture . Nevertheless the incongruity of these buildings , when they come to be finished , will not be the most remarkable thing about them . The most remarkable thing about them will be the extraordinary conscientiousness and accuracy of their construction . We have got so used to this conscientiousness that we think nothing of it , but it // is nevertheless the one really interesting feature about modern building . That people should take infinite care in fashioning things they love and understand is not strange ; but that they should take infinite care in fashioning things they neither love nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated instances . Among the ugly buildings of London it is probable that the new War Office will secure in the judgment of history a high place . But let the reader the next time he passes it force his reluctant eyes to appreciate the rigid , perfect construction of every part and portion of it , and he will agree that there is something here more noteworthy even than ugliness . Not a throb of pleasure in the work itself , in the things taking shape under their hands , not a moment 's pride in the thought that their fellow-citizens would look with delight at their achievement , helped on these workers . It was mere dull , stupid routine from beginning to end . And yet look at the awful precision of it all , at the stern sense of duty which reigns in every detail . Is it not evident that to these workmen the clear and exact definition of form is something sacred , so sacred that even when it is put to senseless uses , even when it is wholly cut off from the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old classical allusions and ideas which nobody understands or cares for , they still instinctively treat form with all care and reverence ? Though there may be nothing in mechanical accuracy to admire , though such scrupulousness on the surface when there is nothing within , no meaning or thought of any kind , even aggravates ugliness , yet one may admit that this kind of treatment shows where the instinctive respect both of the public and of the workman lies . Indeed it is the case that , so long as the Western artisan or craftsman retains any sense of right conduct whatever , it will be in his respect for form that it will show itself . In these days , when all the meaning it drew from life has gone out of architecture , excellence of workmanship tends to follow , and it needs no very vigilant eye to // distinguish in all constructive work the signs of carelessness and scamping . But yet though the wood may be green and the paint reduced to a " lick , " though the windows may let the draught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most shoddily constructed suburban flats and villas the articulation of form remains perfect . Every wall is smartly flush , every angle sharp and square to a hair 's - breadth , every measurement accurate , every curve true . Form is the ultimate refuge of Western self-respect , and if ever the time should come when Western walls and arches begin to bulge and waver , we may then indeed expect the imminent collapse of the whole fabric of European progress and civilisation . And yet all this accuracy of form , accepted by us as quite a matter of course , would certainly strike an observant Oriental with wonder and astonishment . The like of it he has never seen . It is a new experience , containing dim suggestions of a strength of character and purpose with which he is totally unfamiliar . The rich and vivid colour of an Oriental bazaar is not more absent from our sombre streets than the iron clearness of Western architecture is absent from the tottering , fantastic edifices , pierced with distorted arches and propped by wooden beams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Oriental city . Architecture is the greatest of the works of man ; but down to the least this difference holds . The contrast between East and West in architecture is the contrast between it in furniture-making , or jewelry , or the laying out of flower gardens , or the making and finishing of every kind of object or utensil for ornament or use . Every one who has lived in the East knows the impossibility of getting the simplest bit of work done with accuracy and simplicity . He will remember the carpenters and masons with their childish scolding ways , holding their tools as if they were afraid of them and fingering their materials with the tips of their fingers , so different from the easy grasp of the English artisan on // saw or chisel ; indeed , the mere way an English mason turns a brick ere he strikes it with the trowel-edge has a mastery in it which no Oriental mason ever attained to . The restless , nervous , slender hands of the East are all for intricacy and ingenuity . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs , but to carve anything with sureness of outline and simplicity of shape is beyond them . It is now many years ago since I was struck by and attempted to describe the profound similarity which exists between Arab life and history and Arab towns and bazaars . It was with Algiers that I was more particularly dealing , and , as I said , to visit the town and pass into its crumbling mass of masonry was to pass into the intricacies of Arab life . The winding , tortuous alleys , zigzagging in all directions , with holes drilled along their bases , out of which protrude piles of merchandise , richly coloured , making blots of purple and crimson in the shadowed way ; the irregular cliff of battered walls latticed with faded shutters , which seem to totter and lean towards each other for support ; the ghost-like robed figures which noiselessly and mysteriously appear , or vanish into their burrows ? all left upon the imagination of a Western observer a strange impression of creatures not governed by any motives of action known to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but governed rather by whim and caprice and fleeting emotional impulses . I had , I said , the same feeling when I stood or wandered in that picturesque labyrinth as when I turned the pages of an Arab history . " There are the same striking individual figures and incidents , the same brilliant glimpses and vivid little scenes , and behind and around all there is the same inextricable confusion , the same lack of all coherence and definite plan . The details of Arab history , however full of romantic and exciting adventures , are to the Western mind inevitably tedious . Of what causes are these events the effects ? Of what effects are they the causes ? are questions which repeatedly recur while you study the thrilling but inconsequent narrative . One receives an impression as of the wrong side of a tapestry . The brilliant colours are there in every stitch , but they are woven into no intelligible design . " i These are thoughts that come naturally to a traveller . The impression he receives of the West is a rational and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterance of life , he will expect to find that the Western rationalism , with its clear-cut ideas and plans , should utter itself most spontaneously in the arts of form . On the other hand , the impression he receives of the East is a sensuous or emotional impression , such as may indeed find artistic expression in richness and intensity of colour , but which neither finds nor seeks expression in the arts of form or in articulate design . Life is the secret of all . It is the fashion nowadays for critics to treat art as a subject distinct in itself and separable from the life which produced it . But art is not self-contained . It is a mode of self-expression not to be distinguished sharply from a thousand other modes of self-expression . Men reveal what they are in their gestures , their looks , and the tones of their voice . They reveal themselves also in their smallest actions , in the way they write their name , or shake hands , or take off their hat or put on their boots . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make , of whatever kind , useful or ornamental , and especially do they reveal themselves in their works of art , which are the most apt conductors of human thoughts and emotions . A traveller 's jottings are not therefore irrelevant to art . What he observes in Western cities and among Western crowds , the steady unhurried step , the self-controlled , almost emotionless manner , the purpose expressed in look and bearing , the disciplined , clear , scientific , wellorganised system of life , so reasonable yet so cold ? all these things are so much raw material which is bound to // work up into an art of a similar and corresponding kind ; while , just as surely , the passion , the emotional force , the speculative bias , and the weak , indefinite impulses in the sphere of practical execution , which make up the play of forces in Oriental life , must issue in an art of the same negative and positive attributes . PAR III CHAPTER XI TILE CHRISTIAN POINT OF VIEW The mediaeval period is the first epoch in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its chief characteristic consists in its equally vigorous interest in mundane and spiritual ideas . The gilds and the monasteries represent this dual development . The balance is not maintained . With the coming of the Renaissance spiritual ideas are dropped in favour of intellectual . WE have dealt with Eastern and Western thought , and with their effects upon art . Eastern thought , we said , was spiritual and mystical in character ; Western thought was rational and intellectual . The most striking feature of the history of man during the preChristian era is the distinct line of cleavage between the two . The opposition between them during that era is absolute . Whoever compares the spirit and temper of Indian and classic literature , or art , or politics , or philosophy , will instantly be aware of this opposition . It embraces all life . The East seems to be reserved and set apart for exclusive cultivation of the emotional faculty ; the West seems to be reserved and set apart for the exclusive cultivation of the intellectual faculty . But then we found , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ancient exclusiveness of the classic intellectualism began to be disturbed by signs of a coming invasion . Following the physical intercourse and colonial penetration of East by West , Eastern ideas filtered Westward and largely transformed the character of Western x88 // thought . The cities of Eastern Europe , which exchanged Eastern and Western commerce , also exchanged Eastern and Western ideas . " All over Asia Minor Hellenism had to mingle wall Asiatic elements , losing in the contact all its fine austerity and sweet reasonableness. " 1 Every one of these cities was trying its hand at the task to which the Greek intelligence had given itself up ? the task of formulating a philosophy of Eastern ideas . It was at this moment , when the fusion between spirit and intellect seemed complete , that a religious drama was enacted , which , in its own main facts , or dogmas as they came to be , answered to the needs of both the spiritual and intellectual faculties , and by so doing secured , so long as it could maintain its own dominance over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these hitherto separated sides of human nature . Henceforth we have to deal with a life and an art which are conditioned by the dualism which Christianity involves . Christianity , the joining of East and West , undertakes the difficult task of reconciling these opposites ; and it is with the recognition of this fact in our minds that we should approach the study of mediaeval life and art . Our reasons for choosing this epoch are of course obvious . The mediaeval moment has been the only moment in Christian Europe when life has been sufficiently sure of its own meaning to express itself in a coherent and original style of art . The earlier centuries , down to the mediaeval age , are encumbered with the idea of the great Empire that had passed away ; they are centuries that are perpetually looking back over their shoulders at the departing shadow of Rome . This retro- FORM AND COLOUR spective tendency shows itself equally in life and art , in attempts to revive the Imperial system of government and in attempts to maintain the basis of Romanesque architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too evidently and too deeply infected with the imitative bias and profound insincerity of the Renaissance to be able to speak for the life of their age as a whole . Their attitude towards art is vitiated by the conception they have formed of it as a fruit of culture rather than a fruit of life . To the mediaeval age , therefore , we turn . We find in that age a new order of society laid down in accordance with the genius of the new races . The Germanic Empires on the Roman model no longer stand the chief representatives of law and order . There has sprung to life a new kind of social organism in the North . A new national bond has been forged . The young races of Europe advance with their own conception of what is to constitute nationhood . The principle of liberty , and the purpose and resolve to establish this principle as the basis of a practical system of government , are to be the maxims of the new progressive states . Free communes and free boroughs , charters and privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new citizenship . A society , rude it may be , but robust , fresh formed and evidently instinct with vitality , dates from the mediaeval epoch . This is Europe 's voice , the voice of the Europe that we know , by contrast with the voice of the old Roman Europe that has now definitely passed . And , identifying the moment , there occurs one of those unmistakable creative epochs in art , a movement so coherent in character and so vigorous in articulation that all who but glance at it must be aware that a new interpretation of life , a new conception of life 's value and meaning , is at the back of it . Let us then , in regard to this age , follow our usual course . Let us , before we turn to the art which it produced , turn to the life out of which that art grew . It was not difficult to seize the ruling principle of Eastern // life , nor was it difficult to seize the ruling principle of classic life , for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediaeval epoch does not adhere to a single idea , and therefore loses something perhaps in immediate intelligibility , yet the character of its thought is not really obscure . For whoever looks at that age frankly and freely will easily distinguish the two main motives by which it is inspired . He will , to begin with , at once realise that the age is one of immense practical energy . The burghers and citizens who , for the better defiance of feudalism , banded themselves together in the earliest English towns , were undoubtedly as shrewd and hard-headed a generation as it would be easy to find . Their purposes and intentions were of an immediately practical kind . Their aim was the very intelligible one of securing their own independence and right to manage their own affairs , and the means they adopted went straight to the point . The lack of personal authority and a personal following was supplied by the excellence of their organisation . To the solitary tyranny of the nobles they opposed the collective unanimity of the commons . But that bond to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the citizens of an English town of the Middle Ages so difficult a force to subdue was the unflinching clearness with which each man envisaged the end in view and the stubbornness of character which each brought to its realisation . If we look at mediaevalism from this standpoint we can do no other than admit its materialistic efficiency . Its purposes are usually of that description . The determination of the shop - keeper and craftsman to direct the affairs of their own borough , and to supervise with jealous vigilance the least concerns of their own handicrafts , seem to denote a people whose ideals lack nothing in mundane tangibility . If ever there were a race of doers , rather than dreamers , one would have thought that the weavers , and armourers , and dyers , and bakers , ' r 0 // and masons of a mediaeval town , knit together in their gilds for the maintenance of their own rights , were such a race . Yet this would have been but half the truth . The curious and so far unique character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper which so conspicuously belongs to it , of an equally clearly marked spirit of devout contemplation and emotional ecstasy . The age is not only that in which material aims are pursued with the greatest vigour and the keenest realisation of their practical value ; it is also that in which spiritual aims are pursued with an equally intense concentration . If mediaeval society derived a quite unusual satisfaction from the prosecution of all kinds of human endeavour , so did it also derive more felicity than ever before or since from the inward contemplation of the truths revealed by spiritual consciousness . Mediaeval society appears like a cord composed of two strands , one white the other red , twisted together , yet still distinguishable the one from the other . Thinkers at all times have told us that the things of the world and the things of the spirit are separate and can only be pursued separately ; yet at this moment they are being pursued simultaneously and that not with less but with more than usual ardour and success in both quests . So opposed in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into history and fix our attention on the scenes and occasions which display their rival action , we seem to be dealing with the past of different races and ages . The occasions which display the influence of the virile energy of that age testify to a temperament , a racial character , a point of view apparently inconsistent with the ideals and aspirations of the contemplative faculty . What arc the motives which underlie the mediaeval strenuousness ? The chief , you would say , was an extraordinarily vivid consciousness of the significance of man 's mortal existence . In this the Aryan race , even in its youthful , primitive days , differs from other races . // What lends animation and interest to Aryan barbarism is the vigorous grasp it has of the concrete ? a grasp which seems at once to express the race 's recognition of the opportunities latent in the material universe , together with its own determination to make the most of them . The young of this vigorous breed set to work upon their surroundings like men who perceive in those surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts are to receive expression . It would almost seem as if , from the very first , there had existed , among the wandering tribes destined to national advancement , an instinctive consciousness of what was in store for them . The struggles they waged , whether against the declining Empire they invaded or amongst each other , were never merely destructive . They were struggles for opportunities , for the right to build cities , and own land , and increase , and expand , and develop . These barbarians , however rude , are aware already of what the future holds for them . The contrast I have in view between the active and contemplative principles which so strangely constitute mediaeval life is very well exemplified in the two leading institutions of that period . The English gilds are often thought of as corporate trading bodies , as associations founded for the purpose of protecting their trade rights and maintaining among their members a certain standard of craftsmanship . These , however , were not the original motives of their creation . The original motive had its roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its purpose was the assertion and maintenance of popular liberty . The gilds are the answer to the self-assertion of individual tyranny , and it is in them that we first catch sight , in its visible effects , of that love of freedom which was to form the basis of European civilisation . Naturally the idea of association is as old as human history , and many theories have been proposed ( by Harting , Wilder , and others ) , in which the gild system // is derived from Greek , Roman , and other sources . What we are here concerned with is the growth of the movement among Northern races , and the point to be borne in mind is that the gilds arose , not in the first place out of any consideration of craftsmanship , but as a vehicle or instrument through which the people could assert their claims to liberty and their right to handle and manage their own affairs . The collective principle they inculcated acted immediately on town development . Green emphasises , what is so evident a trait in mediaeval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of free speech in free meeting , of equal justice by one 's equal , were brought safely across the age of Norman tyranny by the traders and shopkeepers of the towns . " He adds that " in the quiet , quaintly-named street , in town-mead and marketplace . . . in the bell that swung out its summons to the crowded thoroughfare , in the jealousies of craftsmen and guilds , lay the real life of Englishmen , the life of their home and trade , their ceaseless , sober struggle with oppression , their steady , unwearied battle for selfgovernment . " Such was the part played by the towns ; but the germs of the towns were the gilds . As early as the ninth and tenth centuries the gild organisations were already translating themselves into town institutions . An association or collection of people is already a town in all but houses , the growth of the town being but the completion of the popular instinct for combination . Where but two or three were gathered together there existed already a consciousness of strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unprotected . The instinct towards association , formulated as a precept , or ideal , by the gilds , was in outward visible fact , embodied in the towns . The town , in short , was as much the refuge and fortress of the communal or gild system as the castle was the fortress of the individual or feudal system . A further indication of the character of the early gilds is to be found in the attitude of feudalism towards them . // At the time when the English gilds were successfully asserting their right to recognition , those on the Continent were everywhere forbidden and persecuted by the authorities . " A series of Capitularies of the Emperor Charlemagne and his successors interfered with all kinds of combinations and unions , . . . Not only those which proposed directly unlawful objects were threatened with scourging , nose-slitting , banishment , and such-like punishments of their members , but even those whose object was protection against robbery and other kinds of violence . " 1 Instances occur of stringent measures of repression taken against the gilds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with an instinctive and bitter hostility . " The crime of the serfs in their unions , " observes Brentano , " consisted in their endeavouring to provide redress for their grievances without making use of the intervention of their masters , whose powers over them such intervention always increased . Even when the poor people , who were without protection against the inroads of the Normans , leagued themselves into several brotherhoods , and in this manner offered firm resistance to the robbers , they were cut down by the Frankish nobles as a reward for their bravery . " I have drawn the reader 's attention to the gilds because , of all the influences active throughout the mediaeval age , it would seem that these are the most fundamentally characteristic of Western thought and the Western point of view . On the one hand they are the institutions which are most powerful and which most obviously determine the national development ; on the other they are in their intention typical of the ruling motives of the commons . What we think of as the business instinct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their aptitude for achieving practical ends by practical means , is perfectly illustrated in the formation and discipline of the gilds . The influence of the gilds measures the strength of the hold which // mediaeval society maintained on the material interests of life . But there is another aspect of mediaeval life almost as conspicuous , and this too has its associations and leagued brotherhoods . Scarcely less universal and less flourishing , and scarcely after their manner less influential , the monasteries play almost as important a part in mediaeval life as the gilds . Monasticism , it is important to notice , was a spontaneous growth which sprang up everywhere , in every nation , not by any act of authority on the part of the church , but out of a widespread popular sentiment which everywhere nourished and sustained it . It is necessary , if we would do it justice , to consider the movement in its vigour and its prime , and to resist the temptation to examine its decline and estimate its character by the traits it then exhibited . Those defects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty , for the fervour of monasticism died away into the intellectualism of the Renaissance , and as it weakened it was preyed upon by the very maladies which intellect is so apt to detect in its explanations of spiritual phenomena . Self-indulgence and sensuality , hypocrisy and make-belief , worldly greed and luxury , the natural ills which intellect attributes to devotional establishments , came to be , as the age passed from the spiritual to the intellectual standpoint , the very ills by which they were assailed . We , being naturally intellectualists , easily adopt this line of criticism , and with perfect complacency persuade ourselves that we have dealt with the essential qualities of the monastic movement when we have signalised certain symptoms of disease which attended its decline . We shall not make much progress in that way . A movement like monasticism , so obviously indigenous to the soil which produced it , so recognised and important an ingredient in national history , so woven into the life of the people , and even adopted , as we may say , by the very scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement is not to be estimated by what is negative and defective in it , but by what is positive and effective . Causes profound and vital in the life of that age could alone have produced effects of such consequence . What drew these men forward along the path they trod ? What was the felicity they promised themselves ? It was no more than every ascetic , in every age and clime where asceticism has been practised , has laboured to attain . Whenever and wherever seclusion and asceticism have become rules of life , the same motive is at work . Monastic history , the letters of monks , even the relics which survive of their gardens and cloisters , repeat an admonition which has never varied since the world began . Not by reasoning and thinking , so all mystics say , can man attain to the bliss of spiritual insight . Reason dwells on earth , and its business is with the things of earth . It can never yield us more than that dim and faint testimony to the spiritual order which materialism itself contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual order man needs a spiritual faculty ; and such a one he possesses . The soul is to man his spiritual eye by which he is instructed and enlightened ; only to use it to this end it is necessary that the attention and the will be concentrated on the act of spiritual attention , and that the whole order of the temporal and the finite , which is reason 's subject-matter , should be silenced and shut out . Hence the purpose of asceticism . Whenever soul rather than intellect is accepted for guide , the inclination towards asceticism and seclusion is invariable . Let the universe and all objects be as though they were not ; let the breath be stilled , the very heart-beats suspended , the consciousness of physical existence annihilated , and by degrees spiritual consciousness will take the place of physical , and , passively surrendering his whole being to contemplation , the visionary will be drawn into a complete participation in spiritual existence . From whence was this spirit of mysticism derived // which so strangely illumines mediaeval life ? It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East . We have already seen how , before and during the classic age , while all the West that counts was being saturated with pure intellectualism , the East was already brooding over its one and only thought of spiritual vision ; and how the Greeks themselves , when they had run their own solution to a standstill , came in contact with that thought and fell in love with it , and , under manifold philosophic disguises , introduced it into the West . With it came its inevitable attendant , the ascetic life , and together the two ? the idea of an inward spiritual vision and of a monastic discipline for its cultivation  --  working constantly from East to West  --  slowly invaded Europe . Yet there remains always , even after the idea of a disciplinary system had been fully accepted by the West , a difference between Western and Eastern discipline which is significant . The rigour of monasticism is always in proportion to the intensity of the mysticism it is directed to promote . In the East , where mysticism is undiluted , asceticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nearer East , the meeting-ground of East and West which has been most largely influenced by Hellenic ideas , the ascetic system was shorn of some of its terrors and in part adapted to human limitations . In the more essentially rational West , where mysticism is after all but a guest , the monastic ideal has ever been comparatively mundane as well as turned to more practical uses . The rule of St. Benedict , which is the rule of Western monasticism , is adapted from the Eastern rule , or rule of St. Basil , yet contrives not only to mitigate the austerities prescribed by the East , but also to adapt its abstract and transcendental philosophy to the purposes of a rational existence . It made allowance for the weaknesses of flesh and blood . More than that , it so far recognised the world that it provided for the exercise of other faculties than itself , a concession quite outside the ken of Oriental asceticism , and even encouraged // literature and art , the recognition of the claims of knowledge , and such intellectual activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Western point of view , which has always declined to surrender itself to a purely abstract thought , and always insisted on recognising the claims of the material universe . Still the point to be borne in mind is , that the inclination towards seclusion and asceticism , always apparent in the East in conjunction with a certain mode of apprehension , when that mode of apprehension was imported into the West , travelled westward also in the wake of it . It grew up first in the Eastern confines of Christendom , in Egypt and Palestine and Syria , and was thence transplanted into the Western parts of Europe . It flourished and spread , bearing witness in its growth to the depth of the impulse it arose from , yet wearing , to some extent , an alien aspect , an aspect not perfectly congenial to Western life . The strain of deep emotional feeling , passive and still in its nature , and indeed dependent on clearness and calmness of soul for its very power to be and act ? this spiritual strain which penetrates mediaeval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is often difficult to reconcile the ideal of contemplation with the strenuous habits which prevail in the society of the period . No doubt every institution , or profession , must draw the ideas it subsists on out of contemporary life ; yet who would have guessed that the eager , energetic temper which seems to animate most of the aspects of mediaevalism would have yielded adequate sustenance to such an ideal as the monastic ? Who , studying the social , political , and communal activities of the time , would have looked to find , growing freely out of their rough turbulence , and mysteriously feeding upon it , haunts of dreamy contemplation and meditative repose ? Not less seems the contrast the writer remembers between the shaggy trunks and branches of Eastern jungles and the clusters of waxen orchids which , high // up among the shadows , broke from the rude bark in which they had so unexpectedly taken root . Of the two motives we have just glanced at , which together ruled mediaeval life , it was not the mystical impulse which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rather the practical and realistic impulse of which the communes were the centre . Realism , not spiritualism , was , in the immediate future , to dominate Western culture . There has never been a radical change in the Western standpoint . A citizen of the thirteenth century , awakening in present times , would find little in modern progress , with its discoveries and inventions , and applications of science to life , which he would not readily accept . The essentially rational bias of his mind would adapt it to receive all that the Renaissance had to offer . At the same time , accepting modern life , he would look round for something that had dropped out of it . What , among all this reasoning and analysing and investigating , had become of the old thought of spiritual vision ? What indeed ! It would seem to have evaporated . It would seem that , as in Eastern life the cultivation of the mystical faculty has led to intellectual atrophy and to the soaking of Oriental life in the spirit of dreamy acquiescence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to an exclusively intellectual culture has been to atrophy the mystical faculty and drench life in the material estimates which intellect can best handle . The growth , in short , of intellect in the West is registered not more in its own progress than in its rival 's decline . As the time drew on for the birth of the age of reason , men 's thoughts assumed a more definitely mundane cast . There are critics who affirm that the decay of monasticism was due to laxity within the religious orders . No , the decay of monasticism was due to the waning of the contemplative instinct throughout the West . While that instinct lasted and maintained itself in Western life monasticism kept its health , for it had that in life which it could // feed on . It was not until the instinct was vitiated by the trend of the Western mind towards rationalism that those who had hitherto looked to a spiritual source for their felicity began to seek it in more mundane recreations . One word I would add . It is not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain traces of practical and material energy , or certain vestiges of spiritual contemplation . We might discover such in almost any age , and among almost any people , for there are no attributes possible to humanity of which , if we looked close enough , we should not at any time detect the rudiments or the relics . What we want is something very different . Motives dominate art in proportion as they have first dominated life . What we call style in art is the assertion , over the whole area of art , of the influence of certain motives which already have achieved a like control over the life of the age . It is the leading and governing life-motives which we are after . Have we correctly hit upon there ? Does the reader , when lie conjures up in his imagination the age of the craftsman and the monk , see it under the double aspect and dominated by the two families of ideas which we have spoken of ? If so , then we shall find that on the art also of their epoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mediaeval life and art , then , are typical of what we have called the Christian point of view , in that they attempt a reconciliation of matter and spirit . As regards the following period , the period known as the Renaissance , which has lasted to our own day , its general tendency and direction are evident . Mediaevalism , uniting mundane and spiritual interests in a high degree of vigour , utters itself , in art , in terms both of form and colour . The Renaissance , remarkable above all for the strongly and specifically intellectual bias which it lent to the human mind , concentrates its attention more and more on the quality of form . The period of the " awakening of the intellect , " hailed as the fount
