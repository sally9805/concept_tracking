txt Two of the highest ranking officers of the army . Major Gen. Hugh L. Scott , Chief of Staff . and Major Gen. Leonard Wood . commander of the Department of the East , before a sub-committee of the Senate Committee on . Military Affairs today co demned in unsparing terms the Feder d militia as a national military organization and recommended the adoption of a system of universal mill-tary training and service . Walter L , Fisher of Chicago . Secretary of the Interior , attacked the Idea of universal training , and advocated instead a larger standing army , to be secured by increasing the pay of men and coupling vocational with military training . Advocates of universal military training had been counting on the truth of reports that President Wilson had become a convert to this plan of augmenting the national defense . Some of them heard disquieting news today , however . While non-committal as to his ultimate attitude , the President is understood to have Indicated that he was by no means willing to say that universal military training let alone universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reject the theory of the usefulness of uni-versal military training , but he is not convinced of the practicability of any of the schemes proposed . including that embodied in the bill innler considPra- : tion ? ct the meeting of the Senate subcommittee today . Nor is the President in accord with General Scott , General Wood , and the many others who contend that the Federalized militia is a failure . He is understood to feel that the Federalized militia scheme has not had a sufficient trial to justify decision as to its use- ' fulness . Call Militia Scheme a Failure . General Scott and General Wood both characterized a. , s an utter failure the recent mobilization of the National Guard on the Mexican border , and declared that no effective scheme of national defense could be built up on the militia as a basis . 4'Itoth said the nation needed a far &lie,; force of trained men to give it seourity than it had ever before re . mitred , and they gave it as their opinion that the only demozratie , economical , reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the national burden would be equally shared by ell citizens . General Wood laid stress on education in the responsibilities of citizenship and the physical improvement to be secured by a common military training . Mr. Fisher declared that universal training would not supply the need for a first-line force , and that an increase in pay would secure for the regular army all the additional men needed , and introduced figures to show that universal service did not bring the improvement in national morale claimed for it . He asked for the continuance of the volunteer system , which both army officers declared should be discarded . General Scott 's arraignment of the National Guard included sections of a long report of the Inspector General on the recent mobilization on the border , showing in detail what were declared to be the inefficiency and lack of proper equipment and organization which characterized it- He also went into detail in examining the experience of the European nations as to the length of time required to train a soldier and the number of men needed for security at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to the alliance between Great ? Bnitain and Japan as an example of what we must be prepared to meet if we would be absolutely secure against foreIgn encroachment . Before the European war began , he pointed out . the General Staff estimated that , to insure our national safety , 500,000 fully equipped troops would be enough at the outbreak of war , with 500,000 more available in ninety days . Since the war began that estimate has been tripled , making it 1,500,000 in each case . Great Britain and Japan . " This is due , " said General Scott , " to the fact that one of the powers involved in the war and whose territory - extends the whole length of our northern frontier has increased its army from a relatively small force to a strength approximating that of the other great European powers . Due to the fact that our northern neighbor is largely an island empire , a great portion , af any trained force it may possess can be spared for use in a distant theatre : of operations , because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives ' it practical immunity from inva-slon where troops would have to be ' transported across the sea . ; ! . It should also be pointed out that iiitr northern neighbor is in alliance ; With : c.:PUWerful Oriental nation , another ; teitestd-ernpire , which , for the same rea-son ; " ? when- acting in alliance with a PCWar. " - vvhiat has control of the sea , has Aitiii-71.Crailtd " - its army of 2,250,000 men to any part of the world without danger of invasion . I think a mere statement ! of these facts makes It clear that at present we are practically defenseless before the veteran armies of our northern neighbor and could easily be crushed by the existing coalition of these ' slant : empires . " The volunteer system can not now under the most favorable circumstances . I produce anything like the number of men required for the national defense . It is undemocratic , unreliable , inefficient and extravagant . It is undemocratic because it shifts the burden of national defense from the shoulders of the many , where It rightfuly belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition in life or whose patriotism impels them to offer themselves to accept the risks and hardships of war . It Is unreliable , as all history teaches us . It has been tried and discarded by all of the other great nations of the world , and today the United States and China are the mly nations of size upon the globe which rely upon volunteers for the defense of national existence . " It is , therefore , without apology that the recommendaion is made that this system , which has ever been a failure from every possible angle , be discarded and a modern system of national defense ! erected In its stead . The time has come when this country , unless it intends to avoid war at any cost , must resort to universal liability to military training and service . " The term ' universal liability to military training and service ' is used because the term ' compulsory military training and service , ' so frequently I heard in discussions relative to our I national defense , seems not to be applicable in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , if universal liability to military training and service were ordained , it would mean only that the people as a whole have through their representatives recognized the duty of the individual to prepare himself to defend his country in case of need . " General Wood 's Training Plan , General Wood advocated a system providing at the start for six months of intensive military , training for boys when . they reach the age of 19 . This Would be followed by thirty days of training When they became 21 . When the thirty days ' training had been completed the young man would be enrolled as a member of a " national reserve " regimenl , , to be liable for active service until he became Sti , the preference to be given to those between 21 and = , usually an age before the average man has acquired permanent family obligations . The General opposed payment for . service , saying payment would destroy the feeling of national obligation , which should be one of the chief objects of universal service . ? ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " we should have more soldiers than we could take care of . If we want to pay the money , we can hire all the men we desire , but we do n't want that . We want to make citizens acquire a real feeling of national solidarity and national duty , and we will go far toward that when we get common sacrifice for national security . " Universal service is the only really democratic system , and I believe it would be thoroughly popular if people could realize that the rich man and the poor man alike would have to share its burdens . I have found enthusiasm for it everywhere when 1 nave made people understand that no one is to be allowed to buy his way out . The labor leader and the district leader in New York alike are responsive to the idea under those conditions , " The tragedy of the National Guard mobilization , with the deprivations it imposed on some families , was worth all It cost if we take heed from it . The experiences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties of the camp , have gone far toward educating the country to the possibilities ' of a universal system . " General Wood said he did not believe in a large standing army , as his scheme . If worked out , eventually would give the nation a reserve army of 4. - 000,000 men , which would be adequate to . make the country secure against invasion . The standing army should be kept only for manning permanent garrisons . The National Guard , he said . should be abolished as a national force . " If the States wish to keep it as a militia organization , " he said , " that is their right , but personally I believe a State constabulary would be much better to keep order in strikes and similar disturbances , as police are al.1 ways better than troops in handling crowds . Their presence is not apt to be so much resented . " General Wood declared that universal training would serve better than anything now known to give a sense of nationality to immigrants . " I believe its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation would be startling , " he added . " Our huge murder rate , now many times . greater than that of Europe , would be divided by ten . " Larger Pay as the Remedy . In urging his plan of a larger standing army , Mr. Fisher said in part : " I have talked with a prominent officer , very high in the service , and he told me that in his judgment we could get all the men we needed if we paid them $30 a month , instead of $13 . It is only natural that men should feel that to enlist in the regular army at the present rate of pay is a confession of failure . They think it shows the value which they put upon themselves , and they avoid it as long as they can . If we paid them $30 a month and offered every man in addition the chance to learn a trade we could turn military service from a thing of drudgery and ' servitude into something of personal and social value . " The solution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the contrary , it lies in turning military service ' or training into something of real value to those who undertake it , into a benefit rather than a burden , an individual asset rather than a universal liability . If we reorganized our regular army and our militia service so that every one who went into it came out better off than he was before , we would have a military system which would justify it . " General Scott will go into details as to mobilization when he resumes his testimony tomorrow . Diamond Badge for U. S. Marshal . United States Marshal Thomas D. McCarthy received a gold badge set with diamonds from his subordinates yesterday , partly on account of Christmas and partly in recognition of his efforts to have the pay of his thirty-three deputies equalized . Their pay now ranges from $900 a year to $1,500 . Mr. McCarthy wants all of them to receive $1,200.
