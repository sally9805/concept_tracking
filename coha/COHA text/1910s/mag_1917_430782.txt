 | Vague and erroneous ideas about war finance are perhaps more general than about any other matter of such vital importance in the great struggle which we have entered . Even among those otherwise well informed , including many in business and banking itself , the prevalence and persistence of incorrect and even fallacious ideas regarding the fundamentals of war financiering are little short of amazing . Editors of our leading journals and directors of financial institutions point out almost daily our inability to meet the expenditures of a great war during the war period and the advisability of postponing part of the cost to the future so that posterity , which shall share the benefits , may share also its burdens . They have failed to distinguish between internal and foreign financing ; they have failed to grasp the significance of President Wilson 's war message in its urgent appeal to Congress to resort to taxation and " to protect our people , so far as we may , against the very serious hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of the inflation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the advantages of an initial bond issue , this article will undertake to show , first , how a continued resort to borrowing will inflate our purchasing medium and cause prices to rise exorbitantly , as taxation will not ; second , why the cost of our part of the war not only can , but must , be met during the war period and that no part of the burden can really be postponed ; third , how adequate funds may be raised by taxation without resort to further bond issues ; fourth , why the taxation policy will be more just and mobilize our resources more effectively than will a continuance of the bond policy ; and , fifth , why the taxation policy will make easier necessary readjustments after the war . Practically all economists admit the desirability of an initial bond issue at the outbreak of war to secure funds quickly while taxation machinery is being put in order . Furthermore , a successful $7,000,000,000 bond issue will impress ourselves ,  | our friends and our enemies ; it will give our movement a tremendous momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the diversion of labor and capital to war industries more natural and gradual than would too heavy taxation at the outset . But the continuance of the bond policy as the chief method of raising funds would be exceedingly unwise . According to The Annalist , the cost of living has risen 64% in the twelve months ending May 5 , 1917 . This means that a man with a fixed wage or salary of $1,000 has had his income cut to $610 as compared with a year ago , or to $529 as compared with pre-war conditions . This is in addition to the cut caused by high prices which had been our chief complaint for several years prior to 1914 . Of course , those with large incomes could spare one-third or one-half of the total and still have left much more than a minimum of subsistence , but few of us realize the sacrifice involved for the great majority of families of this country , for their incomes are considerably less than $1,000 a year . For many of them it means poor health , disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , and perhaps in the case of even women and men in the poorer quarters of our cities . It means also more crime as well as a less efficient labor force and hence the undermining of national power at its very foundation . Why bond issues cause an increase in prices as taxation does not is far from clear to many who have not studied banking . Hence it is desirable to present a few fundamental principles . Bank deposits are of two kinds . When a man puts a thousand gold dollars in a bank , he is given a deposit account . This is a " real deposit " and it is in this sense that many people think of the term " deposit . " But there is another kind of deposit which is even more important in practice . Suppose a man goes to the bank to borrow a thousand dollars . He gives his note for a thousand dollars , and he might take out a thousand gold ' dollars ; but he does not . Instead , the bank gives him a deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a " book deposit . " If the man is unsophisticated , he may imagine that the bank sets aside 1,000 actual dollars to pay the checks which he will draw , but that is not the case . It merely sets aside a small reserve , probably $200 , which makes his  | $1,000 deposit account good , because when this man gives his grocer a ten dollar check , the grocer presents it at the bank but does not usually ask for cash . Instead he asks that it be deposited to his account . The first man 's account is debited $10 , and the grocer 's account is credited $10 . No actual money has been used . If the grocer gives a clothier a $10 check , the latter presents it to the bank and , instead of asking for cash , has it deposited . The sum on deposit is still $1,000 . No money has been used . A few who receive checks will ask for actual cash , but the bank has found by experience that a small reserve , say $200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar deposit account going . In other words , when the bank loaned this man a thousand dollars , it merely gave him a book account which involved the use of only $200 of actual money . It may be said to have created $800 of credit purchasing power which is used to buy more goods just the same as real money . The important point for our purpose is that the man 's ability to borrow depended upon his giving security . That is why a bond issue means more purchasing power than does taxation . It is primarily because a bond is security upon which the holder can borrow at the bank . On the other hand , if the government takes $1,000 from a man in taxes , his credit or purchasing power is lessened to the same extent as the government 's is increased . He can not borrow on the security of his tax receipt . The man with a bond worth $1,000 can , and very often will , borrow at the bank . Suppose he borrows $800 ; to lend him $800 the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead it gives him a deposit account of $800 and , inasmuch as most of those who present checks do not ask for actual cash but have their checks credited to their deposit accounts , the bank can keep this $800 in checks floating by setting aside , say , only $200 of actual cash . In other words , this bond issue transaction has resulted in increasing the government 's credit by $1,000 , in decreasing the man 's credit by only $200 and in decreasing the bank 's reserve by only $200 ; that is , there has been a net increase of credit currency ( checking deposit accounts ) of $800 , in contrast with no net increase if taxes had been adopted instead of bonds .  | If the man had given up $1,000 in taxes , he would have ceased to compete with the government and other buyers of commodities and labor to that extent ; but when the government gives him a bond for his $1,000 , he is still enabled , by borrowing at the bank , to enter the market for goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bondholder with the government inevitably forces up the prices which must be paid by both . Thus the government 's cost of conducting the war and citizens ' costs of living are increased . In the illustration , the bank sets aside $200 of actual cash as a reserve to support the $800 of credit extended to the bond holder . This leaves $600 as the net increase in the purchasing power of society as a whole . Inflation will not take place unless the floating of bond issues causes more borrowing at the banks . Hence objectors have asked whether many wealthy men will borrow at the banks or sell their present securities yielding 4 to 6% in order to provide funds for investment in United States bonds yielding 3 1/2% . One hard-headed banker is quoted as replying to such a question , " I do n't know . I 've sold $300,000 worth in the past few days to enter an initial subscription for that amount . " ' Perhaps many who buy United States bonds will not borrow at the time to do so , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , or , if they borrow anything in the future before they realize on their bonds , such borrowing will have much the same effect then as borrowing to buy bonds , because such borrowing would not have been necessary if the funds had not been spent for bonds . Furthermore , even if they have spare funds and do not need to borrow to buy bonds , their buying of bonds prevents their lending to others , who are thus forced , directly or indirectly , to borrow more from the banks and inflate the purchasing medium more than would have been the case with no bond issues . It is not a question of whether bond issues will cause inflation or not , but a question of the extent of the inflation . The above illustrations show the possible results of bond issues that are taken by the public . As a matter of fact , if bonds are issued , a large part of them will be taken by banks .  | It is likely that the Federal Reserve Banks will buy these bonds wholesale by giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will cause immediate inflation to the amount of the checking accounts thus created , less reserve requirements , that is , possible inflation to about 80% , or even to 100% , instead of to 60% of the bond issue , as outlined in the previous illustration . As the government draws checks on these bank accounts to meet its requirements , the banks will try to recoup themselves by retailing the bonds to the public . To the extent that they succeed , the bonds get into the hands of the ultimate investor who can use them as security for bank loans . In so far as the banks are unsuccessful in this distribution , the government is almost certain to permit them to issue bank notes on the basis of the bonds left in their hands , if the financial strain becomes severe . Such bank notes will cause inflation even worse than that due to the checking accounts of the public based on bond collateral . The effect of inflation is cumulative . The more bonds that are issued the greater the inflation and the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quicker the funds are ex hausted and the greater the need for more bond issues with still greater inflation and prices . Bond issues sold at home do not , in fact , lighten the present burden of a war nor do heavy taxes necessarily increase its weight more than bonds . Perhaps there is no more common fallacy regarding the burden of a severe war than that it is so great that it can not be met in the short time in which it is being fought . Corollary to this is another very popular fallacy that , even if a war could be paid for at the time , part of the burden should be put off until the future in order that posterity , which shares the benefits , should also share the burdens . The truth of the matter is that a war , however great its cost , not only can , but must , be paid for during the war period , if the nation does not expect to draw upon foreign countries . If the war should be a long contest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insignificant fraction of what we shall have to devote to its prosecution . Munitions ,  | food , clothing , and practically all that is necessary to wage the war will have to be produced as we fight . They must be paid for by somebody during the war period unless the government is to seize them without payment . What a war really means is a diversion of labor from the industries of peace to the industries of war . We can not continue producing and consuming all of the commodities to which we have been accustomed and , at the same time , divert a large part of the forces which have been used in their production to military purposes . This obliges us , of course , to give up some things , the things that are least necessary luxuries . The corollary of this is that everyone who demands luxuries and unnecessaries is thereby keeping men from the firing line or from the production of equipment for war or from the production of the necessities of life . This not only means a smaller force to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of necessities and also a higher cost of everything which the government has to buy . If the government is to pay for the labor which it diverts and for the commodities which it uses , it must secure its funds in one of two ways , either by taxing or by borrowing . In either case , it can secure these funds only from those who have more than a minimum of subsistence unless it is to press down the masses of its people below that minimum . If the government takes money in the form of taxes from a man , it gives him a tax receipt and owes him nothing further , but , if it secures the same amount by borrowing , it gives him a bond which it promises to repay in the future , with interest . If the government takes as taxes a large part , or even all , of income above a minimum of subsistence , it causes no more sacrifice than it does when it conscripts a man for the firing line . This is especially true in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this income by taxation , the government promises to pay it back with interest , the sacrifice is insignificant . It is now clear in what sense the burden of a war financed at home can be put upon posterity . If a father sustains great losses , the burden is put upon his children in the sense that they do not receive as great a heritage as they would have received otherwise . If a nation sustains a great loss , posterity re- ceives an impaired heritage . Both the present generation and all future generations suffer . But in the sense that is usually meant , the future can not bear the present 's burden . Munitions not yet created and men not yet born can not be hurled against the enemy 's lines . It is true that some of our citizens may advance money in return for bonds and be repaid by the citizens of the future , who will include the soldiers who are fortunate enough to return . But this merely means taking the burden off one part of our citizens and putting a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not put off the burden . This is evident when we consider that if all the bonds should be cancelled there would be no change in the amount of commodities or property within the nation . There would merely be a cancellation of the obligation of one part of the citizens to another part of the citizens . As has been intimated above , the extraordinary expenditures of the war should be met in large part by taxation upon special war profits and surplus incomes . It would be unwise to increase most of our customs duties greatly , because they fall upon people largely in proportion to their consumption of necessities and not in proportion to their ability to bear burdens of taxation . To meet the enormous needs of war , we may well lower the income tax exemptions from $3,000 and $4,000 to , say , $1,500 and S2.000 or even less , and we may well increase the rates upon the larger incomes , especially upon those above $50,000 or $100,000 . In extreme need taxation might take alI incomes above a minimum of subsistence without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing line . Doubtless it would be more expedient not to take all , but to leave as large a proportion as is feasible in order to encourage efficiency . Of special profits caused by the war itself , the government might first exempt a maximum profit of 6% or 8% and then take all of the excess above that amount if necessary . But here , too , it would be expedient to exempt a certain percentage to stimulate efficiency . It should be observed that both of these proposed taxes provide for exemptions at the bottom , that both of them are advocated for the war period only , and that neither of them confiscates capital now in existence , but that they  | merely propose to take a part of surplus income during the war . The experience of the warring nations shows that such taxes are feasible . For example , during the fiscal year just closed , Great Britain has raised nearly three-fourths of a billion dollars from her " excess profits tax " and nearly a billion dollars from her income tax . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably two or three times as great as those of Great Britain and the profits even greater in proportion . In other words , from these two taxes as now framed in Great Britain , we could probably raise 3% to 4 billion dollars a year . They should form the backbone of our emergency revenue system , also . If to them we add other taxes and other measures which are suggested below , we could finance our part of the war entirely , if need be , by taxation . But taxation is not only a method of raising revenue , it is also a method of cutting down demand for luxuries and unnecessaries , of ' diverting labor and capital from places where least needed to military purposes . In the present emergency , such a national waste as the liquor business should not merely be discouraged by heavy taxation , but should be eliminated entirely . The taxation of luxuries which are not to be absolutely prohibited will cut down their consumption , and the taxation of surplus incomes will have a similar effect by reducing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of commodities and services produced in the United States which could be dispensed with either permanently or temporarily . The items include such things as artificial flowers , pleasure cars , billiard tables , many furnishings , clocks , many articles of clothing , silks , laces , feathers , plumes , jewelry , extravagant millinery , musical instruments , patent medicines , alcoholic liquors , coffee , tea , many private and public buildings , et cetera , amounting to from $7,000,000 , - 000 to $10,000,000,000 annually , enough to finance the war . But there is much objection to heavy taxes . Besides the fallacious ideas which have been discussed above , the most common and serious objection is that taxation will not raise funds quickly enough and that it will injure industry and business much more than will bonds . It is true that time is  | required to get the machinery for new and heavy taxes in working order so as to bring in their maximum yield ; hence the initial issue of short time bonds or treasury notes is justifiable . Such bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominations and interest bearing , in order to keep them out of general circulation as paper money . The most serious objection to a policy of heavy taxation is its effect upon industry . This objection takes several forms . In the first place , it should be pointed out that many people who make this objection have not drawn the proper distinctions between general taxes upon surplus incomes and net profits , on the one hand , and taxes upon commodities , property , and even special taxes upon income and profits , on the other hand . A tax upon property or upon the products of that property ? for example , upon a sugar factory or upon the sugar turned out ? would make that property or that commodity less profitable and would tend to drive producers out of that line of inindustry into others which were taxed less heavily . But if the tax were general and evenly distributed upon all property and all commodities , it would not drive enterprise out of one industry into another , because both would be taxed in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was levied , they would be also equally profitable after it was levied . But from an administrative standpoint it would be almost impossible to levy taxes on different properties and commodities in such a way as to distribute them equally . Hence such taxes might cause a considerable disturbance in business . Even in case of a special tax upon incomes or net profits from certain lines of business , there would be a tendency for those in the taxed lines to go over into those industries whose profits were not taxed . But the case is different with a general tax upon net profits and incomes . This tax applies to net profits and incomes from whatever source derived . Whatever the rate of the tax , it is to the interest of the taxpayer to make the highest possible net profit . If the tax leaves him any part of his net profit , that is , if it is anything less than 100% , the greater his total profit the greater will be his remaining share after the tax is deducted . Before the tax was levied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make  | the greatest possible profit . If , because of the tax , he goes into any industry in which the total net profit is less , his share of the net profit after the tax is deducted will also be less . In other words , a general tax upon net incomes offers no inducement for a man to go out of one industry into another . But even heavy general taxes upon net incomes may hurt business by taking funds for the government which would otherwise be used for repairs or for extension of plants . In the case of war the government must get funds somewhere . The question is whether the government shall take part of the funds which would ordinarily go for the repair and extension of plants or whether it shall take part of the funds which people would use for consumption . It is evidently in the public interest to take these funds from consumption in so far as this consumption is of luxuries . But it is of very questionable wisdom to take such funds from the consumption of necessities , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masses of a standard of living which is necessary for health and efficiency . It is probable , however , that nearly all the funds needed could be secured through the elimination of the consumption of luxuries . It would be unfortunate to take funds that would really hamper business , and it would be equally , or even more unfortunate , to sap our national labor strength at its foundation . A typical business man has objected to the injury which heavy taxation would cause business by saying : " While I might pay 25% of my income in taxes , it would be impossible to give up 60% of it without incurring bankruptcy . " This man , like many others , has a net income of perhaps $100,000 , but he knew in advance that he would have such an income and hence had made contracts involving its use . Not all this $100,000 net income , nor even one-fourth of it , is what may be called free . He had agreed to use a certain part of it to pay for land which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts for life insurance , et cetera . It is true that most of these payments are investments of a sort , but he is under contract to pay them and may be bankrupted by foreclosures if he has to give up too large a part of his income in taxes .  | This is a real difficulty , but it involves a problem of administration rather than a matter of principle . In many cases the investments which men like this one are making are bringing in current income out of which they could pay taxes , but if , as in many other cases , the free income would not be available for a few years , the taxes could be advanced by the banks on the security of the investments of present income . These investments will become remunerative , or can be liquidated in time to repay the loans of the banks . The government might even instruct the Federal Reserve Banks and the national banks to arrange for such advances of taxes . It has been objected also that very sudden and heavy taxes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus lead to bankruptcy , much temporary unemployment , and much confusion . Bond issues , by causing inflation , would avoid this sudden change and consequent depression , it is claimed . The government in bidding for commodities and men would raise prices for those things which it wanted . These higher prices would result in diverting industry in the desired directions gradually instead of suddenly . There is much weight to this claim , although , even those who advance the idea , urge very heavy taxes as well as bonds and admit that bond issues sacrifice justice for the sake of expediency . The present writer is in thorough agreement with this . But the fact is that we are not faced with a prospect of raising all funds through taxation . We have already authorized $7,000 , - 000,000 in bonds . The policy here advocated is the raising of as large a proportion as possible of all future requirements through taxation . We have already indicated incidentally some ways in which a proper tax policy will promote national efficiency as bond issues will not . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened by the inflation consequent upon bond issues , is of prime importance . Taxation as a means of forcing economies and of diverting labor and capital to the places most needed is scarcely of secondary importance , though the advantages of taxes over bonds are not so great in this case . But what is of more importance in promoting national efficiency is the justice of the taxation program . All serious  | objections to taxes are based upon expediency ; very few deny their justice . All admit that taking surplus income by taxation involves very much less real sacrifice than conscription of men . Justice makes for national solidarity and power . Men will enlist in greater numbers and will fight with greater zeal if they know that those at home , both rich and poor , are also sacrificing their all for the cause . Not only would the tax policy mobilize our forces more effectively during the war period , but it would also leave our industries much better prepared to meet the readjustments which must follow the war . Prices have already soared skyward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The higher they go , the further they will have to drop after the war . Hence the greater the danger not only of a financial panic but also of a prolonged depression with unemployment and all its attendant evils . The reduction of heavy war taxation at the end of the struggle would encourage consumption and hence call for the employment of returning soldiers and labor freed from munition making . If we raise prices during the war by bond issues and levy heavy taxes after the war , incomes will then be cut and consumption curtailed at the very time when we shall have a large free labor force capable of producing for larger consumption . The problem now before us is not one of raising all funds by the one method or by the other but rather one of the proper proportion between the two.2 How much shall what is economically feasible give way to what is politically practicable ? How much shall social justice be sacrificed to administrative expediency . The answer depends almost solely upon the general understanding of the issues involved . Such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An America in which every citizen without discrimination is called upon to do and to give all he can , all that his powers permit , will be a united America , and a united America is bound to be victorious .
