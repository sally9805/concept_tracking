txt Almost the strangest thing that has happened since the beginning of the war was the collapse of the Turkish resistance at Erzerum . Now Asia Minor is open to the peril of being halved like an apple by a pair of shears , the Russians descending from the north and the English ascending , from the south . Mesopotamia is the core . The defeat of the Turks is not yet explained . It was not owing to a lack of ammunition or supplies , for ' the official bulletins tell of the capture of large quantities of war material . The killing , nevertheless , is said to have been one-sided . The official Petrograd word for the Russian losses is " slight " : for the enemy 's losses it is " terrible . " That was the case both in the taking of Erzerum and in the headlong pursuit . The Russian War Office speaks of being on the heels of the enemy , " annihilat " ing them or taking prisoners at the " tall ends of Turkish columns .

Among the spoils enumerated by the Russians were military motor cars , as if the Turks in their panic had forgotten one precious means of flight The ideas of the correspondents have been utterly confused , so that one day they have written of a Russian as- , sault so terrific that forts withered away before it , and , on the next , ( the Russians being inside , ) they have ex patiated on the impossibility of the ' ' Turks ever retaking Erzerum , because the defenses were only slightly damaged and are being rapidly mended by the new occupants . Berlin and Constantinople comment on the situation by silence or in monosyliables.1 That may be regarded as eloquent corroboration . Here has been an unexpected defeat for the Turco-Teutonic combination . The German dream of an overland empire is rudely interrupted . Allowing what you will for Russian enthusiasm and for the exuberance of correspondents unused to the sensations of victory , the facts are that Asia Minor has been powerfully invaded under the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate were ' put to flight in two directions , and that the momentum of pursuit has carried the Russian forces already a long distance to the south , in the direction of Mesopotamia , where the English invaders are . The Bagdad Railway is threatened . That is the Kaiser 's projected short route to India , from Constantinople eastward across Asia Minor to Bagdad and down the Tigris River to the Persian Gulf , which is an estuary of the Indian Ocean . The Russians moving south , on the heels of the fugitive Turkish forces , are now within 100 miles of the Bagdad Railway . BY , cutting it they could perhaps divide the total forces of the Turkish Empire and make it impossible for Constantinople to relieve or reinforce the army opposing the English south of Bagdad . But that is not the most interesting possibility . Here is Russia at last about to find herself in physical possession of the shortest route from Europe to India . No wonder she is enthusiastic .

That would account for nearly everything except the inefficiency of the Germans ' information service . Evidently they underestimated the gathering power-of Grand Duke NICHOLAS in the Caucasus . It is possible that they thought he had been Sent there to lie on , a shelf , instead of which it was to spring a midwinter surprise . There will be , no doubt , some ponticalmiSgivings in Europe on the head of Russia 's progress toward navigable water that does not freeze , especially as the initiative appears to he wholly hers , so that her prestige in ' Asia will be much enhanced ; but that for the present can not count against the great end , which is again to.weld the ring , If the Russians and the end of pagan .
