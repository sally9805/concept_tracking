 | I had always said that if anything could tempt me to face the prospects of parenthood ( a thing , by the way , for which the invariable feminine heart is represented by current literature ? I just missed writing " fiction " ? to " hunger " ) , it would be the satisfaction of having something of my very own upon which to practise my theories of education . Alice had said the same . And there was a considerable period when it was a pretty even bet that I was as likely to yield to the temptation to demonstrate our doctrines as she was . But Alice has always been a bit given to surprizing people . So she , who " did n't like the boys , " one fine day announced her engagement , and , in course of time , we had a wedding in our family . But we continued to discuss the educational field offered by children as something still remote and purely academic , when , after some six years of placid and prosperous wedded life for Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded him as a duty ; that due reflection had convinced her that from every point of view , intellectual , physical , financial and social she and Tom were the sort of citizens upon whom should rest the responsibility of training the coming generation ; and when Alice begins to consider duty , you might as well discontinue argument . Bob and I did point out to her that up to that time she and Tom had found a great deal of companionship and entertainment in Helen , the cat ; that providing a good home for an estimable cat , to say nothing of providing the homes of one 's friends with equally estimable kittens , was no mean mission in life , and that there was besides this incalculable superiority of cats over babies ; that if you wished to go out of an evening , all you had to do was to leave Helen on the back porch , and enjoy perfect serenity of mind until she came purring to meet you on the front one on your return . Helen was a worthy cat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly human reasoning faculties once earned me three dollars from THE INDEPENDENT ) ; but I had to admit that altho we had taught her to eat at the table like a lady , you could n't teach her Latin , or that the primary purpose of a pile of freshly ironed shirt waists was not to  | serve as a place for feline slumbers . Now of course no really worthy system of education can be devized that does not embrace Latin ( but I have never yet seen one that would inspire a baby any more than a cat with the least respect for a clean shirtwaist ; maybe the domestic scientists will achieve that ) . Therefore , after all , we welcomed Richard . Only his name was to have been Thomasina . Our educational system had been especially elaborated with a view to the development of feminine character . Our mother averred , too , that " you could dress little girls so much prettier than boys . " ( I should like to hear some venturesome mortal now intimate in her hearing that Richard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue collar and belt , that he has been wearing this summer . ) I myself looked forward with great complacency to training little Thomasina 's infant lips to lisp first of all a demand for the ballot and free entrance into professional life , with equal pay with men . Even Tom and Bob and our father admitted ? they could n't safely do otherwise ? that they " liked girls . " And so Richard 's layette was all blue . Well , he wore the clothes . Their color matched his eyes . But otherwise our pedagogical scheme required some readjustment . The very first readjustment so far as his only aunt was concerned was the revision of a monumental work which she was preparing for his first Christmas present . This was an edition de luxe of a First Latin Book , composed by myself , and designed as a most important illustration of my fundamental educational doctrine ; that the study of Latin should be begun at the earliest possible moment in a child 's life , and that it should so intimately deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been she ) should never even suspect the existence of that ludicrous superstition of the unlettered ? or the " vocationally " trained ; same thing ? that it is a " dead " language . I regret that limitations of space forbid the reproduction of a few specimen pages . I have never attempted to use the book for commercial purposes , it having been purely a labor of love for my nephew , with no thought of financial return ( the nearest approximation to maternal " self-sacrifice , " I suppose , to be expected from a school-teacher and bachelor aunt ) . But I may modestly say that I am confident that upon only a very slight advertisement of that nature it would be widely adopted , not only for use in schools but also in families . It may not be in bad taste to say that it is arranged upon the soundest pedagogical principles , beginning duly with the first declension and first conjugation , the first vocabulary running somewhat as follows : Thomasina , ae . An angel child . Helena , ae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to have been . Bona . What Richard ought to have been . Vagitare . To cry . Vapulare . To spank . Etc . The sentences deal not with muses , tables and stars for the first lesson , masters , fields , wars and men for the second , et cetera ; but with various intimate and tender relations of our family life and daily walk and conversation . As EXERCIZE I. 1 . Quis est parva Thomasina ? 2 . Thomasina pulcherrima puellula est. 3 . Suntne dua ? Thomasina ? ? Non sunt . Altera Thomasina in orbe terrarum esse non potest. 4 . Thomasina vagitatne ? Minime . Thomasina semper bona puella est. 5 . Cur Helena parvam Thomasinam amat ? Quod Thomasina Helenam numquam agitat. 6 . Parva Thomasina litteras suas amatne ? Sane , vehementer amat. 7 . Si parva Thomasina tam pulchra et bona est , si litteras amat , neque vagitat neque Helenam agitat , nonne moritura est ? Minime vera , non moritura est ; numquam enim est nata. 8 . Num Thomasinam veram personam putavisti ? Now any classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go to press was completely knocked out by th ? nature of Richard 's father 's telegram . Gender cuts any amount of ice in a First Latin Book , and there 's no earthly way of getting a boy into the first declension unless he 's a Greek or a farmer ( agricola , of course ) . The cover , designed and made by one of our Art School students , still did well enough , because a baby in long clothes answers equally well to the name of Richard or Thomasina , but the filling for that cover had to be made over , and in a hurry , too , for Richard 's natal  | day is the third before the Nones of December , and a Christmas box that must travel a thousand miles ought to be started soon after the Ides . Well , the result of it all was that , except indirectly as indicated in the above vocabulary excerpt , Parvulus Ricardus never got into the first lesson of his own book , and had to wait and serve as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And while I regretted it in the exceptional case of my own and only nephew , I have found some consolation in what was then for the first time borne in upon my consciousness ; that if men in general get the first place most of the time , at least in Latin grammar they have to stand second . to the puellae , and not for empty considerations of mere courtesy , either , which is another unanswerable reason why the study of Latin should never be omitted in our schools , and why it should be pursued coeducationally for its uplifting and chastening effect upon the sexes respectively . Richard had seen precisely six months of existence before he saw his maiden aunt . He greeted me with cordiality , however . At least , he submitted smilingly to my practical demonstration for the benefit of his father and other skeptical persons that I did know how to hold a baby . He also showed his appreciation of the beautiful by chewing the toes of both blue shoes that I brought him almost before we had them laced up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence it was manifest that his education had not received much systematic attention . Alice admitted that she had intended to start him on amo the day he sat for his first real photograph ? at three months ? but that it had somehow taken about all her spare time and strength to teach him to go to sleep without being rockt , and to get his short clothes ' made . It could not well be denied that her success in those two directions , however , repaid her endeavors . The way Richard has always gone to sleep is conceded even by the grandmother generation a triumph for the New Idea in baby training . And the first time we took him abroad in his short clothes , with blue ribbons on his little cap , and blue forget-me-nots embroidered on his carriage pillow , he just was adorable ? if he had n't chewed his blue shoes . However , I did what I could to repair the damage to those , and started in at once upon a systematic classical education . Nobody denied that when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own family we all agreed that his pronounced superiority to most children of nine months was due to nothing else than his envelopment in a purely classical atmosphere . Upon such mental pabulum and malted milk he throve apace , and even for purposes of discipline ( not " mental " ) we found Latin superior to all else . His most vicious howls ( he has a temper ) could be cut short by sternly pointing a finger at him and impressively ejaculating , " Tate , " ( or , in times of great urgency , " Os opprime " ) , when no amount of tossing and cuddling and endearment had the slightest effect . At the sound of the noble speech of Cicero he gasped , stared ? and held his peace . And do n't tell me that he did n't understand what it meant . In the ten months that elapsed before Richard and I met again great additional possibilities for culture had developt in him . He had hair , for one thing . Curls . In my wildest dreams I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , incidentally , he could walk , and , in a fashion of his own , talk . A considerable part of his vocabulary seemed to me more closely allied to Sanskrit than to any other language I have studied , but as persons who had enjoyed his society uninterruptedly , but were not Sanskrit scholars , seemed to understand his dialect perfectly , I conclude that my philologic deductions upon that point were inaccurate . According to the record of his Baby Book , his first linguistic achievement was " cooky , " both word and practical incentive to its acquisition being supplied by a doting neighbor , called by him " kinky . " And he did n't speak a word of Latin , altho his grandfather had given him a beautiful new edition of Caesar 's Gallic War for Christmas , and I had accompanied it by a most diminutive horse , instratus frenatusque , which to this day he calls by no other name than " my equus Caesaris . " Alice said that the reason she had let him live to the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be such a happiness to me to teach him his first Latin word . But he refused to learn the first Latin word . All that blessed summer I labored with him and amo , amos , amat ; I heard him acquire " kitty , " and " cake , " and " all gone , " and " out-doors , " and " auntie , " and a lot of other perfectly banal and tiresome vocables that anybody 's baby could utter , but when after every conceivable form of cajolery and bribery I would say in my most compelling accents , " Now , Richard , say amo for auntie , " he would only regard me with a simply diabolic grin , and drawl , " Coo-ookee . " But one late September day I was reading by the fire , giving little attention ( for once ! ) to the occupations of my nephew , as they seemed to be temporarily harmless . I did have a dim consciousness of hearing " amo " in his chatter , but I still did not realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt a baby hand pulling my dress and pinching my arm while the cherub cooed , " Amo ? amo ? attie ? amo , " quite as if he had never cared for " coo-ookees " in all his twenty-.one months of life . And two nights later , as he was lifted up for his good-bye kiss before I started for my train , just as our lips parted , he reached out his little hand to pat my cheek , and , with a look of love unutterable , murmured , " Amo . " I cried all the way to Chicago . For all the sleep I got that night I might as well not have enriched the soulless Pullman Company with two of my hard-earned dollars . I wept again a few days later when Alice 's first letter told me that towards dark on the day after I had gone she found Richard alone in the firelit parlor , standing pensively by the piano , where I had been used to play for him at that hour , saying sadly over and over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We realized then that he had christened me anew , and that to his infant comprehension my attempt to start him upon the road to classical scholarship had been only an effort to teach him my own name . I have been " Auntie Amo " ever since , and this very summer he was ready to thrash a big boy who told him that that was not my name . I may say here what perhaps I should have said before , that the fact that the few illustrations already given and yet to be given of Richard 's intellectual development are not all , at first glance , related to Latin or Greek , is a matter of design with me , and offered in proof of what I believe to be a great truth ; i. e. , that the alleged narrowness of the classical curriculum is in reality but a fiction of the unlearned , and that Richard 's brilliant reasoning , his speculations upon questions of morals and ethics , and likewise his ability to drive a nail ( phenomenal for a four-year-old , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of his early education , By the third summer of our acquaintance he had become a fluent conversationalist ( still is ; Alice says that the only time she ever gets anything done is when he is asleep , and one day lately when I ventured to interject a remark or two to his mother , he said plaintively , " You ' sturb me , Auntie Amo , ' cause you wo n't let me talk " ) , and learning dead languages was just fun for him . To hear him say , " Mihi nomen is parv'lo wicardo , " and " Da mi basia mille , " or greet his adored " gwan ' papa " with , " Quid agis , ' cissime wewum ? " was to make one thrill with pride at relationship with him . And when Mr. and Mrs. Principal of the High School brought their little daughter one evening to call , and Richard met the latter with , " Here , Helen , I 'll let you p'ay wiv my equus -- cum-carro , " the impression upon those pedagogical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget . He recited thus the component parts of his little red wagon : " Ve tongue is a temo , ve wheels are rotae , an ' ve whole wagon is a carrus " ; and naturally I thought this a pretty good " stunt " to exhibit to admiring visitors . But one night he " struck . " We were entertaining callers on the porch , and they pined ? or said so ? for an exhibition of his accomplishments : but Richard would not . He was , for the time being " a horsie , and horsies ca n't talk . " While persuasion was still being tried , a passing horse whinnied , and Richard turned to me with the triumphant air of one whom Providence has indicated . " Vere , Auntie Amo , do n't you understand ? Horsies say huh-huh-huh ' ; vey do n't say Latin . "  | And I think it was only the next morning that all my hopes that at least , if fate had willed that I could not make him a suffraget , I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a fearful set-back when he remarked to me in tones of scorn for the feminine which no type can repro-duce , " Auntie Amo , mans do n't call a horsie an equus . " One day last summer he was invited to spend the day in the country at a home containing a recent high school graduate , supposedly acquainted with the Latin tongue , and we dismist him with a parting injunction to " tell Nettie that he was going to be a bonus puer . " He returned at nightfall , joyous , rather soiled , and less disposed to speak of his own conduct than of the " frashin ' ' chine " he had seen in action . But finally we pinned him down . " Richard , were you a bonus puer ? " " Why , no , " he responded with unction . " I could n't be , ' cause Nettie did n't know what vat standed for . " The first time he attended Sunday school he requested the return of his penny from the collection , and met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls about God with , " Wes , but pennies buy ice-cream cones , too . " I ought to take time to tell , with illustrations , how since his third summer he has reveled in sesquipedalian words , how Ciceronian is his profanity ( " My Auntie Amo says , " we heard him telling two small neighbors , " vat when you feel like you wanted to say rats ' ? why ? you must say , Mehercule ' ! " ) how he showed his legal mind by inquiring how they can take pictures of Santa Claus if nobody ever sees him , how he handles all the lingo of the automobilist with a fluency that fills me with awe ( I do n't know a cylinder from a spark-plug ; there is a difference , is n't there ? ) , et cetera , et cetera , but what 's the use ? Already I can see this coming back with a note from the editor , " Ca n't you cut it down to two thousand words ? " ( It is n't as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few more evidences of Richard 's wide range of observation and intelligence as developt by our system I simply must recite . At the age of two and a half it was his habit to hold out his arms to me enticingly , and coo in honeyed tones , " Auntie Amo , come cwose to me . " And when Auntie Amo came , he nearly pulled the hair out of her head and doubled up with mirth the while . You may not believe it , but one day I rebelled . I said : " No , I 'm not coming , for you always pull my hair . " " Oh ! " quoth he , soothingly , " I 'll buy you anuvver hair , Auntie Amo , if I pull iss hair off . " I submit to any unprejudiced person that nothing but classical training could have produced in a two-year-old such keenness of perception that he should have already discovered the nature of the most efficacious brand of twentieth century hair-restorer . We had not tried ? yet ? to imbue Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seems to have caught the spirit . He has been very desirous to go to " really school " to " gwan ' papa , " and even offered two pennies to " pay his tuition in his advance , " but after about two days of " really " instruction he wearied of it , and wished to discontinue the pursuit of learning , Alice said : " But if you are going to be a Rhodes scholar , or a doctor like papa , or an engineer , or any of the things you want to be when you grow up , you must study hard now , and recite to grandpapa . " " Well , mamma , " he said , " I 've decided not to be any of vose things . When I get big I 'm dus ' going to keep house , an ' you do n't have to know anyfing to do vat .

So here it is , and it is two-fold : Every small child needs the training of an unorthodox , suffraget bachelor maid , and , conversely , every bachelor maid needs the training of a small child , because -- good heavens ! ( or perhaps more fittingly , edepol ! ) I must go down and look after the morals of Richard . I have just heard him on the back porch inquiring , " Lillie , has the ice-wagon came yet ?
