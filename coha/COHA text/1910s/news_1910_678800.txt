txt TAXICAB SERVICE . Complains of Company 's Failure to Fill Advance Orders . May I echo the bitter cry of your correspondent of Eleventh Street as to the taxicab service vouchsafed to us of that neighborhood ? Twice in succession recently have advance orders of mine been accepted , and no taxicab been forthcoming . On the first occasion my complaint was met with unintelligible " explanations " ; on the second it was met with the bland assurance that an advance order . even when specifically accepted , would assure to me a taxicab only if one happened to be disengaged when the hour named arrived . Of course , the taxicab company can be sued for not filling an accepted advance order , but equally , of course . It knows that only trifling financial damage could be proved in the cash of a missed dinner or theatre engagement . And for neither its promise nor the serious inconvenience of its patrons does the company care one jot .                 @ @ @ @
