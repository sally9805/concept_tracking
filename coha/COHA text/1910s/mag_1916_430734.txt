 | WHATEVER may happen in Europe after the war , this much is certain : America 's relation to the old world will not be what it was ; she will have to face revolutionary changes in her international relationships . Her departures in foreign policy will probably have to be more radical than any which she has made since this country became an independent state . That means that the old ideas can no longer altogether serve . Overnight , as it were , American public opinion will be brought face to face with very new conditions , and , consequently , the need of revising old conceptions . The circumstances of American politics , especially the politics of a presidential campaign , fortify the tendency to hold by old traditions , the slogans of the fathers . A novel idea is always likely to be misunderstood by the mass of occupied and busy folk ; and that misunderstanding makes it easier for those who have any political interest in discrediting its sponsors to misrepresent it . There is hardly any departure that has been suggested ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a differentiation of neutrality as a sanction for international agreement , a defense of the open door , a decisive foreign policy of any kind ? which is not , from the point of view of the politician , exposed to these risks . Both parties fear them and prefer to live from hand to mouth so far as foreign policy is concerned . Sufficient unto the day are the hostages offered to the enemy . The safe course is to avoid any radical dealing with a foreign problem , treat symptoms as they arise , and stand by the old methods , the old international law ,  | the old test of neutrality , the old freedom from entangling alliances . It is true that one fact in connection with the American attitude towards foreign affairs would seem to belie this . In no country in the world so much as in this , is the general public so ready to approve the abstract theory of complete internationalism . Certainly in no European country ? except perhaps in the little states ? could ambitious schemes of world order receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful , even , whether less ambitious schemes like that suggested in the League to Enforce Peace could in any European country receive the public approval of persons corresponding in weight and influence to those whose names appear in the membership of the American league . Yet this apparent radicalism in foreign politics , this ready support of wholesale internationalism , is negated by an extreme conservatism when it comes to details , to some definite step to be taken by the United States towards internationalism . The same American who is ready to pledge his country 's support to a plan like that predicated in the League to Enforce Peace , ready to guarantee all countries of the world against aggression ( at least , to the extent of compelling their aggressor to submit his case to examination ) , is horrified at the suggestion that after the war , assuming the league has not by that time materialized , America should become one of the guarantors of one country , Belgium , as a means of facilitating the settlement . At such a suggestion , the American member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps leagues advocating still more far-reaching plans of world government , will quote George Washington on the dangers of entangling alliances . It hardly seems to be realized that any plan of international order involves for its members entangling alliances of a very far-reaching kind . It is , however , obvious that the approach to a world league will most probably have to be by steps ; that a result of that  | kind is not likely to be achieved completely at one jump ; that some states will find one reason or another for standing out against it , and that unless their objection is met by persistent pressure on the part of the others , it can never materialize . And that persistence means a period of alliances which almost certainly will not at first embrace the whole world . A refusal to make any such adjustment , or to take the necessary risks unless at one stroke the whole object is immediately obtained , is poor preparation for the larger responsibilities . A somewhat similar contradiction is revealed in the relations with Germany . This country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to which side wins . To speak in terms of reality , it would regard German victory as a disaster . Nor can it be said that this feeling has no political influence so far as the government 's conduct towards the belligerents is concerned . If this country were really neutral , it would compel , by pressure that it can perfectly well exercise , English observance of the Declaration of London , which would be an immense help to the German cause . In refusing to give that help , the United States is , in the view of the present writer , absolutely right . In basing that refusal , however , upon pretense of neutrality , America is far from right ; she is paralyzing her capacity not only to defend her own rights and interests but possibly to play any useful part in world organization of the future . I wish to show why this is the case . Complex as is the problem of sea law in its details , its outstanding dilemma , and the alternative it represents , can be very simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible without co-operation between nations , without strong international organization . To create sufficient motive to make such an organization possible or desirable , or one subserving the permanent interest of its members , " neutrality " in great international disputes must disappear : no real protection either of sea right or vital neutral interest  | is possible until this doctrine is abolished . Or , to put it more briefly , without internationalization there can be no protection of " neutral " rights ; with internationalization there can be no neutrality . We have been told during the present controversy that America would , by showing that she is ready to fight " at the drop of the hat " on the violation of neutral rights , at least demonstrate to combatants that such violation involves risks , and would so put her potential military power behind the observance of the law . But it seems to be overlooked in most of the discussions of this subject , that if she couples with that attitude adherence to the traditional attitude of neutrality , couples , that is , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combatants , whatever the causes that have brought them to war , she may protect the law of neutral rights , but she has made it for lesser nations at least a positive danger ; and the more those rights expand , the more dangerous would they become to them . American action would in its belligerency for neutral rights coupled with unconcern as to the causes which turn neutrals into combatants , have the effect of protecting the temporary rights of war time at the cost of the permanent rights to national existence . To illustrate this clearly , assume that America has extended her readiness to fight for her own neutral rights to include the neutral rights of others ; and has coupled this with classical " neutrality " to combatants whoever they may be . And for the sake of illustration , assume that Germany 's invasion of Belgium had taken place only a month or so after the war began ( the Germans having tried first to reach Paris through the eastern fortifications of France ) . Assume that during that month America had associated herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined by the Declaration of London . In that case she would strenuously have resisted , say , the seizure by Germany of a Belgian ship carrying food or cotton to Antwerp for possible shipment to  | France ; or the stoppage of a Belgian ship for the purpose of removing its French passengers . But from the moment that Germans invade Belgium and seize the whole country and its ports , America has not a word to say . Neutrality prevents it . The Germans then are perfectly entitled under international law to confiscate all Belgian ships and imprison or execute their crews , and neutrality would forbid America or any other neutral from supporting Belgium . America or any league of neutrals would take action to protect Belgian cargoes from seizure or to protect Belgian mail ? but is quite indifferent if Belgium itself is reduced to ashes and its neutrality destroyed ! It would then , on behalf of neutrality , be obliged to see that Belgian resistance to Germany was in no way assisted ! Take another illustration . England would break the law and expose herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to Rotterdam , which she can not blockade ; but we have not a word to say under the existing law of neutrality if England declares war on Holland without any cause whatever and so makes Rotterdam an " enemy " port . Under present conceptions of neutrality , the law says to the belligerent : " The nations will compel you to respect the rights of neutrals except the neutrals ' right to existence , which the law permits you to violate with impunity . You must respect this individual 's rights unless you destroy him altogether ; and then you will be exonerated . " Thus does existing international law protect the vital interest of nations . What nation in its senses would take any risk or assume any real obligation on behalf of it ? It would be assuming serious obligations for a protection which ceased immediately it became most needed . The analogy in municipal law would be this : If Smith and Brown in their " shooting match " in High Street should so block the sidewalk as to compel Robinson to walk round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the support of Robinson in his right to walk to his office on just  | that sidewalk ; and the community would pay its taxes and support its jails and police to vindicate such right . But if Robinson , desiring nothing better than to be left alone , is deliberately attacked by Smith or Jones and killed ? the law has nothing to say . The community is " strictly neutral " and will on no account come to Robinson 's support . Who would be safe in such a community ? And who would care twopence whether the law were supported or not ? But the incompatibility of neutrality as we now know it with anything resembling the organization of a society is shown in another way . America at present bases her claims upon a law which the precedent and practice of nations has established . But if she washes her hands of all international acts save those against her citizens , there may grow up , as the result of a large number of acts against nations not in a position to resent them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of its disregard of neutral rights that in the future the " general practice " will constitute no real protection . If , as the result of the immunity which has followed acts like the violation of Belgium , there grows up the impression that a belligerent in order to be safe has merely to violate such rights one at a time , and there also grows up the impression that a hard-pressed combatant may commit acts such as the sinking of the Lusitania and escape penalty because his rival is also violating the law and because no one nation is likely to possess the overpowering force to deal with both , national rights and international law must necessarily continue to be in practice unobserved . The principle involved is worth clarification because the whole character of America 's action , of her future international policy , of her influence in international affairs , the final outcome of the step she is about to take , will depend upon the decision of her general opinion as to which of the two contrary methods of action she will most consistently support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his rights only by virtue of a course of action towards  | others the exact contrary of that which America in her relations with other states has heretofore adopted and is still adopting . The law within the state is worth the individual 's support because his own security is bound up in it . He contributes to its cost because the community will enforce it for his protection . Security for the individual is achieved only by making an aggression upon his rights under the law equivalent to an aggression upon the rights of all . A community which remained " neutral " when one of its members was the victim of such aggression would have surrendered its law and disintegrated into chaos , would be one in which no member could be secure for long . But that is the prevailing American conception of the community of nations . It is indeed the universal conception of international relationship . A violation of the general rule or law is not considered as an aggression against those who have subscribed to it . This is America 's position to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , until an American citizen suffers . Until America abandons this principle and stands not only for her own particular right but for the observance of the rule under which the right is claimed , that rule will never be strong enough to protect her particular right . The result that we might expect from such a state of things is revealed in the whole history of the fight for neutral rights : it is a history of failure . Let us examine its meaning a little more in detail . If the right of commerce to continue in war as in peace , the historical American conception of " freedom of the sea , " is to work with anything like equality of treatment for both belligerents , it will involve not alone " immunity of private property at sea in war time " as heretofore understood by American and European lawyers ? immunity , that is , qualified by contraband and blockade ? but the virtual disappearance of commercial blockade and contraband . Now , when we remember that the much more limited regu-  | lation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , that the British Orders in Council do not in the opinion even of some British lawyers so much as adhere to the code of the Declaration of Paris , that they do not observe , in the view of many , even the principles for which America fought in the war of 1812 , - what hope is there for the observance of an infinitely more radical regulation unless it is compelled by strong international combination ? While it is altogether likely that England might , at the threat of embargo on American munitions , accept the Declaration of London as a law , it is quite doubtful whether she would accept the abolition of commercial blockade and contraband , thus permitting the purchase of war material by her enemy . Rather than that she would probably trust to the resources of her own empire and the strength of her sea power to enforce her own policy . England has before had to face a league of armed neutrals ( in which conflict the neutrals got hopelessly the worst of it ) ; and it is as certain as anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present neutrals to secure from England the abolition of commercial blockade and contraband without any counterbalance in the way of guarantee for her own military safety would be met by England 's naval force . And to fight England would mean German victory , with no real assurance that this would be equivalent to a better sea law in the future ; would involve , that is , risks to neutrals altogether out of proportion to any advantage gained by them . They would be fighting for a position of greater national danger : they would be putting vital interests in jeopardy for much less vital ones . And this England knows , and the knowledge gives her the assurance that she will be secure from neutral interference . Indeed , each side is protected from that interference by the illegality of the other . How much this is the case becomes apparent when we examine certain suggestions that have been made for enabling  | America to stand for neutral rights in this war . In his interesting book , " The Economic Aspects of the War , " Professor Clapp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have learned that some action is necessary in order to safeguard our nation 's rights . In two strong notes of protest to Great Britain , we stated her violations of our rights . She prevents us from shipping non-contraband to Germany and receiving any goods from Germany at all , in defiance of our right to enjoy such trade via neutral countries even if Britain were to establish that her blockade of German ports is effective . Britain has seriously deranged our trade with the little neutral nations of Europe upon the suspicion that some of the trade may be going through to Germany . We have seen in great detail how deeply these violations of our rights affect our material interests , how little submission to them would accord with our history or our rank as a leading neutral , and how dangerous is such submission for our future welfare . In every note that Germany has written she has emphasized that the submarine campaign is a retaliation for the unlawful British measures in holding up food and raw materials for Germany . When both belligerents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other as justification , the pressure of neutrals must be applied to the one which refuses to join in a return to law and order . Our problem is to compel that joint acceptance of a compromise which we proposed in our note to the belligerents in February . . . . Germany is ready for acceptance ; the pressure must be applied to England . He proposes to enforce American rights by a method which he justifies from the clause in the 1907 Hague Convention which allows a change of rules as to the export of munitions during a war " in case where experience shows the necessity for such action in order to safeguard a nation 's rights . " He concludes as follows : With the attainment of this end ? the acceptance of the Declaration of London and its contraband list by England and Germany and the return by Germany to lawful use of her war vessels ? both belligerents return to the limits of law . Neutral trade rights are recovered and established for all time . Our excuse for stopping the export of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oversea world , barred to Germany , England enjoys a great advantage from her sea  | power , the only advantage which she can be allowed to enjoy without destroying the rights of those who have had no part in making or prosecuting this war . Why is this proposal outside the bounds of practical politics ? Why will it never be adopted ? Not because it is impracticable , but because the American people have decided it to be undesirable . They realize that an action designed to give protection to certain American interests now , would do so at the sacrifice of immeasurably greater American interests later if that action aided Germany 's victory . The action recommended by Professor Clapp will never be taken because this country does not desire the victory of Germany and believes that its interest in helping to prevent that is greater ? immeasurably greater ? than the interests injured by England 's alleged lawlessness . Professor Clapp asks in his book : " Is it the business of a neutral to worry which side wins the war ? " Well , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconcerned if Germany should win this war ? Our own military preparations give the lie to it . Do we not close our eyes to quite patent facts , facts which are of the essence of the problem , when we pretend otherwise , when we pretend that we are not concerned with the peace conditions left by the war ? This touches the crux of the whole problem . We are maintaining a legal fiction if we pretend that nations outside the actual military conflict have no interest in the outcome when it may have originated in the violation of principles essential to the safety of all nations . The object of whatever America does is to give security to American citizens and their rights ; but to ignore inexcusable aggression is to place them in the very greatest jeopardy . Though nations may not be directly or immediately involved , they can no more be indifferent to the success of menacing military aggression than the individuals of any community could remain indifferent to the murder of one by another of  | their number . If they did remain indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermining their own security ; none of them would or could be safe . They would be on the way to an anarchy that would threaten all . Any system really establishing security would involve the abandonment of " neutrality " in murders . Neutrality , when a law vital to society is violated , is incompatible with the establishment of any society . There is the fundamental defect of our present method of trying to make international law reality . In the attempt to attach to itself a large body of interests , it ignores the supreme interest : the right to existence . But there are other things which existing conceptions of neutrality ignore . We are misled by our terms . " The right of commerce to continue in war very much as in peace " is not neutrality except as a legal fiction . The furnishing of ammunition is entirely equivalent in modern war to the furnishing of soldiers . More and more will wars become wars of industry , and to proceed on the assumption that the extent and destination of our assistance should be determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put nations in the position of the old Swiss mercenaries : ready to give victory to the side that will pay best , or to allow the thing to be determined by geographical accident . Many Germans claim that America , by deliberate choice in refusing to place an embargo on the export of munitions , has not only intervened but by its immense national resources is largely determining the issue of this war . Many Germans claim that it would have been over before this but for the immense aid furnished by the material resources of America to the Allies . Now , that possibly may be true . In any case , the German feeling will grow if the blockade of Germany becomes , as the Allies seem to hope it may , the most effective weapon of her enemies . In any case , the American decision by which alone that weapon is used effectively against Germany is deliberate because the real reason why suggestions  | like that of Professor Clapp have not been adopted is that national feeling in America judges the German cause to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole point ? the value of that decision as a deterrent of future aggression is altogether lost by reason of the diplomatic fiction which , in keeping with the old doctrine of neutrality , the American government is obliged to maintain , and by reason of the fact that the popular decision was not the result of a predetermined and previously announced policy . The diplomatic position of the American government ? the attitude that it takes towards Germany is : " We are entirely neutral and would put not the slightest obstacle in the way of our citizens supplying you with munitions and material if you could come and fetch the cargoes . After this war , therefore , the Germans will say ? and they will say it on the strength of the position now maintained by the American government : " If we could have commanded the sea , we could have transferred the economic alliance of America from our enemies to ourselves . The important thing , therefore , is not to worry about respecting international obligations like the Belgian treaty but to command the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America are at your disposal whether your cause be good or bad , aggressive or defensive . We have the assurance of the American government on that point . " And any other prospective belligerent , as Japan , say , in a war of conquest waged against China , will argue in the same way . So that the vast national resources of America will act as a silent pressure on the side , not of the good behavior of nations and respect of treaty right , but on the side of naval rivalry irrespective of right or treaty obligation . It has indeed been urged that it would always be open to America to refuse to supply a country in the position of Germany even if it did command the sea , but so long as the prospective combatants do not know beforehand what in Amer-  | ica 's view will constitute good or bad behavior , what she will regard as aggressive and menacing , and what defensive , they will always assume that the chances are on the side of their being able to buy the munitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's policy always looks defensive and defensible to itself . No people is able to take a very accurate view of foreign opinion of its own conduct . Seventy million Germans , including men of great intellectual equipment , are still marvelling why it is that the world can not see that they are fighting a purely defensive war forced upon them by the unprovoked aggression of jealous and truculent neighbors . Unless there is some definite and unmistakable criterion of what constitutes an unjustifiable war , they will always count upon being able , once they command the sea , to command also that economic alliance of neutrals which at present goes with it . Unless prospective belligerents know that war under such and such conditions will definitely close neutral ports to them , the neutral resources of the world will be a prize offered to predominant naval power , a premium upon naval rivalry , instead of being used to encourage the observance of certain rules and principles essential to the protection and ultimate safety of neutral rights and the security of all nations . Suppose that twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great interest which would tend to make its observance obviously to the interests of the nations , had said that any nation proceeding to hostilities against another without first having submitted its difference at least to inquiry and with such and such delay , would be unable to secure American supplies , munitions , or credit for the purposes of war , whether it obtained command of the sea or not . If we could imagine such a policy to have been adopted even by the United States alone , every prospective belligerent would have desired to observe the rule and to put itself right with America by so doing , whether it expected to command the sea or not . If it possessed sea control it would have  | wished to take advantage of that command to the full , and secure the economic allegiance of America to its cause ; if it did not command the sea , it would equally have desired to observe the rule in order to deprive its enemy of most of the advantages of such command : in other words , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , place an embargo on the export of supplies and munitions . Thus , with such a policy in effect , there would be for all belligerents ? prospective commanders of the sea or not ? a strong motive to submit their case to inquiry and delay , a behavior which would prevent most wars and give international organization and machinery a chance . There would be set up a strong tendency to international arrangement , which would have behind it the push of a great material advantage , America 's economic alliance or its refusal to the enemy . Respect for the rights of others , and for some means of determining those rights , would for the first time in history be a definite and visible military asset . America 's enormous resources would then be acting as a silent and potential power for peace . Such an arrangement does not compel American ? or any other ? opinion to decide on the merits of a complex international quarrel . Which is offense and which is aggression would be settled by a simple test ? adherence to a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society of nations , without which all laws , however cunningly devised , all schemes for the protection of neutrals , must fail . If general , the arrangement would of course abolish absolute neutrality in war . Problems of blockade and contraband would be solved by disappearing . If no nation would export to the recalcitrant member , questions of blockade could not well arise ; if no goods could go to him because no nation would sell them , it would not greatly matter what the contraband list was . Sea law would then be the police law of organized society . The nations of the world would have surrendered their " neutral " right of trade in war in exchange for a definite organiza-  | tion of the world which would give protection to a right much more important , and would diminish the risk of war , and the damage which in any case war now entails upon them . Undoubtedly America was and still is quite able to make this departure from old conceptions of neutrality , whether supported immediately by other nations or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy before : the Monroe Doctrine was one . It has been said that if America had announced this policy at either of the Hague Conferences , it would have meant war . By whom ? It would have been to no one nation 's interest to declare war , even if the object could be achieved , which it could not . Short of absolute conquest and administration , a nation can not be compelled to lend its money or sell its goods . America would , after all , only be exercising rights which are clearly secured to nations under existing international law : the right of a nation to keep its wealth to itself if it wants to . Any day we may read that Holland or Switzerland announces an embargo upon this or that article and no combatant challenges its right so to act . Indeed the principle of impartiality even is observed in the above suggestion . America extends a right of access to her ports on equal terms to both combatants , the terms being submission of their cause to inquiry , which she exacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of her travellers at sea , depend upon a measure of international order which can not otherwise even be begun . If Switzerland , or Sweden , or Holland , in this present situation can with impunity put embargoes upon their exports , assuredly America could on hers . The more the details of America 's position in such a situation and the position of any nation which would challenge it ? the proportions of advantage gained and risk assumed ? are examined , the more preposterous does the idea of any combination against America on such a score become . America obviously would be acting on behalf of a general interest ? the interest of all against aggression ; her new doctrine would be in keeping  | with the tendency of the time . She would be undisturbed in her assertion of this differential neutrality ? incidentally , by the way , the very form of neutrality which Grotius declared to be the right one , the only possible one in a civilized world . And what is the alternative policy ? An advocate of " the largest navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to fight at the drop of the hat ' and your rights will be respected . " Well , Holland two hundred and fifty and America a hundred years ago , if they did not fight " at the drop of the hat , " fought for just these rights . They have not secured them . And , again , when Americans speak of fighting over these things , fight whom ? Germany ? and make the British Orders in Council the basis of American rights at sea ? Britain ? either now or after war ? and so make the work of western democracies futile by putting them at Germany 's mercy ? Fight both ? Would America long retain much affection for neutral rights if she had to meet belligerents of such dimensions ? Or just leave things where they are and go on proclaiming to Germany ? or anyone else ? that if in the next war she can command the sea , she can for the purpose of her war call upon America 's national resources to any extent she pleases ? Well , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea ; and with immense increase of sea force , does anyone suppose that the freedom and safety of the sea would be brighter than it has been in the past ? Whenever the anarchy of international relationships forces us to take a step nearer to the creation of a real society , we are compelled to revise our conceptions of such things as " sovereignty " and " independence . " A " society " made up of " sovereign and independent " units is a contradiction in terms . Closely related to sovereignty and independence is neutrality . And old conceptions of neutrality , also , if we are ever to move appreciably towards the organization of a society of nations , must undergo the necessary adaptation .
