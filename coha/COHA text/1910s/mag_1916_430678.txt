Nothing under the sun is quite new . The combination of wit , humor , satire , and erudition of an odd and unexpected sort , which characterizes that form of journalistic literature technically known as the " colyum , " is commonly regarded as something distinctly modern . Its sprightly manner seems instinct with the spirit of this unusually present and up-to-date age of ours . But some forty-five years ago a professor of mathematics in London , Augustus De Morgan , was doing precisely , the same sort of thing in " The Atheneum , " under the title , " A Budget of Paradoxes , " that F. P. A. , B. L. T. , and a few others are doing now in our metropolitan newspapers . Indeed , the modern exponents of this gentle art of " colyuming " might do much worse than to study De Morgan for fine points of technique . In the deftness and sureness of his characterizations ; in the precision , acuity , and yet unfailing good humor of his satire ; and in the nimble wit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been surpassed . Before his death , De Morgan had started upon the pleasant labor of collecting and completing the " Athenmum " papers , both by editing and by considerable additions of actually new material . He did not live to complete it , however . The first edition of the " Budget , " which appeared in 1872 , was edited by Mrs. De Morgan . In her preface she made many apologies for the imperfections of the work in comparison with what it would have been could it have been finished by Professor De Morgan himself . Without doubt the book did fall short of what it would have been under entirely favorable circumstances , but in spite of all this it was immediately successful in point of sales . It was apparently never reprinted after the first edition , and consequently soon became out of print . Second-hand copies have become increasingly rare as time has gone on , until in recent years it has become quite impossible to obtain the book unless one was prepared to pay a distinctly long price . This circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , has led Professor David Eugene Smith , a distinguished student of the history of mathematics , to edit , and the Open Court Company to publish , a second edition . By the fact alone of doing this thing , the editor and publishers have put the world of scholarship , in the very broadest sense of that term , greatly in their debt . Concerning the manner in which the re-editing of this classic has been done , the case is not quite so clear ; but on that matter comment will be reserved until a later point in this review . Let us first of all be quite sure that everyone is clear as to just what the " Budget of Paradoxes " is , what it has for an object , and the means taken to attain that object . Then we may proceed to discuss it with greater freedom . To the reviewer it seems odd that it should be necessary to explain what the " Budget " is : his own familiarity with the book , which covers in point of time the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to induce much the same sort of feeling in regard to explaining what the book is about , as one would have if he were to start to explain to grown-up persons what the Bible , or Shakespeare , or Dickens , was about . In other words , it seems difficult to conceive that anyone can have reached even moderately adult life without having read at least some portion of the " Budget of Paradoxes . " But so great is our confusion of thought regarding the fundamentals of an education , that one must conclude that even within THE DIAL family there may be those for whom the pleasure of the elder De Morgan 's acquaintance is still anticipatory . For such no better statement of the purpose of the " Budget " can be made than De Morgan 's own . The book opens with the following words : " If I had before me a fly and an elephant , having never seen more than one such magnitude of either kind ; and if the fly were to endeavor to persuade me that he was larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficulty . The apparently little creature might use such arguments about the effect of distance , and might appeal to such laws of sight and hearing as I , if unlearned in those things , might be unable wholly to reject . But if there were a thousand flies , all buzzing , to appearance , about the great creature ; and , to a fly , declaring , each one for himself , that he was bigger than the quadruped ; and all giving different and frequently contradictory reasons ; and each one despising and opposing the reasons of the others ? I should feel quite at my ease . I should certainly say , My little friends , the ease of each one of you is destroyed by the rest . I intend to show flies in the swarm , with a few larger animals , for reasons to be given . . . " During the last two centuries and a half , physical knowledge has been gradually made to rest upon a basis which it had not before . It has  | become mathematical . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better or worse to the pure thought , but whether it accords with observed phenomena in those consequences which can be shown necessarily to follow from it , if it be true . Even in those sciences which are not yet under the dominion of mathematics , and perhaps never will be , a working copy of the mathematical process has been made . This is not known to the followers of those sciences who are not themselves mathematicians and who very often exalt their horns against the mathematics in consequence . They might as well be squaring the circle , for any sense they show in this particular . " A great many individuals , ever since the rise of the mathematical method , have , each for himself , attacked its direct and indirect consequences . I shall not here stop to point out how the very accuracy of exact science gives better aim than the preceding stage of things could give . I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer , and his system a paradox . I use the word in the old sense : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either in subject-matter , method , or conclusion . " Many of the things brought forward would now be called crotchets , which is the nearest word we have to old paradox . But there is this difference , that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it ; which was not the necessary sense of paradox . Thus in the sixteenth century many spoke of the earth 's motion as the paradox of Copernicus , who held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem , and some , I think , who even inclined towards it . In the seventeenth century , the depravation of meaning took place , in England at least . Phillips says paradox is a thing which seemeth strange ' ? here is the old meaning : after a colon he proceeds ? and absurd , and is contrary to common opinion , ' which is an addition due to his own time . " It might appear from this that the " Budget " was confined to the discussion of strictly scientific matters . Such a conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Budget " as a receptacle for his opinions de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis . Matters literary , social , political , pedagogical , editorial , historical , financial , classical , philosophical , and generally otherwise , all fell within his purview as naturally and easily as did things scientific . In fact , the subjectmatter of the " Budget " may be characterized in Mr. Venus 's conveniently embracing terminology as " human warious . " A considerable part of the book is devoted to those hardy perennial paradoxers who square the circle , or , put in another way , who convince themselves and endeavor to convince others that they have discovered not only that the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is exactly commensurable , but also just precisely what that measured ratio is . With the quadrating gentry De Morgan has unmeasured fun . The most persistent and entertaining of the lot was Mr. James Smith , of Liverpool . Of him the author says : " When my work appeared in numbers , I had not anything like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world in the points in which he is superior . He is beyond a doubt the ablest head at unreasoning , and the greatest hand at writing it , of all who have tried in our day to attach their names to an error . Common cyclometers sink into puny orthodoxy by his side . " The behavior of this singular character induces me to pay him the compliment which Achilles paid Hector , to drag him around the walls again and again . . . He will come out of my hands in the position he ought to hold , the Supreme Pontiff of cyclometers , the vicegerent of St. Vitus upon earth , the Mamamouchi of burlesque on inference . " This intention was carried out , fully and adequately . As is readily to be inferred from De Morgan 's definition of a paradoxer , already quoted , he distinguished many different species and varieties of the genus . Not all received the same sort of treatment as Mr. Smith . De Morgan considered that he himself belonged in the group which he classified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , in private life , and in matters which concern themselves , take their own course , and suit their own notions , no matter what other people may think of them . These men will put things to uses they were never intended for , to the great distress and disgust of their gregarious friends . I am one of the class . " He goes on to tell the following anecdote of another rational paradoxer , Dr. Isaac Milner , sometime President of Queen 's College , Cam-bridge : " He wanted a seat suited to his shape , and he defied opinion to a fearful point . He spread a thick block of putty over a wooden chair and sat in it until it had taken a ceroplast copy of the proper seat . This he gave to a carpenter to be imitated in wood . One of the few now living who knew him ? my friend , General Perronet Thompson ? answers for the wood , which was shown him by Milner himself ; but he does not vouch for the material being putty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Frend also remembered it . Perhaps the Doctor took off his great seal in green wax , like the Crown ; but some soft material he certainly adopted ; and very comfortable he found the wooden copy . " The temptation to go on quoting from this thoroughly delightful book is great , but must be resisted . To anyone who is familiar with the " Budget of Paradoxes , " and at the same time has some understanding of the principles  | of heredity , there is no uncertainty as to an important , if not indeed the chief , reason for the literary ability and charm of William De Morgan . It is doubtful if there is anywhere a more conspicuous and precise example of the inheritance of literary ability than in this notable son of a notable father . Every lover of the son 's novels should put the father 's " Budget " next them on the shelves , for if he likes one he is sure to like the other . Indeed , they are in some measure supplementary . For in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of the story , and so be enticed to go on and on reading . The " Budget " has no plot , and if taken in too large doses might give one a severe case of mental indigestion . It is to be picked up and dropped into at random , and , after a choice morsel has been extracted , put back upon the shelf until again one wants a little nip of that exclusive brand of intellectual stimulant provided by the De Morgan family . Coming now to the matter of the editing of this present reprint of the " Budget , " the reviewer finds his opinion somewhat at variance with that of the editor as regards the general plan , and widely so as regards the manner in which the plan has been executed . With such part of the editorial scheme as allowed no textual changes except the correction of obvious typographical errors and the substitution of American for English spelling , there can be no serious quarrel , though upon the second point there might be differences of opinion . The main feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , however . It consists of some odd millions ( more or less ) of footnotes , designed , in the words of the editor , " to elucidate the text by supplying such information as the casual reader might wish as he passes over the pages . " It may be granted that just possibly something is to be said for such a plan on theoretical grounds , as a general proposition regarding the editing of books of an earlier generation . But the sanity of the plan in any particular case obviously depends solely upon the manner in which it is carried out in that case . Professor Smith 's idea of the mental equipment of those persons likely to read the " Budget of Paradoxes " is that , in the first place , they know no single word of any language other than the English , and that , in the second place , they are so completely and totally ignorant of all history and literature that any and every allusion to persons or events must be fully explained in terms easily to be comprehended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not examined the book it will be nearly unbelievable that petty didacticism could be carried to such lengths as it here is , even in a text-book . Just for an example : on page 169 of Vol . I occurs the following passage , which is here set down literatim et punctatim as it occurs in the text : " There is an awful paradox about the book , which explains , in part , its leaden sameness , It is all about l'homme , l'homme , l'homme , s except as much as treats of les hommes , les hommes , les hommes. ? . . " At the bottom of the page footnote 6 furnishes the desperately needed information : " Man , man , man . " This is pretty bad , but worse is yet to come . Footnote 7 reads as follows : " Men , men , men . " Thus this difficult bit of idiomatic French is cleared up , and poor De Morgan 's little joke is fully explained , so that any " casual " idiot may easily comprehend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing might be instanced , were there need to do so . The effect on the intelligent , in contradistinction to the editor 's " casual , " reader is like that which would be produced upon the readers of F. P. A. 's " Conning Tower " if each mention of Washington in that sprightly turret were to be garnished with a footnote to this effect : " G. Washington , born Feb. 22 , 1732 , died Dec. 14 , 1799 , first President of the United States . Popularly known as The Father of his Country . ' A gentleman of very dignified bearing , much esteemed by his contemporaries . " No doubt many utterly wearisome arguments might be adduced in support of the contention that in this day and age many of De Morgan 's allusions would be , incomprehensible , in the absence of these painfully lucid footnotes , to any but scholarly persons . But just in that argument lies the meat of the matter , in a manner totally unperceived by those who advance it . De Morgan did not write the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language of sound , thorough , and mellow scholarship . He assumed , as a matter of course , that his readers understood that language . No more determined or bitter foe of all that is " casual " and shallow in intellectual matters ever lived than he . If as a people we have any one outstanding intellectual characteristic it is laziness . Intellectual laziness engenders mental mediocrity . More and more does it become the dominant quality of our literature that it shall be capable of absorption without the slightest effort , conscious or unconscious , on the part of the reader . This being a country in which all people are more or less free and equal , or at least like so to  | consider themselves , there is probably noth ing which can be done either about or to those persons who wish to have their intellectual pabulum so pre-digested that they need not stir a neurone in the process of getting it into their systems . But to pander to their low tastes in the name of Augustus De Mor gan is a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of that genial scholar , who contributed not alone to the sum of knowledge but so notably to the joy of living , can allow to pass without vigorous protest .  |
