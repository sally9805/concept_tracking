txt Like everybody Non-Existent else , we , of course , Dangers know and highly anpreciate the services Proclaimed . as well as the intentions of the Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children . Led by the organization of that name in this city , they I have done much work in the way of guarding the young and helpless from maltreatment and exploitation , and they can well claim , as does the local society in a circular just sent out to all the affiliated bodies , that " of all ' matters " ' pertaining to the welfare of children ' " there is none of such public importance " and Usefulness as the work done ' by " OUR ( sic ) societies in the rescue and " protection of innocent little ones and " the prosecution of their abusers . " The object of the circular , however , is to excite antagonism to the Borah bill establishing in the Department of Labor a " Children 's Bureau , " . and it is with very sincere regret that we feel obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tone , to those issued for a somewhat similar purpose by the aggregation of quacks , charlatans , and self-illuslonists that impudently calls itself the " League for Medical Freedom . " The circular shows , that is , precisely the same inclination as does the " literature " Of tile league to see in the proposed law a deep and dark conspiracy , concocted by people with the wickedest of motives , to bring about interference . with and control of State activities . We can ourselves find in the Borah bill no such purpose , nor do we believe that any of the dreadful consequences foreseen by , the society would result from its passage . tVe are quite unable to understand , moreover , why these good People should feel moved to put contemptuous quotation marks around words like " economics , " " sociological problems , " " research , " and " the limelight of publicity . " The officers of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children should remember that they and their doings have often been criticised with some asperity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least to that extent should they be careful not to be unjust to others . And , while the best work hitherto done for children has unquestionably been theirs , that fact is very far from precluding the possibility that their work can be supplemented , advanced , and improved by other agencies . Scorn of statistics and of Scientific investigation is certainly the reverse Of commendable in anybody , no matter how good he is or has been . While a little group There Never of New Yorkers , all Was Any concerned with large . Personaffairs , were taking Such luncheon recently , the conversation turned to a municipal problem that is receiving much attention just now and deserves to receive even more than it is getting . It is a particularly complicated problem , since it involves both public and private interests of the utmost importance , and , as is usual  --  or inevitable  --  in such cases , the two kinds of interests are more or less in conflict . They can be harmonized only by concessions that both sides are reluctant to make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recrimination , much bitterness of feeling , and of greatly needed action  --  none , Some may suspect from these hints that the subject under consideration at the luncheon was the subway situation . Be that as it may , in the course of the discussion one of those present was moved , or inspired , to question the others in about these words : What man in the whole city is there with such a reputation for knowledge , wisdom , and disinterested regard for the public welfare that , if he made a careful statement of the facts in this matter as he saw them , explained the facts in their relations and significances as he understood them , and clearly stated what in his opinion ought to be done  --  what man is there who. if he did this , would speak with an authority which ... " " everybody would recognize , with an honesty which none would doubt ? In other words , who is the best trusted and most respected man in New York ? The question went unanswered . Name after name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly respected in this or that fraction of our population , but it was apparently impossible ' to recall one commanding personality so high " above all others in the city 's regard as to escape all criticism and all suspicion . Very probably this is not a latter-day phenomenon : perhaps there never was in any city such a man . It did seem strange , however , to the participants in this inquest that of the dozen or twenty men in one or another way deservedly eminent who were brought forward for consideration there was not one of whom somebody did not at once say  --  and say truly  --  that he would not do because either his competence or his character would be seriously questidned in one or another circle too large to be safely ignored . Perhaps some of our readers will be more fortunate . Our own impression is that anywhere and at any time such a search would have been without result . The human race is not much given to unanimity in admiration . One of our corresponTheir Works dents repeated yesterSpeak day  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , but on the authority of certain South . erneriean friends of his ? that in enforcing quarantine regulations t Panama our health officers have sometimes been discourteous and unfair , with the result that desirable trade goes to Europe that ought to come here . It would , of course , be folly approaching madness to insist that every one of these officials has always been the pink of politeness  --  that none of them has ever been harsh , Unreasonable , or unjust . They are hard-worked men , carrying heavy responsibilities in a most trying climate , and dealing not infrequently with people at once ignorant and irascible . That they have sometimes lost their temper could not safely be denied , and no viler would it be . to leny that the effects of i  --  ritability this caused have sometimes fallen upon travelers from both South , and -0 o foi North America - whose intentions and conduct were irreproachable . Admitting all that , the fact remains , unquestionable , colossal , and magnificent , that the men whom our correspondent attacks have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the canal possible  --  that their achievements are a National glory ranking close to. , if not even with , the achievements of the engineers  --  that to GORGAS and his subordinates hardly less than to GIDETHAL3 and his is due the new respect with which the name of the United States is viewed all through that part of the world . And our ' correspondent worries because they have driven away trade ! Nonsense . Of course manners count in business , but it is chiefly in selecting one market or another where the prices are about the same . It can be assumed with perfect confidence that not many South Americans who can get here , more cheaply than in Europe , what they want , will go there for it just because some weary doctor snapped at them in Panama or Colon . This , , it may be stated incidentally , is r o defen'je of official discourtesy , on the Isthmus or elsewhere ; it is only an appeal to the sense of proportion            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
