txt UTICA , Jan. ** interest has been aroused in Central and Northern New York by an event that is soon to take place in this city , which is without parallel in the records of Freemasonry and Catholicism In this country . St. John 's Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum in this city is sadly in need of a new building to house the 200 or more children that are cared for by the Sisters of Charity . The Sisters some years ago commenced raising funds to erect a building to replace the one that has done service for forty years and now has become almost uninhabitable and entirely inadequate . They had just opened their campaign When the earthquake that destroyed San Francisco ' occurred . The Sisters withdrew their appeal and turned in to aid the stricken city . Other demands upon the charitable people of the city , in one way or another , have interfered with their effort , though some progress has been made , and it is believed that the work of building may be commenced in the Spring , Hearing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's , Supt. William J. Wiley of the Masonic Home in this city offered to give a public concert In the Majestic Theatre on the evening or Jan. 20 , in which the children of the Masonic Home should participate , the entire proceeds to be given to the Sisters of Charity for a new home for the children under their charge . Some Catholics were cynical and some Masons were astonished . Such an idea was unheard of before , for the Catholic Church had been understood to be opposed to Masonry , and there was a belief among some Catholics that the chief business of the Masonic lodges was to plot and connive against Catholicism . But Supt. Wiley paid little attention to these expressions . He knew that the little children of St. John 's Orphan Asylum were ill-housed and the Sisters under great disadvantage in caring for them . He felt that the orphans of Masons under his charge could be taught no better lesson in charily than in the giving of a concert for the benefit of the little fellows in another orphanage who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his children could give a concert that would be worth while . The indications are that the seats will be sold out long before the night of the concert . At $3 each a ticket , the proeeecla will amount to more than $.1,000 , which is the least sum that Supt. Wiley hopes to turn over to St. John 's Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum . koehbeus R. Wilfley , who was Attorney General of the Philippines when President Taft was Governor General , and later was the first Judge of the United States Court In Shanghai , China , arrived here yesterday from Mexico , where he has been far a year in the interests of a mthing corporation . Talking with a TIMES reporter at the Waldorf-Astoria yesterday , Judge Wilfley said that the accounts of the recent trouble In Mexico which had been published , here were greatly exaggerated . This Was not so much the fault of the newspaper correspondents , he said , as they could not get at the facts as they happened .

" A spirit of uncertainty pervades classes , which is chiefly due to anxiety regarding- President Diaz 's successor . Ramon Corral , the Vice President , is a very iR man . and , it Is not believed he will reFein his health . President Diaz is Sie Years old , and hence the question of choosing a successor is vital to the Mexicans , and also to the foreigners who have interests In the country . " At present there is fully ee00,000.000 of American capital , ** of British , and several millions of French , German , and Spanish capital invested Ia Mexico . " Judging from my interview with Dike two weeks ago , he will he able to serve out his term of six years and cope with any situation that may arise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the army , and also have the sympathy of the people . If such a man is selected there will be no disturbance . Another factor that Is helping the situation is the policy of substituting younger and more progressive Governors of provinces for those who have been in office . " The manner in which the Hon. Henry Lane Wilson , United States Minister to Mexico , handled the students ' riots evoked the admiration of Americans and Mexicans alike . " Americans are very popular in Mexico , he said , and President Diaz and his Ministers are anxious to keep on friendly terms with the United States . Judge Wilfley added that he would remain In this city for a week , and then visit his home city , St. Louis , where he intended to open an office .
