In October , 1850 , when d ' Azeglio presented the name of Cavour for the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture , Victor Emmanuel replied , " Do n't you gentlemen see that that little fellow will send you all heels over head ? " The plump little man , with his head full of statistics and his heart full of the Liberal Idea , was indeed destined , not perhaps to send the ministers flying , but at least to change the map of Italy . It is for this one thing ? the creation of the Kingdom of Italy ? that Cavour will be remembered , and for this alone . Indeed , his life presents singularly little eke of interest . While yet a boy , he dreamed of some day being first minister of his country ; the decade of his public life was wholly devoted to the great task , which was scarcely accomplished before he died ; and no master of romance could have put more appropriate words into the mouth of a dying hero than those actually uttered by Cavour Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of Cavour was felt far beyond the limits of his own country , for it was the decisive event in that series of transformations which effected the political reconstruction of Europe on the basis of nationality and constitutional government . It does not often fall to the lot of even a great man , by devoting himself exclusively to one task , to decide the destiny of his country , and thereby drive the main currents of history into new channels . Mr. Thayer has given us a life of Cavour commensurate in scope with the importance of the subject ; and if it proves not to be a masterpiece of historical biography , it will at least rank with the scholarly and well-constructed histories of the present time . He has studied , apparently with great care , all the available sources ; and the printed sources are abundant ? sufficiently so , it seems , to make it unlikely that further  | search in archives would greatly add to our knowledge or furnish the basis for any new conclusion of importance . In the main drift and substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ; but in clear and detailed exposition of events he offers much that is new , at least to English readers . One must admire the skill with which he has picked out the tangled skein of diplomatic negotiations , and the persistence with which he follows the devious underground ways of the secret societies . Those who have tried to work out the genesis of the Sicilian expedition , or to arrive at some clear notion of the exact part which was taken in that movement by Garibaldi , the Mazzinians , the National Society , and above all by Cavour himself , will be grateful to Mr. Thayer for his excellent treatment of a complicated subject . Details of importance , too often omitted or distorted , ? such as the statement of Napoleon to Hubner on New Year 's Day 1859 , or the fact that Victor Emmanuel knew before the battle of Solferino that the Emperor was contemplating a truce with Austria , ? one finds correctly stated here . And then , Mr. Thayer has the rare merit of making his people real . Garibaldi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brofferio , are not so many lay figures , but men of flesh and blood , that the reader comes to know apart , and to like , too , in their different ways , even though Mr. Thayer , one suspects , does not always ? as in the case of Brofferio ? particularly like them himself . Of Cavour we have on the whole a faithful and certainly a most engaging portrait ; while the exposition of his aims , and of his transcendent genius in meeting and overcoming the difficulties that faced him on every side , leaves little to be desired . Cavour professed that sort of political philosophy which is generally known as Liberalism . " I am the son of Liberty , " he said , " and to her I owe all that I am , " ? and to her , it might be added , as Mr. Thayer wishes us to understand , he gave his life . But Cavour understood Liberty in terms of that golden mean which the adherents of the school not infrequently found so convenient a substitute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , Liberalism is seen to have been the halfway house on the road from absolutism to democracy ? or not quite that perhaps , the first stage rather ; and it found its chief support in the well-to-do middle class . The highly respectable and altogether conventional bourgeois , immortalized in the pages of Thackeray and Balzac , and of which the archtype is the Citizen King with his green umbrella ( who indeed would push the principle of Liberty so far as to wish the privilege of being scorched by the sun or wet by the rain ? ) ? this excellent middle-class found the great dogma of the Mean exactly to its liking . Liberty there must be , certainly , ? but not too much of it , and only for the right sort of people : political liberty for those who had money enough to appreciate its advantages ; industrial liberty for those who wished to increase profits , but not always for those who wished to raise wages ; intellectual and religious liberty for all except the indecently eccentric or the uncomfortably original . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Greek sense . Liberalism , as it lay in the quiescent mind of the bourgeois , was doubtless crude enough . But there were not wanting statesmen and essayists to clothe the interests of a class in decent and attractive theory . Let us have , they said , freedom in government , in industry , in thought , in religion , to the end that every man may develop to the highest point the best that is in him ; only thus shall justice prevail , ignorance and superstition and intolerance disappear , poverty and war be banished , and peace , prosperity , and happiness be universally diffused at last . Now , Cavour 's Liberalism was strong precisely because it was grounded upon class interest and at the same time attractively shaped in terms of this plausible theory . Cavour was , through his own industry , a rich man , and his vigorous intelligence ? always , as Medici said , essentially at " the level of circumstances " ? was just the sort to be captivated by a theory at once so simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this principle , " he said ? and he was always repeating it , " there must follow a greater welfare for all , but especially for the least favored classes . " This was the very essence of the Liberal philosophy  --  the simple faith that liberty wisely ordered by the few would bring in its train that essential quality dreamed of by the many . The Liberal Idea thus became for Cavour , as for many another generous mind of that day , the open sesame to the millennium . " A calico millennium , " laughed Carlyle . " At least a concrete one , and safe , " Cavour might have replied . And Mr. Thayer , one suspects , would say so too . He is so heartily in sympathy with Cavour. with his philosophy , with his practical policy , that his book may not unjustly be called an apology for liberal constitutionalism ? an apology in the older sense of the word , the sense of a valiant justification . Perhaps apology is after  | all not the right word ; but I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have adopted Cavour 's point of view just temporarily , for historical purposes , as never to have ventured very far away from it . He sees the drama from Cavour 's angle of vision , because , like Cavour , he habitually sits in the mean distance ; like Cavour , therefore , he can not quite understand how the play looks to those who sit at ease in the boxes , or strain uncomfortably forward from the gallery . This is the prime defect : Mr. Thayer is so much of a liberal himself that he can not be quite fair to those who were not in sympathy with Cavour 's methods , or to those who stood in the way of his aims ; and thus the three determining forces of that time ? conservatism , liberalism , radicalism ? are presented to the reader in somewhat false perspective . Of Mr. Thayer 's treatment of Mazzini and the radicals , one need not complain much . The portrait of the incorrigible idealist , whom it was impossible not to love yet never quite safe to follow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part we are led to suppose that his work was indispensable to Italian unity ( I. , 274 , 542 , II. , 233 ) , although occasionally one infers that Cavour was quite right in dismissing him as an unmitigated nuisance . However , this question is hardly as important for the biographer of Cavour as the question of the validity of Mazzini 's criticism of Cavour . The full force of this criticism Mr. Thayer does not , I think , sufficiently emphasize ; and of this something presently . It is chiefly among the conservatives that Mr. Thayer finds himself , like goodman Tulliver , in a world that is , if not precisely too much for him , at least fairly puzzling . The English Tory , for example , he thinks a good sort of person . " Often he is not consciously selfish " ; but the defect of a Tory is that " however patriotic he may be , he can not understand patriotism in others . " This is amusing enough , and harmless too . But Mr. Thayer 's dislike of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cavour himself ; and that is more serious , for it fixes his attention somewhat too much upon the Bombas and Antonellis to the neglect of that wide-spread and genuine conservative sentiment without which these puppets ? despicable enough , truly ? would long since have been brushed aside . Austria was not so wholly perverse as one is led to suppose . " Austria , " indeed , was more truly a geographical expression than Italy , and Francis Joseph can hardly be censured for his aversion to d is very principles ? national independence and liberty ? which , if allowed to become practically operative , would have dissolved his empire , and , indeed , came very near dissolving it in 1848 , without much prospect of becoming practically operative at that . The shadow of ' 93 was still over Europe , and how much the events of 1848 had deepened it Mr. Thayer will by no means let us see : the anarchy that had prevailed for weeks in the streets of Paris and Vienna not only struck terror to the puppet rulers of Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every country of Europe as well . " We demand , " said Marche , addressing the Provisional Government in behalf of the Paris radicals , " the extermination of property and capitalists , the immediate installation of the proletariat in community of goods , the proscription of bankers , the rich , the merchants , the bourgeoisie of every condition above that of wageearners , the acceptance of the red flag to signify to society defeat , to the people victory , to Paris the Terror , and to all foreign governments invasion . " A pleasant programme ! ? but one which helps to explain why so many men were willing to suffer such evils as the Hapsburgs rather than to fly to others that they knew not of . Mr. Thayer 's remarks on the Church would furnish a hostile critic with many fine openings . He honestly endeavors to distinguish the Church and the Catholic religion from those that represented it . In this I think he is not very successful . " The romanticists , " he says , " represented mediaeval life , not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few had been the practice of all . " One might turn this epigram a little differently , and apply it with some justice to Mr. Thayer himself : he is too much inclined to represent the Church as if the practices of a few had been the ideals of all . This prejudice must account for many statements which , besides being unnecessary for the author 's main purpose , are misleading . " I believe because it is impossible , " which is ascribed to Saint Anselm , expresses precisely the thing for which Saint Anselm did not stand ; more than any other scholastic , he was keen to demonstrate that what he believed could be shown by reason to be not only possible but necessary . Doubtless Mr. Thayer knows this very well . And he must know , too , that the doctrine of Infallibility refers only to " the definition of doctrine in faith and morals , " and not to Papal action in establishing a form of government for the patrimony of Saint Peter . Besides , the doctrine of Infallibility was not promulgated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concessions . Let us not apply , even to the Pope , that flagrantly unliberal thing , an ex post facto law ( I. , 188 ) . We are told that it was the mission of Cavour " to mediate between an era that is passing away and a new era that has not yet taken definite form . " This is true enough ; and there is one aspect of this mediation , and a rather important one , which may be noted in conclusion . If Cavour did much to bring in the new era , he did something also to perpetuate the spirit of the old . It may , indeed , be said of Cavour that he placed some of the very rocks upon which the ship of Liberalism in which he sailed as pilot has made at least partial shipwreck . The point may be conveniently presented by referring again to the criticism of Cavour by Mazzini . Mr. Thayer quotes in part the famous letter which Mazzini wrote in answer to Cavour 's speech of April 16 , 1858 . In this letter Mazzini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knee to force , " and with corrupting the youth of Italy by " a policy of artifice and lies . " These charges cut deep , and very deep . The justification of Cavour 's methods depends upon the sincerity of his faith in the value of the liberal programme ; and yet his utterly unscrupulous methods , the " policy of artifice and lies , " implied a repudiation of Liberalism at its best . Nor was it a mere rhetorical flourish to say that Cavour " bowed the knee to force . " Of course Mazzini was all for force , too . But the difference , as he saw it , was vital : Mazzini appealed to the force of the oppressed themselves , to that " force inspired by the love of Liberty , " but Cavour appealed to force which existeu for the purpose precisely of bolding liberty in check . To go to Plombieres , to cede Savoy , to welcome assistance from the man who for ten years had set his heel on freedom in France , to employ in the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hearts there is no Liberty , ? this was " to bow the knee to force , " and for a temporary advantage betray the cause of humanity in the end . So thought Mazzini . Few now think with him . Yet there is much in the history of the last half century to confirm his opinion . It may be true that Italian unity could be achieved only by Cavour 's method . If so , the price of Italian unity was certainly higher than Cavour imagined . What Mazzini saw was that the methods used by Cavour to give liberty to Italy would in the end do much to discredit the very faith be professed . If the old Liberalism has become for the Europe of to-day little more than the shadow of a dream , if the worship of facts has in any measure replaced the worship of ideas , if faith in " blood and iron " has grown strong and faith in " speeches and resolutions of Parliament " has fallen away , if in statesmanship there has been a return to the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machiavellianism , no less than Bismarck 's brutal cynicism , has done something to bring about that result . It is probable that Cavour did more than Mazzini to unite Italy ; it is certain that he did more to divide humanity .  |
