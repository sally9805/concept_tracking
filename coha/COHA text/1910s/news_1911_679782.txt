txt A further effort of the indicted meat packers to avoid trial and to have the Sherman anti-trust law declared unconstitutional and void was made to-day by their surrendering to the United States Marshal and seeking an immediate appeal to United States Circuit Judge C. C. Kohisaat for a writ of habeas corpus . The arguments will be heard on Thursday . This step came as a surprise to the Government . The request for a decision on the constitutionality of the Sherman anti-trust law before undergoing trial was said to have been taken as a necessary step to carry the case before the United States Supreme Court without the cost or delay of a trial Violations of the Fifth , Sixth , and Eighth Amendments to the United States Constitution , ambiguity and alleged failure of the act either to create an offense against the Government , or so to define what it set up as an offense in a manner that would . enable the citizen to know when he erred and when net , were charged against the Sherman law as recently interpreted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tobacco cases . Attorney John S. Miller , who , as chief counsel for the packers , conducted to'day 's court action , charapterized the Sherman law as a " net large enough to catch all possible offenders , and leaves to the courts to step in and say who rightfully ' can be detained and who set at large . " Of the ten packers indicted , all but J. Ogden Armour were temporarily in custody while the petition was heard . The nine who surrendered are : Louis F. Swift , President of Swift &; Co . Edward F. Swift , Vice President , Swift - &; Co . Charles H. Swift , Director , Swift . &; Co . Edward Tilden , President , National Packing Company . Arthur Meeker , General Manager , Armour &; Co . Edward Morris , President , Morris &; Co . Francis Fowler , Director , ? wift &; Co . Thomas J. Connors , Director , Armour &; Cc . Louis H. Heyman , Manager , Morris &; Co . The petition for a writ of habeas corpus contained few points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before United States District Judgo Carpenter when they sought to have the indictments quashed , and later in-the arguments demurring to the court 's decision in the indictment controversy . On the contention that a citizen is unable to know whether he is a lawbreaker or not before a jury trial , the petition says : " The alleged criminality of the alleged transactions complained of in the indictments will depend entirely upon a particular jury 's view of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the particular case ; it will depend not on any standarct erected by the law which may be known in advance , but on one that may be created by the whim , prejudice , or arbitrary views of a jury . " There is no set standard fixed or attempted to be fixed , to guide the citizen to a knowledge of his guilt or innocence of an offense charged , before It has been adjudicated . " The act violates the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States , which requires that the petitioners severally shall be informed of tile nature and cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the act attempts to establish as a crime acts not criminal , but civil in their nature . The large number of witnesses necessary to trace the multitudinous transactions of a National business is pointed out as an in , dication of the great cost a trial will impose , both to the defense and to the Prosecution . Hence the request that the constitutionality of the act be determined . The packers were released on bonds of $30,090 each . With the trial of the so-called " beef trust " set for next Monday in the United States District Court it became known today that since the return of the indictments there has been a complete reorganization of the National Packing Company . In the opinion of Government officials this company is the central point of the so-called trust . Private weekly meetings , at which , the Government charges , prices were fixed , territories alloted , and amounts of interState shipments by each of the firms were decided , have been discontinued , and in their place monthly meetings are now held by the Directors . Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men under indictment , remains as President and Director . Ogden Armour , Edward Morris , the Swifts , and the other defendants have resigned . Nine men instead of nineteen now make up the board . The Grand Jury , acting on the testimony of Jerome H. Pratt , head of the beef sales department of Armour &; Co. , regarding the business transacted at these weekly secret meetings , found that they had been in vogue long before ? 1902 , when the Government filed its first bill of injunction , and had continued regularly up to the time of the indictment . Mr. Pratt testified that the memorandum showing the amounts to be shipped by Armour &; Co. were taken by him to Thomas G. Lee , dressed beef manager of Armour &; Co. , each Tuesday up to the time of his withdrawal ; that this information served as Lee 's guidance during the week ; that he also was informed of the amounts allotted to Swift &; Co. , Morris &; Co. , and the G. H. Hammond Co. ; that written summaries were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales to be used as data for the next private meeting ; that he had been furnished weekly printed tables showing the margins of difference between cost and selling price at the other three plants , and that Mr. Lee and other officials had habitually referred to the big packing companies by arbitrary code letters , not by their corporate names , in speaking and writing of them . Marshal Henkel received instructions yesterday from the Federal authorities in Chicago to serve subpoenas in the suit against the beef packers on Jacob H. Schiff , James Stillman of the National City Bank , Abraham Kuhn and Soloman Loeb of the firm of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , and on Anderson Fowler of 60 East Sixtyeighth Street . The Marshal succeeded in serving Mr. Schiff , but was informed that Mr. Stillman was in France . The other three , he discovered , had been dead- for many years , and lie so reported to Chicago .
