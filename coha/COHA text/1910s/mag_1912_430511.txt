 | Phi Beta Kappa is " a Greek letter society . " Beta and Kappa , B and K , the second two constituents of its name , are found in what we call the Roman alphabet also , and hence in the English . But the first is not ; nor may the concept which Phi here represents , " philosophia , " be perfectly understood by those who never have received a literal message from the Greeks . Had we leisure to discuss the history of the separate words , " Philosophy , the Guide of Life , " in which we render our noble motto , it would not be difficult to show how the name suggests an essential unity in all the diversity of ancient , medieval , and modern culture . The words " guide " and " life " do , indeed , take on a different coloring when translated into other tongues , and interpreted for different stages of civilization : Die Philosophie , der Lei/stern des Lebens ; La Pliilosophie , la Regle de la Vie . French , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different outward appearance , as have different epochs in the life and thought of a single nation . The resemblances between French thought in Abaelard of the twelfth century , for example , and French thought in Loisy of the twentieth are not wholly on the surface . Yet in every age , in the chief of modern tongues , and to the most modern , who are often the most conservative , of their times , the word " philosophy " must remain essentially unchanged , and essentially Greek . Our Society was organized in the first year of our national independence , at a time when the study of Greek and Latin authors was felt to be indispensable to the cultivation of philosophy and the study of belles leftres in general ? " beautiful letters , " as the French so beautifully express it . Subsequently there has intervened a brief space ? brief , that is , in the perspective of the centuries , and even in the history of our own nation ? during which certain alleged exponents and purveyors of culture have seemed to feel otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , themselves sometimes owing the best that was in them to the study of Greek , yet acting as if they fancied that the  | study of less beautiful letters might embellish the souls of our American youth quite as well as the most excellent letters of all ; I mean those most excellent letters in which the Homeric poems , the tragedies of Sophocles , the dialogues of Plato , and the books of the New Testament have come down to us . These intervenient guides have told us , in effect , that any kind of mental pabulum is wholesome for a man , so long as he craves it ; that one subject is just about as good as another in the curriculum , so long as no sneering demagogue has labeled it " aristocratic " ; and that the main principle in a general education no longer is , " Let a man deny himself , and take up his cross , " but , " Let every man follow his bent . " Yes , and let the nation follow its bent , irrespective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must also observe the things to which we ourselves are particularly prone , as different natures have different inclinations , and we may ascertain what these are by a consideration of our feelings of pleasure and pain . And we must drag ourselves in the direction opposite to them . . . . as we do when we pull a crooked stick straight . " Under the elective system , the drift of the nation , as of individuals , led away from Greek , and for many reasons , the chief one being that Greek , like mathematics , is hard , bringing students to a consideration of their feelings of pain , and , unlike a part of the mathematics , has little obvious bearing upon the production and distribution of animal comforts or necessities . Vet there is reason to believe that the evil time of lost distinctions and educational anarchy in America is past , or passing ; that Greek , for example , was in greatest peril about the beginning of the present century ; that a hundred signs now point to its coming rehabilitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latterly have been faint-hearted or treacherous in its defence , will shortly join in the wide-spread acclamation , when the subject once more comes to its own . I venture to speak in this way , partly because of a conviction that the class of persons to which I have the honor of belonging ? the teachers of modern vernacular literatures , and in particular of English ? will ultimately be found to have exercised a potent influence in this rehabilitation of Greek . It may not be improper to say that I yield to none in the veneration of my own subject , the English language and literature . I will even venture to af- firm that the teacher of his own vernacular has , with certain manifest disadvantages , certain paramount advantages in the general culture of his students over the teacher of any foreign literature , whether ancient or modern ; nay more , that certain advantages can accrue to the pupil only on the condition that his teacher from time to time shall approach the ancient or foreign literature through the vernacular . Having said so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the most pernicious of errors to assume that one subject , considered in itself , is as important as another in a general scheme of studies . Properly considered , English , the most important of modern literatures except Italian , is a very feeble instrument of education indeed in comparison with the classics , if it be dissociated from them ; and if a severance were necessary between the ancient and modern , the modern had better be dropped from the curriculum , and the ancient , above all the Greek , retained . There is , at present , no likelihood that such a mischance will occur . What seems probable is that the teachers of modern languages will more and more clearly recognize the impossibility of pursuing their respective subjects , French , German , Italian , English , with students who are innocent of Greek and Latin . They will more and more insistently demand that what is fundamental , what precedes in point of logic as well as time , shall be acquired by students before they approach the special investigation of a modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Greek may have seemed to be losing ground , and Latin perhaps not to be gaining , eminent scholars in English have been sending out of our American universities a succession of young doctors of philosophy convinced that the hope of the classics is the hope of any thorough general culture , and that the cause of English will stand or fall with that of Greek . What these eminent teachers of English have been doing , the eminent teachers of other modern literatures have likewise been doing , with the result that we possess in the best-trained younger men and women in some of the more popular subjects of instruction a growing influence in favor of the classics , to be added to the persistent influence of classical scholars themselves . It would be impossible to explain in brief the cogent reasons that move these teachers of modern literature in their effort to  | direct the younger generation betimes into the study of Greek and Latin ; yet a few remarks upon the relation of our own literature to the classics may not at this point be lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the first requisite in understanding a poem in any language is a measure of sympathy with its author . The reader must have had certain experiences in common with the poet . Now , with exceptions so rare as to be negligible , the English poets , beginning with Chaucer , Spenser , Shakespeare , and Milton , and coming down to Wordsworth , Tennyson , and Browning , have had the common experience of reading Latin ; and from Spenser and Milton to Tennyson and Browning , most of them read Greek before they wrote English poetry of any consequence . The inference is obvious ; let us put it in the form of the advice which one of these very poets , Wordsworth , gave to his nephew : " Remember , first read the ancient classical authors ; then come to us , and you will be able to judge for yourself which of us is worth reading . " Precisely so . Let our Freshmen and Sophomores first study Greek and Latin ( and may we add history and mathematics ? ) ; then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let them specialize if they will in English , and they will be able to judge for themselves what is worth while in that subject . As for prospective teachers of English , we may say to them : Remember , first acquaint yourselves with the method of interpretation and criticism which has been developed by twenty-three centuries of classical scholarship in Europe , and you will be able to judge for yourselves how much or how little variation there need be in applying this method to the study of the vernacular . Again , I suppose , it will be granted that on the part of a student , as distinguished from the naive and unformed reader , no greater mistake can be made than to fancy a particular thought or expression in an English author to be original with him , and a sure mark of his particular genius , when as a matter of fact it is not original with him , but comes , let us say , through a series of intermediate translations , from the Greek of Plutarch . There is a wonderful description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she first appeared to the hero :  | When she first met Mark Antony , she pursed up his heart , upon the river of Cydnus . . . The barge she sat in , like a burnished throne , Burned on the water ; the poop was beaten gold , Purple the sails ; and so perfumed , that The winds were love-sick with them ; the oars were silver , Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made The water which they beat to follow faster , As amorous of their strokes . For her own person , It beggared all description ; she did lie In her pavilion ? cloth-of-gold of tissue ? O'er-picturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature ; on each side her Stood pretty-dimpled boys , like smiling Cupids , With divers-colored fans , whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool , And what they undid did . Is the description original ? So far as I am aware , the only measure of its originality is the passage in North 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given without further comment : " When she was sent unto by divers letters . . . she . . . mocked Antonius so much that she disdained to set forward otherwise , but to take her barge in the river of Cydnus , the poop whereof was of gold , the sails of purple , and the oars of silver , which kept stroke in rowing after the sound of the music of flutes , howboys , citherns , viols , and such other instruments as they played upon in the barge . And now for the person of herself : she was laid under a pavilion of cloth of gold of tissue , apparelled and attired like the goddess Venus commonly drawn in picture ; and hard by her , on either hand of her , pretty fair boys apparelled as painters do set forth god Cupid , with little fans in their hands , with the which they fanned wind upon her . " Upon this showing , which seems to be the more original , Shakespeare , or the biographer of Chaeronea ? And if Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three removes , why has Plutarch disappeared from the circle of humane studies to-day ? that Plutarch who later fructified the genius of a modern educator , Rousseau ? Moreover , Plutarch is himself but a late and relatively unoriginal Greek . The ultimate sources of vital ideas , of " philosophia " , lie far behind him .  | But again : it often happens that some portion of a modern author is almost unintelligible unless we are familiar with the Greek or Latin image which he has in mind . One is bound , for example , to think that Shelley 's picture of himself in lines 289-295 of Adonais must be well-nigh meaningless to the reader who is unacquainted with the Greek conception of the suffering wanderer Dionysus : His head was bound with pansies overblown , And faded violets , white , and pied , and blue ; And a light spear topped with a cypress cone , Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew Yet dripping with the forest 's noonday dew , Vibrated , as the ever-beating heart Shook the weak hand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hero in Wordsworth 's poem of Ruth more comprehensible if our previous studies have shown us that the panther and dolphin are the classic companions of Dionysus in his joy : He was a lovely youth ! I guess The panther in the wilderness Was not so fair as he ; And , when he chose to sport and play , No dolphin ever was so gay Upon the tropic sea . " The poetry of ancient Greece and Rome , and modern Italy , and our own country " , says Shelley , in his Preface to The Revolt of Islam , " has been to me , like external nature , a passion and an enjoyment . Such are the sources from which the materials for the imagery of my Poem have been drawn . I . . . have read the Poets and the Historians and the Metaphysicians , whose writings have been accessible to me " . And he adds that the training he has received , with the feelings it has evoked , is not indeed the essential thing which makes men poets ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are . " One might go on to multiply examples endlessly . The truth is , English literature from the time of Chaucer , far from being original in the ordinary acceptation of the word , is derivative to an extent undreamed of by the layman ; and though the immediate sources of inspiration are often French and Spanish , more often , perhaps , Italian , the chief immediate source of most of the  | ideas of our poets has been Latin ? and the ultimate source is Greek . All roads lead to Rome , is as true of English as of the modern Continental literatures ; and a thousand roads lead back from Rome to Greece . Accordingly , the one great model of English prose is Cicero , whose model was Demosthenes ; and the great writers of English prose from Milton to Burke , and from Burke to Newman , have been familiar with either or both . And the two chief wells whence English poets have drawn their notions of poetic style , as well as their mythological allusions , have been Virgil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homer , and Ovid who collected and arranged pretty much all that is known of Graeco-Roman mythology . To an age that is eager for any short cut whatsoever to the intelligent reading of our English poets , I would say that a hundred hours devoted to Ovid and Virgil , even read in translations , would be worth thousands of hours spent upon most of the books in the list adopted for " Entrance English . " Of the mythological allusions in Shakespeare " for which a definite source can be assigned , it will be found that an overwhelming majority are directly due to Ovid , while the remainder , with few exceptions , are from Virgil . " So says a competent investigator ; and he adds : " A man familiar with these two authors , and with no others , would be able to make all the mythological allusions contained in the undisputed works of Shakespeare , barring some few exceptions " ? which we may here neglect . But we are not at present advocating a short cut to the interpretation of modern authors ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about the necessity of studying the English Bible before attempting to read authors who knew it by heart , and who use its thought and language as a common possession of the reading public . What we are advocating is a short cut to that inner substance of the Greek classics , that " sophia " , which the Greeks especially loved , that leaven which has diffused itself , by way of Rome , throughout all modern literatures . There is but one short cut to the substance of Greek , and that way lies through the letters which enfold it . They are not dead , and they do not kill . The eternal spirit which inhabits those letters imparts its life to them , and makes them beautiful . There really is no ar guing about the matter ; only those who know that spirit , incar- nate in those letters , are in a position to speak of the value of either in a system of education . Emphatically must we add that those who have dabbled in Greek , and have not loved it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position to speak on the subject ; nor are those who never had an opportunity of studying it . But the latter class at least may attend to the words of a teacher of English when he says : In nine cases out of ten , the undergraduates who think the best thoughts and express them in the best way , and who utter righteous judgment when they examine the standard modern authors , are those who have studied , or are studying , Greek and Latin . " A great London editor told me , " observes Goldwin Smith in his Reminiscences , " that the only members of his staff who wrote in good form from the beginning had practised Latin verse . " " In regard to antiquity as an element of education , " says an eminent Russian , Professor Zielinski , " people are disposed to deem it merely a singular survival , which has maintained its footing in our modern school curriculum in some unintelligible way , and for some unintelligible reason , but which is destined to make a speedy and final disappearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs will rejoin that antiquity , owing both to historical and psychological causes , is , and must be considered , an organic element of education in European schools , and that if it be destined to disappear entirely , its end will coincide with the end of modern European culture . " In America , the members of the Society of Phi Beta Kappa dare not regard themselves as unconcerned in the cultivation of Greek letters and the diffusion of the Hellenic spirit . And the duty of these members with respect to the classics is clear and simple . The influence such a body represents is sufficient to divert thousands of new students every year into the pursuit of classical subjects ; it is sufficient within a decade to convert twenty American universities into as many leading institutions in humane studies ; it is sufficient to accomplish this , if each individual who has faith in Greek will attempt at the beginning of every academic term to implant his faith in the heart of two other persons . The effort must begin with individuals . Let us shake off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , our supine acquiescence in a state of affairs which  | we know to be evil ; and let us resolutely send our most promising pupils , and younger fellow-students , to the tables where generations of those who hungered and thirsted after wisdom have been fed , and felt no lack . And let us otherwise strive , according to our powers , to make this Society perform its office in the body educational . At many of our colleges and universities , an election to the Society of Phi Beta Kappa at present constitutes the only distinction which is conferred upon pure scholarship without an attendant pecuniary reward . By our words and actions let us make clear that we believe in the distinction ; because it sets a premium on the men and women whose nominal and real business in a place of study are eminently one and the same , that is , the business or activity of students ; and because it puts the mark of high success upon the sort of men and women for whom an idealist like Ezra Cornell wished to found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything has been tolerated save orthodoxy , let us tolerate orthodoxy . Furthermore , in order to enhance the distinction , we need not hesitate openly to condemn , wherever it may appear , the shallow thinking that gives honor to the man whose nominal business is study , but who slights his manifest duty , and succeeds , apparently , at something else . A characteristic of the vulgar , says the caustic Ulysses , is their frantic worship of a tinsel success that is not connected with the permanent issues of life : One touch of nature makes the whole world kin , That all with one consent praise new-born gawds And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt o'er-dusted . But our Society may say to the world , in the language of King Agamemnon : Why , then , you princes , Do you with cheeks abashed behold our works , And call them shames ? which are indeed nought else But the protractive trials of great Jove , To find persistive constancy in men : The fineness of which metal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold and coward , The wise and fool , the artist and unread ,  | The hard and soft , seem all affined and kin . But in the wind and tempest of her frown , Distinction , with a broad and powerful fan , Puffing at all , winnows the light away ; And what hath mass or matter , by itself Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
