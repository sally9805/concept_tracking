txt ioo THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY and a longer period of dependence of the offspring upon parents , and the like , is directly to be explained through natural selection ; while seeking the indorsement of society before forming a new family , sexual modesty , tendencies to artificial adornment , and the like , are to be explained through man 's self-consciousness and higher intellectual development , also through the fuller development of his social instincts . The gap between the human family life and brute family life is , therefore , not an unbridgeable one . That this is so , we see most clearly when we consider the family life of the anthropoid or manlike apes ? man 's nearest cousins in the animal world . All of these apes , of which the chief representatives are the gorilla , orangutan , and the chimpanzee , live in relatively permanent family groups , usually monogamous . These family groups are quite human in many of their characteristics , such as the care which the male parent gives to the mother and her offspring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group . Such a group of parents and offspring among the higher apes is , moreover , a relatively permanent affair , children of different ages being frequently found along with their parents in such groups . So far as the evidence of animals next to man , therefore , goes , there is no reason for supposing that the human family life sprang from confused or promiscuous sex relations in which no permanent union between male and female parent existed . On the contrary , there is every reason to believe , as Westermarck says , that human family life is an inheritance from man 's apelike progenitor . The Evidence from the Lower Human Races . ? The evidence afforded by the lowest peoples in point of culture i // even more clearly , if anything , refutes the hypothesis of a primitive state of promiscuity . The habits or customs of the lowest peoples were not well known previous to the nineteenth century . Therefore it was possible for such a theory as the patriarchal theory of the primitive family to remain generally accepted , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century . This was the theory that the oldest or most primitive type of human family life is that depicted in the opening pages of the Book of Genesis , namely , a family life in which the father or eldest male of the family group is the absolute ruler of the group and practically owner of all persons and property . The belief that this was the primitive type of the human family life was first attacked by a German-Swiss philologist by the name of Bachofen in a work entitled Das Mutterrecht ( The Matriarchate ) , published in 1861 , in which he argued that antecedent to the patriarchal period was a matriarchal period , in which women were dominant socially and politically , and in which relationships were traced through mothers only . Bachofen got his evidence for this theory from certain ancient legends , such as that of the Amazons , and other remains in Greek and Roman literature , which seemed to point to a period antecedent to the patriarchal . In 1876 Mr. J. F. McLennan , a Scotch lawyer , put forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain legal survivals which he found among many peoples . With Bachofen , he argued that this matriarchal period must have been characterized by promiscuous relations of the sexes . In 1877 Mr. Lewis H. Morgan , an American ethnologist and sociologist , put forth again , io2 THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY independently , practically the same theory , basing it upon an extensive study of the North American Indian tribes . Morgan had lived among the Iroquois Indians for years and had mastered their system of relationship , which previously had puzzled the whites . He found that they traced relationship through mothers only , and not at all along the male line . This method of reckoning relationship , moreover , he found also characterized practically all of the North American Indian tribes , and he argued that the only explanation of it was that originally sexual relations were of such an unstable or promiscuous character that they would not permit of tracing descent through fathers . From these theories sociological writers put forth the conclusion that the primitive state was one of promiscuity , or , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of " communism in women . " Post , a German student of comparative jurisprudence , for example , summed up the theory by saying that " monogamous marriage originally emerged everywhere from pure communism in women , through the intermediate stages of limited communism in women , polyandry , and polygyny . " Even Herbert Spencer in his Principles of Sociology , while he avoided accepting such an extreme theory , asserted that in the beginning sex relations were confused and unregulated , and that all forms of marriage ? polyandry , polygyny , monogamy , and promiscuity ? existed alongside of one another and that monogamy survived through its being the superior form . Before giving a criticism in detail of this theory let us note whether the evidence from the lowest peoples confirms it . The lowest peoples in point of culture are not // the North American Indians nor the African Negroes , but certain isolated groups that live almost in a state of nature , without any attempt to cultivate the soil or to control nature in other respects . Such are the Bushmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Philippine Islands and of the Andaman Islands , the Veddahs of Ceylon , and the Fuegians of South America . Now all these peoples , with a possible exception , ' practice monogamy and live in relatively stable family groups . Their monog-amy , however , is not of the type found in patriarchal times or among civilized peoples , but is a simple pairing monogamy , husband and wife remaining together indefi-nitely if children are born , but separating easily if childless . Westermarck in his History of Human Marriage shows un-doubtedly that nothing approaching promiscuity existed among these lower peoples . Promiscuity is apt to be found at a higher stage of social development , and is especially apt to be found among the nature peoples after the white man has visited them and demoralized their family life . But in all these cases the existence of promiscuity is mani-festly something exceptional and abnormal . Perhaps civilized peoples such as the Romans of the decadence have more nearly approximated the condition of promis-cuity than any savage people of which we have knowledge . At any rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite forms of family life , and the type usually found was the simple pairing monogamy mentioned above . // Objections to the Hypothesis of a Primitive State of Promiscuity . ? We may now briefly sum up the main criticisms of this theory of a primitive state of promiscuity , not only as we may derive them from inductive study of the higher animals and the lower peoples , but also as we may deduce them from known psychological and biological facts or principles . ( r ) In the first place , then , the animals next to man , namely , the anthropoid apes , do not show a condition of promiscuity. ( 2 ) The evidence from the lower peoples does not show that such a condition exists or has ever existed among them . ( 3 ) A third argument against this hypothesis may be gained from what we know of primitive economic conditions . Under the most primitive conditions , in which man had no mastery over nature , food supply was relatively scarce , and as a rule only very small groups of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the scarcity of food supply , would prevent anything like promiscuity on a large scale . ( 4 ) A fourth argument of a deductive nature is that the jealousy of the male , which characterizes all higher animals and especially man , would prevent anything like the existence of sexual promiscuity . The tendency of man would have been to appropriate one or more women for himself and drive away all rivals . Long ago Darwin argued that this would prevent anything like the existence of a general state of promiscuity . ( S ) A fifth argument against this theory may be got from the general biological fact that sexual promiscuity tends to pathological conditions unfavorable to fecundity , // that is , fertility , or the birth of offspring . Physicians have long ago ascertained this fact , and the modern prostitute gives illustration of it by the fact that she has few or no children . Among the lower animal species , in which some degree of promiscuity obtains , moreover , powerful instincts keep the sexes apart except at the pairing season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in man would , therefore , greatly lessen the birth rate , and any group that practiced it to any extent would soon be eliminated in competition with other groups that did not practice it . ( 6 ) We have finally the general social fact that promiscuity would lead to the neglect of children . Promiscuity means that the male parent does not remain with the female parent to care for the offspring and , therefore , in the human species it would mean that the care of children would be thrown wholly upon the mother . This means that the children would have less chance of surviving . Not only would promiscuity lead to lessening the birth rate , but it would lead to a much higher mortality in children born . This is found to be a striking fact wherever we find any degree of promiscuity among any people . Hence , promiscuity would soon exterminate any people that practiced it extensively in competition with other peoples that did not practice it . From all of these lines of argument , without going over the evidence in greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the hypothesis of a primitive state of promiscuity has no foundation in fact and is essentially unscientific . " The facts put forth in support of the theory do not justify the conclusion , Westermarck says , that promiscuity has ever been a general practice io6 THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY among a single people and much less that it was the primitive state . Promiscuity is found , however , more or less in the form of sexual irregularities or immorality among all peoples ; more often , however , among the civilized than among the uncivilized , but among no people has it ever existed unqualified by more enduring forms of sex relation . Moreover , because promiscuity breaks up the social bonds , throws the burden of the care of children wholly upon the mother , and lessens the birth rate , we are justified in concluding that promiscuity is essentially an antisocial practice . This agrees with the facts generally shown by criminology and sociology , that the elements practicing promiscuity to any great extent in modern societies are those most closely related with the degenerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in modern society that practice promiscuity are on the road to extinction , and if a people generally were to practice it there is no reason to believe that such a people would meet with any different fate . The Earliest Form of the Family Life in the Human Species , therefore , is probably that of the simple pairing monogamous family found among many of the higher animals , especially the anthropoid apes , and also found among the lower peoples . This primitive monogamy , however , as we have already seen , was not accompanied by the social , legal , and religious elements that the historic monogamic family has largely rested upon . On the contrary , this primitive monogamy rested solely upon an instinctive basis , and , as we have seen , unless children were born it was apt to be relatively unstable . Permanency in family relations among primitive peoples depended largely THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY to , upon the birth of children . Thus we find confirmed our conclusion drawn some time ago that family life rests pri marily upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact , as we shall see later , that divorce is many times more common among couples that have no children than among those that have children . Some General Conclusions , both of theoretical and of practical bearing , may here be pointed out . We have seen that the biological processes of life have created the family , and that the family , as an institution , rests upon these biological conditions . Hence it is not too much to say , first , that the family is not a man-made institution ; and , secondly , that it rests upon certain fundamental instincts of human nature . Both of these statements are also true to a certain extent of human society in general . There is a sense in which social organization is not whollyman-made , and we have already seen that human institutions rest to some extent upon human instincts . This is not saying , of course , that man has not modified and may not modify social organization and human institutions through his reason , but it is saying that the essential elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conditions of life generally and to the instincts which natural selection has implanted in the species . To attempt to reorganize human society or to reconstruct institutions regardless of the biological conditions of life , , or regardless of human instincts , is to meet with certain failure . A practical conclusion which may be drawn also is that those people who advocate sexual promiscuity in present society , or free love , as they please to style it , are advocating a condition which would result in the elimination of any ro8 THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY group that practiced it . Promiscuity , or even great instability in the family life , as we have already seen , would lead to the undermining of everything upon which a higher civilization rests . The people in modern society who advocate such theories as free love , therefore , are more dangerous than the worst anarchist or the most revolutionary socialist . In other words , the modern attack upon the family is more of a menace to all that is worth while in human life than all attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resented as such ; and it is one of the most serious signs of the times that many intellectual people have indorsed such views . We must reemphasize , therefore , the fact that the family is the central institution of human society , that industry and the state must subordinate themselves to its interest . Neither the state nor industry has had much to do with the origin of the family , and neither the state nor industry may safely determine its forms independent of the biological requirements for human survival . Moreover , it is evident that human society from the beginning has in more or less instinctive , and also in more or less conscious , ways attempted to regulate the relations between the sexes with a view to controlling the reproductive process . While material civilization is mainly a control over the food process , moral civilization involves a control over the reproductive process , that is , over the birth and rearing of children ; and such control over the reproductive process , which has certainly been one of the aims of all social organization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples , evidently precludes anything like the toleration of promiscuity or even of free love . // CHAPTER VI THE FORMS OF THE FAMILY , THE family as an institution has varied greatly in its forms from age to age and from people to people . This is what we should expect , seeing that all organic structures are variable . Such variations in human institutions are due partly to the influences of the environment , partly to the state of knowledge , and partly to many other causes as yet not well understood . The family illustrates in greater or less degree the working of these causes of variation and of change in human institutions . The Maternal and Paternal Families . ? As regards the general form of the family we have to note first of all the two great forms which we may characterize respectively as " the maternal family " and " the paternal family . " As we have already seen , Bachofen , Morgan , and others discovered a condition of human society in which relationship was . traced through mothers only , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than along the male line . Further investigation and research have shown that up to recent times , say up to fifty years ago , one half of all the peoples of the world , if we reckon them by nations and tribes rather than by numbers , practiced this system of reckoning kinship through mothers only , and passed property and authority down along the female line . Ethnologists and sociologists have practically concluded , from the amount of evidence now collected , that this ma-iio THE FORMS OF THE FAMILY iii ternal or metronymic system was the primitive system of tracing relationships , and that it was succeeded among the European peoples by the paternal system so long ago that the transition from the one to the other has been forgotten , except as some trace of it has been preserved in customs , legends , and the like . Among many tribes of the North American Indians this metronymic or maternal system was peculiarly welldeveloped . Children took their mother 's name , not their father 's name ; belonged to their mother 's clan , not their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if hereditary , not to his own son , but to his eldest sister 's son . The relatives on the father 's side , indeed , were quite ignored . Frequently the maternal uncle had more legal authority over the children than their own father , seeing that the children belonged to his clan , that is , to their mother 's clan . Now , Bachofen claimed not only that in this stage was kinship reckoned through mothers only , but that women were dominant socially and politically ; that there existed a true matriarchy , or rule of the mothers . Do the facts support Bachofen 's theory ? Let us see . The Wyandot Indians , a branch of the Iroquois , were a typical maternal or metronymic people . Among them , without any doubt , the women had a position of influence socially and even politically which often is not found among peoples of higher culture . For example , among the Wyandots the government of the clan was in the hands of four women councilors ( Matrons ) , who were elected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councilors , however , elected a Peace Sachem , who carried out the will of the clan in all matters // pertaining to peace generally . Moreover , the councilors of the several clans , four fifths of whom were women , met together to form the Tribal Council ; but in this Tribal Council the women sat separate , not participating in the deliberations , but exercising only a veto power on the decisions of the men . In matters of war , however , government was intrusted to two war chiefs elected from the tribe generally , the women here only having the right to veto the decision of the tribe to enter upon the warpath . Thus we see that while the women of the Iroquois Indians had a great deal of social and political influence , the actual work of government was largely turned over by them to the men , and especially was this true of directing the affairs of the tribe in time of war . There is no doubt , however , that in the maternal stage of social evolution women had an influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they had at many later stages of social development . Among the Zuni of New Mexico , for example , another welldeveloped maternal people , marriage is always arranged by the bride 's parents . The husband goes to live with his wife , and is practically a guest in his wife 's house all his life long , she alone having the right of divorce . Indeed , among all maternal peoples the rule is that the husband goes to live with the wife , and not the wife with the husband , the children , as we have already seen , keeping the mother 's name and belonging to her kindred or clan . Nevertheless we can not agree with Bachofen that a true matriarchy , or government by women , ever existed . On the contrary , among all of these maternal peoples , while the women may have much influence socially and // politically , the men , on account of their superior strength , are intrusted with the work not only of protecting and providing for the families and driving away enemies , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of the people . Strictly speaking , therefore , there has never been a matriarchal stage of social evolution , but rather a maternal or metronymic stage . We have already said that this stage was probably the primitive one . How are we to explain , then , that primitive man reckoned kinship through mothers only ? Was this due , as Morgan thought , to a primitive practice of promiscuity which prevented tracing relationships through fathers ? The reply is , that among the many maternal peoples now well known , among whom relationships are traced through mothers only , we find no evidence of the practice of general promiscuity now or even in remote times . The North American Indians , for example , had quite definite forms of the family life and were very far removed from the practice of promiscuity , though they traced relationship through mothers only . It is evident that the causes of the maternal family and the maternal system of relationship are not so simple as Morgan supposed . What , then , were the causes of the maternal system ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know the physiological connection between father and child . The physiological connection between mother and child , on the other hand , was an obvious fact which required no knowledge of physiology to establish ; therefore , nothing was more natural than for primitive man to recognize that the child was of the mother 's blood , but not of the II4 THE FORMS OF THE FAMILY father 's blood . Therefore , the child belonged to the mother 's people and not to the father 's people . If it be asked whether it is possible that there could be any human beings so ignorant that they do not know the physiolog-ical connection between father and child , the reply is , that this is apparently the case among a number of very primitive peoples , even down to recent times . It is not infrequent among these peoples to find conception and childbirth attributed to the influence of the spirits , rather than to relations between male and female . While , there-fore , a social connection between the father and the children was recognized , leading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fathers do whether among civilized or uncivilized peoples , yet the blood relationship between the father and the child could not have been clear in the most primitive times . Perhaps an even more efficient cause , however , of the maternal system was the fact that the mother in primitive times was the stable element in the family life , the constant center of the family . The husband was frequently away from home , hunting or fighting , and oftentimes failed to return . Nothing was more natural , therefore , than that the child should be reckoned as belonging to the mother , take her name and belong to her kindred or clan . More-over , after the custom of naming children from mothers and reckoning them as belonging to the mother 's clan was established , it could not be displaced by the mere discovery of the physiological connection between the father and the child . On the contrary social habits , like habits in the individual , tend to persist until they work badly . We find , therefore , the maternal system persisting among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the physiological connection of father and child . Indeed , the maternal system could never have been done away with if social evolution had not brought about new and complex conditions which caused the system to break down and to be replaced by the paternal system . The Paternal and the Patriarchal Family . ? At a certain stage , then , we find a great change in the organization of the family , which probably took place slowly and largely unconsciously . The family life becomes definitely organized about the male element , and the maternal system disappears . At first the paternal family appears with children taking the father 's name and property and titles passing along the male line . Then there develops that extreme form of the paternal family which we know as the patriarchal family , in which the authority of the husband and father has become supreme and the position of the wife and children has been reduced , if not to that of property , at least to that of subject persons . Classical pictures of patriarchal family life may be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the causes which brought about the breakdown of the maternal system and the gradual development , first of a paternal , and then of a patriarchal system ? Some of these causes we can clearly make out from the study of social history . ( I ) War was unquestionably a cause of the breakdown of the maternal system through the fact that women were captured in war , held as slaves , and made wives or concubines by their captors . These captured wives were regarded as the property of the captor . Any children born to them were , therefore , also regarded as the property of the captor. // Furthermore , these captured wives were separated from . their kindred , and their children could not possibly belong to any clan except their husband 's . Manifestly this cause could not have worked in the earliest times , when slave captives were not valuable ; but as soon as slavery became instituted in any form , then women slaves were particularly valued , not only for their labor , but because they might be either concubines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and slavery would thus indirectly tend to undermine the maternal system . ( 2 ) Wife purchase would operate in the same way . Among peoples that had developed a commercial life as well as slavery it early became the practice to purchase wives . It is evident that these purchased wives would be regarded as a sort of property , and the husband would naturally claim the children as belonging to him . Among certain North American Indians we find exactly this state of affairs . If a man married a wife without paying the purchase price for her , then her children took her name and belonged to her clan ; but if he had purchased her , say with a number of blankets , then the children took his name and belonged to his clan . ( 3 ) The decisive cause , however , of the breakdown of the maternal system was the development of the pastoral stage of industry . Now , the grazing of flocks and herds requires considerable territory and necessitates small and compact groups widely separated from one another . Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and be far removed from the influence and authority of her own kindred . This gave the husband greater power over his wife . Moreover , the care of flocks and herds accenTHE // tuated the value of the male laborer , while primitively woman had been the chief laborer . In the pastoral stage the man had the main burden of caring for the flocks and herds . Under such circumstances nothing was more natural than that the authority of the owner of the family property should gradually become supreme in all matters , and we find , therefore , among all pastoral peoples that the family is itself a little political unit , the children taking the father 's name , property and authority passing down along the male line , while the eldest living male is usually the ruler of the whole group . ( 4 ) After all these causes came another factor ? ancestor worship . While ancestor worship exists to some extent among maternal peoples , it is usually not welldeveloped for some reason or other until the paternal stage is reached . Ancestor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes , seems to develop more readily where the line of ancestors are males . It may be suggested that the male ancestor is apt to be a more heroic figure than the female ancestor . At any rate , when ancestor worship became fully developed it powerfully tended to reenforce the authority of the patriarch , because he was , as the eldest living ancestor , the representative of the gods upon earth , therefore his power became almost divine . Religion thus finally came in to place the patriarchal family upon a very firm basis . Thus we see how each of these two great forms , the maternal family and the paternal family , arose out of natural conditions , and therefore they may be said to represent two great stages in the social evolution of man . It is hardly necessary to point out that civilized societies // are now apparently entering upon a third stage , in which there will be relative equality given to the male and the female elements that go to make up the family . Polyandry . ? We must notice now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been constituted among different peoples and in different ages . Marriage , like the family itself , is variable , and an indefinite number of forms may be found among various peoples . We shall notice , however , only the three leading forms , ? polyandry , polygyny , and monogamy , ? and attempt to show the natural conditions which favor each . It is evident that if we assume that the primitive form of the family was that of a simple pairing monogamy , the burden is laid upon us to show how such different types as polyandry and polygyny arose . Polyandry , or the union of one woman with several men , is a relatively rare form of marriage and the family , found only in certain isolated regions of the world . It is particularly found in Tibet , a barren and inhospitable plateau lying north of India and adjoining China proper on the west . It is also found in certain other isolated mountainous regions in India , and down to recent times also in Arabia . In none of these places does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other forms of the family . Thus in Tibet the upper classes practice polygyny and monogamy , while among the lower classes we find polyandry and monogamy . In all these regions where polyandry occurs , moreover , it is to be noted that the conditions of life are harsh and severe . Tibet is an exceptionally inhospitable region , with a climate of arctic rigor , the people living mainly by grazing . THE FORMS OF THE FAMILY uq Under such circumstances it is conceivably difficult for one man to support and protect a family . At any rate , the form of polyandry which we find in Tibet suggests that such economic conditions may have been the main cause of its existence . Ordinarily in Tibet a polyandrous family is formed by an older brother taking a wife , and then admitting his younger brothers into partnership with him . The older brother is frequently absent from home , looking after the flocks , and in his absence one of the younger brothers assumes the headship of the family . Under such circumstances we can see how the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , the jealousy of the male , might become greatly modified , or cease to act altogether . Certain other conditions besides economic ones might also favor the existence of polyandry , such as the scarcity of women . Summing up , we can say , then , that this rare form of the family seems to have as its causes : ( I ) In barren and:inhospitable countries the labor of one man is sometimes found not sufficient to support a family . ( 2 ) Also there probably exists in such regions an excess of males . This might be due to one of two causes : First , the practice of exposing female infants might lead to a scarcity of women ; secondly , in such regions it is found that from causes not well understood a larger number of males are born . It may be noted as a general fact that when the conditions of life are hard in human society , owing to famine , war , or barrenness of the soil , a larger number of male births take place . We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sexes in such regions . ( 3 ) A third cause may be suggested as // having something to do with the matter , namely , that habits of close inbreeding , or intermarriage , might perhaps tend to overcome the natural repugnance to such a rela tion . Moreover , close inbreeding also , as the experiments of stock-breeders show , would tend to produce a surplus of male births , and so would act finally in the same way as the second cause . Polygyny , or the union of one man with several women , is a much more common form of marriage . It is , in fact , to be found sporadically among all peoples and in all ages . It has perhaps existed at least sporadically from the most primitive times , because we find that at least one of the anthropoid apes , namely , the gorilla , practices it to some extent . It is manifest , however , that it could not have existed to any extent among primitive men , except where food supply was exceptionally abundant . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which comes in when some degree of wealth has been accumulated , that is , sufficient food supply to make it possible for one man to support several families . Polygyny came in espe cially after women came to be captured in war and kept as slaves or wives . The practice of wife capture , indeed , and the honor attached to the custom , had much to do in making the practice of polygyny common among cer tain peoples . Wherever slavery has existed , we may also note , polygyny , either in its legal form or in its illegal form of concubinage , has flourished . Polygyny , indeed , is closely // related with the institution of slavery and is practically coextensive with it . In the ancient world it existed among the Hebrews and among practically all of the peoples of the Orient , and also sporadically among our own Teu-tonic ancestors . In modern times polygyny still exists among the Mohammedan peoples and to a greater or lcs ; degree among all semicivilized peoples . It exists in China in the form of concubinage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much evidence seems to show that the Utah Mormons still practice polygyny to some extent , although it may be doubted whether polygynous unions are being formed among them at the present time . Two facts always need to be borne in mind regarding polygyny : First , that wherever it is practiced it is rela-tively confined to the upper and wealthy classes , for the reason that the support of more than one family is some-thing which only the wealthy classes in a given society could assume . Secondly , it follows that under ordinary circumstances only a small minority of a given popula-tion practice polygyny , even in countries in which it is sanctioned . In Mohammedan countries like Turkey and Egypt , for example , it is estimated that not more than five per cent of the families are polygynous , while in other regions the percentage seems to be still smaller . The reason for this is not only the economic one just mentioned , but that everywhere the sexes are relatively equal in num-bers , and therefore it is impossible for polygyny to become a widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife it is evident that other men will probably have to forego marriage entirely . This is not saying that under certain circumstances , namely , the importation of large // numbers of women , a higher per cent of polygynous families may not exist . It is said that among the negroes on the west coast of Africa the number of polygynous families reaches as high as fifty per cent , owing to the fact that female slaves are largely imported into that district , and that they serve not only as wives , but do the bulk of the agricultural labor , the male negro preferring female slaves , who can do his work and be wives at the same time , to male slaves . But such cases as these are altogether exceptional and manifestly could not become general . Summing up , we may say that the causes of polygyny are , then : First of all , the brutal lust of man . No doubt man 's animal propensities have had much to do with the existence of this form of the family . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a mistake to think that sensuality is an adequate explanation in all cases . On the contrary , we find many other causes , chiefly , perhaps , eco-nomic , operating also to favor the development of polygyny . One of these is wife capture , as we have already seen . The captured women in war were held as trophies and slaves , and later became wives or concubines . Among all peoples at a certain stage the honor of wife capture has alone been a prolific cause of polygyny . Another cause , after slavery became developed , was the high value set on women as laborers . Among many barbarous peoples the women do the main part of the work . They are more tractable as slaves , and consequently a high value is set upon their labor . As we have already seen , these female slaves usually serve at the same time as con-cubines , if not legal wives of their masters . // ( 4 ) Another cause which we can perhaps hardly appreciate at the present time is the high valuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of the patriarchs of the Old Testament . Under the patriarchal family great value was set upon children as necessary to continue the family line . Where the device of adoption was not resorted to , therefore , in case of barrenness or the birth exclusively of female children , nothing was more natural than that polygyny should be resorted to in order to insure the family succession . In the patriarchal family also a high valuation was necessarily set upon children , because the larger the family grew the stronger it was . ( 5 ) Finally , religion came to sanction polygyny . The religious sanction of polygyny can not be looked upon as one of its original causes , but when once established it reacted powerfully to reenforce and maintain the institution . How the religious sanction came about we can readily see when we remember that very commonly religions confuse the practice of the nobility with what is noble or commendable morally . The polygynous practices of the nobility , therefore , under certain conditions came to receive the sanction of religion . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution , very difficult to uproot , as all the experience of Christian missionaries among peoples practicing polygyny goes to show . We may note also the general truth , that while religion does not originate human institutions or the forms of human association , it is preeminently that which gives fixity and stability to institutions through the supernatural sanction that it accords them . // Some judgment of the social value of polygyny may not be out of place in connection with this subject . Admitting , as all students of social history must , that in certain times and places the polygynous form of family has been advantageous , has served the interests of social survival and even of civilization , yet viewed from the standpoint 1 of present society it seems that our judgment of polygyny must be wholly unfavorable . In the first place , as we have already seen , polygyny is essentially an institution of barbarism . It arose largely through the practice of wife capture and the keeping of female slaves . While often adjusted to the requirements of barbarous societies , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , must necessarily rest upon the subjection and degradation of women . Necessarily the practice of polygyny must disregard the feelings of women , for women are jealous creatures as well as men . No high regard for the feelings of women , therefore , would be consistent with the practice of polygyny . Finally , all the evidence that we have goes to show that under polygyny children are neglected , and , at least from the standpoint of a high civilization , inadequately socialized . This must necessarily he so , because in the polygynous family the care of the children rests almost entirely with the mother . While we have no statistics of infant mortality from polygynous countries , it seems probable that infant mortality is high , and social workers in communities with polygynous families quite generally testify that delinquent children are especially found in such households . Fatherhood , in the full sense of the word , can hardly be said to exist under polygyny. // Those philosophers , like Schopenhauer , who advocate the legalizing of polygyny in civilized countries , are hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any widespread practice of polygyny in civilized communities would lead to a reversion to the moral standards of barbarism in many if not in all matters . That polygyny is still a burning question in the United States of the twentieth century is merely good evidence that we are not very far removed yet from barbarism . Monogamy , as we have already seen , has been the prevalent form of marriage in all ages and in all countries . Wherever other forms have existed monogamy has existed alongside of them as the dominant , even though perhaps not the socially honored , form . All other forms of the family must be regarded as sporadic variations , on the whole unsuited to long survival , because essentially inconsistent with the nature of human society . In civilized Europe monogamy has been the only form of the family sanctioned for ages by law , custom , and religion . The leading peoples of the world , therefore , practice monogamy , and it is safe to say that the connection between monogamy and progressive forms of civilization is not an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monogamy which favor the development of a higher type of culture ? These advantages are numerous , but perhaps the most important of them can be grouped under six heads . ( r ) The number of the two sexes , as we have already seen , is everywhere approximately equal . This means that monogamy is in harmony with the biological conditions that exist in the human species . The equal number of the two sexes has probably been established through // natural selection . Why nature should favor this proportion of the sexes can perhaps be in part understood when we reflect that with such proportion there can be the largest number of family groups , and hence the best possible conditions for the rearing of offspring . ( 2 ) Monogamy secures the superior care of children in at least two respects . First , it very greatly decreases mortality in children , because under monogamy both husband and wife unite in their care . Again , monogamy secures the superior upbringing and , therefore , the superior socialization of the child . In the monogamous family much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by both parents . In other forms of the family not only is the death rate higher among children , but from the point of view of modern civilization , at least , they are inferiorly socialized. ( 3 ) The monogamic family alone produces affections and emotions of the higher type . It is only in the monogamic family that the highest type of altruistic affection can be cultivated . It is difficult to understand , for example , how anything like unselfish affection between husband and wife can exist under polygyny . Under monogamy , husband and wife are called upon to sacrifice selfish desires in the mutual care of children . Monogamy is , therefore , fitted as a form of the family to foster altruism in the highest degree , and , as we have seen , the higher the type of altruism produced by the family life , the higher the type of the social life generally , other things being equal . It is especially to the credit of monogamy that it has created fatherhood in the fullest sense of the term , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of service and self-sacrifice . Under polygynous conditions the father can not devote himself to any extent to his children or to any one wife , since he is really the head of several households , and therefore , as we have already noted , fatherhood in the fullest sense scarcely exists under polygyny. ( 4 ) Under monogamy , moreover , all family relationships are more definite and strong , and thus family bonds , and ultimately social bonds , are stronger . In the polygynous household the children of the different wives are half brothers and half sisters , hence family affection has little chance to develop among them , and as a matter of fact between children of different wives there is constant pulling and hauling . Moreover , because the children in a polygynous family are only half brothers this immensely complicates relationships , and even the line of ancestors . Legal relations and all blood relationships are , therefore , more entangled . It is no inconsiderable social merit of monogamy that it makes blood relationships simple and usually perfectly definite . All of this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of blood relationship , even in modern societies , is something still worth taking into account . But of course the main influence of all this is to be found in the family group itself , because it is only under such simple and definite relations as we find in the monogamous family that there is ample stimulus to develop the higher family affections . ( 5 ) From all this it follows that monogamy favors the development of high types of religion and morals , family affection being an indispensable root of any high type of ethical religion . That form of the family which favors the development of the highest type of this affection will , // therefore , favor the development of the highest type of religion . We see this even more plainly , perhaps , in ancient times than in the present time , because it was monogamy that favored the development of ancestor worship through making the line of ancestors clear and definite , and thus monogamy helped to develop this type of religion , which became the basis of still higher types . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of the children , but also favors the preservation of the lives of the parents , because it is only under monogamy that we find aged parents cared for by their children to any extent . Under polygyny the wife who has grown old is discarded for a young wife , and usually ends her days in bitterness . The father , too , under polygyny is rarely cared for by the children , because the polygynous household has never given the opportunity for close affections between parents and children . That monogamy , therefore , helps to lengthen life through favoring care of parents by children in old age is an element in its favor , for it adds not a little to the happiness of life , and so to the strength of social bonds , that people do not have to look forward to a clicerless and friendless old age . In brief , the monogamic family presents such superior unity and harmony from every point of view that it is much more fitted to produce a higher type of culture . From whatever point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many reasons why civilized societies can not afford to sanction any other form of the family than that of monogamy . The Causes which Determine the Form of the Family and Society . ? As we have already seen , the form of the // family is undoubtedly greatly influenced by the form of industry . This is so markedly the case that some sociologists and economists have claimed that the form of the family life is but a reflection of the form of the industrial life ; that the family in its changes and variations slavishly follows the changes in economic conditions . That such . an extreme view as this is a mistake can readily be seen from a brief review of the causes which have produced certain types of family life in certain periods . Thus , the maternal type of the family can not be said by any means to have been determined by economic conditions . On the contrary , primarily the maternal family , as we have seen , was determined by certain intellectual conceptions , namely , the absence of knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of primitive life tended powerfully to continue the maternal family long after intellectual conditions had changed . Again , it has been said that the patriarchal family owed its existence entirely to a form of industry , namely , pastoral industry , but , as we have seen , other factors also operated to produce the patriarchal type of the family , such as war , religion , and perhaps man 's inherent desire to dominate . Moreover , religion continued the patriarchal family in many cases long after pastoral industry had ceased to be the chief economic form . So too with the forms of marriage . While polygyny has been claimed to be due entirely to economic causes , we have seen that these so-called economic causes have only been the opportunities for the polygynous instincts of man to assert themselves . These polygynous instincts of man have asserted themselves more or less // under all conditions of society , but under certain condi-tions , when there was an accumulation of wealth , and especially with the institution of slavery , they had greater opportunity to assert themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not economic , but psycholog-ical ; and given certain moral and economic conditions of . ) society , these polygynous tendencies assert themselves . Monogamy , on the other hand , is fundamentally deter-mined by the biological fact of the numerical equality of the sexes . This is doubtless the main reason why monogamy has been the prevalent form of the family everywhere . Certain moral and psychological factors which go along with the development of higher types of culture have , however , powerfully reenforced monogamy . It is doubt-ful if economic conditions can to any extent be shown to have equally reenforced the monogamic life . Our conclusion must be , then , that the family and all other forms of association are determined , not by the in-dustrial life alone , though that is very influential , but by all the active factors in human association , geographic , economic , intellectual , and moral or cultural . CHAPTER VII THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FAMILY WHILE we can not enter into the historical evolution of the family as an institution among the different civilized peoples , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family among some single representative people in order that we may see the forces which have made and unmade the family life , and incidentally also to a great degree , the general social life of that people . We shall select the ancient Romans as the people among whom we can thus best study in outline the development of the family . While the family life of the ancient Hebrews is of particular interest to us because of the close connection of our religion and ethics with that of the Hebrews , yet in the family life of the ancient Romans constructive and destructive factors are more clearly marked and , therefore , the study of ancient Roman family life is best fitted to bring out those factors . The ancient Romans were among the earliest civilized of the Aryan peoples , and their institutions are , therefore , of peculiar interest to us as representing approximately the early Aryan type . What we shall say concerning Roman family life , moreover , will apply , with some modifications and qualifications , to the family life of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Romans , indeed , were so closely related in their early culture that for the purpose of institutional history they may be considered practically one ' people . Without any attempt , then , to sketch the 131 // history of the family as an institution in general , let us note some of the salient features of the family life of the ancient Romans . The Early Roman Family . ? ( i ) Ancestor Worship as the Basis of the Early Roman Family . What we have said thus far indicates a close connection between the family life and religion among all peoples . This was especially i true of the early Romans . It may be said , indeed , that ancestor worship was the constitutive principle of their family life . Among them the family seemed to have lost in part its character as a purely social institution and to have become specialized into a religious institution . At any rate , the early Roman family existed very largely for the sake of perpetuating the worship of ancestors . Of course , ancestor worship could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life among the Romans . The type of their family life was patriarchal , and we have already noticed the causes which brought about the existence of the patriarchal family . But while ancestor worship had nothing to do with the origin of the family , once it was thoroughly established it became the basis of the family life and transformed the family as an institution . The early Romans shared certain superstitions with many i primitive peoples , which , if not the basis of ancestor worship , powerfully reenforced it . They believed , for example , that the soul continued in existence after death , and that persons would be unhappy unless buried in tombs with suitable offerings , and that if left unburied , or without suitable offerings , the souls of these persons would return to torment the living . Inasmuch as in the patriarchal // family only sons could perform religious rites , that is , could make offerings to the departed spirits , these superstitions acted as a powerful stimulus to preserve the family in order that offerings might continue to be made at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already said , among the early Romans the family was practically a religious institution with ancestor worship as its constitutive principle . It is supposed by de Coulanges that in the earliest times the dead ancestors were buried beneath the hearth . At any rate , the hearth was the place where offerings were made to the departed ancestors , and the flame on the hearth was believed to represent the spirit of the departed . The house under such circumstances became a temple and the whole atmosphere of the family life was necessarily a religious one . ( z ) The Authority in the Early Roman Family was vested , as in all partiarchal families , in the father or eldest living male of the family group . Under ancestor worship he became the living representative of the departed ancestors , the link between the living and the dead . Here we may note that the family was not considered as constituted simply of its living members , but that it included also all of its dead members . Inasmuch as the dead were more numerous and were thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the more important element in the life of the family . The position of the house father , as representative of the departed ancestors , and as the link between the living and the dead , naturally made his authority almost divine . Hence , the house father was himself , then , almost a deity , having absolute power over all persons // within the group , even to the extent of life and death . This absolute power , which was known in the early Roman family as the " patria potestas , " could not , however , be exercised arbitrarily . The house father , as representative of the departed ancestors , was necessarily controlled by religious scruples and traditions . It was impossible for him to act other than for what he believed to be the will of the ancestors . Disobedience to him was , therefore , disobedience to the divine ancestors , and hence was sacrilegious. ( 3 ) Relationship in the Early Roman Family was determined by community of worship , inasmuch as only descendants upon the male side could perform religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods of their husbands ' ancestors ; therefore , only descendants on the male Fide could worship the same ancestors and were relatives in the full religious and legal sense . These were known as " agnates . " Later , some relationship on the mother 's side came to be recognized , but relatives on the mother 's side were known as " cognates , " and for a long time property could not pass to them . Indeed , in the earliest times the property of the family , as we have already implied , was kept as a unit , held in trust by the eldest living member of the family group for the good of all the family . In other words , the house father in earliest times did not possess the right to make a will but the property of the family passed intact from him to his eldest male heir . ( 4 ) The Marriage Ceremony among the Early Romans was necessarily of a religious character . It was constituted essentially of the induction of the bride into the worHISTORICAL // ship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the bride 's father had first to free her from the worship of her household gods , in later times a certificate of manumission being given not unlike the manumission of the slave . After the bride had been released from the worship of her father 's ancestors , the bridegroom and his friends brought her to his father 's house , where a ceremony of adoption was practically gone through with , adopting the bride into the family of her husband . The essence of this ceremony , as we have already said , was the induction of the bride into the worship of her husband 's ancestors through their both making an offering on the family hearth and eating a sacrificial meal together . After that the wife worshiped at her husband 's altar and had no claim upon the household gods of her father . ( 5 ) Divorce . Under such circumstances it is not surprising that marriage was practically indissoluble . A wife who was driven out of her husband 's household or deserted was without family gods of any sort , having no claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a social outcast . Under such circumstances it is not surprising that divorce was practically unknown . It is said , indeed , that for five hundred and twenty years after Rome was founded there was not a single divorce in Rome . While this may be an exaggeration , it is historically certain that divorce was so rare in early Rome as to be practically unknown . ( 6 ) Adoption . In case of a failure of sons to be born there was no taking of a second wife , as among the Hebrews . Polygyny was unknown in early Rome . The Roman device to prevent the failure of the family succession was adoption . Younger sons of other families were adopted i36 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FAMILY if no sons were born , and these adopted sons , taking the family name , became the same legally as sons by birth . Inasmuch as the position of younger sons in the patriarchal household was not an enviable one there was never lack of candidates for the position of eldest son in some family group in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Roman family life the most stable that the world has ever known , but it was also of a relatively pure type . Chastity was rigidly enforced among the women , but of course , as in all primitive peoples , was not enforced among the men . Still it was expected that 9 the married men at least should remain relatively faithful to their wives . On the whole , therefore , the early Roman family life must be judged to have been of a singularly high and stable type . While the position of women and children in the early Roman family was one of subjection , the family itself was nevertheless of a high type . ( 7 ) The Decadence . But it was inevitable that this type of family should decay , and this decay began comparatively early . Inasmuch as the early Roman family was based upon ancestor worship , a religion which was fitted for relatively small isolated groups , it was inevitable that the family life should decay with this ancestor worship . How early the decay of ancestor worship began it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter , Venus , and the rest , existed alongside of ancestor worship from the earliest times . At any rate , we find their worship growing rapidly within the period of authentic history and undermining the domestic worship , while at a still later period skeptical philosophy undermined both religions . Along with the decay of ancestor worship went many economic // and political changes which marked the dissolution of the patriarchal family . Let us see what some of the first steps in this decadence were . ( 8 ) Steps in the Decadence . ( a ) One of the earliest steps toward the breaking down of the patriarchal family which we find is the limiting of the power of the house father . This took place very early ? as soon as the Council of Elders , or Senate , was formed to look after matters of collective interest . Gradually the paternal power diminished , until it was confined to matters concerning the family group proper . ( b ) A second step was when the right to make a will was conceded . This right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest Roman times , but with the development of property and of a more complex economic life the house father was given the right to divide his property among his children , at first only on the male side , but later among any of his children , and still later to bequeath it to whom he pleased . ( c ) Thus women came to be given the right to hold property , a thing which was unknown in the earliest times ; and becoming property holders , their other rights in many respects began to increase . Originally the wife had no right to divorce her husband , but in the second century B.C. women also gained the right of divorcing their husbands . ( d ) The rights of children were increased along with the rights of women , particularly of younger children . ( e ) The right of plebeians to intermarry with the noble families became recognized . All of these changes we should perhaps regard as good in themselves , but they // nevertheless marked the disintegration of the patriarchal family . The decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , but went on to the decay of the family bonds themselves . Later Roman Family Life . ? By the beginning of the Christian era the relations between the sexes had become very loose . Men not only frequently divorced their wives , but women frequently divorced their husbands . Indeed , a complete revolution passed over the Roman family . Marriage became a private contract , whereas , as we have seen , in the beginning it was a religious bond . Many loose forms of marriage were developed , which amounted practically to temporary marriages . In all cases it was easy for a husband or wife to divorce each other for very trivial causes . Among certain classes of Roman society the instability of the family became so great that we find Seneca saying that there were women who reckoned their years by their husbands , and Juvenal recording one woman as having eight husbands in five years . Women and children achieved their practical emancipation , as we would say . Women , especially , were free to do as they saw fit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and among all classes the instability of the family life had become very great . Along with all this , of course , went a growth of vice . It is not too much to say that the Romans of the first and second centuries A.D. approached as closely to a condition of promiscuity as any civilized people of which we have knowledge . Causes of the Decadence . When we examine the causes // of this great revolution in Roman family life from the austere morals and stable family of the early Romans to the laxity and promiscuity of the later Romans , we find that these causes can perhaps be grouped under four or five principal heads . ( i ) First among all the causes we must put the destruction of the domestic religion , namely , ancestor worship , through the growth of nature worship and skeptical philosophy . The destruction of the domestic religion necessarily shattered the foundations of the Roman family , since , as we have already seen , there was the closest connection between the family life of the early Romans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship was destroyed merely through the growth of nature worship and of skeptical philosophy . As we have already seen , it was a religion which was mainly adapted to isolated groups . Changes in economic and political conditions , therefore , were to some extent prior to the decay of the domestic religion . ( 2 ) Changes in economic conditions , that is , in the form of industry , were , then , among the more important causes of the decay of the early Roman family . The patriarchal family belonged essentially to the pastoral stage of industry , and as soon as settled agricultural life , commerce , and manufacturing industry developed , this destroyed the isolated patriarchal groups , and so also in time affected even the religion which was their basis . Again , the growth of cities going along with these changes in the methods in obtaining a living destroyed the old conditions under which the family had been the social and political unit . ( 3 ) We have therefore as a third cause the breaking up of old political conditions . Family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the patriarch was destroyed . Legislation designed to meet the new social conditions , especially such as we have already noted in the steps of the decadence , profoundly affected the whole family group and weakened family bonds . ( 4 ) The growth of divorce and of vice may be put down ? as a fourth cause of the decay of the Roman family . Some may say that this was an effect of the decay of the Roman family rather than a cause , but it was also a cause as well as an effect , for it is a peculiarity of social life that what is at one stage an effect reacts to become a cause at a later stage ; and this was certainly the case with the growth of divorce and vice in Rome , in its effect upon the Roman family . Moreover , much of this came from Greece through imitation . The family life had decayed in Greece much earlier than it had in Rome , and when Rome conquered Greece it annexed its vices also . While the most radical social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the imitation of a foreign people is frequently , in the history of a particular nation , one of the most potent causes in bringing about social changes . It was certainly so in the case of the growth of divorce and vice in Rome . The Causes of Social Change . ? We see that the causes , of the decay of the Roman family life were very complex . This is true of all important social changes . It is impossible to reduce the causes of these changes to any single principle or set of causes . While changes in economic conditions were undoubtedly very influential in bringing about the profound changes in the Roman family , still we have no ground for regarding the economic changes as determinative of all the rest . We know as yet little of the development of industry HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FAMILY 14r in antiquity . What little we do know , however , furnishes good ground for claiming that changes in the methods of getting a living are among the most influential causes of social change in general ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marx and his followers , " that the method of the production of the material life determines the social , political , and spiritual life process in general . " On the contrary , the evolution of the Roman family clearly shows moral and psychological factors at work quite independent of economic causes . The decay of ancestor worship , for example , can not be wholly attributed to the change in the method of getting a living . The very growth of population and accompanying changes in political conditions probably had quite as much to do with the undermining of ancestor worship . Moreover , while religion may not be an original determining cause of social forms , it is , nevertheless , as we have already seen , especially that which gives them stability and permanency , so much so that the life history of a culture is frequently the life history of a religion . The decay of religious ideas and beliefs , therefore , from any cause , frequently proves the important element working for social change in all societies . So , too , changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frequently prove a profound modifying influence in societies . Lastly , there are certain moral causes inherent in the individual , oftentimes involving perverted expressions of instinct , which lead to profound social changes . Such was the vice which Rome copied very largely from Greece , but which proved the final solvent in its family life . // In general we may say , then , that there is no single principle which will explain the evolution of the family from the earliest times down to the present . Any attempt to reduce the evolution of the family to a single principle , or to show that it has been controlled by a single set of causes , must inevitably end in failure . The economic ) determinism of Marx and his followers , the ideological conceptions of Hegel , the geographical influences of Buckle and his school , and like explanations , are all found wanting when they are applied to the actual history of the family . It is not different with the theories of recent sociologists , who would strive to explain all social changes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Habit , " " Environment , " " Imitation , " and " Consciousness of Kind " will not go further in explaining the changes in the family life than some of the older principles that we have just mentioned . Human life is , indeed , too complex to be explained in terms of any single principle or any single set of causes . The family in particular is an organic structure which responds first to one set of stimuli and then to another . Now it is modified by economic conditions , now by religious ideas , now by legislation , now by imitation , and so on through the whole set of possible stimuli which may impinge upon and modify the activity of a living organism . So it is with all institutions . The Influence of Christianity upon the Family . ? While we can not study further the evolution of the family in any detail , still it is necessary , in order to avoid too great discontinuity , to notice in a few sentences the influence of Christianity upon the family in Western civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the // family life of the Greco-Roman world demoralized . The reconstruction of the family became , therefore , one of the first tasks of the new religion , and while other circumstances may have aided the church in this work , still on the whole it was mainly the influence of the early church that reconstituted the family life . From the first the church worked to abolish divorce , and fought as evil such vices as concubinage and prostitution , that came to flourish to such an extent in the Pagan world . Only very slowly did the early leaders of the church win the mass of the people to accepting their views as to the permanency of the marriage bond . In order to aid in making this bond more stable the early church recognized marriage as one of the sacraments , and , as implied , steadily opposed the idea of the later Roman Law that marriage was simply a private contract . The result was , eventually , that marriage came to be regarded again as a religious bond , and the family life took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church had come fully into power in the Western world , legal divorce ceased to be recognized and legal separation was substituted in its stead . Thus the church succeeded in reconstituting the family life upon a stable basis , but the family after being reconstituted , was of a semipatriarchal type . Nothing was more natural than this , for the church had no model to go by except the paternal family of the Hebrew and Greek and Roman civilization . Nevertheless , the place of women and children in this semipatriarchal religious family established by the church was higher on the whole than in the ancient patriarchal family . The church put an end to the exposure of children , which had been common in Rome , and protected childhood in many ways . It also exalted the // place of woman in the family , though leaving her subject to her husband . The veneration of the Virgin tended par ticularly to give women an honored place socially and religiously . Only by the advocacy and practice of ascetic doctrines may the early church be said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the whole the reconstituting of the family by the church must be regarded as its most striking social work . But the thing for us to note particularly is that the type of the family life created by the church was what we might call a semi-patriarchal type , in which the importance of husband and father was very much out of proportion to all the rest of the members of the family group . It was this semi-patriarchal family which persisted down to the nineteenth century . CHAPTER VIII THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY PASSING over the changes which affected the family during the Middle Ages , and the still more striking changes which came through the Reformation , let us now turn to the study of the problem of the family in the modem world . Peculiarities of Modern Civilization . ? We must note first some of the great movements which have made modem civilization what it is in its moral aspects . The first of these is the rise of individualism and the decline of authority . This movement began , or rather had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter years of the eighteenth century it culminated in the French Revolution , and in the subsequent rise of political democracy among all European peoples . This growth of individualism and decline of authority has continued down to the present , until both religious and political authority are perhaps less in the civilized world of to-day than ever before in the history of Western civilization . The result of this upon the family has been that the authoritative type of the family has tended to disappear . The religious theory of the family which prevailed during the Middle Ages , but which was more or less undermined by the Reformation , has given place among large classes of the population to the view that marriage is a private contract . This view of the family has even been embodied to a large extent in our laws . 145 // The second great influence which has affected modern civilization is the revolution in industry , owing to the invention of machinery and the rise of the factory system . This has tended , as we have already seen , to destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their economic activities . The individual , in other words , has become the unit in production as well as the political unit . This has tended to destroy the social , ' cohesion between the members of the family group and has even to some extent placed the sexes in competition with each other . A third influence greatly affecting modern civilization has been the enormous growth of wealth which has resulted from the introduction of machine industry . While this wealth has not extended to all classes of society , it has emancipated certain classes from the fear of want , a factor which in the past put an effective restraint upon conduct . The growth of wealth , in other words , has favored , in certain classes at least , lower moral standards , and increasing laxity in family relations . Owing to these and many minor causes the nineteenth century was a period of great social change and unrest . It was a period of social disintegration and of social reconstruction , as yet far from complete . Now , in such periods of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest themselves , until some new basis for a stable social order can be found . While the forces making for social dissolution manifested themselves comparatively late in the family , the modern family has suddenly found itself confronted with the need of social readjustment and in the midst of change and confusion . // The Problem of the Family . ? Thus it happens that we find the family life at the beginning of the twentieth century in a more unstable condition than it has been at any time since the beginning of the Christian Era . Now , any great instability of the family is manifestly inconsistent with the idea of permanent monogamy . Hence the problem of the modern family is whether permanent monogamy shall continue to exist or to be the standard in Western civilization . There are many who do not hesitate to say that the family , in its present form of permanent monogamy , will soon pass away . While such a statement is wholly unwarranted from a scientific standpoint , the student of the family can not fail to see that the crux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instability . The legal expression of the instability of the family is to be seen in divorce . If the whole problem of the modern family centers in the matter of its instability , then the study of the divorce movement should throw more light upon the condition of the modern family than the study of anything else . Just how far we have gone already toward getting rid of permanent monogamy as the standard in modern society will be more or less evident from the divorce statistics . However , the student must bear in mind that divorce statistics never adequately measure the instability of the family life , for divorce is only the legal expression of such instability . In every community a certain number of marriages are dissolved without the formality of legal divorce . Among the very poorest class in American cities , it is found that illegal desertion is about four times as common as legal divorce . Hence it would probably be not far from the facts if we should add 20 per cent to // the number of divorces granted to get an approximate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . As we have just implied , the instability of the modern family is most evident in the United States . This is due in part to the freedom with which legal divorce has been granted in the United States ; but it is also due in part to the fact that American society has exaggerated the in dividualism and industrialism which are characteristic of Western civilization in general . Hence , although the dis integration of the family characterizes more or less all modern civilization , it is particularly American conditions that will concern us , because they illustrate best the tendencies of modern society in respect to the family . Without devoting too much time to the consideration of divorce statistics in their technical aspects , let us note , then , some of the main outlines of the modern divorce movement in this and other civilized countries . Statistics of Divorce in the United States and Other Civilized Countries . ? For a long time the United States has led the world in the number of its divorces . Already in 1885 this country had more divorces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . These statistics of the number of divorces granted in different civilized countries in 1885 ( taken from Professor W. F. Willcox 's monograph on The Divorce Problem ) are of sufficient interest to cite at length : // In 1905 the United States had nearly 68,000 divorces while all of the rest of the Christian civilized world together had less than 40,000 . While the number of divorces has greatly increased in the meantime in all civilized nations , it is evident from the above figures that the United States retains its relative position in regard to divorce . The above statistics show that in Japan there was one divorce to eight marriages , in Switzerland one to sixteen , in Austria one to seventeen , in France one to twenty-one , in Denmark one to twenty-two , in Germany one to twenty-four , in New Zealand one to twenty-four , in Norway one to thirty , in Sweden one to thirty-three , in Great Britain one to ninety-six , in Canada one to one hundred and sixty-one ; but in the United States the rate in 1922 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was one divorce It will be noted that in this particular year ( 1885 ) , when the United States had 23,472 divorces , all the other countries mentioned together had only 20,131 . The following statistics are available for the years indicated : // to every 2.6 marriages , in Wyoming one to 3.9 , in Montana one to 4.3 , in Missouri one to 4.7 , in Texas one to 4.9 , in Oklahoma one to 4.8 , in California one to 5.1 , in Ohio one to 5.2 , in Indiana one to 5.4 , in Colorado one to 5.5 , in Kansas one to 5.7 , in Maine one to 5.8 . While these rates are those of some of the states in which divorce is most common , yet the number of states in which the divorce rate ranges from one to every five marriages to one to eight marriages are so numerous that they may be said to be fairly representative of American conditions . The divorce census for 1916 gave returns very similar to those of 1922 , except that in the intervening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1916 the number of divorces granted was 112,036 , or one divorce to every nine marriages . Some states in 1916 , however , had higher divorce rates than in 1922 . Thus in Oregon in 1916 there was one divorce to 2.5 marriages and in Washington one to 4 marriages . Increase of Divorces in the United States . Not only does the United States lead the world in the number of its divorces , but apparently divorces are increasing in this country much more rapidly than the population . In 1867 , the first year for which statistics for the country as a whole were gathered , there were 9937 divorces in the United States , but by 1922 , the last year for which we have statistics , the total number of divorces granted in this country , yearly , had reached 148,554 . Again , from 1867 to 1886 there were 328,716 divorces granted in the United States , but during the next twenty years , from 1887 to 1906 , the number reached 945,625 , or almost a total of 1,000,000 divorces granted in twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of divorces increased 16o per cent , while the population increased only about 45 per cent ; from 1906 to 1922 the number of divorces increased over 106 per cent , while the population increased about 28 per cent . Thus it appears that divorces are now increasing in the United States four times as fast as the increase of population . It becomes , therefore , a matter of some curious interest to speculate upon what will be the end of this movement . If divorces should continue to increase as they have increased during the past fifty years , it is evident that it would not be long before more marriages would be terminated by divorce than by death . In 1870 , 3.5 per cent of all marriages were terminated by divorce ; in 1900 , 8.1 per cent were terminated by divorce ; and in 1922 , over 13 per cent . Professor Willcox has estimated that if this increasing divorce rate continues , by 1950 one fourth of all marriages in the United States will be terminated by divorce , and in 1990 one half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a time when , if present tendencies continue , the family , as a permanent union between husband and wife , lasting until death , shall cease to be . At least , it is safe to say that in a population where one half of all marriages will be terminated by divorce the social conditions would be no better than those in the Rome of the decadence . We can not imagine such a state of affairs without the existence alongside of it of widespread promiscuity , neglect of childhood , and general social demoralization . Without , however , stopping at this point to discuss the results or the effects of the divorce movement upon society , let us now consider for a moment I52 THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY how these divorces are distributed among the various elements and classes of our population . Distribution of Divorces . It is usually thought by those who have observed the matter most carefully that divorce especially characterizes the wealthy classes and the laboring classes , but is least common among the middle classes . We have no statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is substantially correct . The divorce statistics ' which we have , however , indicate certain striking differences in the distribution of divorces by classes and communities . ( I ) The divorce rate is higher in the cities than in their surrounding country districts . The statistics show , for example , that in many cities in the Central West the divorce rates are much higher than in the states in which they are situated . Exceptions to this generalization are cities in which a large proportion of the population are Roman Catholic or of foreign birth . ( 2 ) The census statistics show that apparently the divorce rate is about four times as high among childless couples as among couples that have children . This doubtless does not mean that domestic unhappiness is four times more common in families where there are no children than in families that have children , but it does show , nevertheless , that the parental instinct is now , as in primitive times , a powerful force to bind husband and wife together . ( 3 ) While we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of divorces is among the various religious denominations , still we know that because the Roman Catholic Church is strongly against divorce , divorces are very rare in that denomination . In Switzerland , where the number of divorces among Protestants and // Catholics has been noted , it is found that divorces are four times as common among Protestants as among Catholics . Some observers in this country have claimed that divorces are most common among those of no religious profession , next most common among Protestants , next among Jews , and least common among Roman Catholics . ( 4 ) From this we might expect , as our statistics indicate , that the divorce rate is much higher among the native whites in this country than it is among the foreign born , for many of the foreign born are Roman Catholics , and , in any case , they come from countries where divorce is less common than in the United States . ( 5 ) For the last forty years two thirds of all divorces have been granted on demand of the wife . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of divorces is a movement connected with the emancipation of woman , and on the other hand it may indicate that it is the husband who usually gives the ground for divorce . ( 6 ) The census statistics show three great centers of divorce in the United States . One is the New England States , one the states of the Central West , and one the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states . These three centers are also typical centers of American institutions and ideas . The individualism of the New England , the Central West , and the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast regions has always been marked in comparison with some other sections of the country . But during the last twenty years divorce has also been increasing rapidly in the Southern states , and we now find such states as Texas , Arkansas , and Oklahoma well up toward the front among the states with a high divorce rate . // This distribution of divorces among the various elements and classes of the country suggests something as to the causes of divorce , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes of the increase of divorce . The Grounds for Granting Divorce . ? There are no less than thirty-six distinct grounds for absolute divorce recognized by the laws of the several states , ranging from only one ground recognized in New York to fourteen grounds recognized in New Hampshire . For this reason some have supposed that many of the divorces in this country are granted on comparatively trivial grounds . Several states have , for example , what is known as an " Omnibus Clause , " granting divorce for mere incompatibility and the like . But the examination of divorce statistics shows that very few divorces are granted on trivial grounds . On the contrary , most divorces seem to be granted for grave reasons , such as adultery , desertion , cruelty , imprisonment for crime , habitual drunkenness , and neglect on the part of the husband to provide for his family . These are usually recognized as grave reasons for the dissolution of the marriage tie . None of them at least could be said to be trivial . Professor Willcox showed that for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of all divorces were granted for these six principal causes . Moreover , he also showed that over sixty per cent were granted for the two most serious causes of all , ? adultery and desertion . Again , of the one million divorces granted from 1887 to 1906 over ninety-four per cent were granted for the six principal causes and over fifty-five per cent for adultery and desertion , while in still other cases adultery and desertion figured in combination with other causes ( a total of over // sixty-two per cent in all ) . Therefore , it seems probable that in nearly two thirds of the cases the marriage bond had already practically been dissolved before the courts stepped in to make the dissolution formal . We must conclude , therefore , that divorce is prevalent not because of the laxity of our laws , but rather because of the decay of our family life ; that divorce is but a symptom of the disintegration of the modern family , particularly the American family . In other words , divorce is but a symptom of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American society apparently undermined the very virtues upon which the family life subsists . This is not saying that vice is more prevalent to-day than it was fifty years ago . We have no means of knowing whether it is or not , and there may well be a difference of opinion upon such a subject . It is the opinion of some eminent authorities that there has been no growth of vice in the United States along with the growth of divorce , but this would seem to be doubtful . The very causes for which divorce is granted suggest a demoralization of certain classes . While there may not have been , therefore , any general growth of vice in the United States along with the growth of divorce , it is conceivable that it may have increased greatly in certain classes of American society . Be this as it may , it is not necessary to assume that there has been any growth of vice in the American population , for if actual moral practices are no higher than they were fifty years ago that alone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family life . It is an important truth in sociology that the morality which suffices for a relatively simple social life , largely // rural , such as existed in this country fifty years ago , is not sufficient for a more complex society which is largely urban , such as exists at the present time . Moreover , recognized moral standards within the past fifty years have largely been raised through the growth of general intelligence . It follows that immoral acts , which were condoned fifty years ago and which produced but slight social effect , to-day meet with great reprobation and have far greater social consequences than a generation ago . This is particularly true of the standards which the wife imposes upon the husband . For centuries , as we have already seen , the husband has secured divorce for adultery of the wife , but for centuries no divorce was given to the wife for the adultery of the husband ; and this is even true to-day in modern England , unless the adultery of the husband be accompanied by other flagrant violations of morality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife overlooked , therefore , a generation ago , is to-day sufficient to disrupt the family bonds and become a ground for the granting of a divorce . Even if vice , then , has not increased in our population , if moral practices are no higher to-day than fifty years ago , we should expect that this alone would have far different consequences now than then . The growth of intelligence and of higher and more complex forms of social organization necessitates realization of higher standards of conduct if the institutions of society are to retain their stability . But there are grave reasons for believing that there has been in certain classes of society a decay of the very virtues upon which the family rests , for the family life requires not only chastity , but even more the virtues of self-sacrifice , loyalty , obedience , and self-subordination . Now there is // abundant evidence to show that these particular virtues which belong to a self-subordinating life are those which have suffered most in the changes and new adjustments of modern society . We have replaced these virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Causes of the Increase of Divorce in the United States . ? Let us note somewhat more in detail the causes of the increased instability of the American family during the past four or five decades . We have already in a rough way indicated some of these causes in studying the distribution of divorce and the grounds upon which it is granted . But the causes of the instability of the family so affect our whole social life and all of our institutions that they are well worth somewhat more detailed study . ( r ) As the first of these causes of the increase of divorce in the United States we should put the decay of religion , particularly of the religious theory of marriage and the family . As we have already seen , no stable family life has existed anywhere in history without a religious basis , but within the last few decades religious sentiments , beliefs , and ideals have become largely dissociated from marriage and the family , and the result is that many people regard the institutions of marriage and the family as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious view of the marriage bond has , however , had other antecedent causes , partly in the moral and intellectual spirit of our civilization , partly in our industrial conditions . ( 2 ) We should put , therefore , as a second cause of the increase of divorces in this country the growing spirit x58 THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY of individualism . By individualism we mean here the spirit of self-assertion and self-interest , the spirit which leads a man to find his law in his own wishes , or even in his whims and caprices . Now , this growing spirit of individual-ism is undoubtedly more destructive of the social life than anything else . It makes unstable all institutions , and espe-cially the family , because the family must rest upon very opposite characteristics . Our laissez-faire democracy , our industrial organization , and our unsocialized education have all been responsible to some extent for making the in-dividual take his own interests and wishes as his law . ( 3 ) Moreover , this individualism has spread within the last fifty years especially among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , known in its moderate phases as the " Woman 's Movement " and in its more radical phases as " Feminism . " The woman 's move-ment has accompanied and in part effected the eman-cipation of women legally , mentally , and economically . The result is that women , as a class , have become as much individualized as the men , and oftentimes are as great practical individualists . No one would claim that the emancipation of woman , in the sense of freeing her from those things which have prevented the highest and best development of her per-sonality , is not desirable . But this emancipation of woman has brought with it certain opportunities for going down as well as for going up . Woman 's emancipation has not , in other words , meant to all classes of women , woman 's elevation . On the contrary , it has been to some , if not an opportunity for license , at least an opportunity for self-assertion and selfishness not consistent with the welfare // of society and particularly with the stability of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women achieved complete emancipation , but they did not thereby better their social position . On the contrary , the emancipation of woman in Rome meant woman 's degradation , and ultimately the demoralization of Roman , family life . While this is not necessarily an accompaniment of woman 's emancipation , still it is a real danger which threatens , and of which we can already see many evidences in modern society ) As in all other emancipatory movements , the dangers of freedom are found for some individuals at least to be quite as great as the dangers of subjection . That the woman 's movement has had much to do with the growth of divorce in this country gains substantiation from the fact that many of the leaders of that movement , especially the more radical like Mrs. Gilman and Miss Ellen Key , have advocated free divorce , and their inculcation of this doctrine certainly could not have been without some effect . But the woman 's movement would have perhaps failed to develop , or at least failed of widespread support , if it had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her of many new industrial callings and the securing for her a certain measure of economic independence . This , again , while perhaps a good thing in itself , has , nevertheless , facilitated the growing tendency to form unstable family relations . But this economic independence of woman , we need hardly remark , is the necessary and , indeed , inevitable outcome of modern industrial development . // ( 4 ) The growth of modern industrialism must , then , be regarded as one of the fundamental factors which has brought about the increase of divorce in the United States . By industrialism we mean manufacturing industry . As we have already noticed , the growth of manufacturing industry has opened a large number of new economic . callings to woman and has rendered her largely economically independent of family relations . Moreover , the labor of women in factories has tended to disrupt the home , particularly in the case of married women , as we have already seen . For the laboring classes it has tended to make the home only a lodging place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , such labor has set the sexes in competition with each other , has tended to reduce their sexual differences and to stimulate immensely their individualism . Finally , inasmuch as modern industrialism has tended to destroy the home , the result has been the production of unsocialized children , and especially of those that had no tradition of a family life . Girls , for example , through industrialism , have failed to learn the domestic arts , failed to have any training in homemaking , and therefore when they came to the position of wife and mother , they were frequently not fitted for such a life , and through their lack of adjustment rendered the homes which they formed unstable . ( s ) Closely connected with the growth of modern industrialism is the growth of modern cities , and , as we have already seen , divorce is usually much more common in the cities than in the rural districts . The growth of the cities , in other words , has been a cause of the increase of divorce . City populations , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are peculiarly homeless . A normal home can scarcely exist in the slums and in some of the tenement districts of our cities . Again , in the city there is perhaps more vice and other immorality , less control of the individual by public opinion , and more opportunity , on account of close living together and high standards of living , for friction , both within and without the domestic circle . ( 6 ) The higher standards of living and comfort which have come with the growth of our industrial civilization , especially of our cities , must also be set down as a cause of increasing instability of the family . High standards of living are , of course , desirable if they can be realized , that is , if they are reasonable . But many elements of our population have standards of living and comfort which they find are practically impossible to realize with the income which they have . Many classes , in other words , are unable to meet the social demands which they suppose they must meet in order to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , with these rising standards of living , and also within the last decade or two with the rising cost of living , requires such a large income that an increasingly smaller proportion of the population are able to do this satisfactorily . From this cause , undoubtedly , a great deal of domestic misery and unhappiness results , which finally shows itself in desertion or in the divorce court . It is evident that higher standards of taste and higher standards of morality may also operate under certain circumstances to render the family life unstable in a similar way . // ( 7 ) Directly connected with these last mentioned causes is another cause , ? the higher age of marriage . Some have thought that a low age of marriage was more prolific in divorces than a relatively high age of marriage . But a low age of marriage can not be a cause of the increase of divorce in the United States , because the proportion of immature marriages in most classes is steadily lessening , that is , the age of marriage has been increasing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marriage has gone increasing divorce ; and there may possibly be some connection between the two facts . As we have already seen , the higher standards of living make later marriage necessary . Men in the professions do not think of marriage nowadays until thirty , or until they have an independent income . Now , how may the higher age of marriage possibly increase the instability of the family ? It may do so in this way . After thirty , psychologists tell us , one 's habits are relatively fixed and hard to change . People who marry after thirty , therefore , usually find greater difficulty in adjusting themselves to each other than people who marry somewhat younger ; and every marriage necessarily involves an adjustment of individuals to each other . This being so , we can readily understand that late marriages are more apt to result in faulty adjustments in the family relation than marriages that take place in early maturity . ( 8 ) Another cause of the increase of divorce in the United States that has been given is the popularization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law was once the prerogative of special classes , and courts were rarely appealed to except by the // noble or wealthy classes ; but with the . growth of democratic institutions there has been a great spread of legal education , especially through the modern newspaper , and consequently a greater participation in the remedies offered by the courts for all sorts of wrongs , real or imagined . Many people , for example , who would not have thought of divorce a generation ago , now know how divorce may be secured and are ready to secure it . However , it would seem as though this cause of the increase of divorce might have operated to a greater extent twentyfive or thirty years ago than it has during the last two decades , for it can not be said that since the nineties there has been much increase of legal education among the masses , or much greater popularization of the law . ( q ) Increasing laxity of the laws regarding divorce and increasing laxity in the administration of the laws has certainly been a cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these causes doubtless lie all the other causes just mentioned , and also increasing laxity in public opinion regarding marriage and divorce . To assume that laxity of the laws and of legal administration has no influence upon the increase of divorce in a poplation is to go contrary to all human experience . The people of Canada and of England , for example , are not very different from ourselves in culture and in institutions , yet there is almost no divorce in England and in Canada as compared with the United States . Canada has a few dozen divorces annually , while we have over seventy thousand . Unquestionably the main cause of this great difference between Canada and the United States is to be found in the difference of their laws . This is not saying , // however , that instability of the family does not characterize Canada and England as well as the United States , even though such instability does not express itself in the divorce courts . Interesting statistics have been collected in numerous places in the country to show the laxity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce courts of our large cities , for example , it has repeatedly been shown that the average time occupied by the court in granting a divorce is not more than fifteen minutes . In other words , divorce cases are frequently rushed through our divorce courts without solemnity , without adequate investigation , with every opportunity for collusion between the parties , so as to favor a very free granting of divorces . On the other hand , about one fourth of all the applications for divorce which come to trial are refused by the courts , showing that the courts are not so lax in all cases as they are sometimes pictured to be . Moreover , the divorce courts have two excuses for their laxity . First , the divorce courts are always greatly overburdened with the number of cases before them ; and , secondly , public opinion , which the courts as well as other phases of our government largely reflect , favors this laxity . This is shown by the fact that public opinion stands back of the lax divorce statutes of many states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years . ( ro ) Our study of the family has accustomed us to the thought that the family is an institution which , like all other human institutions , undergoes constant changes . Now at periods of change in any institution , periods of // transition from one type to another , there is apt to be a period of confusion . The old type of institution is never replaced at once by a new type of institution ready-made and adjusted to the social life , but only gradually does the new institution emerge from the elements of the old . In the meantime , however , there may be a considerable period of confusion and anarchy . This social principle , we may note , rests upon the deeper psychological principle , that old habits are usually not replaced by new habits without an intervening period of confusion and uncertainty . In other words , in the transition from the old habit to the new habit there is much opportunity for disorganization and disintegration . It is exactly so in human society , because social institutions are but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family , which prevailed down to the beginning of the nineteenth century , the type of the family which we might perhaps properly call the monarchical type , has been disappearing for the past one hundred years , ? is in fact already practically extinct , at least in America , but we have not yet built up a new type of the family to take its place . The old semipatriarchal family of our forefathers has gone , but no new type of the family has yet become general . A democratic type of the family in harmony with our democratic civilization must be evolved . But such a democratic type of the family can be stable only upon the condition that its stability is within itself and not without . Authority in various coercive forms made the old type of the family stable , but a stable basis for a new type of the family has not yet been found , or rather it has not been found by large elements of our population . Un166 THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY questionably a democratic ethical type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are respected and all members are bound together , not through fear or through force of authority , but through love and affection , is being evolved in certain classes of our society . The problem before our civilization is whether such a democratic ethical type of the family can become generalized and offer a stable family life to our whole population . It is evident that in order to do this there must be a considerable development , not only of the spirit of equality , but even more , a considerable development of social intelligence and ethical character in the minds of the people . To construct a stable family life of this character , however , which is apparently the only type which will meet the demands of modern civilization , ? is not an impossibility , but is a delicate and difficult task which will require all the resources of the state , the school , and the church . There is , however , no ground as yet for pessimism regarding the future of our family life ; rather all its instability and demoralization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the achievement of a higher type of the family than the world has yet seen . Such a higher type , however , will not come about without thought and effort or without wise social leadership . The Reconstruction of the Family . ? That instability of the family and divorce , so far as it is an expression of that instability , is an evil in society is implied in all that has thus far been said concerning the origin , development , and functions of the family as an institution . While all the preceding chapters amount to an argument on this question , a word further may not be out of place . // It is often said by those who favor free divorce , that such divorce will prevent immorality in society ; but it must be pointed out that this has not been the experience in other countries and ages than our own . As we have already seen , in proportion as divorce grew in Rome , for example , sexual immorality of all sorts increased . Weak family ties seem to encourage lax relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society of the sanctity of the marriage bond . Again , those who advocate free divorce claim that such free divorce is for the benefit of the children as well as of the husband and wife . While it may be admitted that in many cases it is desirable to dissolve the family bonds for the sake of the children , still all investigations seem to show that the instability of the family is itself one of the greatest sources of child delinquency and dependency in those communities where such instability is pronounced . In an investigation made by the writer in the year 1909 , it was found that out of 7575 children in thirty-four State Reform Schools , 29.6 per cent came from families in which there had been divorce or desertion , 33 per cent in which either father or mother were dead , while 38 per cent ( including a few cases which overlapped the first two classes ) came from homes demoralized by drink , vice , or crime . In only a negligible per cent of the cases did these Reform School children have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four juvenile courts , it was found that 23.7 per cent of this number came from families in which father and mother were separated by desertion or divorce , while 27.8 per cent came from families in which one or both parents were dead . Even in thirty-two institutions for dependent children it // was found that 24.7 per cent of the inmates were from homes in which there had been desertion or divorce , while only 47.5 per cent were either orphans or half orphans . Many other statistics have been collected by social workers showing that apparently the children of separated or divorced parents are much more apt to drift into poverty , vice , or crime , that is , into the unsocialized classes , than children i who do not come from such disrupted homes . The general conclusion of social workers is that a normal family life in which the child has the care of both parents is the best possible guarantee for the proper adjustment of the child to society ; for hitherto all experiments in the proper care and upbringing of children in institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not warranted , therefore , in drawing any other conclusion than that the welfare of the child as well as the moral character of adults is bound up with the stability of the family . If the real evil is not so much divorce as the decay of the family life , however , it is idle to suppose that superficial remedies will suffice . Nothing short of radical social reconstruction , such as will put an end to all of the disintegrating influences which are now affecting the home , whether industrial , political , or moral , will solve the problem of the modern family . The problem of the family , in other words , like all other social problems , is bound up with the total conditions of modern social life . As has often been emphasized , present social problems are all interdependent and really but phases of one larger problem , the " Social Problem , " the problem of the relations of men to one another . Legislation can do little , in one sense , to correct the real evil . That it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laissez-faire is justified upon this question , is , of course , not true . Legislation , if properly applied , can assist in accomplishing much . Even direct legislation regarding marriage and divorce can accomplish something . As we have already noted , the difference between the few divorces of Canada and the many divorces of the United States is largely due to a difference of laws . But of course we must not assume that there is a like difference in the state of the family life of the two countries . Legislation , in other words , may simply ignore social evils , and prohibit in appearance things which persist in reality . While it is not too much to say that the divorce laws of many of our states are a crime against civilization , because they have set low moral standards , yet the making of these laws stricter may not of itself greatly check the decay of the family . Let us note , however , some of the proposed reforms which seem feasible with reference to marriage and divorce , because they illustrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Proposed Legislative and Judicial Remedies for the Divorce Evil . ( I ) The first of these which might be mentioned is a uniform divorce and marriage law , enacted by the federal Congress and administered by the federal courts . The enactment of such a law , however , would require an amendment to the federal Constitution . Assuming that such amendment is possible , a uniform marriage and divorce law for the whole United States is certainly desirable ; for such a fundamental institution as the family should not be left to the regulation of local administrative areas , such as our states are . The family is not a state concern , but a national concern . However , as we have already // implied , the family problem is so deep that a mere transfer of the laws governing marriage and divorce from the statute books of the states to the statute books of the nation would make no material difference in the problem . There can be no question but that the states which now lead in divorce would continue to lead . In Switzerland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate divorce prior to 1876 , in 1906 , after thirty years of uniform law , the canton of Geneva had one divorce to every seven marriages , while the canton of Valais had one divorce to every two hundred and fifty marriages . Nevertheless , while we must not expect too great results to follow , uniform divorce and marriage laws are important enough to be worth working for . It is possible that such uniformity may be brought about through the cooperative action of our states rather than through an amendment to the federal Constitution . ( 2 ) Of more importance than uniformity in divorce laws , however , is reform in judicial procedure in trying divorce cases . We have already seen that very often divorce cases are rushed through our courts , not only without solemnity , but even without adequate knowledge of the merits of the cases . This has resulted , in many instances , in divorce being granted , in effect , upon mutual consent of the parties ? something never contemplated by our divorce legislation , lax though it be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst of these evils . The first is the appointment , in every court which tries divorce cases , of a Divorce Proctor , whose duty shall be to inquire carefully into every application for divorce to see whether the alleged grounds actually exist fi // and whether there is an absence of collusion or fraud , and then to advise the judge . In Kansas City , Missouri , the appointment of such a divorce proctor resulted in cutting down the number of divorces granted nearly thirty per cent in a single year , a conclusive proof that many divorces had previously been granted upon inadequate grounds or where there was collusion or fraud . A second reform in judicial procedure in granting divorce , more radical than the first , would be to put the matter of divorce in the hands of special Courts of Domestic Relations . Such courts already exist in several cities , but hitherto their control over divorce cases has been limited . It would seem that all applications for the dissolution of family bonds , whether between husband and wife , or parents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before special tribunals which should carefully investigate the cases to see whether the welfare of society would be subserved by the breaking up of the particular family or not . The subordinate officers of such courts could fully establish the facts and make recommendations to the judges , while the judges in turn could , in many instances , reconcile the parties and thus preserve the unity of the family . This has been ' done very successfully in a large number of instances by the Court of Domestic Relations in the city of Chicago . Similar practices in Switzerland have also been found effective in bringing about the reconciliation of many parties seeking divorce . Such work by the courts is truly reconstructive of the family , and can not be too highly commended . The trouble is that in a majority of cases it comes too late . As yet , moreover , such Courts of Domestic Relations exist only in very large cities ; and even where // they exist , they have only a limited jurisdiction in matters affecting the family . ( 3 ) A third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of legal grounds for absolute divorce . There can be no question but that such legislation is desirable in many of our states . However , such legislation might easily make the mistake of going too far , and of simply forcing the evil beneath the surface . A practicable divorce law in a majority of our states at the present time would probably have to recognize the five or six most serious grounds for divorce which we have already discussed , and for which over ninety per cent of the divorces are granted . Stricter laws , however , in many of our states , would serve to set higher standards for the family life and indirectly might thus do considerable to lessen the instability of the family . ( 4 ) Restrictions upon remarriage of divorced parties might also do something to reduce the instability of the family . Statistics in the United States seem to indicate that from thirty to fifty per cent of divorced persons remarry , according to the locality . While no large proportion of divorces are sought for the purpose of immediate remarriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing . If restrictions upon remarriage were permanent , this would amount to making divorce merely legal separation , and might be at the present time a practice which would be socially inexpedient . On the other hand , the lax laws of some of our states which permit immediate remarriage upon divorce make possible frequent remarriage on the part of divorce " repeaters " and result in affronts to public decency . Students of divorce , therefore , are practiTHE // cally unanimous in the opinion that a reasonable time should elapse after a divorce decree has been granted before remarriage is permitted . This is probably best secured by what is known as the nisi , or conditional , decree of divorce , which becomes absolute , permitting remarriage , only after a period of one or two years , thus allowing the divorced parties to effect reconciliation within that time without the formality of remarriage . ( 5 ) Restrictions upon marriage are at present advocated by certain writers as a remedy for the instability of the family . It is said that the real evil is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should have very few divorces in society if we had wise marriages . This may be granted without accepting the view that legal restrictions upon marriage would do much to make our family life more stable . Wise marriages should , of course , be in every way encouraged by society , but thus far it has been found possible to do but little in a legal way to bring about such marriages . To be sure , our marriage laws are still lax , and they should do more than they do ; but at best marriage laws could act only negatively , that is , they can prevent to some extent unwise marriages , but can do but little to secure wise ones . The laws might safely forbid , not only the marriage of persons of immature age , of defectives , of those afflicted with contagious diseases , but also should probably prevent the marriage of persons of too great difference in age , and of different races . Farther than this the laws could scarcely go with safety . In all countries where property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal age of marriage has been placed too high , a great increase in illegitimacy has resulted . // Indeed , the general policy of the law should undoubtedly be to encourage marriage among all normal persons in society and certainly not to make marriage difficult for such . What law can not accomplish or even safely attempt , however , education , public opinion , and social standards can . It is to the power of these rather than of mere legislation that we must look for stable and adequate reconstruction of any institution ; for back of all institutions stand the habits , opinions , and standards of the mass of individuals . The chief thing which is wrong with American family life is after all the " mores , " the social standards , of the American people in regard to the family . Now , the " mores " of a people can be changed for the better only in one way ? and that is through a process of learning on the part of the mass of the people . There are several ways , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safest and most economical way is through the systematic education of all the people in social matters . The social education of individuals , especially of the young , is the key to the scientific reconstruction of society . Let us consider , then , more in detail social education as a means of reconstructing our family life . Social Education and the Reconstruction of the Family . Education , unlike legislation , can easily change the habits , opinions , and standards of individuals , because the whole process of education is essentially a process of taking on certain habits , ideas , and ideals as preparation for life . Legislation , on the other hand , is necessarily external and coercive . It affects the individual for the most part too late in life to change radically his habits or even his opinions . It is for this reason that legislation has so many shortTHE // comings as an instrument of social reconstruction or reform . Of course , neither education nor legislation should be neglected in social reconstruction . Both are necessary and supplement each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and habits of the people already formed through education . On the other hand no public system of education can exist unless it is supported by appropriate legislation . In this matter of reconstructing our family life , therefore , the main reliance must be placed upon the education which the school , the church , and the home can give to the rising generation . Until children are taught to look upon the family as a socially necessary and therefore sacred institution , until they are taught to look upon marriage as something other than an act to suit their own convenience and pleasure , we must expect that our family life will be unstable . While the reconstruction of our family life practically involves the reconstruction of our whole social life , as we have already pointed out , yet the key to the situation in any event is the social education of the young , because only through such education can right ideals concerning marriage and the family be acquired . The importance of a pure and wholesome family life should , therefore , be emphasized by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can readily be done even in the lowest grades through throwing the emphasis upon the importance of the home and the family in all social activities and relationships . Here , of course , would enter instruction in the domestic sciences and arts in our public schools ; also education for parenthood so far as it is practicable to give such education in the public school . // The institution in society , however , which is especially charged with the task of conserving and propagating social ideals is the church . It is evident that a large responsibility for right ideals concerning marriage and the family must rest upon the church . Unless the church teaches such ideals , other institutions in society will not teach them to any extent . So far as the Christian church is concerned , it may be suggested that the first social task of the present church should be , as it was of the primitive church , the reconstituting of a stable and pure family life . It may be admitted , however , that the chief education along these lines must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truest respect for marriage and the family be effectively inculcated in the young . Many homes are , however , already so demoralized in this respect , that we can not expect that children will receive the right ideas from their home life . Hence the importance of supplementing the moral education along these lines which has hitherto been given mainly in the home , by explicit education in our public schools and in our Sunday schools . The situation is , however , not so difficult as might seem , for we must remember that imitation in society moves from the socially superior to the socially inferior classes . Proper social leadership in this matter of educating the child adequately in the school , the church , and the home in everything which pertains to the family would insure a great improvement within a single generation . There is no reason , then , for pessimism ; but it is evident that effective work along this line has hardly yet begun . A Normal Family Life evidently requires not only proper physical conditions , sufficient income to maintain a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations be tween its members , but , above all , consideration of the child . It is this last which marks the fully socialized family ; for the welfare of the race and of society is bound up with the welfare of the child . Child welfare may , indeed , in one sense be said to be the central problem of civilization. , For this reason , the child has always been and must con , tinue to be the center of gravity , so to speak , in any normal family life . Any discussion of the family , therefore , which fails to make the welfare of the child that is , or may be , born , the matter of the highest importance in the family life misses the whole point . On the other hand , any dis cussion of child welfare which fails to recognize the family as the normal environment of the child also misses the point . For so-called children 's institutions , juvenile courts , and other child-saving agencies are very inadequate sub stitutes for a normal home . The securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , the indispensable thing needed for child welfare ; and , on the other hand , a normal family life must be centered in the child . From this point of view the way which must be followed to secure the solution of the many problems connected with our family life becomes clear . For example , whether a particular family should be dissolved or not is a matter which should be decided upon the basis , not primarily of the happiness of husband and wife , but rather of the wel fare of the children involved ; and society , of course , can-not afford to set up one standard for couples with children and another standard for couples without children , as that // would place a premium upon childlessness . Again , the labor of married women outside of the home , the labor of children themselves , wages and hours of breadwinners , and even the building of our cities must be regulated upon the basis of child welfare . Finally , the unsocialized individualism of our " mores " with reference to marriage and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This last is the most needed reform of all , for the instability of the American family is rooted , not so much in our industrial conditions as in our " mores , " as is shown by such facts as that divorces usually increase with economic prosperity , and that American industrial development is of the same general type as that of European countries which have a more stable family life . It may be pointed out that in emphasizing child welfare as the basis for deciding problems of the family , there is no necessary sacrifice of the moral and social welfare of adults . Any system of morality which is social in its aim must place a premium upon the development of altruism . The moral character of adults , in other words , can best be safeguarded by emphasizing the claims which society and the race have upon the individual ; and the child stands , as we have said , for society and the race , and so for the development of the higher altruism . Conclusions for Social Reconstruction . ? The study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding social reconstruction in general which are worth emphasizing . Social reconstruction , as we have seen from the problem of reconstructing our family life , always involves reconstructing the " mores . " But this can not be accomplished by mere force or coercive // legislation . It can be accomplished only by a process of educating the whole people . The press , the school , and the church must be the prime agents for accomplishing such a process of education . Free public discussion and the free formation of public opinion under the guidance of social leaders are also necessary before a definite social decision can be reached which will change social standards . Only when public opinion and public sentiment have so crystal lized that social standards have already practically changed , is it wise to pass coercive laws . Even then laws must be supported by the active forces of government , education , morality , and religion , if they are to be effective and the habits of the people definitely changed . All agencies of social control , in other words , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical environ ment must also be so changed as to be favorable to the new standards if they are to be successful . If , on the other hand , laws are enacted without such a process of popular education and without the free formation of a public opinion , they will not represent the popular will and must sooner or later prove a failure . The same thing is evidently true if they are not actively supported by political , educational , moral , and religious agencies after enactment , and if appro priate changes in the material conditions of life are not made . In stable social reconstruction society must move as a unit ; but social education is the key to its successful prosecution . 18o THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY CHAPTER IX THE GROWTH OF POPULATION Mass as a Factor in Social Evolution . ? Mass is a factor in the survival of a social group . Other things being equal , that group will stand the best chance of surviving which has the greatest numbers . In a large and growing population also , competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of efficiency will tend to rise . " Civilization is a function of numbers and of the contact of numbers , " as Professor Keller says , however , not so much because of the two facts just mentioned , as because of the fact that the larger the mass of a given group the greater can be the industrial and cultural division of labor . This means higher , more complex social cooperation and so greater progress in industry and in civilization . With the proper organization and division of labor of large numbers the mastery over nature becomes easier . For this reason the higher types of industry and of civilization have depended upon the growth of numbers as one important factor . As we pass from savagery to civilization we find population constantly increasing . The lowest savage hordes have scarcely ever more than forty or fifty individuals , while not until high civilization is reached do we find nations numbering many millions . There is thus 181 // an intimate connection between numbers and a high state of civilization . Perhaps the chief reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its development through contact with other minds , and hence the multiplication of mental contacts is favorable to both mental and cultural development . Provided there is relatively free intercommunication maintained between individuals , mental interstimulation can be immensely more rich , varied , and intense in a large population than in a small one . The number and variety of ideas in circulation in a large group is greatly increased , and hence the opportunities for the selection of valuable ideas is also increased . Hence inventions of all sorts are stimulated by the increased contacts and needs of great masses of men . On the other hand , it is obvious that population may exceed resources , that its increase makes the social life and its problems more complex and may greatly intensify the struggle or competition between individuals and groups . The questions which center around the growth of population , accordingly , are among the most important with which sociology has to deal . These questions are , of course , closely connected with the family life , since the growth of population in the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths . However , the growth of population has so long been looked upon as a national question that perhaps it will be best to study it from the standpoint of the national group . The population of modern national groups , the influences which augment and deter the growth of population , and the laws of population in general , will be what will concern us in this chapter . // Population Statistics of Some Modern Nations . ? The following table of statistics will show the growth of population in the largest nations of Europe and America since the beginning of the nineteenth century : The table shows that while the population of nearly all of these nations increased rapidly within the nineteenth cen tury , the rate of increase has been relatively unequal . If we project Russia 's increase of population to the year 2,000 A.D. , we shall find that its probable population will be in the neighborhood of 300,000,000 ; Germany 's probable population , say Ioo , 000,000 ; while France 's probable population in the year 2000 , if it continues to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45,000,000 . While the World War rendered all forecasts of population uncer tain , and while these can not be considered certain in any sense , still they are sufficient to show that the growth // of modern nations in population is relatively unequal . Inasmuch as the mere element of numbers is one of the greatest factors for the future greatness of any nation , this is a highly important matter . A nation of only 40,000,000 a century hence , it is safe to say , will be no more important than Holland and Belgium are now . On the other hand , it is very probable that a century hence the civilized nations that lead in population will also lead in industrial and cultural development . Many other factors , of course , enter into the situation , but the factor of mere numbers should not be neglected , as all practical statesmen recognize . A century hence it is probable that the population of continental United States will be over 200,000,000 . It would be considerably more than this if the present annual rate of increase were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an estimate of 200,000,000 is sufficiently high . ' We have already seen that it is probable that Russia 's population may equal 300,000,000 by the year 2000 . It seems probable , therefore , that the United States and Russia may be the two great world powers a century hence , particularly if Russia emerges from its present social and political troubles and takes on fully Western civilization , - while the other nations may tend to ally themselves with the one or the other of these great world powers . Of course , China is the X ? the unknown // quantity ? in the world 's future . Should its immense population absorb Western civilization , this would certainly bring into the theater of the world 's political evolution a new and important factor . The population and vital statistics of the various civilized countries show :  - -  (r) The population of all civilized countries , with one or two exceptions , has been increasing rapidly since the beginning of the nineteenth century . Previous to that time we have no statistics that are reliable , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Middle Ages and increased only slowly down to the nineteenth century ; but during the nineteenth century the population of the leading industrial nations increased very rapidly . This was due primarily , without doubt , to improved economic conditions , which made it possible for a larger population to subsist within a given area . Back of these improved economic conditions , however , has been increased scientific knowledge of ways of mastering physical nature , and accompanying them has been a very greatly decreased death rate , due in part at least to the advance of medical science . ( 2 ) This increase in population has been due , not to an increase in birth rate , but to a decreased death rate . During the nineteenth century the death rate decreased markedly in practically all civilized countries . As we have already noted , this was due primarily to improved living conditions , particularly in the food , clothing , and shelter for the masses , but it was also due in no small part to the advance in medical science , especially that branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death rate decreases with improved // material conditions , and probably also with improved moral conditions , it is a relatively good measure , at least of the material civilization or progress of a people . We may note that the death rate is measured by the number of deaths that occur annually per thousand in a given population . The death rate of the countries most advanced in sanitary science and in industrial improvement apparently tends to establish itself around fifteen per thousand annually . ' ( 3 ) The birth rate of civilized countries also declined markedly during the nineteenth century , especially during the latter half . On the whole , this was a good thing . The birth rate should decrease with the death rate . This leaves more energy to be used in other things ; but when the birth rate falls more rapidly than the death rate or falls beyond a certain point , it is evident that the normal growth of a nation is hindered , and even its extinction may be threatened . While an excessively high birth rate is a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand an excessively low birth rate is a sign of physical and probably moral degeneracy in the population . When the birth rate is lower than the death rate in a given population , it is evident that the population is on the way to extinc-tion . Such a birth rate is manifestly abnormal . In order that a birth rate be normal , therefore , it must be sufficiently above the death rate to provide for the normal growth of the population . On the whole , it seems safe to // conclude that we have no better index of the vitality of a people , that is , of their capacity to survive , than the surplus of births over deaths . Such a surplus of births over deaths is also a fairly trustworthy index of the living conditions of a population , because if the living conditions are poor , no matter how high the birth rate may be , the death rate will be correspondingly high , and the surplus of births over deaths , therefore , relatively low . Vital statistics are , therefore , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material condition of a given population . Probably there are no social facts from which we may gather a clearer insight into the social conditions of a given population than vital statistics . Without going into the vital statistics of modern nations in any detail , the following table of birth rates and death rates in three leading European nations will serve to illustrate the decrease in the death rate and the birth rate among civilized people in general , the birth rate being computed the same as the death rate , that is , the number of births per thousand annually of the population : // The preceding table shows , not only that birth rates and death rates have been declining among civilized peoples , but that the decline has been unequal in different peoples . In the case of England the excess of births over deaths in the decade 1900-1909 was 11.8 per thousand of the population annually ; in the case of Germany , 14.5 ; while for France it was only 1.0 . In the years just before the World War the excess of births over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European nation . During the same period the excess of births over deaths in France was insignificant , and in some years the number of deaths in France actually exceeded the number of births . During the War the birth rate of France fell nearly one half ? to 10 per thousand annually . The causes of the stationary population of France are probably mainly economic , although all the factors which influence the family life in any degree must also influence birth rate . For a number of years the economic conditions of France have not been favorable to the growth of a large population , and at the same time the law necessitating the equal division of the family 's property among children has tended to encourage small families , especially in the agricultural population . Unquestionably , however , other factors of a more general social or moral nature are also at work in France as well as in all other populations that are decreasing in numbers . There are no vital statistics in the United States comparable with those we have cited of representative European countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , containing more than half of the total population , the average death rate for the five years 1917 ? 1921 was // 14.1 , while the average birth rate for the same period was 23.9 . The Decrease in the Native White Stock in the United States . Certain classes in the United States also show a very slight surplus of births over deaths and in some cases absolutely declining numbers . In general the United States Census statistics seem to indicate that the native white stock in the Northern states is not keeping up its numbers . This is suggested by the decreasing size of the average family in the United States . The average size of the family in the United States in 185o was 5.6 persons ; in 186o , 5.3 ; in 188o , 5.0 1890 , 4.9 ; in 1900 , 4.7 ; in 1910 , 4.5 ; and in 1920 , 4.3 . If we include only private families in 1900 , the average size of the family was only 4.6 . Thus , between 185o and 1900 the size of the average family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This decrease is most evident in the Pacific Coast and North Central states . In rural New England , according to the census of 1920 , the average size of the family was only 4.1 persons . Moreover , the vital statistics kept by the state of Massachusetts for a long number of years show conclusively that the native white stock in that state is tending to die out . In 1919 , for example , in Massachusetts the native born had a birth rate of only 14.9 , while the foreign born had a birth rate of 43.4 . But the death rate among the native born in Massachusetts in 1920 was 12.8 ; while among the foreign born it was 15.5 . Thus among the native born the number of births was greater than the number of deaths by 2.1 per thousand of their population annually ; while among the foreign born the excess of births over // deaths was 27.9 per thousand of their population . The following table of birth rates and death rates for 1890 in the city of Boston 1 for the native born and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birth rate of the native born is not new : The high birth rate of the foreign born , is , of course , in part to be explained through the fact that the foreign-born population is made up for the most part of individuals in the prime of life , that is , in the reproductive age . Neverthe-less , while this explains the excessively high birth rate of some of the foreign-born elements , it does not explain the great discrepancy between their birth rate and that of the native born . It is clearly evident that the native born are artificially limiting their numbers , while the more recent immigrants do not practice this . Such a condition is changing the blood of our Northern states . If present tendencies continue , it is apparently not difficult to see a time in the not very distant future when the old Puritan // New England families will be replaced in the population of Massachusetts and Boston almost entirely by the descendants of recent immigrants . Moreover , so far as vital statistics concerning different classes can be gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same tendencies are manifest ; that is , everywhere we find the native-born white population failing to hold its own alongside of the more recent immigrants . Apparently , therefore , we must conclude that the birth rate of the older white stock in the United States is declining to such an extent that that element in our population threatens to become extinct if present tendencies continue . Only the Southern whites present an exception to this generalization . The Southern white people , from various causes not well understood , ? partly , perhaps , from family pride , partly , perhaps , from racial instinct , but even more probably on account of certain economic conditions , ? keep up their numbers , increasing more rapidly even than the negro population which exists alongside of them . Causes of the Decrease in Birth Rate in the Native White Stock in the United States . What , then , are the causes of this decrease in the birth rate of the native white stock in the United States ? It is worth our while to inquire briefly into these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in favoring or deterring the growth of population . They are not only of special interest to us as affecting conditions in our own country , but they are typical of the influences which determine the survival or extinction of peoples . ( I ) Economic conditions are without doubt mainly at // the bottom of the decreasing birth rate in the native white American population . Certain unfavorable economic conditions have developed in this country of recent years for this particular element ; especially have higher standards of living increased among the native white population in the United States more rapidly than their income . This has led to later marriages and smaller families . Again , more intense competition along all lines has forced certain elements of the native stock into occupations where wages are low in comparison with the standard of living . This has , perhaps , especially come about through the increased competition which the foreign born have offered to the native white element . The foreign born have taken rapidly all the places which might be filled by unskilled labor and many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrunk from this competition and have retired for the most part to the more socially honorable occupations , such as clerkships in business , the professions , and the like . In many of these occupations , however , as we have already said , the wages are low as compared with the standards of living maintained by that particular occupational class ; hence , as we have already said , later marriages and fewer children . Rising standards of living and rising costs of living have , therefore , impinged more heavily upon the native born than upon the foreign born . It is difficult to suggest a remedy for this condition of affairs . No legislator can devise means of encouraging a class to have large families when by so doing that class would necessarily have to sacrifice some of its standards of living . F-Iowever , it may be that the native born can be protected to some extent // from the competition of the foreign born through reason-able restrictions upon immigration , and it may also be that unreasonable advances in standards of living may be checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat doubtful nature . ( 2 ) No doubt the pressure of economic conditions is not responsible for small families in some elements of the native white population in the United States , for often-times the smallest families are found among the wealthy , among whom there could be no danger of a large family lowering the standards of living or pressing upon other economic needs . We must accept as a second factor in the situation , therefore , the inherent selfishness in human nature which is not willing to be burdened with the care of children . In other countries , and apparently in all ages , the wealthy have been characterized by smaller families than the poor . The following table from Ber tillon , l showing the number of births per thousand women between fifteen and fifty years of age in Paris , Berlin , and London among the various economic classes , shows conclusively that it is not altogether the pressure of eco nomic wants which leads to the limiting of a population : // ( 3 ) Besides economic conditions and individual selfishness we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population which has been definitely ascertained , and that is vice . Vice cuts the birth rate chiefly through the diseases which accompany it . About 20 per cent of American marriages are childless , and medical authorities state that in one half of these childless marriages the barrenness is due to venereal diseases . All authorities in medical sociology agree that a large per cent of the young men of the United States become addicted to sex vice before marriage . This serves to disseminate venereal diseases among the general population , especially among innocent women and children . The consequence is , on the one hand , a considerable number of sterile marriages and on the other hand a high infant mortality . It need not be assumed , as we have already said , that vice is more prevalent to-day than in previous generations , but on account of the conditions of our social life diseases which accompany vice are now more widely disseminated than they have been at any time in our previous history ; therefore , even the physical results of vice are different to-day than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Education has been alleged as a cause of decreasing birth rate in the native white American stock . This , however , is true only in a very qualified sense . While it is a fact , as collected statistics have shown , that if Harvard and other universities depended on children of their alumni for students their attendance would actually decrease in numbers , it is not true that college graduates have had a lower birth rate than the economic and " social // classes to which they belong . So far as statistics have been collected , indeed , they seem to indicate that the wealthy uneducated are producing fewer children than the educated classes who associate with them . The influence decreasing the birth rate among the educated is , therefore , not education itself , but the high standards of living and the luxury of the classes with whom they associate . On the other hand , the higher education of women seems to be , down to the present time , operating as a distinct influence to lessen the birth rate among the educated classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not marry . The higher education has not yet gone far enough , however , to give us any definite facts with which to judge what the ultimate effect of woman 's higher education will be . If the higher education of woman is going to lead to a large per cent of the best and most intellectual women in society leading lives of celibacy , then , of course , ultimately the higher education of woman will be disastrous to the race . But probably the relative infrequency of marriage among women who are college graduates is a transitory phenomenon due to the fact that neither women nor men are as yet adjusted to the higher education of women . ( 5 ) Some phases of the " woman 's movement " have without doubt tended to lessen the birth rate in certain sections of American society . Some of the leaders of the woman 's movement have advocated , for example , that women should choose a single life , while others have advocated that families should not have more than two children . Some " birth-control " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families would have but two children this // would be a cure-all for many social troubles . Indeed , this ideal of two children in the family has been so widely disseminated in this country that it is often spoken of as the " American Idea . " Of course , such teachings could not be without some effect . Without attempting to reply to the advocates of this theory of but two children to a family , it will be sufficient to remark that for a population simply to remain stationary three children at least must be born to each family on the average ; otherwise , if only two children are born , as one of the children is apt to die or fail to marry , the population will actually decrease in numbers . Under the best modern conditions one out of three children now born either fails to live to maturity or fails to reproduce . There must be , therefore , more than three children born to the average family for a population to grow . From the sociological point of view the ideal family would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are born . ( 6 ) Finally , not all of the childless and small families in the native American stock are due by any means to voluntary causes , or even involuntary causes of the kind that we have mentioned . There are also certain other obscure physiological causes at work producing sterility in American women . The sterility of American women is greater than that of any other civilized population , even apart from the causes which have just been mentioned . Some say this is due to physical deterioration in the native white American stock , and there are other things which seem to point in that direction . It may be , however , that this deterioration is in no sense racial , but only individual , affecting certain individuals who lead a relatively unnatural life . // Our American civilization puts a great strain upon certain elements of our population , and this strain in many cases falls even more upon the women than upon the men . The social life of the American people , in other words , is oftentimes such as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in the women of a population first of all in sterility . It is evident that the remedy for this cause is a more natural and more simple life on the part of all , if it is possible to bring this about . Thus , the causes which influence birth rate are evidently very complex . In the main they are doubtless economic causes among all peoples , but there is no reason to believe that these economic causes act alone in determining birth rate , nor is there any reason to believe that the other psychological and biological causes may be in any way derived from the economic . So far as we can see , then ; industrial conditions are mainly responsible for the lessened birth rate in the native white American stock . But mingled with these industrial conditions , operating as causes , are certain psychological ( or moral ) and biological factors that have to be considered as in the main independent . It is furthermore evident that the causes which lead to the decline and extinction of any population , whether civilized or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinction of peoples of antiquity , or modern nature peoples , such as the North American Indians and the Polynesians , through any single set of causes , must be looked at as unscientific . It can readily be shown that in all these cases the causes of the decline of the birth rate and the ultimate extinction of the stock are numerous and are not reducible to any single set of causes . // Causes which Influence the Death Rate . Before we can fully understand the causes of the growth of a population , that is , of the surplus of births over deaths , we must understand something also about the things which influence the death rate as well as the things which influence the birth rate , because , let it be borne in mind , the growth of a given population ( excluding immigration always ) is due to the combined working of these two factors . Within certain limits the death rate is more easily controlled than the birth rate . It is very difficult for society deliberately to set about to increase the birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take deliberate measures to decrease the death rate , because all individuals have a selfish interest in decreasing the death rate ; but the increase of the birth rate does not appeal to the self-interest of individuals . Modern medical science , as we have seen , has done much to decrease the death rate in civilized countries , and it promises to do even more . A century ago a death rate of fifty or sixty per thousand population in urban centers was not unusual , but now a death rate of thirty in a thousand in the same communities is considered an intolerable disgrace , and the time will shortly come , no doubt , when even a death rate of twenty per thousand of the population will be considered disgraceful to any community . As we have already seen , the normal death rate of the most enlightened European and American communities tends to establish itself around fifteen per thousand . Of course the sanitary and hygienic conditions which influence the death rate are so numerous that we can not enter into and discuss them . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are often overlooked and which are of particular interest in sociology . ( 1 ) The World War demonstrated once more that war , next after famine and pestilence , is the greatest destructive agency known to man . While previous recent European wars , such as the Franco-Prussian War of 187o-1871 , had comparatively small effects upon the death rates of the countries involved , the reverse was true of the World War . In all the chief belligerent nations the death rate was enormously increased , while the birth rate was greatly decreased . Thus France suffered a loss of about seven per cent of its total population in the years 1914-1918 , losing 1,385,000 through death in its military forces , and over I , 000,000 through the excess of deaths over births in its civilian population , during the four years of the War . Germany , it is estimated , suffered a total loss , within its geographical boundaries of 1914 , of about 3,500,000 in its population during the four years of the World War , of which number , however , only 1,600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is estimated that about 7,500,000 men died in the armies of the whole of Europe during the War , while almost as many more were permanently disabled ? the total wounded being estimated at over 18,000,000 . In addition , perhaps io , 000,000 died in Europe from the diseases and starvation caused by the War . Thus we see that even in modern war disturbances in economic and sanitary conditions cause more deaths than wounds received in battle . ( 2 ) As already implied , then , economic conditions exercise a very great influence upon death rate , particularly // when economic conditions cause increased cost of the necessities of life and widespread scarcity of food . This cause produces far more deaths in modern nations than any other preventable cause . The doubling of the cost of bread during the World War was one of its greatest calamities . While in peace modern civilized peoples fear famine but little , there are many classes in the great industrial nations that live upon such a narrow margin of existence that the slightest increase in the cost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these classes . Statistics , therefore , of all modern countries , and particularly of all great cities , show an enormous increase in sickness and death among the poorer classes in times of economic depression . ( 3 ) Other economic causes also greatly affect the death rate , especially industrial accidents and occupational diseases . It is estimated by reliable authorities that in the United States alone 25,000 are killed annually by industrial accidents , and r , 000,000 maimed and wounded , and that there are as many as 3,000,000 cases of illness in a year produced by harmful industrial conditions . It is evident from these figures that modern industry is more bloody than many a war , and that in all industrial communities , unless there are the most advanced sanitary and safety appliances , it must swell the death rate considerably . ( 4 ) Climate and season are rather constant factors in the death rate of all communities . The rule here is that in northern countries the death rate is higher in winter , while in southern countries the death rate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Sweden in February THE GROWTH OF POPULATION deaths rise to 113 , in August they go down to 79 ; but in t hr United States in 1910 in March deaths were at I l l as , ? ur pared with the standard , and in August at 102 , while I n June and October deaths were at 92 and 91 respectively , - the period of minimum death rate in the United State : ; being in the spring and autumn . In other words , in months of most moderate temperature the mortality is least . The biological fact of sex also influences death rate . Males in general are shorter-lived than females . This is in part due to the fact that men are more exposed to the dangers of industry in earning a livelihood , while women are more secluded in the home . But this does not explain entirely the discrepancy in the death rate of the two sexes , for boy babies die more frequently than girl babies . As we have already seen , the female organism is the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less physical strength , have more vitality than males . In the registration area of the United States the death rate in 1920 for the males was 13.5 per thousand of the male pope lation , while the death rate for the females was only 12.7 per thousand of their population . Conjugal condition is also a factor which affects death rate . The differences between the death rates of t he married and unmarried have long been noted . The follow-ing table of the death rates ( per thousand ) of males and t females of different conjugal classes between the ages of forty and fifty years ( in Germany , 1876-188o ) , taken from Profes-sor Mayo-Smith 's Statistics and Sociology , illustrates this : // It will be seen from these figures that in the more advanced years of life the death rate among the single is higher than among the married . The probable explanation of this , however , is not that the married state is better physiologically , as has been so often claimed , but that it is better socially . These figures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of the home . Single persons , particularly in the more advanced years of life , who are without homes , are more liable to fall sick , and when sick are less likely to receive proper care . That these figures show the great social advantage of the home in preserving life is evident from the fact that among the widowed males , whose homes have been broken up , the death rate is higher even than among the single males . Moreover , in interpreting such statistics we must bear in mind that the unmarried in the higher ages of life are made up very often of those who arc relatively abnormal , either physically or mentally , that is , of those who are biologically unfit . Inasmuch as the single persons include many of this class , and also lack the comforts of home , it is not surprising that the death rate is much higher among them . ( 7 ) Infantile mortality is one of the most interesting phases of vital statistics . We have already said that the death rate is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we say that the death rate among children , particularly those under one year of age , is an index to a people 's sanitary and moral condition . Taking the world as a whole , it is still estimated that one half of all who are born die before the age of five years . This represents an enormous waste of energy . Even in many of the most civilized countries the death rate among chilTHE // dren , and especially among infants under one year of age , is still comparatively high . Most of this death rate is unnec essary , could be avoided , and , as we have already said , represents a waste of life . According to Dr. Newman , ' during the decade 1894-1903 , in Russia 27 per cent of all children born died the first year ; in Germany , 19.5 per cent ; in France , 15.5 per cent ; in England , 15 per cent ; in Norway , 9.4 per cent ; in New Zealand , 9.7 per cent ; and in the United States , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high infant mortality is the ignorance of parents as to proper methods of child care ; but this is closely cor related with economic conditions . The Federal Children 's Bureau has shown that the highest death rate of children in the United States is generally in families with very low income , while the lowest death rate was found in families with an income above $1200 annually . What proper measures can do to reduce infant mortality is shown by recent statistics . Thus , in 27 leading states of the regis tration area in the United States in 1921 only 7.6 per cent of the children born died the first year , while in New Zealand in 1920 the per cent was only 5.0 . The Laws of the Growth of Population . ? Can the growth of population be reduced to any principle or law ? This is a problem which has puzzled social thinkers for a long time . Many have thought that the growth of population can be reduced to one or more relatively simple laws , but we have seen from analyzing the statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable . A formula that would cover the growth of population would have to cover all of the variable causes influencing birth rate and death rate and so entering into the surplus of births over deaths . It is evident that these causes are too complex to be reduced to any such formula among modern civilized peoples . In the animal world and among uncivilized peoples , however , conditions are quite different , and the growth of population is regulated by certain very simple principles or laws . Thus it is probable that for centuries before the whites came , the Indians of North America were stationary in their population , for the reason that under their stationary condition of culture a given area could support only so many people . In conditions of savagery , and even of barbarism , therefore , we can lay down the principle that population will increase up to the limit of food supply , and will stop there and remain stationary until food supply increases . This is the condition which governs the growth of the population of all animal species , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barbarians among the human species . But among civilized men who have attempted the control of physical nature , and to some extent even the control of human nature , many other factors enter in to influence both birth rate and death rate , and so the growth of the population . Nevertheless , many social thinkers of the past have conceived , as has already been said , that the growth of population might be reduced to very simple and definite laws . Among the first who proposed laws governing population was an English economist , Thomas Robert Malthus , whose active career coincides with the first quarter of the nineteenth century . In 1798 Malthus put forth a little book which he entitled An Essay on the Principle of Population as it affects the future improvement of society . This essay went through numerous editions and revisions , and THE GROWTH OF POPULATION in it Malthus elaborated his famous economic theory of the growth of population . Inasmuch as this theory of Malthus has been the storm center of sociological and economic writers for the past one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly what Malthus 's theory was , and why it is inadequate as a scientific statement of the laws governing the growth of population . Malthus 's Theory of Population . In the first edition of his essay Malthus contended that population tends to increase in geometric ratio , while food at best will increase only in arithmetical ratio ; and that this means that constant discrepancies between population and food supply would appear , with the result that population would have to be cut down to food supply . Later Malthus saw how crude this statement of his theory was and abandoned any attempt at mathematical statement , presenting substantially the following theory : ( I ) Population is necessarily limited by food ; ( 2 ) Population always increases where food increases and tends to increase faster than food ; ( 3 ) The checks that keep population down to food supply may be classified as positive and preventive . Positive checks are those which increase the death rate , such as famine , poverty , war , disease , and the like . Preventive checks are those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudence in the birth of children . Inasmuch as Malthus believed that the positive checks must always operate where the preventive checks did not , he advocated the use of the preventive checks as the best means to remedy human misery . The inherent tendency of population to outstrip food supply , Malthus believed to be the main source of human misery in all of its forms . // Criticisms of Malthus 's Theory . ( I ) It is evident that Malthus 's theory applies only to a stationary society , that is , a non-progressive society , because in a progressive society human invention and , therefore , food supply , may far outstrip any increase of population . This was the case in practically all civilized countries during the nineteenth century , where improvements in machinery and agriculture greatly increased the food supply . If it be replied that this increase of food is but temporary , and that sooner or later Malthus 's theory must operate , then it may be said , on the other hand , that as yet we see no limit of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just entering upon the stage of material progress . We have just begun to conquer physical nature , and in the United States in particular scientific agriculture tells us not half of the actual fertility of the soil is utilized . Malthus , of course , did not foresee the inventions and agricultural progress of the nineteenth century . For this reason his theory was a static one and it can not be made to apply to a progressive society . ( 2 ) Similarly , the theory makes no allowance for the increased efficiency which may come with increased population , because increase of population makes possible better cooperation . As we have already seen , cooperation and division of labor in a society depend upon the size of the group to a certain extent , that is , the larger the group there is for organization the better can be the organization and division of labor in that group . Every increase of population , therefore , opens up new and superior ways of applying labor ; and cooperation and the division of // labor make it possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly accomplish working as individuals . Improved means of cooperation , therefore , operate very much the same way in human society in controlling nature as new inventions . ( 3 ) The theory of Malthus makes no allowance for the general law of animal fertility , which is that as the rate of individual evolution increases the rate of reproduction decreases . Of course , Malthus 's theory antedates this law of animal fertility , which was first stated by Herbert Spencer . Some scientists declare that this law does not apply within the human species , and it must be admitted that we are not yet certain that it does . As we have already seen , however , the lower and less individualized classes in human society reproduce much more rapidly than the upper or more individualized classes . Increase of food supply , or of wealth , does not necessarily mean increase of population , and the fatal error in Malthus 's theory is that he assumes that wherever food increases population always increases unless deliberate checks are applied . ( 4 ) The overpopulation which Malthus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shown by the labors of Darwin to be the condition essential to the working of the process of natural selection in the human species . Overpopulation , at least until artificial selection arrives , is not an evil , but a good in human society . Without it there would not be sufficient elimination of the unfit in human society to prevent wholesale social degeneration . Even with artificial selection , however , some overpopulation would be necessary for the working of any scheme of selection . We must conclude , then , that Malthus 's theory , either as // an explanation of the growth of modem populations or as an implied practical ethical doctrine , is of little value . This is not saying , of course , that Malthus 's theory does not have elements of truth in it . Undoubtedly Malthus 's theory does apply to stationary , non-progressive peoples , to savages and lower civilized in certain stages of culture , and also perhaps to certain classes in modem society who fail to participate in modern social progress . But these lower classes or elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the tendency to individual improvement is so marked . Again , Malthus 's theory has certain elements of truth in it , so far as it depends upon the economic law of diminishing returns in agriculture , and in so far as it merely asserts that the struggle for existence in human society is , in the last analysis , a struggle for food . Finally , Malthus meant his theory chiefly as a criticism of socialistic and communistic schemes , which would equalize wealth and do away with competition in society . Unquestionably any such scheme to equalize wealth and do away with competition in society would result in the enormous increase of the lower and more brutal element of society ? those that have not yet participated in modern culture . Malthus 's theory as a criticism of socialistic schemes that would do away with competition ( which , however , is not an aim of genuinely scientific socialism ) is unquestionably as good to-day as when it was written . Summary and Conclusion . ? Most modern economists and sociologists recognize the failure of Malthus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some have attempted to form theories independent of MalTHE // thus ; but it must be said that they have succeeded no better than Malthus . In its practical aspects also Malthusianism must be judged to be an inadequate doctrine . In practice Neo-Malthusian ideas have served merely as an excuse for the socially fortunate classes to restrict their birth rate . Modern eugenics makes a much closer approach to a rational population policy . According to eugenics , society needs birth release among the strong , the intelligent , and the economically fortunate , while it needs birth restriction among the weak , the unintelligent , and the economically depressed . But there are insuperable difficulties at present in the way of carrying out such a program . It may be accepted , however , as a standard upon which to base a rational reconstruction of our population policy ; for Malthusianism in practice has worked the opposite and produced a " reversal of selection " in society . As to economic influences , they are , as we have seen , powerful influences in determining the growth of population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors which enter into determining the excess of births over deaths are much too complex to be lumped together and called " economic conditions . " So far as the birth-rate side of the population equation is concerned , it would be more nearly correct to say that in a very broad sense the problem is psychological . In conclusion , we may say that we are unable to formulate any laws of population which are worthy of the name of laws as yet , and it seems probable , that while we may understand clearly enough the factors which enter into the growth of population , we shall never be able to reduce these factors to a single formula or law . Social phenomena , // we may here note , are too complex to be reduced to simple formulas or laws as physical phenomena are reduced . Indeed , it is doubtful whether laws exist among social phenomena in the same sense in which they exist among physical phenomena , that is , as fixed relations among variable forces . Human society has in it another element than mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this so increases the complexity of social phenomena that it is doubtful if we can formulate any such hard and fixed laws of social phenomena as of physical phenomena . This is not saying , however , that social phenomena can not be understood and that there are not principles which are at work with relative uniformity among them . It is only saying that the social sciences , even in their most biological or physical aspects , can not be reduced to the same exactness as the physical sciences , though the knowledge which they offer may be in practice just as trustworthy . CHAPTER X THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM IN new countries population may increase by immigration as well as by the surplus of births over deaths . Immigration is , therefore , a secondary means of increasing the population of a country , and in new countries is often of great importance . History and Causes of Migrations . ? Immigration , or the migration of a people into a country , along with its correlative emigration , constitutes a most important social phenomenon . All peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a wanderer upon the face of the earth since the earliest times . According to modern anthropology the human species probably evolved in a relatively narrow area and peopled the earth by successive migrations to distant lands . In all ages , therefore , we find more or less migratory movements of populations . But the movements in modern times , particularly in the nineteenth century , probably exceed , in the number of individuals concerned , any other migratory movements of which we have knowledge in history . Ancient migrations were , moreover , somewhat different from modern immigration and emigration . Ancient migrations were largely those of peoples or tribes , while in modern times migration is more of an individual matter . The Huns , for example , came into Europe as a nation , but the immigration into the United States at the present 2II // time is wholly an individual movement . The causes of migration are more or less universal , but corresponding to the difference in ancient and modern migrations we find the causes varying somewhat in ancient and modern times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all migrations seem to be : ( r ) lack of food ; ( 2 ) lack of territory for an expanding population ; ( 3 ) war . In modern times we find other causes operating , such as , ( 4 ) the labor market , ? men now migrate chiefly to get better economic opportuniti s ) government , ? in modern times the oppression of unjust g vernments has often caused extensive migration ; ( 6 ) religion , ? religious persecution and intolerance have in modern times been important among the causes of migration . Migration as a Factor in Social Evolution . ? Migration as a factor in social evolution has had most important consequences in human history . The process of migration has been a selective process which has had much to do with the creation of existing social types . It is generally held , by students of social history , that migration exercises a selective effect in favor of the stronger , more energetic , more restless types of people . Hence peoples descended from migrants are more apt to show energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migration of the utmost social conse'quence has been the intermingling of peoples . This has gone on to such an extent in the world 's history that ethnologists tell us that there are no longer any pure races . The crossing of races has had such profound social effects that we can not stop here to discuss the matter , except to say that undoubtedly one result has been to add to the variability , // and hence to the plasticity , of human types . This increased variability resulting from the crossing of races , in the opinion of many writers , has favored social progress . This seems to be the case when the crossing is between types not too far removed either in biological constitution or in culture . Of equal importance with these biological effects of human migration , however , have been the cultural effects . As a result of migration different peoples with different cultures have been brought into contact with one another . In this way peoples have come to borrow much from one another by imitating the folkways , customs , and institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as Bagehot says , has been broken up . In other words , social habits have been prevented from becoming too inflexible by the contact of different peoples . Civilization has thus been very largely spread by migrations in the past . Again , from the union of two dissimilar cultures , an impetus usually results toward the development of a new and higher type of civilization . This is , at least , usually the case when the cultures are not too dissimilar . Sociologists are , therefore , generally agreed that the intermingling of peoples in the past has been a great stimulus to progress . This would necessarily result , under normal conditions , from the breaking up of tradition and custom , which we have spoken of as one of the important consequences of migration . Still other important sociological phenomena flow from the intermingling of peoples of different traditions and of different races . Here we can see in the clearest possible way the importance in human society of the " consciousness of kind , " and of physical and mental resemblance , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here we can also see in connection with the intermingling of peoples the important phenomena of social assimilation through imitation . Without discussing further , however , in an abstract way these important sociological principles , let us now turn to the current problem of immigration into the United States ; for all historical examples of the intermingling of peoples are relatively of little value compared to the actual phenomena which we find going on in our own country , if it be desired to make our study of sociological principles at all concrete . History of Immigration into the United States . ? The great economic opportunities offered by the settlement of the vast territory of the United States , together with a combination of causes in Europe , partly political , partly religious , and partly economic , have caused , during the past century , a flood of immigrants from practically all European countries to invade the United States , greater in number of individuals than any recorded migration in history . Between 182o , the first year for which we have immigration statistics , and 1923 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , d over one half of them coming since 189o . Before 182o it is improbable that immigration into the United States assumed any large proportions . Even up to 1840 the number of immigrants was comparatively insignificant . Thus in 1839 the number was only 68,000 , and not until 1842 did the number of immigrants first cross the 10o,0o0 mark . Owing to the potato famine in Ireland in the forties , however , and to the unsuccessful revolution in Germany in 1848 , the number of immigrants from Europe began greatly // to increase . From 1851 to 186o inclusive no less than 2,571,000 immigrants sought homes in this country . The number fell off greatly during the Civil War , and did not reach the same proportions again until the seventies . In the decade , 1881-1890 , the volume of immigration rose to 5,246,000 . The number of immigrants again declined during the nineties , owing largely to the financial depression in the United States , to 3,687,000 ; but during the decade 1901-1910 it surpassed all former records , and amounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods of immigration have hitherto been about ten or twenty years apart . Thus the first noteworthy maximum of 427,000 , in 1854 , was not surpassed again until 1873 , when another maximum of 459,000 was recorded ; in 1882 another maximum was reached of 788,000 , and in 1903 another maximum of 857,000 . After 1903 , however , immigration went on increasing until 1907 . These fluctuations in immigration correspond to the economic prosperity of the country , and , as Professor Commons has shown , are almost identical with the fluctuations in foreign imports . This shows very conclusively the prevailing economic character of modern migration . During 1905 , 1906 , and 1907 , indeed , the United States received more immigrants than its total population at the time of the Declaration of Independence . In 1905 the number was 1,027,000 ; in 1906 , 1,100,000 ; in 1907 , 1,285,000 . However , about twenty-five per cent must be deducted from these immigration statistics in prosperous years to allow for emigrants returning to their home countries . In years of economic depression and public calamity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the four years of the World War , the emigration from the United States almost equalled the immigration . ' Previous to 1890 , nearly all the immigrants who entered came from the countries of Northern Europe . It has been claimed that as high as ninety per cent came from Teutonic and Celtic countries , and were , accordingly , almost of the same blood as the early settlers ; but after 1890 the character of our immigration changed , so that after that time nearly seventy per cent came from non-Teutonic countries , such as Russia , Austria-Hungary , Italy , and Greece . The period of maximum immigration for the Irish to this country was the forties and fifties ; the period of maximum immigration for the Germans was the fifties and eighties ; and for the English , the seventies and eighties . But the period of maximum immigration for the Italians can scarcely as yet be reckoned by decades at all . The Italians first began coming in numbers exceeding 100,000 only in 1900 , but in 1907 , 285,000 of our immigrants were Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than those of the immigrants from any other single European nation in a single year , unless we count as one nation the immigrants of various nationalities sent to us by Austria-Hungary or by Russia . The immigration frg , fn Austria-Hungary , also , did not exceed soo , 000 until the year 1900 , but by 1905 it had reached 275,000 , and in 1907 , 338,000 . The immigration from Russiaconsisting largely // of Russian Jews and Poles , began to be considerable , if we include Poland in Russia , by 1892 , when it reached 122,000 . In 1903 , after falling off , it reached 136,000 ; in 1907 , 258,000 ; and in 1913 , 291,000 . The " Old " and the " New " Immigration . These statis tics have been cited to show the change in the sources from which we are receiving immigrants . This can be brought out still more clearly by contrasting a typical year previous to 1890 with one of the latest years . The year 1882 was the year , previous to 189o , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received 788,000 immi grants . Nearly all , as the table which we are about to give will show , came from countries of Northern Europe . In order to contrast the " old " immigration of a quarter of a century ago with the " new " immigration , let us compare the year 1882 with the year 1907 , which thus far has been the year of maximum immigration into the United States , ? the total number of immigrants for 1907 being 1,285,000 : 218 THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM It will be noted that while in 1882 , 71.3 per cent of our immigrants came from the countries of Western Europe , only 10.5 per cent came from the countries of Southern and Eastern Europe . In 1907 the situation was very nearly reversed . In 1907 Great Britain and Ireland , and Scandinavia , Germany , the Netherlands , Belgium , France , and Switzerland ? the countries which had furnished 71.3 per cent of our immigrants in 1882 ? furnished only 17.7 per cent , while Austria-Hungary , Italy , Russia , Greece , Servia , Roumania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished but 10.5 per cent in 1882 ? furnished 75.5 per cent . This matter of changed sources from which we receive our immigrants evidently is one of first impor tance in any consideration of the present immigration prob lem of the United States . The Distribution of Immigrants . If immigrants would distribute themselves evenly over the United States , the immigration problem would be quite different from what it is . Instead of this , there is a massing of immigrants in some states and communities , and very little evidence to // show that these immigrants ever distribute themselves normally over the whole country . In 1907 , for example , the Commissioner of Immigration reported that 65 per cent of the 1,285,000 immigrants who came that year went to the North Atlantic states ; 23 per cent to the North Central states ; 6 per cent to the Western states ; and 4.5 per cent to the Southern states . If these figures are at all trustworthy , they indicate a congestion of our recent immigrants in the North Atlantic states and in certain states of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics of the Commissioner of Immigration . According to the census of 1920 the number of foreign-born in the United States was 13,920,000 , or 13 per cent of the total population . But these foreign born were confined almost entirely to the Northern states ; that is , the North Atlantic states and North Central states . In 1920 the Southern states ( South Atlantic and South Central ) contained but 6.2 per cent of the total foreign born of the country . The reason why so few of our immigrants have thus far settled in the South is perhaps chiefly because of the competition which the cheap negro labor of the South would offer to them , and also because the South is still largely agricultural , offering few opportunities for the industrial employments , into which a majority of our immigrants go . In 1920 nearly one fourth of the population in the North Atlantic states was foreign born , and 20.3 per cent in the Pacific Coast states . The influence of the foreign born in the United States is perhaps better shown if we consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign born and their children . In a large number of states more than half of the popula220 THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM tion is of foreign stock . Thus in 1920 more than one half of the population was of foreign stock in Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Penn sylvania , Illinois , Michigan , Wisconsin , Minnesota , and North Dakota . For the United States as a whole the number of foreign stock in 1920 amounted to 34.8 per cent , or 36,715,000 out of a total population of 105,700,000 . Many of our large cities have a still higher percentage of foreign stock in their population . The following per centages were indicated by the census of 1920 : These figures show the tendency of our immigrants to mass together in our great cities . More than three fourths of our foreign born live in the cities . The census of 1920 showed that only 20.7 per cent of the people of New York city were of native white stock , while of the foreign white stock 946,129 were Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 616,627 were Irish . The immigrants also mass , as the census statistics also in dicate , in certain states . For a number of years the statis tics of the census and of the Commissioner-General of Immigration show that from two thirds to three fourths of our immigrants settle in the states of New York , PennTHE // sylvania , New Jersey , Massachusetts , Connecticut , Ohio , Michigan , Wisconsin , and Illinois . British immigrants distribute themselves relatively evenly over the country , but all other nationalities have certain favorite sections in which they settle . Thus , the Irish settle mainly in the North Atlantic states , while the Germans have two favorite settlements , one consisting of New York and Pennsylvania , and the other of Wisconsin and Illinois , though Michigan , Iowa , and Missouri also contain many Germans . The Scandinavians locate chiefly in the Northwest , especially in Minnesota and the Dakotas ; and the large number of foreign parentage in those states is due to Scandinavian immigration . As to immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe the CommissionerGeneral 's statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1907 : Of the 294,000 Italianspeaking immigrants who came to us in that year , 120,000 settled in the state of New York , 53,000 in Pennsylvania , 19,000 in Massachusetts , and 17,000 in New Jersey . Of the 138,000 Poles who came in 1907 , 33,000 were bound to Pennsylvania , 31,000 to New York , 12,000 to New Jersey , and 17,000 to Illinois . These four states seem to constitute the favorite places of settlement for the Slays . Of the 149,000 Hebrews who came in 1907 , 93,000 settled in New York state , 15,000 in Pennsylvania , and 9000 in Massachusetts , these three states being the favorite places of settlement for recent Jewish immigrants . It seems clear from these figures that the congestion of recent immigrants is serious , and it is a question whether with such congestion it will be possible to assimilate these recent corners , so unlike , ourselves in social traditions and // ideals , to the American type . It is claimed by some that there is no serious congestion of immigrants in this country , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences in the places where they are most needed , and that we need not , therefore , be concerned about the congestion of foreign born in certain communities . This view , however , that economic laws or forces will sufficiently attend to this matter of the distribution of our immigrants , is not borne out by the facts of ordinary observation and experience . The Distribution of Immigrants in Industry . It is probably safe to say that four fifths of our recent immigrants belong to the unskilled class of laborers , though the percentage of unskilled fluctuates greatly from year to year and from nationality to nationality . Out of the total of 1,285,000 immigrants in 1907 only 12,600 were recorded by the Commissioner of Immigration as belonging to the professional classes ; 190,000 , or about 15 per cent , were skilled laborers , including all who had any trade ; while 760,000 were unskilled laborers , including farm and day laborers ; and 304,000 were persons of no occupation , including women and children . When we consider the matter by races , the contrast is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1907 only 701 were professional men ; 26,000 , or 11 per cent , were skilled laborers ; while the number of unskilled amounted to 161,000 , or 66 per cent . Of the 138,000 Poles who came in 1907 , only 273 were professional men ; 8000 , or 6 per cent , were skilled laborers ; and 107,000 , or 77 per cent , were unskilled . In the case of the Hebrews , however , there is a much higher percentage of skilled laborers and professional men . It is // claimed by those who favor the policy of unrestricted immigration that what this country needs at present is a large supply of unskilled laborers , and so the fact that the mass of immigrants belong to the unskilled class of laborers , it is said , is no objection to them . The census of 1910 showed a very uneven distribution of the foreign born among the different classes of occupations . Thus , while the foreign born constituted about one seventh of the population , over one third of those engaged in manufacturing were foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign born ; one fourth of those engaged in transportation were foreign born ; one fourth of those engaged in domestic service were also foreign born , while only one tenth of those engaged in agriculture were foreign born . Two government commissions have shown that the foreign born form about one half of the labor force in our basic industries . It is in these industries that there is the greatest demand for cheap labor , and the presence of a large number of unskilled foreign laborers has made it possible for the American capitalists to develop these industries under such conditions probably faster than they would otherwise have been developed . At the same time , however , all of this has been a hardship to the native-born American laborer , as the tendency has been to eliminate the native born from these occupations to which the immigrants have flocked . Some Other Social Effects of Immigration . ? ( 1 ) The influence of immigration on the proportion of the sexes in this country has without doubt been considerable . In 1907 , out of a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a long period of // years about two thirds of all the immigrants into the United States have been males . This has greatly affected the proportion of the sexes in the United States , making the males , in 1920 , 2,090,000 in excess in our population . The influence of such a discrepancy in the proportion of the sexes is difficult to state , but it is obvious , from all that has previously been said about the importance of the numerical equality of the sexes in society , that the influence must be a considerable one , and that not for good . ( 2 ) The following table shows how far the increase of pop-ulation in the United States in the decennial periods since 1800 has been due to immigration and to reproduction . ' Until 184o the increase by immigration was so small as to be hardly noticeable , and therefore no account of it is taken . // This table shows that it is not certain that immigration has increased the total population of the United States , as a decrease of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this reason Professor Francis A. Walker held that it was doubtful that immigration had added anything to the population of the United States . At any rate , the population of the country was increasing just as rapidly before the large volume of immigration was received as it increased at any later time . Again , the Southern states , which have received practically no immigrants since the Civil War , have increased their population as rapidly as the Northern states , that is , the increase of population among the Southern whites has been equal to that of the Northern assisted by immigration . These two facts suggest that the immigrants have simply displaced an equal number of native born who would have been furnished by birth rate if the immigrants had never come . ( 3 ) Immigration has very largely aided in maintaining a considerable amount of illiteracy in the United States in spite of the effects of the propaganda for popular education which has been carried on now for the last fifty years or more . In 1920 there were still 4,931,905 illiterates above the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6. o per cent of the population above that age . Of these , 1,242,572 were native whites , while 1,763,740 were foreignborn whites . Nearly all of the native white illiterates in the United States are found in the Southern states , the white illiteracy in the Northern states being practically confined to the foreign born . Thus , in the state of New York 5.1 per cent are illiterate , but of the native whites only o.6 per // cent are illiterate , while 14.2 per cent of the foreign popula-tion can neither read nor write . Again , in Massachusetts 4.7 per cent of the population are illiterate , but of the native whites only 0.4 per cent are illiterate , while 12.8 per cent of the foreign born are illiterate . Statistics of illiteracy for our cities show the same results . Thus , in the city of New York 6.2 per cent of the population are illiterate , but only 0.3 per cent of the native whites are illiterate , while 13.8 per cent of the foreign born are illiterate . In Boston 4.0 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the native white population are illiterate , while 9.9 per cent of the foreign-born population are illiterate . Of the total immigration in 1907 , 30 per cent were illiterate . The number of illiterates from different countries varies greatly . It is interesting to contrast the " new " immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe with the " old " immi-gration from Northern and Western Europe . In 1907 , the illiterates among the Southern Italian immigrants numbered S3 per cent ; among the Ruthenians , 56 per cent ; among the Poles , 40 per cent ; among the Syrians , 54 per cent ; among the Russian Jews , 29 per cent . On the other hand , among German immigrants illiterates numbered only 4 per cent ; among Irish , 3 per cent ; English , 2 per cent ; and Scandinavians , 1 per cent . Illiteracy is not only a serious social and economic handicap for the immigrant ; it prevents his social assimilation . It makes it much more difficult for the immigrant to learn English , and so pre-vents his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number in our population who can-not speak English . In 1910 the number of persons in the // United States above the age of ten years who could not speak English was reported by the census to be 3,091,000 , but , largely owing to the development of Americanization work , in the year 1920 the number had been reduced to 1,570,000. ( 4 ) Crime and Poverty . It is said that crime is apt to accompany migration . However , down to 1910 our immigrants have not shown any exaggerated tendency to crime . The special prison census of 1910 showed that 26.2 per cent of the male white prisoners were foreign born , while 24.5 per cent of the general male white population above the age of fifteen years were foreign born . This shows a tendency to crime among the foreign born not greatly out of proportion to their numbers in the population . The same census , however , showed that 33.8 per cent of native white prisoners committed during 1910 were born of foreign parents , while this element constituted only 27.6 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of the foreign born there appears to be a greater tendency toward crime than among the foreign born themselves . The probable explanation of this is that the children of the foreign born are often reared in our large cities , and particularly in the slum districts of those cities . Thus the high criminality of the children of the foreign born is perhaps largely a product of urban life , but it may be suggested also that the children of the foreign born lack adequate parental control in their new American environment . Certain nationalities among our immigrants , however , seem strongly predisposed to crime . This is especially true of the Southern Italian . For example , the census of 1910 showed that 36.5 per cent // of the foreign-born prisoners committed for homicide during 1910 were Italians , whereas in 1900 Italians con stituted only 9.9 per cent of the total foreign-born popula tion . Again , in New York city in 1907 ? 1908 the Italian born constituted 26.9 per cent of those convicted of crimes of personal violence , while they constituted but slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city in 1910 . In the matter of poverty and dependence the foreign born make a more unfavorable showing . In the special census report on paupers for 1904 the proportion of foreign born among almshouse paupers was about twice as great as among the native born . Again , in a special investigation conducted by the Commissioner of Immigration in the year 1907-1908 , out of 288,395 inmates of charitable institutions there were 60,025 who were foreign born , or about 21 per cent , and out of 172,185 inmates of insane hospitals , 501734 , or about 29 per cent , were foreign born . Inasmuch as the foreign born did not constitute in 1907 ? 1908 more than 15 per cent of the total population of both sexes , it is seen that the foreign born contribute out of their proportion both to inmates of charitable institutions and to the num ber of the insane . The experience of Charity Organization Societies in many of our large cities , on the whole , confirms these findings . ' It is not surprising , indeed , that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing in this country , inasmuch as a very large proportion of them come to the United States bringing little or no money with them . Thus , for a number of years // the amount of money brought by immigrants from Russia varied from nine to fifteen dollars per head . On account of the difficulties of economic adjustment in a new country it is not surprising , then , that many of the immigrants become more or less dependent , some temporarily and some permanently . Immigration into Other Countries . ? It has been suggested that with the opening up of other new countries the immigration problem of the United States would solve itself , and that so many emigrants from Europe will soon be going to South America , South Africa , and Australia that this country will be in no danger of receiving more than its share . Down to recent years , however , there have been little or no signs of such a diversion of the stream of immigration from Europe into those countries . The principal countries which receive immigrants , other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Australia . While Brazil has received between 182o and 1922 a total of 3,648,000 immigrants , the present number of immigrants into Brazil seems to be comparatively small ; in 1913 it was only 192,684 . Argentina , next to the United States , receives the most considerable immigration from Europe . From 1857 to 1920 Argentina received 5,121,000 immigrants . In 1920 the number was 155,000 , of whom over 6o per cent were from Italy and Spain . The foreign immigration into other South American countries is comparatively insignificant . In 1921 Australia received 87,938 immigrants , most of whom were British , but the emigration from Australia almost equaled the immigration into Australia in that year . Again , in 1923 the Dominion of Canada received 137,000 immigrants , almost // wholly from Great Britain and the United States . An unknown number , however , of Canadians migrate across the border into the United States , ? no record being kept of Canadian immigration into the United States since 1885 , except of those who come by way of seaports . Thus . it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the War , than all the other countries of the world combined , and , as we have said , there is as yet little or no evidence that the stream of European emigration will be diverted for some years to come to these other countries . The problem of immigration in the United States is not , therefore , a problem of the past , but is still a problem of the future . Therefore , the question of reasonable restrictions upon immigration into this country and of the assimilation of the immigrants that we admit is still a pressing problem in our national life . Arguments for the Restriction of Immigration . ? There are no good moral or political grounds to exclude all immi-grants from this country . The question is not one of the prohibition of immigration , but one of reasonable restric-tions upon immigration , or , as Professor Commons has said , of the improvement of our immigration . There can be no question as to the moral right of the United States to restrict immigration . If it is our duty to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will make the largest possible contribution to the good of humanity , then it is manifestly our duty to exclude from membership in American society elements which might prevent our institutions from reaching their highest and best development . All restrictions to immi-gration , it must be admitted , must be based , not upon // national selfishness , but upon the principle of the good of humanity ; and there can be no doubt that the good of humanity demands that every nation protect its people and its institutions from elements which may seriously threaten their stability and survival . The arguments in favor of further restrictions upon the immigration into this country may be summed up along four lines : ( 1 ) The Industrial Argument . Many of the immigrants work for low wages , and , as we have already seen , offer such competition that the native born , in certain lines of industry , are almost entirely eliminated . This has been , no doubt , a hardship to the native-born American workingman . While we have been zealous to protect the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective tariffs , yet inconsistently we have permitted great numbers of European laborers to compete with the American workingman upon his own soil . With unrestricted immigration it is impossible to maintain a minimum wage or other means of protecting the standard of living of the American workingman . On the other hand , this large supply of cheap labor , as we have already seen , has enabled American capitalists to develop American industries very rapidly , to dominate in many cases the markets of the world , and to add greatly to the wealth of the country . It has been chiefly the large employers of labor in the United States , together with the steamship companies , who have opposed any considerable restrictions upon immigration , and thus far their power with Congress has successfully prevented the passing of stringent immigration laws . On the whole , it is probably true that if industrial arguments alone are to be taken into // consideration upon the immigration problem , the weight of the argument would be on the side of unrestricted immigration . But industrial arguments are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration problem , and this has been hitherto one of the great mistakes of many in discussing the problem . ( 2 ) The Social Argument . Many of our recent immigrants are at least very difficult of social assimilation . They are clannish , tend to form colonies of their own race in which their language , customs , and ideals are preserved . The " consciousness of kind , " which is such a great factor in social life , while it binds them together , works at the same time to keep them separate and distinct from the rest of the American people . This is especially true of the illiterate immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe . As we have already seen , the rate of illiteracy among certain of our recent immigrants is so high that they can scarcely be expected to participate in our social life . Just the social effect of such colonies of different peoples and nationalities upon our own social life and institutions can not well be foreseen , but it can scarcely be a good effect . The public school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals and standards the children of even the most unassimilable immigrants . The public school is not as yet , however , a perfect agency of socialization , and even when attended by the children of these immigrants they fail to receive from it , in many cases , the higher elements of our culture and still continue to remain essentially foreign in their thought and actions . ( 3 ) The Political Argument . Many of these immigrants are , therefore , incapable of understanding and appreciatTHE // ing our free institutions . They are not fit to vote intelligently , but often vote even before naturalization am l form a very large per cent of our voting population , especially in our large cities . As a rule , they do not sell their votes , but their votes are often under the control of a few leaders , and thus they are able to hold , oftentimes , the balance of power between parties and factions . It is questionable whether democracy can work successfully under such conditions . It must be admitted , moreover , that hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a good degree of mental and moral likeness among citizens , that is , in communities not too heterogeneous in their elements . ( 4 ) The Racial or Biological Argument . Undoubtedly the strongest arguments in favor of further restriction upon immigration into the United States are of a biological nature . The peoples that are coming to us at present belong to a different race from ours . They belong to the Slavic and Mediterranean subraces of the white race . Now , the Slavic and Mediterranean races have not shown the capacity for self-government and free institutions which the peoples of Northern and Western Europe have shown . It is doubtful if they have the same capacity for self-government . Moreover , the whole history of the social life and social ideals of these people shows them to have been in their past development very different from ourselves . Of course , if heredity counts for nothing , it will only be a few generations before the descendants of these people will be as good I Americans as any . But this is the question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are habits of acting and , therefore , social and institutional life , dependent , more // or less , on the biological heredity of peoples , or are they entirely independent of such biological influence ? There is much diversity of opinion upon this question , but perhaps the most trustworthy opinion inclines to the view that racial heredity , even between subraces of the white race , is a factor of great moment and must be taken into account . It is scarcely probable that a people of so different racial heredity from ourselves as the Southern Italians , for example , will maintain our institutions and social life exactly as those of our blood would do . It is impossible to think that the Latin temperament would express itself socially in the same ways as the Teutonic temperament . Certainly the coming to us of the vast numbers of peoples from Southern and Eastern Europe is destined to change our physical type , and it seems also probable that if permitted to go on , it will change our mental and social type also . Whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide for himself . Another phase of this biological argument is the necessity of selection , if we are to avoid introducing into our national blood the degenerate strains in the oppressed peoples of Southern and Eastern Europe . If selection counts in the life of a people , as practically all biologists agree , then the American people certainly have a great opportunity to exercise selection on a large scale to determine who shall be the parents of the future Americans . While it is undesirable , perhaps , to discriminate among immigrants on the ground of race , it would certainly be desirable to select from all peoples those elements that we could most advantageously incorporate into our own life . The biological argument alone , therefore , seems to necessiTHE // tate the admission of the importance of rigid selection in the matter of whom we shall admit into this country . Hitherto little has been accomplished in the way of insuring adequate health and physique among the immigrants admitted into the United States . All that has been attempted thus far has been to debar the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  An adequate scientific immigration policy requires , first , reasonable restrictions upon the admission of immigrants , and secondly , positive measures to insure their Americanization after their admission . The general principle which should guide all immigration legislation is that only such number should be admitted as we can successfully assimilate fully in our national life . For this reason a law which would limit the maximum permissible annual immigration from any people to a certain per cent ( say , from three to ten ) of those from that nationality who have already become naturalized citizens ? the per cent to be fixed each year by a commission according to the demand for labor and other national circumstances ? would be a scientific law . The second principle which should guide our immigration legislation is that economic adjustment is fundamental for successful assimilation ; hence we should admit only so many immigrants as we can give employment to at reasonable wages . Scientific control over in ) migration must take into account the demand for gal and other economic conditions . This can be done by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country each year in advance . The third principle in a scientific immigration policy // should be to give preference to those immigrants who come to make permanent homes in the United States . Hence preference should be given to those who come as families , rather than as single men . Hence also preference should be given to those who are willing to declare their intention to become citizens of the United States . Certain tests of physical , mental , and moral fitness for citizenship should also be employed . Among these tests the value of a literacy test for a democracy , such as ours , is hardly questionable . The chief advance made during the World War toward a more rational immigration policy was the enactment of the immigration law of 1917 , which among other things provides for the exclusion of illiterate immigrants ( those who can not read in some language ) who are over sixteen years of age . There has been much contention over this feature of the law , but from the sociological point of view there can be little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus to participate more or less fully in the life of the society about one , is a necessary foundation not only for social assimilation , but for social progress . Democracy means government by public opinion ; but the chief means of forming and disseminating public opinion is now the press . Hence , those who can not read can scarcely function in a democracy , especially not in its rational progress . Moreover , it has been shown that the illiterate immigrant is most liable to suffer from exploitation and adjusts himself to his environment with greatest difficulty . Finally , a literacy test will probably react to better educational and social conditions in Europe . Those fleeing from religious persecution , the law provided , were to be exempted from the test , also purely political // offenders , wives and daughters of immigrants , and certain near relatives above fifty-five years of age . The value of a literacy test by itself is , however , very slight . It will exclude very few , at least in the long run , and by itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More stringent tests of biological and social fitness should be added . All tests should , of course , be enforced by examining immigration officers at ports of embarkation in Europe , to prevent needless hardships in the administration of the law . The laws of 1921 and 1924 , restricting immigration on a percentage basis , were designed chiefly to limit the number of immigrants , and were not based wholly on scientific principles . The Americanization of Our Immigrants . ? Even more important than the question of the proper selection of our immigrants is the question of the Americanization of those that we admit . While we perhaps can not be too careful as to whom we admit into our national household , we can not do too much for those to whom we allow a share in our national destinies . Hence our attitude toward the immigrant admitted should be positive and helpful , not negative . Hitherto the treatment accorded to the immigrant has been too often one of neglect . In the past we maintained the open-door policy with respect to European immigration of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content to let their labor be selfishly exploited by their employers , and to let them live and rear their children in the slums of our great cities . We la ( krd , in other words , a fine sense of hospitality toward the immigrant and of responsibility for him and his children . // Many immigrants , indeed , have had to submit to hardships and evils in American life which they would never have experienced had they remained in their European home lands . Now we are waking up to the importance of Americanization , of making the immigrant one with us in tradition , ideals , and loyalty . The problem is a complex one and there is danger of making many mistakes . The Americanization of the immigrant means his social assimilation into American society . Now social assimilation , the successful incorporation of new elements into a social group , can come about only through enlisting the will and the loyalty of the newcomers . It can not be brought about through compulsion . The newcomers need to have presented to them the best ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American life . Moreover , the ideas and habits which they bring with them should be carefully evaluated . The process of assimilation is not wholly one-sided ; it should be a process of give and take . Such a process leads to the comparison of the ideas , beliefs , standards , and values of both groups . It develops the critical-mindedness of both groups , and usually results in the selection of the best in the traditions and customs of both . Certain conditions must be observed if the process of social assimilation is to go on in this happy way . In the first place , an atmosphere of tolerance and of hospitality must be maintained by Americans toward all immigrant groups admitted . If this can not be maintained toward any group , it is better not to admit such a group . Any attempt at coercion of new elements , or any attitude of unfriendliness toward them , is almost certain to create in them attitudes which will hinder their assimilation . // It follows , secondly , that sympathy and consideration should be cultivated between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mutual adjustment of individuals . Thirdly , there must be frequency of personal contact between immigrants and Americans , so that there may be opportunity for mutual acquaintance , mutual understanding , mutual imitation , and the free exchange of ideas . Territorial isolation interferes with such social contact and should be reduced to a minimum by proper distribution of the immigrants . Caste and class lines also are fatal to the assimilation of the foreign born , and they must be carefully guarded against . Fourthly , there should be association to some extent in common work ; for the division of labor will tend to keep the new elements separate from the old and prevent the personal contacts of which we have just spoken . Fifthly , linguistic isolation must be overcome , or at least minimized . Linguistic isolation is fatal to social assimilation . It is obvious that a common language is needed for communication and as the vehicle of the essential traditions of Americanism . The foreign born in America should be taught , not only to speak , but to read English as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mistake , if their mother tongue has a rich tradition of culture , to discourage its preservation . Americans are already too much a people with knowledge only of a single language . Every facility should be made to learn English , but it should be remembered that persons with a knowledge of several languages may make more valuable citizens on that account .
