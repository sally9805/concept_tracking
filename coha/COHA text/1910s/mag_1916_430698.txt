 |p526  AT the outbreak of the war in 1914 Arabia still presented a conglomerate picture of dependent , semi-dependent , and independent political divisions . Syria , Mesopotamia , and Hedjaz were under Turkish domination . These three provinces also constituted the most civilized parts of Arabia . In Syria , where Christianity made more headway than in any other part of the Ottoman empire , many miles of railroads had been built . In Mesopotamia , the Constantinople-Bagdad railway , the completion of which was interrupted by the war , proved a potent civilizing factor . And , finally , even in Hedjaz , where the holy cities of Mecca and Medina are located , a railroad was being constructed . At the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula is Aden , guarding the entrance into the Red Sea , and an absolute dependency of Great Britain . So also is El Katr , on the Persian Gulf . North of it is El Hasa , a Turkish dependency now under the influence of Nejd . North of Aden , on the Red Sea , lies Yamen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity was introduced long before the Prophet was born , only to be swept away with the arrival of Mohammedanism . An unhappy region is Yamen , torn by internal strife and frequent rebellion against Turkey , which was trying to control the province inhabited by industrious Arabs and Jews . But Turkey never succeeded in wresting complete control of Yamen at the expense of the Imam of the region , who claims direct descent from Mohammed . In 1913 an agreement was reached between the Imam and Turkey by which the Ottoman governor was recognized by the Imam officially , the latter retaining full control of all internal affairs . Thus Yamen should be classified as a semi-dependency of Turkey , as also is Asir , located on the Red Sea between Yamen and Hedjaz , in which the rebel chief Idrisi is still in arms against both Turkey and the Imam of Yamen . Oman , on the Gulf of Oman , is an independent kingdom , with British leanings . The heart of the Arabian peninsula , however , is still free of any foreign yoke . Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Turkish knowl/ edge of it is even less than that of Europe , which is mighty little . The northern half of the inner part of the Arabian peninsula is known as Nejd . Nejd is bounded by Hedjaz , the Syrian desert , Mesopotamia , and the Persian Gulf on three sides . As its southern boundary the 23 ? N. latitude may be taken . Nejd is the only real independent entity in Arabia . Its Emir , a scion of the Saoad dynasty , a young man of about twenty-four , is described as a " dashing , crafty leader . " This desert kingdom never had acknowledged Turkish rule . Its nomadic subjects look up to the Emir of Najd as the champion of Arabian freedom . No information whatever had reached the outside world on the attitude of Nejd toward the Arabian revolution engineered by the Sherif of Mecca . South of Nejd , between Yamen and Oman , lies the so-called Empty Quarter , the most arid part of the peninsula , void of any kind of habitation , where life , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to thrive . The situation in Arabia , Syria , and the Levant now presents two phases , each of which represents a distinctly individual and independent force in the revolutionary movement among the Arabs . One of these two phases is religious , the other political . The first deals with those currents of thought and action in the Moslem world that are responsible for the failure of the Jehad , or the Holy War , proclaimed in 1914 by the Sheikul-Islam under the influence of the Sultan of Turkey . The second is concerned with the nationalist movements in Greater Arabia and the interests of France , Russia , and Great Britain in that territory . A study of the two phases will reveal the causes of the present revolution in Arabia , its full significance , and its probable effects on Turkey and , consequently , on the Great War . ARABIAN NATIONALISM The Arabian nationalist movement is a little more than twenty years old . In 1895 there came into existence in Paris the Arabian National Committee , one of the chief founders of which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted all his life to the regeneration of the Arabian people . The aims and purposes of the Arabian Nationalists were set forth in a manifesto issued by them some years later , which said in part : The Arabs . . . are awakened to their historical national and ethnographical homogeneousness , and aim to separate themselves from the Ottoman body and form an independent state . This new Arabian state will be confined to its natural boundaries , from the Tigris and Euphrates to the Suez Canal , and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Sea of Oman . It will be governed by a liberal constitutional monarchy of an Arabian sultan . It will be seen from the words of this manifesto that the future independent Arabian nation was not to be confined to geographical Arabia , but was to include all those possessions of the Turkish empire where the majority of the population was Arabian . Thus , Syria , the Levant , Palestine were all to become part of the new Arabia . However , the vilayet of Hedjah and the district of Medina were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be the religious Caliph of all the Moslems . This latter plan was a solution of the difficult problem presented in the Moslem world by the religious power held by the Turkish Sultan as the Caliph in Islam . The autonomy of the Levant was to be respected , and the places in Palestine sacred to Christendom were to retain their status quo . Such an Arabian state would contain a population of about twelve million , 85 per cent . of which would be Moslem . Negib Azoury Bey , one of the leaders of the Arabian nationalists , in his sensational book " Le Reveil de la Nation Arabe , " published in Paris in 1905 , went as far as to include Mesopotamia in the projected Arabia and to deny all Jewish claims to Palestine . His dream was a united Arabia , independent , progressive , a force in civilization , a cradle for the renaissance of Arabian art , literature , and science . It was then that the Young Arabians began to exert considerable influence on the Arabian people . Especially was this influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum than anywhere else . ADVERSE INFLUENCES ? THE YOUNG TURKS A setback to the revolutionary activities of the Young Arabs was the Turkish Revolution . When the Young Turks turned Turkey into a constitutional monarchy , the Arabs expected some kind of an autonomy for Arabia from the new government . The hopes of the Arabs ran high . They were represented to a large extent in the Turkish Parliament . But it was not very long before the policies of the Young Turks became clear . The Arabian Club , formed in 1908 at Constantinople , was the institution representing those elements among the Arabs  |p529  who demanded , at least , cultural autonomy from the Young Turks . There is no need to enlarge on the attitude of the latter toward the nationalities inhabiting Turkey . That attitude resembled closely the Prussian attitude toward the Polish population of Prussia . T h e Turkish " kultur " was to be disseminated by all means among the population of the Ottoman empire . Armenians , Arabs , Jews were to be ' ' Ottomanized " and fused into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this program was the re-awakening of the nationalist movement among the Arabs . In 1913 there was held in Paris an Arabian Congress , and the revolutionary activities in Svria and Arabia were resumed . EUROPEAN CLAIMS AND INTERESTS Along with these internal agitations of the Arabs , which have now culminated in the revolution , there were also going on the German , French , British , and Russian tivities , mainly intrigues , in the Turkish empire . Germany was interested in the Berlinto-Bagdad railroad project , and her agents were infesting Arabia from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf . Great Britain , in order to secure her Indian possessions and the Aden Protectorate , was seeking to acquire Arabia , thus making the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf British in their entirety . France has long had more than a passing interest in Syria and the Levant . Russia was still concerned with Armenian Turkey . Perhaps of all the claims these European powers had in Asiatic Turkey none was more justified than that of France in Syria . For France bases her claims on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly a century . Compte Cressaty , in the April , 1915 , issue of the Revue Politique et Parlementaire ( Paris ) , makes out in his article on " France and the Syrian Question " a very strong case for the French acquisition of Syria . The dominant European language in Syria is French . There are as many pupils in French schools in Syria as in the schools of all other nations combined . France had constructed in Syria and in the Levant about 800 kilometers of railway . And , finally , as well as chief among the reasons for French acquisition of Syria , is the feeling of the Arabs themselves . They are more inclined to France than to any other European nation . With the fate of Turkey and German interests in the Near East sealed , there remain France , Great Britain , and Russia to divide the spoils . But Russia has no material interest in Arabia and Syria . And the Young Arabs are , therefore , confronted with the aspirations of France and Great Britain only . That these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That to resist France and Great Britain , or either of them , is an impossibility , was just as evident to the Young Arabs . The dilemma was by no means easy of solution . The best that they could do under the circumstances was to choose between the two . And Young Arabia has apparently chosen France . A FRENCH PROTECTORATE PROPOSED There appeared early in the year in Paris a book entitled " La Syrie de Demain . " Its author is Narda Mutran , a Syrian Arab , a Christian , and one of the leaders of the Arabian nationalists . He was formerly one  |p530  of the most gifted advocates of an independent Arabian state . The conditions brought about by the war have modified his former views . And what he has to say concerning the future of Arabia is , in all probability , the view now held by most revolutionary Arabs of education . Narda Mutran gives up the idea of an independent Arabian state , and proposes instead a French protectorate over Arabia and Syria . To this conclusion the author arrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . France has Algeria , Tunis , Morocco , and it would be but logical for her to take over the Arabian population of the Turkish empire . France would have to grant the Arabs certain measures of self-government . She would let the Arabs develop their own civilization , their own culture , and would also bring to them the fruit of the western ' European civilization . He holds , then , that France is more entitled to Syria and Arabia than any other European nation . SYRIAN GRATITUDE TO FRANCE To substantiate this opinion of the author of " La Syrie de Demain , " which , by the way , proved so popular in France that in a short time a second edition of the book was required , there is the fact that in the ranks of the French army about 800 Young Arabs are enlisted . These Arabs , most of them coming from Syria , have volunteered their services to France . No more striking proof of the affection the educated Arabs have for France and the gratefulness they feel for her work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving their lives for France , these Syrians believe that they are also sacrificing themselves for a regenerated Arabia . They also believe that in return for their services France will have the interests of the Arabs at heart . That this belief of the Syrian volunteers is not ill-founded has already been proved by events of the past few months . A recent despatch from Berne , Switzerland , tells of the arrival there of Syrian refugees who brought with them a proclamation of the Turkish commander in Syria , which shows the names of twenty prominent Syrians , including officers , magistrates , and journalists , who were sentenced to death for high treason and executed at Damascus and Beirut . In all about 200 persons have been executed by the Turkish authorities . Among these was Sheikh Abdul-Hamid Zehrawi , perhaps the leading Mohammedan identified with the Arab nationalist movement . The executed Arabs all died with " Vive la France " on their lips . The Lebanon district has been surrounded by Turkish forces , according to information in possession of the Marquis of Crewe , recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the inhabitants were on the point of starvation . The French Government , upon learning of conditions in Syria , through Premier Briand , requested the United States to inform Turkey that it would hold her responsible for the crimes reported to have been committed by her in Syria . WHAT THE REVOLUTION MEANS From a political point of view , then , the Arabian situation may be summarized thus : Political Arabia , revolutionary Arabia , that part of the Arabian people that has awakened to a nationalistic conscience and national aspirations , those Christian and Moslem Arabs who have been raised and educated in the European fashion , are for an autonomous Arabia , under a French protectorate , if independence is impossible . The chief significance of the revolution lies in the fact that it is a Pan-Arabian movement , and therefore not in accord with French designs on Syria . That the revolution now going on in Arabia is the product , to a large degree , of the activities of the Young Arabs is proved by the fact that the revolution is come on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities of Syrian intellectuals . Now , the revolt of last year in Syria was a purely political movement . That it has reverberated so deeply in Arabia speaks for the Arabian revolutionary activities . These activities , if they constitute the main force in the present revolution , may yet cause the establishment of an independent political Arabian state . A CALIPHATE IN ARABIA The religious force behind the events transpiring in Arabia at present is to be found in the reason for the failure of the Jehad . The Holy War failed because most of the Arabs do not acknowledge the Sultan of Turkey as the rightful Caliph in Islam , nor do most of the Indian and Russian Moslems recognize the Sultan as such . The Caliph is the spiritual leader in Islam . Any independent Arabian state would have to have in its midst or as its friend the Caliph . It is obvious that so long as the Sultan of Turkey is alone in claiming the right to the Caliphate he , in a measure , is a source of  |p531  page deleted  |p532  INDEPENDENCE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bespeaks a range of vision and a degree of civilization on their part which promises the birth of an independent Arabia . The Grand Sherif of Mecca , the head of the revoliItionary movement , has issued a proclamation in which the religious and political forces seem to have joined hands . In announcing a definite rupture between orthodox Mohammedans and those represented by the Committee of Union and Progress , which is now in control of Turkey , the proclamation makes reference to the Committee 's disastrous alliance with Germany and , what is vastly more important , it mentions the government 's executions in Syria , where , it will be remembered , the revolutionary movement is entirely political in its nature . " Independence and national rights " are words included in the proclamation along with the " Preservation of Islam . " The text of the Grand Sherif 's manifesto , addressed to " all our Moslem brothers , " follows in part : It is well known that of all the Moslem rulers and Emirs , the Emirs of Mecca , the Favored City , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emirs continued to support the Ottoman Empire until the Society of Union and Progress appeared in the state and proceeded to take over the administration thereof and all its affairs , with the result that the state suffered a loss of territory which quite destroyed its prestige , as the whole world knows ; was plunged into the horrors of this war , and brought to its present perilous position , as it is patent to all . . All this evidently did not fulfil the designs of the Society of Union and Progress . They proceeded next to sever the essential bond between the Ottoman Sultanate and the whole Moslem community , to wit , adherence to the Koran and the Sunna . One of the Constantinople newspapers actually published an article maligning ( God forgive us ! ) the life of the Prophet ( on whom the prayer and peace of God ) , and this under the eye of the Grand Vizier and its Sheikh of Islam and all the Ulema , ministers and nobles ! . In spite of all , we accepted these innovations in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last the veil was removed , and it became apparent that the empire was in the hands of Enver Pasha , Jemal Pasha , and Talaat Bey , who were administering it just as they liked , and treated it according to their own sweet will . . . . At one time they caused to be hanged twenty-one eminent and cultured Moslems and Arabs of distinction in addition to those they previously put to death . We might hear their excuse and grant them pardon for killing these worthy men ; but how can we excuse them for banishing under such pitiful and heart-breaking circumstances the families of their victims ? infants , delicate women , and aged men ? and inflicting on them other forms of suffering in addition to the agonies they had already endured in the death of those who were the support of their homes ? Even if we could let all this pass , how is it possible to forgive them confiscating the property and money of those people after bereaving them of their dear ones ? We are determined not to leave our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union and Progress party . God has vouchsafed this land an opportunity to rise in revolt , has enabled her by His power and might to seize her independence and crown her efforts with prosperity and victory , even after she was crushed by the maladministration of the Turkish civil and military officials . She stands quite apart and distinct from countries that still groan under the yoke of the Union and Progress government . She is independent in the fullest sense of the word , freed from the rule of strangers and purged of every foreign influence . Her principles are to defend the faith of Islam , to elevate the Moslem people , to found their conduct on the holy law , to build up the code of justice on the same foundation in harmony with the principles of religion , to practise its ceremonies in accordance with modern progress , to make a genuine revolution by sparing no pains in spreading education among all classes according to their station and needs . This is the policy we have undertaken in order to fulfil our religious duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and West will pursue the same in fulfilment of their duty to us , and so strengthen the bonds of the Islamic brotherhood . The kernel of the new Arabia has thus been created . With the increasing plight of Turkey , this kernel will grow and expand in all directions . The Arabian tribes who have not as yet joined the revolutionists will undoubtedly respond to the Grand Sherif 's manifesto and flock to his banner . Turkey is powerless to prevent the growth of the movement . She has enough trouble as it is in Armenia and in Europe , where the entrance of Rumania into the war again places Constantinople in a precarious position . The Arabian state will therefore have the opportunity to gather strength and prepare to hold its own at the conclusion of peace in humanity . If the Arabs will present a united front at the expected peace conference , if they will have proved their ability to maintain order and responsible government , they will have the public opinion of the world backing their national claims . With such a power behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object to the regeneration of the Arabian nation .
