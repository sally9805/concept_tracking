have little or nothing to do with his colleague Frye ; and as for Reed , the earth was barely large enough to hold them both when they were most in evidence in our public life . With all his eccentricities and weaknesses , Hale was a Senator whom his contemporaries had to reckon with , a powerful personality . It took something of a man to serve one Northern State in Congress from 1869 to 1911 and to refuse m that interval the Postmaster-Generalship in Grant 's Cabinet and the naval portfolio in its successor . TATTLER . In Defence of Romain Rolland By MARION E BOWLER . Never , perhaps , has there been a more striking example of the truth of the old saying , " Give me two lines of writing of any one and I will have the author hang  --  ed , " than in the case of Romain Rolland  --  who has just been honored by the award of the Nobel prize for literature ! A number of echoes have reached us of the persecu  --  tion carried on against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have admired him as the author of " Jean ? Christophe " have been unable to believe that a man whose ideals were so in harmony with their own , who had presented them with so inspiring a view of life , could suddenly fail Lis country in its time of greatest need , could , as his enemies chose to put it , re  --  tire to Switzerland and perch on a peak of moral superiority where he might maintain his neutrality or die in the attempt ! Un  --  fortunately , neither the articles on which the accusations were supposedly based nor the defences which came out in Europe were available to us in America , so that we were more or less at the mercy of one or two foreign correspondents who were evi  --  dently over-influenced by the hostile at  --  mosphere in which they possibly found them  --  selves . It seemed , therefore , that to make known the truth about the whole affair would be both worth while and interesting , for if Romain Rolland has had his full share of enemies since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and many of them , who deserve to be heard . That I am able to give such a view is due to the cour  --  tesy of Monsieur Rolland himself , who , be  --  sides writing me concerning the more per  --  sonal phases of the situation , has made it possible for me to see various articles that probably rarely reach this country , and from which I have drawn in preparing this arti  --  die . It might be well to add here that , be  --  ing in Switzerland , at Vevey , when the war broke out , M. Rolland , who was beyond the age for active military duties , offered his services to the Red Cross International Agency for Prisoners of War , in connection with which work he has more than once had the opportunity to render assistance to friends of those who were attacking him in France . It will be remembered that during the first year of the war Rolland wrote a series of articles which came out in the Journal de Gen6ve and were refused publication in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their lack of patriotism being that they did not extol war and that their au  --  thor refused to identify love of his own country with hatred of other countries , espe  --  cially , of course , of Germany . " One makes war on governments , not on nations , " he as  --  serted . Because he refused to give up those of his German friends who had not , like Hauptman , abjured their common ideals , because he felt , as he had already said in " Jean-Christophe , " that in a crisis between two countries , the " duty and happiness of friends like himself Olivier and Christo  --  pher was to love one another and to keep their reason uncontaminated by the general upheaval , " and because , not being able to go to the front and dress the material wounds of his country , as Walt Whitman did during the War of Secession , he chose to tend the moral wounds , to be a guide to his distracted countrymen by keeping his rea  --  son clear , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped him . That Anatole France and Octave Mirbeau faced about and rallied to the support of the Government in its most exaggerated posi  --  tion was considered an additional proof of Rolland 's defection , and some of the most distinguished men in France took up arms against him , deliberately misleading the public as to his intentions , so afraid were they of the effect of his words on popular opinion . Bergson , the well-known philoso  --  pher , whose violence since the outbreak of the war must eventually detract from his reputation as a thinker ; Professor Aulard , of the Sorbonne , who in this case seems to have entirely forgotten to apply to his state  --  ments the usual historian 's methods of veri  --  fication of facts , both wrote ill-founded and venomous attacks , and Henri Massis , in l'Opinion and l'Action Frangasse , even un  --  dertook to belittle " Jean-Christophe " as a feeble means of hurting Rolland 's reputa  --  tion . The very sharpness of the attacks prove their weakness . Indeed , some papers went so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was really French , while Stdphane Servant , in a review in the Bonnet Rouge of the injurious attack by Paul Hyacinthe Loyson , inquired whether he had read the official papers ! It is astonishing that a man like Rolland could have been condemned without a hear  --  ing in a country which prides itself , as France do6s , on the liberty of speech it ac  --  cords . As he put it himself : " I can not un  --  derstand why a people who are fighting he  --  roically without for liberty can not defend it at home . " Nothing , of course , but the ex  --  treme tension of patriotism roused by war could in any way explain such a situation , or the fact that these malicious attacks were countenanced by the people at large . That they were as successful as they were is due to the fact that Rolland 's friends received no hearing , or struggled against a prejudiced censorship which even suppressed certain pa  --  pers that took his side . Such men as Jacques Mesnil , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Amedee Dunois , of l'Huntanzte ; Jean Longuet , a Socialist Dep  --  uty ; Maximilien Luce , an artist ; Prof. Paul Seippel , of Geneva , and others sprang to his defence , but only by means of Swiss publications or in pamphlets could most of them state their case . Nevertheless , as soon as his articles could be read without mutila  --  tion , that is , about last December , when they appeared in book form , ' their influence began to spread , so true was it , as one of his defenders said , that many a heart in France was ready to echo to the ideals he stood for , though they dared not themselves run so counter to the public delirium as to express them . Besides the friends and read  --  ers who urged M. Rolland to continue his fight , he had other more general proofs of sympathy , as in the address of the Guild of Blacksmiths sent him to protest against the attacks of which he was the object , and to encourage him in his campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feddration des Syndscats d'In , stituteurs et d'Institu ? &tees; Publics , gave part of two numbers of their paper to him , and the delegates of the labor unions who met in August , 1915 , sent him the following letter , which touched him deeply : To Romain . Rolland : A meeting of the trades unions , departmental unions of workingmen 's syndicates and na  --  tional federation of corporations and indus  --  tries , grouped in the general French federa  --  tion , was held the 15th of August , at Paris Those delegates who could come together after that conference , unanimously moved by your decision to renounce public expression of your opinions , wished to send you an expres  --  sion of their ardent sympathy . They beg you not to allow yourself to be moved by the abuse or hostile literary manifestations of those who , alone in the present hour , cRri freely express their thoughts . As representatives of organi zations they assure you that your words have a deep echo among the workers who have re  --  mained faithful to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hope soon to have the joy of learning that You have reconsidered your decision and are resuming your action , more than ever needed This decision temporarily to give up the expression of his opinions was due to the impossibility of having them published in  --  tact , making a very one-sided struggle , in which , as Rolland said , his enemies had full liberty to express themselves , while his friends ' hands were tied and to him was re  --  fused the opportunity to explain his posi  --  tion . It would be a mistake , however , to suppose that he gave up in discouragement . He wrote to Henri Guilbeaux in September , 1914 : " We must not yield to discourage  --  ment . After this horrible war our task will be greater and finer than ever . Difficult , without doubt . Perilous , perhaps . But what of that ? And so much the better ! " How it *Acs-Deastle de la Melee reminds us of Jean-Christophe , crying : " What is life ? A tragedy . Hurrah ! " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the French papers were accusing Rolland of being a friend of the Germans , trying to carry on a neutral correspondence with that country , the German papers had joined the general chorus of abuse , and every review which had a tendency to inde  --  pendence of speech in either country was immediately accused of being secretly in  --  spired by him ! Nothing could have been more trying to a man of his frankness and jealous individualism . He wrote to me : " I do not consent to any articles being attribut  --  ed to me except those I have published my  --  self . I am and shall always be a free man , independent of all groups , whether political , social , or religious , and every one in France knows it . " As to the accusation that he had written a letter of encouragement to the women at The Hague , though there would certainly have been no disgrace in such an action , in reality the article referred to was written for the English suffragist paper , Jus Suffragsi , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he be  --  gan his articles what he was risking . " He who determines to defend peace among men in the midst of war , " he said , " feels that he is risking his faith , his tranquillity , his rep  --  utation , and even his friends ; but what is a faith worth for which one risks nothing ? " Again , in a letter to Henri ' Guilbeaux , from which I have already quoted : " I , too , have passed through a cruel crisis . Not only without but within , so many duties , pas  --  sions , and hostile instincts . Now , I have seen the light , so far as I am concerned , and I know my duty . It will bring me face to face with those madmen who are feeding on hatred , and it will rouse dangerous ran  --  cor against me . But we do not choose our duty , it imposes itself . Mine , with the help of those who share my opinions , is to save from the flood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher or more worthy of the man who , before there was even a menace of war , wrote : " I am not a soldier in the army of force , I am a soldier in the army of the spirit , " and " I will not be a party to hatred . I will be just to all my enemies . In the midst of passion I wish to preserve the clarity of my vision , to un  --  derstand and love everything " ? For Rol-land 's attitude to-day is the logical continua  --  tion of his former work , which , while re  --  maining French in the sense of the best tradi  --  tions of his great country , has always tended to harmonize the genius of France and that of Germany , " the two wings of the West , " and , indeed , not only these two countries which he knows best , but the free spirits of all countries , since he understands as few yet do the inter-relation and inter-depen  --  dence of the countries and the civilizations of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over spiritual values , his clear vision saw also the upheaval it had wrought in mor  --  al values , as evidenced by the curious fact that many of those who had been the mostviolent revolutionists before were now rang  --  ed with the most fanatical oppressors . This same lucidity of thought made him look beyond the present struggle , with its pas  --  sions and unfairness , to the day when a reconciliation must come ; made him under  --  stand , as a soldier sympathizer put it , that " much goodness and pardon would be nec  --  essary if a solid and durable peace were eventually to be made . " To quote again from a personal letter to Henri Guilbeaux , " the watchword of the future must be toler  --  ance , human fraternity , placed above doc  --  trines and differing faiths " " You , " he said , referring to his enemies , " are thinking of victory ; I am thinking of the peace which will follow it , " and he has hesitated at no sacrifice which will help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one who loves France well must necessarily love hu  --  manity well , and that the hatred encouraged by the press , appealing as it does to that which is lowest in us , will in the end do more lasting harm than the material losses of the war : " Hatred , which is more deadly than war , for it is an infection produced by its wounds , and it does as much harm to him it possesses as to him it pursues . " Rol  --  land believes that those most concerned , the soldiers in the trenches , do not feel any such hatred . They are too close to the great elemental realities of life and death , too close to these men they are killing , not to know that they are brothers , after all , men like themselves , fighting for the ideals of their countries . And he is right , for if a few of those who , safe in their studies , sacrifice the moral leadership that is theirs by right of superior opportunity or gifts , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men safe from harm themselves , the words of France 's real spiritual leader , Romain Rolland , are finding an echo in many hearts and are pinned on the walls of many a work  --  ingman 's cottage . I wish I could quote all the letters writ  --  ten in the trenches by men in every walk of life : simple soldiers , officers , writers , etc. , to express their approval and appreciation of the action of this man who has not failed them in their time of stress . Some of these letters are being published every month in the Revue Mensuelle , of Geneva , which is one of those journals that have taken up Rolland 's defence . Lines from a few may give an idea of their tenor . Corporal K. V. says : " In the light of the brutality of facts I-have judged my former masters . In them I sought consolation , support , encourage  --  ment , and I found they were incapable of understanding me . What admirations I have lost ! But that I felt for Romain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maurice Martinet , speaks of Rolland 's voice as " the conscience of the silent , many silent through cowardice , " while a captain of artillery writes : " There are soldiers at the front who , like Romain Rolland , try not to tarnish their patriotism with hatred and vengeance . " The following tribute is from J. B. R. , novelist , officer , and recipient of the Croix de Guerre : " We doctors , artists , writers , professors , have had to give up the use we made of our strength in times of peace , in order to strain every effort with a sort of fixed intoxication towards this unique end  --  the defeat of Ger  --  many . I salute as a brother in arms the man who has strained all his own strength towards this end  --  the defeat of the spirit of jealousy , misunderstanding , injury , recipro  --  cal scorn , and hatred among nations ; the de  --  feat of the spirit of material enterprise against the liberty of neighboring countries . For one of these victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , finally , these touching words from another soldier , who said : " Our man at the front is Romain Rolland . We have only scorn for those who , in the rear , preach hatred . We have made the sacrifice of our lives , but we do not want to die hating " ; and of this boy of twenty , who wrote to M. Rolland : " Since you are speaking to the two countries , sir , tell those poor Germans , who must moan as we do over so much suffering , that there are men in France who feel only commiseration for them , and that even while fighting them , we pity them for their misery , like unto our own . We can not survive so much sadness save by love . " In addition to these lines taken at random from letters from the front may I add the following from an article by a Dutch poet and philosopher , Frederick van Eeden ? " My defence can be summed up in two words . France has had great poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men of unswerving character , of free and proud spirit , the men of purely human qualities , which surpass in value to all hu  --  manity the artistic and literary gifts . Such a man was Victor Hugo . And , after him , I know of no one who so closely resembles him as Romain Rolland . " Europe is going through a phase of de  --  struction which has never been equalled . Ro  --  main Rolland 's work is opposed to this be  --  cause of its deeply constructive qualities . The war , to him , is a test of the real spirit of Europe as opposed to the passions of the several nations , and from it he hopes there will arise a new symphony of harmony and aspiration , in which there will be greater unity and cooperation , and a new patri  --  otism which will not presuppose hatred of other countries . No one who reads Rolland 's work can help feeling the profound love of humanity that inspires it . He loves France , and believes in the justice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an isolat  --  ed unit , but a part of the great whole we are only beginning to understand  --  the world , humanity . Rolland 's voice is human rather than exclusively French , yet for that very reason is irepresentative of the best in France , the France that has fought and dreamed for the progress of humanity . He does not deny that she is fighting now for the principles of that civilization , but he wants her , while fighting , to remain true to her highest ideals and her greatest tradi  --  tions . He has carried on his work patiently , tenaciously , upheld by the deep faith that was in him . As he explained to me : " I only said a few things , very calm , very moderate , which should have been thought and ex  --  pressed by thousands of others . " His cour  --  age and devotion to what he believes true have made him enemies , but have also made him friends all over the world " who consider the animosity that surrounds him to-day as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ac  --  counts are rendered and the aberrations of war-time have been forgotten , I venture to predict that Rolland 's name will be the one his countrymen will be proudest of . For as he said in " Jean-Christophe " : " Reason is the country of all men . Passion passes , rea  --  son remains . Reason and love " ; and that is the country he has sought to defend . Correspondence PRANCE AS TEACHER . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sac : Prof. Margaret Sherwood , of Welles  --  ley , recently made pertinent reference in your columns to the fact that Americans might find that they had much to learn in terms of truly cultural constructiveness from an in  --  tensive study of the French educational sys  --  tem . But it is more than a possibility that Abaerica has something to learn from Franc ' in this particular : It is an established fact and one , in a measure , that has been demon  --  strated in at least three books by American educators , setting forth in scholarly and il @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the University . Prof. Ernest F. Farrington , of Columbia University , has published two studies of the French schools : " French Secondary Schools " and " The Public Primary School System of France ! ' These two volumes , with their wealth of practical illustrations built upon an underlying foundation of a brilliant exposi  --  tion of the fundamental factors underlying French educational theory , have been , until recently , the only two fountain-heads of in  --  spiration and knowledge for the curious American student in this field . But there has recently been an addition . The Harvard Press is now publishing in its second edition within a year  --  in itself an indication to Pro  --  fessor Sherwood that there are those who share her curiosity -- iProf . R. W. Brown 's " How the French Boy Learns to Write : A Study of the Teaching of the Mother Tongue . " Quite independently of Professor Farrington 's method and material , this sound and brilliant exposition , thoroughly bolstered with first  --  hand knowledge , sets before the American teacher that intricate yet widely coordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine birthright , a feeling for style and an instinct for accurate and vivid expression . Especially can no teacher of English compo  --  sition , whether of university or lower grade , fail to ignore this study The infinite analy  --  sis of programmes , the careful grouping and exposition of the reprinted student 's themes , the characterization of the French Lycee mas  --  ter  --  a characterization that probes into ques  --  tions of personality and professional training in order to discover the secret of teaching effi  --  ciency  --  all these points and many more are massed and ordered be-fore our eyes that we may look guiltily to ourselves and our own lop-sided system of glittering generalities . But there is much yet to be studied in French education . There is yet to be written in English an exposition of that system whereby the French master teaches a boy not only to read in a given foreign language , but to think and to speak . ( It is to France that one must look for the best exemplifica  --  tion and application of that too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruc  --  tion . ) There also remains to be written a study of the spirit of the French university  --  of the University of Paris  --  that indefinable and potent spirit , never expressible and never obtainable in terms of marble halls , endowed libraries , shower baths , stadiums , and win  --  ning athletic teams . It would be interesting to understand a little of those processes whereby the French university finds itself a thing of vital impulse to the nation at large . No one who has ever come into even the most superficial contact with French educa  --  tion or its results can fail to wonder why so long America has been blind to what it might obtain from its great sister republic . Slowly but surely there is being forced abroad even into the inner circles of the universities the fact that " Kultur " and culture are not always synonymous Despite the undeniable prodi  --  gality of Germany 's gift to modern educa  --  tional progress there remains a something lacking in this gift , a something compounded of humanism , a something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and knowledge , but keeps them one and the same inseparable . And for some , this something finds its best exemplification in French char  --  acter and that system of education that goes to foster it . C. J. MASSECK . Washington University , St. Louis , Mo. , October 20 . SHAKESPEARE IN PURITAN DISGUISE . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sue : The present renewed interest in everything touching the name of Shakespeare may justify the reprinting of a curious docu  --  ment given in full in " Seilhamer 's History of the American Stage " ( I , 123 ) . Seilhamer states that it is " a play-bill which John Ber  --  nard copied many years afterward from one that had been preserved by Mr. Morris . " The bill reads : " King 's Arms Tavern , Newport , Rhode Island . " On Monday , June 10 , at the Public Room of the Above Inn will be delivered a series of " MORAL DIALOGUES " IN FIVE PARTS " Depicting the Evil Effects of Jealousy and Other Bad Passions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virtue . " Ms. DOUGLAS will represent a noble and magnanimous Moor named Othello , who loves a young lady named Desdemona , and after he has married her , harbors ( as in too many cases ) the dreadful passion of jealousy . " Of jealousy our being 's bane Mark the small cause , and the most dreadful pain . " MR . ALLYN will depict the character of a specious villain , in the regiment of Othello , who is so base as to hate his commander on mere suspicion , and to impose on his best friend . Of such characters , it is to be feared , there are thousands in the world , and the one in question may present to us a salutary warning . " The man that wrongs his master and his friend , What can he come to but a shameful end ? " MR . HALLAM will delineate a young and thoughtless officer , who is traduced by Mr. Allyn , and getting drunk loses his situation , and his general 's esteem . All young men , whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drinking would you see ? Re warned and keep from evil company . " MR . MORRIS will represent an old gentle  --  man , the father of Desdemona , who is not cruel or covetous , but is foolish enough to dislike the noble Moor , his son-in-law , be  --  cause his face is not white , forgetting that we all spring from one root . Such prejudices are very numerous and very wrong . " Fathers beware what sense and love ye lack , ' T is crime , not color , makes the being black . " MR . QUELCH will depict a fool , who wishes to become a knave , and trusting one gets killed by him . Such is the friendship of rogues  --  take heed . " When fools would knaves become , how often you 'll Perceive the knave not wiser than the fool . " MRS . MORRIS will represent a young and virtuous wife , who being wrongfully suspect  --  ed gets smothered ( in an adjoining room ) by her husband . " Reader attend ; and ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss . DOUGLAS Will be her faithful attend  --  ant , who will hold out a good example to all servants , male and female , and to all persons in subjection . " Obedience and gratitude Are things as rare es they are good . " Various other dialogues , too numerous to mention here , will be delivered at night , all adapted to the improvement of the mind and manners . The whole will be repeated on Wednesday and Saturday . Tickets , six shil  --  hugs each , to be had within . Commencement at 7 , conclusion at half-past 10 , in order that every spectator may go home at a sober hour and reflect upon what he has seen be  --  fore he retires to rest . " God save the king , And long may he sway , East , North , and South , And fair America . " Concerning this performance Seilhamer , I believe , falls into two errors . First , while acknowledging that the " moral dialogues " - must have been Shakespeare 's " Othello " dis  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for this disguise was the legal prohibition of such entertainments , but sug  --  gests that the term " moral dialogues " was employed merely because the play was given in a ' tavern rather than in a theatre . That is to say , Seilhamer misses the delicious humor of the whole piece , particularly of the closing sentence . Then , in view of the enactment of stringent legislation against the giving of plays by the Rhode Island Assembly in Au  --  gust , 1762 , he dates this performance as June 10 , 1761 , or 1762 . But there can be no serious question as to the year . Only once between 1754 and 1771 did June 10 fall on Monday . That was in 1765 , the summer of the passage of the Stamp act , a measure which , as Seilhamer states elsewhere , aroused much prejudice against Douglass 's company of London actors . Now the Douglasses , the Morrises , Allyn , Hallam , and Quelch are all named in con  --  temporary newspapers among the actors playing in Charleston during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1766 .
