txt WIDER SKIRTS FOR WOMEN . Present Style Is a Menace to Health and Safety . As a member of the Rainy-day Club of America and a member of the Public Safety Committee of the New York City Federation of Women 's Clubs . it behooves me to ask the women of our city to adopt a skirt of somewhat wider circumference at the foot , to allow walking with greater ease and comfort . The width of the present day skirt is a serious menace to the health and safety of the women of to-day . The women walk today as did the Japanese women with their tied feet . While the Japanese women have gained their freedom.in walking , our women allow them-selves to be governed by a slily fad of fashion , and can-only. " hobble " along . In crossing streets , , noenting , trolley cars , in ascending and descending the stairs of the Subway stations women are in mortal fear of falling . Is it not high time that another width be added to the women 's skirt of today ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
