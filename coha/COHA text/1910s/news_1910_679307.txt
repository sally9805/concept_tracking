txt Are savings banks banks , and Nif so , is a reserve of 2% per cent . or less for thirty-eight banks , or of about 7 per cent . on an average , an adequate provision for emergencies ? Or are the savings banks investment institutions , and in that case are they not conveniences for the comparatively wealthy and deserving of different manage-ment and esteem from that a.ccorded I them as savings banks ? Or do the savings banks still retain the semi-charitable character originally impressed upon them when their main function was the encouragement of frugality by the safekeeping of funds which it was designed to accumulate , rather than to profit by the lincome upon them ? These questions are worthy attentive consideration , for upon the correct answers depends the manner in which the banks ought to determine the rates of their " dividends , " as the interest distribution is called by many . It Is evasion of the issue to say that the banks have something of each character . So they may have from the point of view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same motives should animate so many individuals . But there ought to be something more like unanimity in the views of their managements , the so-called " Trustees . " They hitherto have been supposed to be giving their services to the worthy poor , but not a few of them now are showing a spirit as keenly competitive as any other moneymakers . They say that otherwise their depositors will leave them for others willing to make distributions deprecated by the State Banking Department . And why should we not divide our earnings , they say , and maintain our rate of dividend ? If a bank can not earn 4 per cent , why , then , let it divide what it can earn , but do not let the weak banks expect the strong banks to moderate the competition in the interest of sound banking . Obviously those who argue thus have lost sight of the educational functions of savings banks as a primary purpose , and subordinate it to the attractions of the income-earning function . In too many cases they do not show perception that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the average surplus has shrunk from 17 per cent . to 7 per cent. , it is apparent that a weakening process is going on . And when it is considered that in recent years the surplus has varied with the market values in some cases more than the margin of surplus . It is beyond argument that the " apprehension minimum " is ibeing approached if not already passed . The banks doubtless have assets in excess of ; their liabilities , and are solvent , beyond peradventure . Doubtless they ought not to be held to the same degree of liquidity of assets as is essential in the case of commercial banks . when the payment of dividends is maintained at the expense of the surplus it is plain that the savings banks are losing something of their character as institutions for the frugal poor and are being availed of by another class of persons . The harm of this is that the comparatively well to do are having their investments made for them at the expense of the poor , whose Surplus is shrinking while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the market . The wealthy depositors ' deposits have not shrunk with the surplus , and they are not entitled to this protection at the expense of their humble associates . Aa a general rule , nobody , rich or poor , ought to have enough money in savings banks for the income to be an object . Whenever the principal reaches such a sum it ought to be invested for the risk of the individual . Such is the foreign custom . At this time there is consternation among the depositors in the British postal savings banks because consols are at their minimum , and as deposits have reached $1,000 they have been invested in consols automatically . It would be well that something like this should be done here in the Interest of both the banks and the depositors . The banks ought to be relieved of the risk and tenxiety springing from their shrink:113gsurplus . The depositors might well be brought to realize something of the nature of the service performed for them , instead of looking to the banks for the last dollar of distribution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their behalf by those who can make no profit thereby for themselves . It would not follow that the strong banks could never increase their dividends . In time tieir surpluses would increase so that a division would be necessary . Extra dividends then could be declared , without establishing an unsafe rule of distribution . If this reduction of a rather high rate should cause depositors to take advantage of the present low range of excellent investments , the benefits would be many . The withdrawal of the deposits would leave the surplus to be applied to a smaller volume of deposits , and the proportion of surplus would be increased . The banks can not make such investments , because they have not the funds , but the depositors can do what the banks can not do . The effect upon the investment market would be stimulating , and the depositors turned investors could find bonds within the savings bank class paying more than the 4 per cent . they are receiving from institutions which can hardly spare the income needed for the upbuilding of the reserve   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
