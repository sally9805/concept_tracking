THE inhabitants of this country in 1776 numbered about onehalf of the present population of the city of New York , but there were probably as many native born sailors following the deep sea for a living as there are today . There was a reason 1 for this : All of the large towns were on the seacoast . Highways and roads were few and in bad condition . It was by sea that the colonies kept in touch with one another ; it was by the waterways that they carried on their commerce . While the colonists were still dependents of Great Britain they had begun to work out a commercial independence . From the New England shipyards had come fleets of merchant vessels , and they sailed to every port in the world . In the olden days ? in fact up to sixty or seventy years ago ? it took little or no training to turn a merchant sailor into a man-of-war's-man . There was no complicated machinery to learn and master ; the ropes and orders were the same ; and the guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all armed in those days ? were the same as those on a vessel in government service , only smaller . It was this adaptability of the American merchant sailor that did much to save the country in its two wars with England . Of course , at the outset of the Revolution , in 1775 and 1776 , the thirteen colonies had no navy at all , and the necessity for possessing armed ships was one of the first things to be discussed when the Congress of the United Colonies first met in 1775 . A naval committee  | consisting of John Langdon of New Hampshire , Silas Deane of Connecticut , Christopher Gadsden of North Carolina , John Adams of Massachusetts , Joseph Hewes of North Carolina , and Richard Henry Lee of Virginia was appointed . This committee decided to start building immediately thirteen vessels . They were to be of three classes ; five ships of thirty-two guns , five of twenty-eight , and three of twenty-four . It was on December 13 , 1775 , that this decision was made , and the faith placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builders was demonstrated when it was declared that all these vessels should be fitted for sea by the end of the coming March . The whole cost of this naval establishment was not to exceed the sum of $867,000.00 , or less than one-sixteenth of the cost of a modern battleship ! Previous to this there had been a number of vessels purchased and turned , for the time being , into men-of-war ; their names were the Providence , the Alfred , the Cabot , and the Andrea Doria ? all taken from peaceful callings to turn to the trade of fighting . The Privateers It seemed a hopeless task that the American colonies had undertaken . Without a single regular vessel of war they were going to oppose the magnificent navy of Great Britain , that at this time consisted of not less than three hundred and fifty-six vessels , a hundred and forty of them being ships-of-the-line ; that is , great floating forts mounting seventy-four guns and more . But a way was found to even matters , in a measure . Although Great Britain from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea from almost every harbor numbers of " privateers " ? vessels that were sent out under private ownership , but with papers furnished them by Congress authorizing them to prey upon the commerce of the enemy . Well did they account for themselves ! These American cruisers captured during the years 1776 and 1777  | upwards of eight hundred vessels . Of the English ships employed in the West India trade two hundred and fifty were taken that were valued , with their cargoes , at ten millions of dollars . The Yankee cruisers penetrated into the English Channel and made captures almost at the entrances of the English harbors . To read of their adventures is stirring to the blood . And fro ' i the ranks of these ex-merchant commanders came many well-known names that soon appeared on the lists of the first regular navy of the United States . Let us look at a few of these early captains , whose doings have become traditions of the naval service . Esek Hopkins was the first commander-in-chief , being appointed in December , 1775 ; then follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nicholas Biddle , John Barry , Edward Preble , Abraham Whipple , and John Paul Jones . It was on March 23 , 1776 , that Congress issued " general letters of marque and reprisal , " which were certificates , really , to any privately owned ship to set sail and to prey on the commerce of Great Britain , and henceforth all British vessels , armed or unarmed , were liable to capture wherever found . In the records of the American Revolution there appear the names of no less than one thousand six hundred and ninetyseven privately armed vessels , and the number of men employed in them was no less than 58,400 . Many had set sail and brought in prizes before the Declaration of Independence of July 4 , 1776 . Four months after this declaration Congress authorized the construction of the first American line-of-battle-ship , of 74 guns the America . However , she took no part in the war , not being finished in time , and she was finally , in 1782 , presented to Louis NVI , King of France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid lent by that monarch and his country , and to replace a French 74 , the Magnifique , that was lost in Boston harbor . On March 7 , 1778 , Captain Nicholas Biddle of the United States frigate Randolph , mounting but thirty-two guns , was overhauled by a British 64-gun ship , the Yarmouth . Bravely Biddle hoisted his colors as the larger vessel came down on him with a following wind and ranged alongside . So rapid and accurate was the Randolph 's fire that for fifteen minutes it was give and take , with the Yarmouth getting the worst of it , when suddenly , for some reason that has never been ascertained , the smaller vessel blew up ; only four of her crew were saved . Brave Biddle had been wounded early in the action and was sitting in a chair on the quarter-deck when the catastrophe occurred . He was but twenty-seven years of age .  | The sloop-of-war Ranger , fitted out in Portsmouth , Massachusetts , had already made a name for herself in making captures when , under the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France in 1777 . On the 14th of February , 1778 , in Quiberon Bay , the Stars and Stripes were saluted for the first time by a foreign fleet when the French fired a salute of nine guns , and of this occurrence Paul Jones wrote , himself , " It was , in fact , an acknowledgment of American independence . " On the 6th of February there was signed a treaty of commerce and alliance between the representatives of the United States and France , and it was this treaty and the aid the French subsequently gave that actually preserved the independence of America . In April , 1778 , John Paul Jones , in this same little Ranger , cruised off the shores of England , Scotland , and Ireland , and actually landed and spiked the guns of the English forts at Whitehaven , set fire to some vessels , and subsequently , in the Irish Sea , off the town of Carrickfergus , he engaged and captured a British armed ship , the Drake , and brought her safely into the harbor of Brest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the glorious action of the 23rd of September , 1779 , in the Bon Homme Richard , Paul Jones added immortal glory to the annals of the American navy , when off Flamborough Head he captured the British frigate Serapis . His story has been told in The Mentor . Captain John Barry , in the frigate Alliance , in 1781 , on two occasions within a month , fought and captured two British vessels at a time , the first two being the frigate Mars and the sloop Minerva , on April znd , and just thirty days later he took the British sloops-of-war Atalanta and Trepassy . These separate , dramatic , and romantic actions would , however , have had little result if it had not been for the French fleets and the French aid in money and supplies for both army and navy that the United States received . It was in June , 1778 , that the fleet of Count D'Estaing arrived in American waters , and he was followed later by the squadrons of Count de Rochambeau , Count de Grasse and Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victory at Yorktown on October 19 , 1781 . Long before this the little navy that Congress had authorized had slowly dwindled by capture ordestruction ; many vessels were actually blockaded in American ports , and it was with increasing difficulty that the privateers escaped the British fleets and put out to sea . France saved the situation . Peace was formally concluded with Great Britain on September 3 , 1783 , although hostilities had ceased nearly five months before .  | Trouble with France and Tripoli For five years the naval service was dormant . Then the United States came very close to having a war with France , for after the French had chopped off King Louis 's head they seemed to get into trouble with the rest of Europe , and apparently the people did not mind having an enemy in their old friend and ally . Owing to the embargo laid on American commerce we came to blows without declaring war , and the United States frigate Constellation on two occasions fought with French ships . Commanded by Captain Thomas Truxton , she captured the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year later she defeated a much larger vessel , La Vengeance . But no war had ever been declared , and so no peace was concluded . From 18o1 to 18o5 the resurrected navy of the United States was engaged in the Mediterranean in a war against Tripoli , whose piratical ships had been preying on American commerce . Commodore William Bainbridge unfortunately grounded his ship , the Philadelphia , on an uncharted rock off the harbor of Tripoli , and , with his officers and crew , was taken a prisoner by the Tripolitans , in August , 1803 , and kept in confinement until peace was declared in 1805 . There were no naval actions of any moment in this war except that of the Philadelphia with the swarm of piratical small craft , and the fleet of the United States was employed mostly in a useless battering of the corsair harbors and ports . But there was one deed of conspicuous gallantry performed by Stephen Decatur and a volunteer crew , who , in the Intrepid , entered the harbor of Tripoli and succeeded in setting fire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked off the rock and anchored under the guns of their fort . This was in February , 1804 , and in September of this year the same little vessel , the Intrepid , on another daring expedition , was blown up with all on board . The conclusion of the war was not a very glorious one ; the American government practically bought peace and ransomed the American prisoners in the pirates ' hands . War of 1812 We come to the period of the second war with Great Britain . For years England had been pushed to it to keep her great fleets manned . In her own home ports she had resorted to the " press gang , " that took by force any citizen , compelling him to serve on the war vessels ? a service  | that was to all purposes practical slavery . British ship : also carried on the " right of search , " and stoppec vessels of friendly nations on the high seas and it friendly ports , and took from them many seamen under pretense that they were suspected of bein4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by birth had been thus kidnapped , and at last so flagrant became these offenses that there was nothing for it but immediate war . Under the policy ci Jefferson , who did not believe in sea power , the navy had again dwindled . There were only a few fast sailing frigates , which were in a class of their own sc far as construction , size , and fighting qualities were concerned , one or two sloops-of-war , and two or three brigs and schooners . The most famous ship in all American history was the frigate Constitution ? " Old Ironsides , " as she was called . The whole United States navy a few months before the outbreak of hostilities between the United States and Great Britain made a list one could take in at a glance , but the names of the ships soon became household words . There was not one that did not make a record to be proud of : The President , 44 guns ; the Constitution and the United States , also of 44 guns ; the Essex , 32 guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 ; the Hornet , 18 ; the Argus , 16 ; and the smaller vessels , brigs , or schooners , Siren , Nautilus , Enterprise and Vixen . The frigate Constitution , under the command of Captain Isaac Hull , met the British frigate Guerriere , ( ger-yare ' ) and after a sharp action the English ship was completely dismasted and burned at sea . That was on August 19 , 1812 . The value of this victory was soon manifest , for there had been a strong movement made in government circles to lay all the ships in safe harbors , many people in high authority concluding that it would be madness to try to keep them cruising on the high seas in view of the numbers and force of the enemy . On the 25th day of October , 1812 , a second action took place on the high seas , when the United States ship United States , under command of Stephen Decatur , captured and brought into port the British frigate Macedonian , and on the 29th of December the Constitution , under command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | At the beginning of the nineteenth century the civilized world was convulsed in war . Napoleon was at the zenith of his power ; England was fighting the Peninsula campaign in Spain against the French ; Russia was being invaded ; all of South America was in revolution . Again , as was the case in the Revolutionary War , the foe 's attention was diverted elsewhere , and she could not use her full strength against the United States . America had to depend again upon the volunteers . The trained men of the navy and the well built ships responded nobly . On land , with the exception of two battles , the Americans were badly defeated , in most cases by much inferior forces . The greatest danger that threatened was an invasion from Canada , and there , also , lay the great opportunity for America . Both sides attempted to cross the line and gain territory , and neither succeeded . The Americans failed owing to the failure of the army and the inadequacy of the volunteer system , and the British failed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lakes ? Perry commanding the American fleet on Lake Erie , and McDonough on Lake Champlain . Of the men of the regular navy a British admiral wrote in a letter : " These Yankee sailors are the only ones who can stand a British boarding party . " Up to the war of 1812 the British navy had lost , in a period of some three hundred years , in single combat , but one ship where the vessels were evenly matched . They had considered themselves invincible , but during the second war with America , out of thirty-one single combats they lost twenty-nine ! This disparity of loss was due , in great measure , to the superior qualities of the American ships . The American frigates were built of heavier timber , and carried for the most part heavier broadsides ; their crews were more numerous , and were made up of men who fought voluntarily and were animated not only by a love of country , but by a feeling of revenge . The list of heroine ships and hero captains grew as the war dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuated in the names of present-day torpedo-boats and destroyers ? the Bainbridge , the Biddle , the Decatur , the Perry , the Lawrence , the Porter , and all the rest . The War of 1812 found America at the high tide of commercial prosperity , and beginning to compete with England for the carrying supremacy of the world . The number of vessels flying the American flag that appeared in foreign ports in the year previous to hostilities in 1812 , was greater than in 1912 ? a hundred years later . From their peaceful pursuits  | as cargo carriers they turned to the more exciting but more profitable trade of privateering . The havoc wrought by the American privateers against the commerce of Great Britain during the War of 181z waE almost beyond belief . Let us look at the figures , and compare them also with the record of the regular navy for the same period . In the latter service there were but twenty-three vessels , which carried an aggregate of five hundred and fifty-six guns . This little force captured or destroyed two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very large proportion of merchant vessels . From the outbreak of the war until its conclusion , there were five hundred and seventeen privateers , which carried the art of destruction into every sea , and they took or destroyed one thousand three hundred and sixty prizes , valued at nearly $46,000,000.00 . The land forces of the United States during the whole war captured but five thousand eight hundred prisoners , while those taken by the privateers were over thirty thousand ! What the English thought of it is plainly shown by the report of a public meeting held in Glasgow in September , 1814 . This was the unanimous report : " That the number of ( American ) privateers with which our channels have been infested , the audacity with which they have approached our coasts , and the success with which their enterprise has been attended , have proved injurious to our commerce , humbling to our pride , and discreditable to the directors of the naval power of the British nation , whose flag , till of late , waved over every sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the plentitude of our power we have declared the whole American coast under blockade , it is equally distressing and mortifying that our ships can not with safety traverse our own channels , that insurance can not be effected but at an excessive premium , and that  | a horde of American cruisers should be allowed , unheeded , unresisted , and unmolested , to take , burn or sink our own vessels in our own inlets , and almost in sight of our harbors . " Peace had been concluded at Ghent , Belgium , on December 24 , 1814 , but the news took time to reach the fields of action . Although James Madison , President of the United States , signed and ratified the peace treaty on the 17th of February , the privateers and the vessels of the regular navy continued fighting in various parts of the world up to the first of July . In the fall of 1815 an American fleet under Commodore Decatur appeared off the harbor of Tripoli , whose cruisers had been again molesting our commerce , and forced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then on the American establishment languished , while the merchant fleets increased . The outbreak of the war with Mexico in 1846 again made use for regular armed vessels , but they were mostly employed convoying transports , and bombarding a few coast towns . Mexico was not a maritime nation , and there was little opportunity for them to do more than assist the army . The Navy in the Civil War The Civil War once more found the naval establishment reduced and disorganized . But soon the shipyards were busy , and the naval forces , which were augmented by fleets of hastily armed steamers of all sorts , entered upon the great blockade that was destined to sap the very lifeblood of the Confederacy . The South had no navy except those hastily constructed harbor and river defense vessels with which they ineffectually , but most bravely , fought against superior odds . The Civil War ushered in a new naval era ? that of the armored vessel . The memorable action between the first two ironclads , the ram Virginia , better known as the Merrimac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the attention of the world . The main principle of the latter craft ? the turret ? has not been improved upon , and is in use today in every navy . The New Ironsides , a combination sail and steam frigate of 3,250 tons , built in 1861 , was the first ocean-going ironclad . On the high seas there was but one important action ? that between the Kearsarge and the Alabama , off the harbor of Cherbourg , France , June 19 , 1864 . Although the Alabama 's officers held commissions from the Confederate government , her crew of 149 men were almost all Europeans ; she was  | really the very last of the privateers . Captain Raphael Semmes , the Alabama 's commander , tempted fate when he ventured into the fight , for the Kearsarge , under the command of Captain John A. Winslow , was in many ways a superior ship and had a larger crew , all Americans . The Alabama had been equipped in England , and this was made the basis for claims against that country , and Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum of $15,000,000 . The end of the Civil War found the United States the greatest naval and military power in the world . Without effort the President and Congress could have called into active service more trained , experienced men than the coalition of any two great powers of Europe could have brought together . Not long , however , did this state of affairs continue to exist . Within ten years England and France had begun to outstrip this country in building ships . There was an excess of officers in the American service at this period , but there was no well directed attempt at naval construction . American born sailors practically had disappeared ; seventy-two per cent . of the enlisted men in the service were foreigners , who were attracted merely by the pay they received . Admiral David D. Porter recorded that , when the United States steamship Trenton went into commission in the spring of 1876 , only eighty of her crew could speak English ! The Modern Navy In 1884 the United States had reached its lowest ebb as a maritime nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it had a hundred years previously , but those in commission were obsolete , not one vessel of the first class being afloat . About this time Secretary of the Navy William H. Hunt began a great work of reconstruction ; through his efforts RearAdmiral John Rodgers was appointed the head of a board of naval officers to determine the requirements of a new navy . It was reported by the board that the United States should have twenty-one battleships , seventy unarmored cruisers , twenty torpedo boats , five torpedo gunboats and five rains . As to the first class , they , perforce , had to exist on paper there was not a shipyard in the country that could build one ! To construct the half dozen small cruisers it was necessary to purchase armor-plate abroad ,  | and the " White Squadron , " as it was called ? the beginning of our modern navy ? was constructed in a measure by foreign workmen , with foreign tools , out of foreign material ! Moreover , the vessels were built , not by the government , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? one of the largest of the little fleet ? launched in San Francisco in 1888 , were drawn by foreign naval architects . Conditions had improved somewhat in regard to the personnel during this period , but as late as 1897 twenty-five per cent . of the enlisted men were foreign born . Today it is completely changed ? the service has all American crews , the foreign-born element being less than two per cent. , and they must be naturalized citizens . As the United States began to build larger ships and as the shipyards and their capacity increased , government construction , under proper direction , was successfully undertaken . In the Spanish War , which began immediately after the blowing up of the Maine in Havana harbor on February 15 , 1898 , the United States Navy acquitted itself brilliantly . During the course of hostilities two Spanish fleets were absolutely annihilated ? one in the Philippines at Manila , and the other off Santiago , composed of those ill fated vessels under brave old Admiral Cervera . In the first action no American life was lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting of the Spanish War the American navy did not lose as many men as the frigate Constitution had lost in any twenty minutes of her three principal single combats ! In fact , as a naval war , the American conflict with Spain was what might be termed a " walk-over . " The war furnished heroes ? especially Dewey and Sampson . One of the battleships , the Oregon , made a record that was considered marvelous , for she kept at racing speed without any serious break to any part of the machinery over a course of 14,700 miles , stopping only to take coal . In sixty-five days after leaving San Francisco , on the 19th of March , she was receiving orders from Washington off the coast of Florida . Even after this long run the Oregon alone , according to a naval authority , would have been a match for the entire Spanish squadron in Santiago . The one blow that the service really received was the loss of one hundred and sixty-seven men who gave up their lives in the Maine . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in comparison with the navies of other first-class powers . Now the Navy , by order of Congress , is being increased to a degree that will place it again in the first rank .  |
