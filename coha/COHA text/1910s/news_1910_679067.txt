txt The question formally before Mayor GAYNOR 'S Committee of One Hundred representative citizens is : Shall New York have a World 's Fair in 1913 to celebrate the three hundredth anniversary of its founding by the Dutch ? Most of the committee condemn the plan of a fair . They feel that the city 's commercial , social , scientific , and aesthetic interests are opposed to such an exhibition . They feel that this capital of the Western Hemisphere is itself a World 's Fair on a scale which they could not hope to rival . But they have not disposed of the real question which underlies this formal proposal . The real question is : Shall New York hold an appropriate celebration of its founding ? A World 's Fair will not do . What will do ? A Washington dispatch to THE TIMES of July 2 conveys a suggestion . In Holland , whose emigrants settled Manhattan , the plan of federating the world has taken concrete form in the tribunal at The Hague . The United States has asked that this tribunal be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Powers at The Hague in 1915 shall deal finally with the questi  --  n of limiting their armaments . Theweakness of the Second Peace Conference in 1907 lay in the fact that it was not an authoritative body . Its delegates were not empowered to pledge their Governments in this gravest of all matters concerning peace . But their meeting was significant of greater things . Mr. JAMES Buowll SCOTT , the delegate of the United States , says : The mere fact that the representatives of all the civilized nations of the world could meet at one and the - same time within the four walls of one and the same room , and for the period of four months exchange views , reconcile differences , discuss questions of grave - international concern , and recommend to their respective Governments conventions of great and fundamental importance , would alone justify the call and point to the dawning of a new and brighter day . Here is New York 's opportunity . In 1913 an international committee is to prepare the programme for the next Hague Conference of 1915 . The formulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conference shall have plenary powers . To give them such powers the nations must first meet in legislative session . If the interests of American commerce , science , art , and civilization , of which this city is the embodiment , would be served by its passads ; Congress would assent at its next session to the terms of the Robinson bill , transmitted by our Washington correspondent , inviting the Parliaments of the world to convene in this country and to draw up and adopt articles of confederation . A more perfect union might then reasonably be expected of the Third Conference at The Hague . Let the sub-committee appointed by Mayor GAYNOR 'S CoMmittee of One Hundred consider this matter . Let them confer with THEODORE ROOSEVELT , who arranged the details of the peace between Russia and Japan , who is New York 's first citizen , and a descendant of the Dutch of Holland . Let them ask him and themselves the question : Would such a Congress of the World dignify this city and worthily commemorate its founding       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
