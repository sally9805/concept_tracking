 | " PRECARIOUS guessing , President Mezes , of New York 's City College , calls any effort to forecast the immediate future of our universities and colleges . Nevertheless , I venture to transmit the impression of a summer 's correspondence with a hundred university and college presidents , all of whom seem somewhat anxious , many speculating , and some estimating with meticulous care . Few seem altogether certain . President Benton makes out a good case for a 90 per cent . attendance at the University of Vermont . Up from the South comes the convincing estimate of Dean Petrie that the Alabama Polytechnic Institute is to fare almost or quite as well . Union College will be content with a two-thirds enrolment , and far out west the University of California reports already a 10 per cent . increase in registration of new students with an accompanying certainty of losing 50 per cent . from the two upper classes and 20 per cent . from the Sophomores . Harvard , Yale , Princeton , Cornell , Dartmouth , and their kind early got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . None are entirely sure what the future has in store . But ? to quote President Luther , of Trinity College , Hartford ? they are proud of their anxieties . Harvard may well bear herself with a new dignity since Victor Chapman died carrying oranges to a hurt comrade . Viiginia needs no prompting to proclaim that when young McConnell last March flew to his death " he bound about her brow some of his own glory . " President Hadley is not dismayed at the outlook of a two-thirds attendance for Yale . The biggest building operation in Yale 's history will go on . Princeton is too keen for patriotic service to lisp at all in numbers . The price due for unusual excellence in military training has already  | been paid in part by Cornell , and the Alumni News can bear to speak without apology of a possible loss of one thousand paying students . Dartmouth means both to do her full duty in the present and to maintain her organization so steadfastly , no matter what it costs , that no momentum will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that incidentally ? as President Hopkins writes ? there may this year be a shrinkage of 50 per cent . in the size of the three upper classes ! President Slocum ( Colorado ) speaks like a seer for all such patriotic institutions in a stirring letter written to announce that it would be better ? as it would ? for many colleges to close than that they should not respond to duty 's call without question or delay . On the educational map geographical and sectional boundaries have all disappeared . If some institutions nearer the sailing ports were quicker than some others to let their students go , without loss of academic credit , to the fighting front , none were overlate in starting . Illinois is not afraid of any shock the autumn brings . President Nollen , of Lake Forest , figures on a two-thirds attendance in the Middle West . President Bell , of Drake University , is inclined to drop as low as a one-half registration . President Vincent ( until recently of Minnesota ) speaks ? admittedly at a venture ? of Northwestern budgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Southwest , President Wilbur confesses that at Leland Stanford they are in the dark as to the upper classes , but expect at least a 90 per cent . registration in the two lower classes . Two executives ? McCracken , of Lafayette , and Ferry , of Hamilton ? seem to have taken some kind of a national reckoning ? and their estimate of shrinkage ranges from 20 to 40 per cent. , with Dr. McCracken inclined to split the difference . As to professional schools , agreement is general that they will suffer little . What they have to give is in immediate demand and even their apprentices can be sure of almost a living wage . This " card-catalogue war " has put a higher premium on technical training ; and the Council of National Defense regards it as a- more patriotic duty to register in a technical school than to enlist in army or in navy . No institution of technology is flying any signal of distress ? and one in Georgia expects more students than ever . The Drexel Institute at Philadelphia is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual to go to college . The " co-eds " east and west will soon be back . Wellesley , Smith , Bryn Mawr , and Mount Holyoke have as hitherto their large and comfortable waiting list , and the entering class at Smith is to be record-breaking . Some of the prosperous junior colleges in the Central West ? like William Woods ? are actually this very month increasing their dormitory accommodations to house the largest number yet of women students . President Serena writes that any girl out there can go to college because every parent appears prosperous . The sky , however , is not without a cloud or two . Any new development in the war zone may oblige us all to take up our belts a hole or two . The sinking of a liner or another break-up on the Russian front may change the plans of many a family , forced to revise the family budget , and keep the daughter home from college even though she has " signed up " and packed her trunk . Too many exemptions from the draft or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may hold back the girl from college for family affection 's sake . " Bumper " crops and " the plenty of money " said to be circulating on the western coast may find their offset in the higher cost of living . Into commerce , industry , agriculture , transportation , girls here as in Europe may be drawn whose only thought now is the good times they will have in college . For initiative , organization , administration , leadership , college women ? actual or potential ? will be sought , if women are required at all . Mount Holyoke and Rockford expect a full attendance , yet their presidents are evidently not unmindful of such possibilities . State institutions and others least dependent on tuition fees are comparatively free from worry . Yet they must know that they are particularly representative and most quickly responsive to the pull of public feeling . They give military trainingl too , and the Government will naturally turn to them , if need arises , for its minor officers . With the tempting bait of abnormal wages due to scarcity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some who need to keep at their books may be drawn off . The three forces likely to affect attendance , in the composite judgment of the Dean of Syracuse and other educational experts , may play alike on all our institutions : conscription , volunteering for various forms of service , and subtle economic pressure as yet unfelt which  | may bear on those who have to count their pennies and also on the well-to-do whose incomes even pledged to college benefactions may be in part diverted to war needs or for the time withheld . For whatever comes we must be ready ; even the projection of the war to our own shores . We must think ahead in terms of any possibility as President Wheeler , of California , dares to do in a letter from which I quote the portentous sentence : " By another year I expect that the attendance of men in the two upper classes will have been reduced practically to zero . " This is a world war . Anything may happen . What are our universities and colleges doing in the premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are meeting the needs of the hour and making ready for that reconstruction hour we all await with eagerness . To meet these two supreme conditions they all at last are sure the teaching staff must be as far as possible maintained . This stand Dartmouth promptly took last spring , though she knew her deficit was to be colossal . Not all colleges could act so reassuringly at once . Some had to let instructors go . In various institutions , large and small , no three months or Easter notice could be given . In fact , one of the biggest universities in the land was as late as June withholding word as to the financial year beginning July 1 . Provision was elsewhere made to terminate any teaching contract at thirty days ' notice . With the loss of tuition fees and of dormitory charges looming large , with a rise already near of 25 per cent . in the cost of manual labor and of 50 per cent . in fuel , with surplus incomes going to the Government which might else come perhaps to subscriptions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But almost everywhere the task was so performed as to keep the teaching unit practically solid . The universities and colleges did not lose their heads . ( 2 ) The President and the Secretary of War want this year to see more students than last year in college . Smaller classes mean better instruction and better trained men . President Pendleton , of Wellesley , writes : " The generation which is now represented by our college students will have to deal with the conflicting and difficult problems involved in reconstruction when peace comes . They must therefore stay in college these days . " The upper classes can not be so large in men 's institutions . Presidents Rhees and Comfort stress this point . But every loss can be offset this very month . The duty rests on everyone who loves his college or his alma mater to work these weeks at any sacrifice of time or money to ensure a freshman class at least twice as large as ever in the . past . If you must sacrifice , let it be ? as the Minnesota Alumni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , student , friend ? whatever college has your love ? do your bit for it , and- do it now . ( 3 ) A nation-wide campaign of patriotic education is rapidly developing . No one can doubt that who knows what took place at the Hotel Astor in New York on July 26 . Vassar 's president is already devoting himself solely to " the mobilization of educational institutions for the war emergency . " Various presidents are on leave of absence in the public service . Under President McCracken 's direction ten teams of four speakers each are planning to start within a fortnight to speak in every city , town , and village in New York State on . the causes of the war , our reasons for participation in it , our military and our economic needs , and what is to be done when the war ends . Our universities and colleges are assuming leadership in all this work . They are proving ? no matter what their faults ? that they are necessary both to the well-being and to the existence of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world safe for democracy . " No loss of income or of students will blind them to their duty or paralyze their energy . They trust their friends to help them over the financial strain and to increase their financial strength when war is done . They know that for every student this year missing there will be many a substitute in years to come when all the forces of society combine ? as they all will ? to multiply , if only for the public weal , the number who will want to go to university and college . America has barely begun to send her boys and girls to college . Only about one-half of one per cent . were there last year . When we complete our cosmic and colossal job . there will be no keeping our young people out of college . Even now one need he no great prophet to foresee A throng is on the brightening way All hail , swift-coming larger day .                    @
