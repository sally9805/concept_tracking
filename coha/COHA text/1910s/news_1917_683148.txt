As officials are not yet prepared to say whether the British Commission hap or has  --  not landed . and have asked that nothing be published regarding the movements of the commission at this time , it would be impossible to obtain from any navy officer at this time a statement that such a salute had been fired without violating the confidence the Government expects its officials to observe with respect to the movements of the commission .
