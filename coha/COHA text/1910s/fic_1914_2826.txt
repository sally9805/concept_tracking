" SAYS I THEN MY ARM MUST HAVE SLIPPED -- AND THE SIDE CLINCH WA' N'T DISTURBED WE WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF PRACTISIN ' THE SIDEWISE DIP , WHEN WHO SHOULD SHOW UP BUT THE HAPPY BRIDEGROOM ! WE WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDST Of THE SCRIMMAGE WHEN IN WALKS VEE ON WITH TORCHY CHAPTER I CHANGING IT FOR VEE Say , what 's next to knowin ' when you 're well off ? Why , thinkin ' you are . Which is a little nugget of wisdom I panned out durin ' a chat I had not long ago with Mr. Quinn , that I used to work under when I was on the door of the Sunday sheet , three or four years back . " Hail , Torchy ! " says he , as we meets accidental on Broadway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't you ? " I grins good-natured at his old josh , just as I used to about twice a week regular , and admits that I am . " You wa' n't lookin ' for me to fade to an ash blond , was you ? " says I. " Ah ! " says he . " I see the brilliance is not all on the outside . Well , what use are you putting it to ? Who are you with now ? " " Same concern , " says I. " Corrugated Trust . " " As First , or Second Vice President ? " says he , cockin ' his head on one side humorous . " Add ' em together and multiply by three , " says I , " then you 'll be warm . " " I do n't quite get the result , " says he . " Ever hear of an office-boy-de-luxe ? " says I. " They do n't print it on the letter-heads yet , or paint it on the ground-glass , but that 's my real label . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Quinn chuckles and goes off shakin ' his head . I expect he 's disappointed that I 've stuck so long in one shop without climbin ' further up the ladder . That 's what he was always preachin ' at me , this ladder-climbin ' advice . But say , hod carriers do that . Me for an express elevator when the time comes . But meanwhile , with a couple of bosses like Old Hickory Ellins and Mr. Robert , it ai n't so worse sittin ' behind the brass rail . That 's one reason I ai n't changed . Also there 's that little mine enterprise me and Mr. Robert 's mixed up in , which ai n't come to a head yet . Then -- well , then , there 's Vee . Go on -- hand me the jolly ! And if you push me to it I 'll admit I ai n't any speedy performer at this " Oh , you ! " game . Mr. Robert he thinks it 's comic , when he has the kiddin ' fit on , to remark chuckly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seen Miss Vee lately ? " There 's others too , that seems to get a lot of satisfaction shootin ' the same thing at me , and they sort of snicker when I get pink in the ears . But , say , there 's a heap of difference between pickin ' peaches from an easy chair under the tree , and when you have to shin the garden wall and reach through the barbed wire ornament on top . Course , I ai n't comparin ' anything -- but there 's Aunty . Dear old girl ! Square as a brick , and about as yieldin ' ; good as gold too , but worth more per ounce than any coined at the mint ; and as foxy in the mind as a corporation lawyer arguin ' before the Rapid Transit Commission . Also I 'm as welcome to Aunty 's eyesight as Eugene V. Debs would be at the Union League Club -- just about . That ai n't any idle rumor , either , nor something that was hinted to me casual . It 's first-hand information , hot off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glarin ' at me through her gold lorgnette like I was some kind of insect specimen , " do I understand that you come here to see my niece ? " " Well , " says I , " there 's you and her -- guess ! " " Humph ! " she snorts indignant . " Then I wish you to know that your visits are most unwelcome . Is that quite clear ? " " I get the outline , " says I. " But , you see --  --  " " No qualifications , absolutely none ! " says she . " Good afternoon , young man . I shall not expect you to return . " " Oh , well , in that case , " says I , sidlin ' off , " why -- I -- I think I 'll be goin ' . " It was a smear , that 's all . I felt about as thick through as a Saratoga chip , and not half so crisp . Encouragin ' finish for an afternoon call that I 'd been bracin ' myself up to for weeks , wa' n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sketchy notes Vee gets about the same line of advice handed her . So there was a debate between her and Aunty . For I expect nobody can lay the law down flat to Vee without strikin ' a few sparks from them big gray eyes . But of course Aunty wins out in the end . It 's a cinch , with everything on her side . Anyway , the next thing I knows about their plans is when I finds their names in the sailin ' list , bound for the Big Ditch , with most everyone else that could get away . And I makes my discovery about three hours after the boat has left . But that was in January . And I expect it was a fine thing for Vee , seein ' the canal before it revised the geography , and dodgin ' all kinds of grip weather , and meetin ' a lot of new people . And if it 's worth all that bother to Aunty just so anybody can forget a party no more important than me -- why , I expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some folks to remember what they 're ordered to forget . Anyway , I got bulletins now and then , and I was fairly well posted as to when Aunty landed back in New York , and where she unpacked her trunks . That helped some ; but it did n't cut the barbed wire exactly . And , say , I was gettin ' some anxious to see Vee once more . Nearly two weeks she 'd been home , and not so much as a glimpse of her ! I 'd doped out all kinds of brilliant schemes ; but somehow they did n't work . No lucky breaks seemed to be comin ' my way , either . And then , here last Sunday after dinner , I just hauls out that church weddin ' costume I 'd collected once , brushes most of the kinks out of my red hair , sets my jaw solid , and starts to take a sportin ' chance . On the way up I sketches out a scenario , which runs something like this : A maid answers the ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to see , when the voice of Aunty is heard in the distance , " What ! A young gentleman asking for Verona ? No card ? Then get his name , Hortense . " Me to the maid , " Messenger from Mr. Westlake , and would Miss Vee care to take a short motor spin . Waiting below . " Then more confab with Aunty , and five minutes later out comes Vee . Finale : Me and Vee climbin ' to the top of one of them Riverside Drive busses , while Aunty dreams that she 's out with Sappy Westlake , the chosen one . Some strategy to that -- what ? And , sure enough , the piece opens a good deal as I 'd planned ; only instead of me bein ' alone when I pushes the button , hanged if two young chappies that had come up in the elevator with me do n't drift along to the same apartment door . We swap sort of foolish grins , and when Hortense fin'ly shows up everyone of us does a bashful sidestep to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a revolvin ' wedge . But that do n't trouble her at all . " Oh , yes , " says she , swingin ' the door wide and askin ' no questions . " This way , please . " Looked like we was expected ; so there 's no ducking and while we 're drapin ' our hats on the hall rack I 'm busy picturin ' the look on Aunty 's face when she singles me out of the trio . They was panicky thoughts , them . But a minute later the plot is still further mixed by the sudden swishy , swirly entrance of an entire stranger ,  - -  a tall , thin female with vivid pink cheeks , a chemical auburn tint to her raven tresses , and long jet danglers in her ears . She 's draped in what looks like a black silk umbrella cover with rows of fringe and a train tacked to it , and she wears a red , red rose coquettish over one ear . As she swoops down on us from the drawin ' room she cuts loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , you dear , darling boys ! " says she . " And the Princess Charming is holding court to-day . Ah , Reggy , you scamp ! But you did come , did n't you ? And dear Theodore too ! Brave , Sir Knights ! That 's what you all shall be ,  - -  Knights come to woo the Princess ! " Honest , for awhile there , as this bughouse monologue was bein ' put over , I figured I 've made a mistake in the floor , and had been let into a private ward . But as soon as I gets next to the Georgia accent I suspects that it ai n't any case of squirrels in the attic ; but just a sample of sweet Southern gush . Next I gets a peek through the draperies at some straw-colored hair with a shell-pink ear peepin ' from underneath , and I know that whatever else is wrong do n't matter ; for over there on the windowseat , surrounded by half a dozen young gents , is somebody very particular and special . Followin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws a deep breath . No Aunty looms on the horizon -- not yet , anyway . With the arrival of the new delegates the admirin ' semicircle has to break up , and the three of us are towed to the bay window by Vivacious Vivian . " Princess , " says she , makin ' a low duck , " three other Knights who would do homage . Allow me first to present Mr. Reginald St. Claire Smith . Here Reggy . Also Mr. Theodore Braden . And next Mr. -- Mr.  - -  er - -   - -   " She 's got to me . I expect her first guess was that I 'd been dragged in by one of the other two ; but as neither of ' em makes any sign she turns them black , dark-ringed lamps inquirin ' on me and asks , " Oh , I 'm sure I beg pardon , but -- but you are --  --  " Now who the blazes was I , anyway ? It all depended on how well posted she was , whether I should admit I was Torchy the Banished , or invent an alias on the spot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to gain time , " you see I 'm a -- that is , I 'm a -- a --  --  " " Oh , hello ! " breaks in Vee , jumpin ' up and holdin ' out both hands just in the nick of time . " Why , of course , Cousin Eulalia ! This is a friend of mine , an old friend . " " Really ! " says Cousin Eulalia . " And I may call him --  --  " " Claude , " I puts in , winkin ' at Vee . " Call me just Claude . " " Perfectly lovely ! " gushes Eulalia . " An unknown knight . ' Deed and you shall be called Claude -- Sir Claude of the Golden Crest . Gentlemen , I present him to you . " We looks at each other sort of sheepish , and most of us grins . All but one , in fact . The blond string bean over in the corner , with the buttermilk blue eyes and the white eyebrows , he do n't seem amused . For it 's Sappy Westlake , the one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keepin ' a peeve on ice all that time ! It 's quite a likely lookin ' assortment on the whole , though , all costumed elegant and showin ' signs of bein ' fairly well parlor broke . " What 's the occasion ? " says I on the side to Miss Vee . " Reunion of somebody 's Sunday school class ? " She gives me a punch and smothers a snicker , " Do n't let Cousin Eulalia hear you say such a thing , " says she . We only had a minute ; but from what she manages to whisper durin ' the general chatter I makes out that this is a little scheme Eulalia 'd planned to sort of launch Vee into the younger set . She 's from Atlanta , Cousin Eulalia is , one of the best fam'lies , and kind of a perennial society belle that 's tinkled through quite some seasons , but refuses to quit . Just now she 's spendin ' a month with Fifth-ave. friends , and has just discovered that Vee and her are close connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother-in-law , or something like that . Anyhow , she insists on the cousin racket , and has started right in to rush Vee to the front . She 's some rasher , Eulalia is , too . No **26;3474;TOOLONG silences while she 's conductin ' affairs . Course , it 's kind of frothy stuff to pass for conversation ; but it bubbles out constant , and she blows it around impartial . Her idea of giving Cousin Vee a perfectly good time seems to be to have us all grouped around that windowseat and take turns shootin ' over puffs of hot air ; sort of a taffy-throwin ' competition , you know , with Vee as the mark . But Vee do n't seem tickled to death over it . She ai n't fussed exactly , as Eulalia rounds us up in a half-circle ; but she colors up a little and acts kind of bored . She 's some picture , though . M-m-m-m ! And it was worth while bein ' one of a mob , just to stand there watchin ' her . I expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it as me , even if they was havin ' hard work diggin ' up appropriate remarks when Eulalia swings the arrow so it points to them . Anyway , they does their best to come up with the polite jolly , and nobody makes a break to quit . It 's durin ' the tea and sandwich scramble , though , that Cousin Eulalia gets her happy hunch . Seems that Sappy Westlake has come forward with an invite to a box party just as Vee is tryin ' to make up her mind whether she 'll go with Teddy Braden to some cotillion capers , or accept a dinner dance bid from one of the other young gents . " And all for Wednesday night ! " says she . " How stupid of you , with the week so long ! " " But I 'd planned this box party especially for you , " protests Sappy . " Oh , give someone else a chance , Westlake , " cuts in Reggy . " That 's the night of our frat dance , and I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about ? " demands Eulalia , dancin ' kittenish into the limelight . " Rivalry among our gallant knights ? Then the Princess Charming must decide . " " Oh , do n't , Cousin Eulalia , " says Vee , wrinklin ' her nose the least bit . " Please ! " " Do n't what ? " says Eulalia , raisin ' her long arms flutterin ' . " My dear , I do n't understand . " " Ah , she 's hintin ' for you to ditch the Princess stuff , " I puts in . " Ai n't that it ? " and Vee nods emphatic . Eulalia lets on that she do n't know . " Ditch the -- why , what can he mean by that ? " says she . " And you are a Princess Charming ; is n't she , boys ? " Course the bunch admits that she is . " There , you see ? " goes on Eulalia . " Your faithful knights acclaim you . Who says that the age of chivalry has passed ? Why , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightest bidding . Now , are n't you , Sir Knights ? " It 's kind of a weak chorus ; but the ayes seem to have it . What other answer could there be , with Vee gazin ' flushed and pouty at ' em over the tea urn ? " Really , Eulalia , I wish you would n't be so absurd , " says Vee . " My dear Cousin Verona , " coos Eulalia , glidin ' up and huggin ' her impetuous , " how could anyone keep their heads straight before such absolutely distracting beauty ? See , you have inspired them all with the spirit of chivalry . And now you must put them to the test . Name some heroic deed for each to perform . Begin with Reggy . Now what shall it be ? " " Fudge ! " says Vee , tossin ' her head . " I 'll do nothing so perfectly mushy . " But Cousin Eulalia wa' n't to be squelched , nor have her grand scheme sidetracked . " Then I declare myself Mistress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the tournament for you . Ho , Trumpeter , summon the challengers ! And -- oh , I have it . Each of you Sir Knights must choose his own task , whatever he deems will best please our Princess Charming . What say you to that ? " There 's a murmur of " Good business ! " " Bully dope ! " and the young gents begin to prick up their ears . " Then this is how it stands , " goes on Eulalia , beamin ' delighted . " Between now and eight o'clock this evening each knight must do his valorous best to win the approval of our Princess . Hers it shall be to decide , the prize her gracious company for next Wednesday night . Come now , who enters the lists ? " There 's some snickerin ' and hangin ' back ; but fin'ly they 're all in . " All save the Unknown Knight , " pipes up Eulalia , spottin ' me in the rear . " How now , you of the Crimson Crest ? Not showing the white feather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. " Well , I do n't quite get the drift of the game ; but if it 'll make you feel any better , you can count me in . " " Good ! " says she , clappin ' her hands . " And while you are afield I must leave too -- another tea , you know . But we all meet here again at eight sharp , with proof or plunder . Teddy , have you decided what to attempt ? " " Sure , " says he . " Me to find the biggest box of candy that can be bought in New York Sunday evening . " " Oh , splendid ! " gurgles Eulalia . " And you , Mr. Westlake ? " " Orchids , " says Sappy . " Grandmother has dandy ones at her place up in Westchester , and I can make there and back in my roadster if I 'm not pinched for speeding . I 'm going to have a try , and maybe I 'll have to steal the flowers too . " " There ! " says Eulalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a knightly spirit . But what of Crimson Crest ? What will you do ? " " The game is to spring something on Miss Vee better'n what the others put over , is it ? " says I. " Precisely , " says Eulalia , allowin ' two of the young gents to help her on with her wraps . " Have you thought what your offering is to be ? " " Not yet , " says I. " I may take a chance on something fresh . " They was all pilin ' out eager by that time , each one anxious to get started on his own special fool stunt , so , while I was mixed up in the gen'ral push , with my hat in my hand and my coat over my arm , it did n't strike me how I could bolt the programme until I 'm half crowded behind the open hall door . Then I gets a swift thought . Seein ' I would n't be missed , and that Vee has her back to me , I simply squeezes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last one ; so , when she fin'ly shuts the door , there I am . " Why , Torchy ! " says she . " I thought you had gone . " " But it wa' n't a wish , was it ? " says I. " Humph ! " says she , flashin ' a teasin ' glance . " Suppose I do n't tell that ? " " My nerve is strong today , " says I , chuckin ' my hat back on the rack ; " so I 'll take the benefit of the doubt . " " But all the others have gone to -- to do things that will please me , " she adds . " That 's why I 'm takin ' a chance , " says I , " that if I stick around I might -- well , I 'm shy of grandmothers to steal orchids from , anyway . " Vee chuckles at that . " Is n't Cousin Eulalia too absurd ? " says she . " And since you 're still here -- why -- well , let 's not stand in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I. " Where 's Aunty ? " " Out , " says she . " What a pity ! " says I , takin ' Vee by the arm . " Tell her how much I missed her . " " But how did you happen to come up today ? " asks Vee . " There wa' n't any happenin ' to it , " says I. " I 'd got to my limit , that 's all . Honest , Vee , I just had to come . I 'd have come if there 'd been forty Aunties , each armed with a spiked club . It 's been months , you know , since I 've had a look at you . " " Yes , I know , " says she , gazin ' at the rug . " You -- you 've grown , have n't you ? " " Think so ? " says I. " Maybe it 's the cut-away coat . " " No , " says she ; " although that helps . But as we walked in I thought you seemed taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . Now , back to back . Well , if I ever ! Look where your shoulders come ! " " No more than an inch or so , " says I , gazin ' sideways at the mirror ; and then I lets slip , half under my breath , a sort of gaspy " Gee ! " " Why the ' Gee ' ? " says she , glancin ' over her shoulder into the glass . " Oh , I do n't know , " says I ; " only I do n't mind bein ' grouped like this , not a bit . " " Pooh ! " says she , but still holdin ' the pose . " Seems to me , " says I , " that Cousin Eulalia is a slick describer . That Princess Charming business ai n't so wide . " " Silly ! " says she . " Come and sit down . " She was steerin ' for the windowseat ; but I picks out a cozy little high-backed davenport and , reachin ' for one of her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two here , " says I. " But you need n't keep my hand , " says she . " No trouble , " says I. " Besides , I thought I 'd inspect what kind of a manicure you take of . M-m-m-m ! Pretty fair , no hangnails , all the half-moons showin ' proper , an --  --  " I broke off sudden at that and sat starin ' blank . " Well , anything else ? " says she . " I -- I guess not , " says I , lettin ' her hand slip . " You 've chucked it , eh ? " " Chucked what ? " says she . " Nothing much , " says I. " But for awhile there , you know , just for fun you was wearin ' something of mine . " " Oh ! " she flashes back . " Then at last you 've missed it , have you ? " " With so much else worth lookin ' at , " says I , " is it a wonder ? " " Blarney ! " says she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " says I. Vee shakes her head . " Maybe you lost it ? " I goes on . " It wa' n't much . " " Then you would n't care if I had ? " says she . " I wanted you to keep it , " says I ; " but of course , after all the row Aunty raised over it , I knew you could n't . " " Could n't I , though ? " says she , and with that she fishes up the end of a little gold neck chain from under some lace -- and hanged if there ai n't the ring ! " Vee ! " says I , sort of tingly all over as I gazes at her . " Say , you 're a corker , though ! Why , I thought sure you'd --  --  " " Silly boy ! " says she . " I 'll just have to pay you for that . You will think horrid things of me , will you ? There ! " She does things in a flash when she cuts loose too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eulalia calls my crimson crest and is rumplin ' up all them curls I 'd been so careful to slick back . I grabbed her wrists , and it was more or less of a rough-house scene we was indulgin ' in , when all of a sudden the draperies are brushed back , and in stalks Aunty , with Cousin Eulalia trailin ' behind . " Ver-ona ! " Talk about havin ' a pitcher of cracked ice slipped down your back ! Say , there was more chills in that one word than ever blew down from Medicine Hat . " What , " goes on Aunty , " does this mean ? " " It -- it 's a new game , " says I , grinnin ' foolish . " As old as Satan , I should say ! " raps out Aunty . " Why , " squeals Cousin Eulalia gushy , " here is our Unknown Knight , the first to come back with his tribute ! Let 's see , what was it you said you were going to do ? Oh , I know -- take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Ye-e-es , " says I. " And I guess I did . " " Trust him for that ! " snorts Aunty . " Young man , at our last interview I thought I made it quite clear that I should not expect you to return ? " " That 's right , " says I , edgin ' around her towards the door . " And you wa' n't , was you ? " Some glance she shot over ; but it did n't prove fatal . And as I rides down I could n't help swappin ' a wink with the elevator boy . " Feelin ' frisky , eh ? " says he . " So was them other young guys . One of ' em tipped me a half . " " That kind would , " says I. " They 're comin ' back . I 'm escapin ' . " But , say , who do you guess wins out for Wednesday night ? Ah , rattle ' em again ! Eulalia fixed it up . Said it was Vee 's decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the game , even if they did have to throw a bluff to Aunty . Uh-huh ! I 've got three orchestra seats right in my pocket , and a table engaged for supper afterwards . Oh , I do n't know . Eulalia ai n't so batty , after all . CHAPTER II PULLING A SLEUTH STUNT Trust Piddie for workin ' up wild suspicions . Say , he ca n't find a stray sheet of scribblin ' paper on the floor without pouncin ' sleuthy on it and tryin ' to puzzle out the hidden meanin ' . So when I get the buzzer call to Old Hickory 's private office and finds him and the main stem waitin ' in solemn conclave there , I guesses right off that Piddie 's dug up a new one that he hopes to nail me with . Just now he 's holdin ' a little bunch of wilted field flowers in one hand , and as I range up by the desk he shoots over the accusin ' glance . " Boy , " says he , " do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says I. " They 're pickled pigs ' feet , ai n't they ? " " No impudence , now ! " says he . " Where did they come from ? " " Off 'm Grant 's Tomb , if I must guess , " says I. " Anyway , I would n't think they was picked in the Subway . " And at this Old Hickory sniffs impatient . " That is quite enough comic diversion , young man ! " he puts in . " Do you or do n't you know anything about how those things happened to get on my desk ? " " Me ? " says I. " Why , I never saw ' em before ! What 's the dope ? " " Huh ! " he grunts . " I did n't think this was any of your nonsense : too tame . And I suppose you might as well know what 's afoot . Tell him , Mr. Piddie . " Did you ever see a pinhead but what just dotes on springin ' a sensation ? Piddie fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he , holdin ' up the wilted bunch , " is the unaccountable . For the fourth time flowers of this description have been mysteriously left on Mr. Ellins ' desk . It is not done after hours , or during the night ; but in broad day , sometimes when Mr. Ellins is sitting just where he is now , and by a hand unseen . Watch has been kept , yet no one has been detected ; and , as you know , only a few persons have free access here . Still the thing continues . At regular periods these absurd bouquets appear on this desk , seemingly from nowhere at all . Hence this inquiry . " I 'd heard Piddie spout a good many times before , but never quite so eloquent , and I expect I was gawpin ' at him some dazed and admirin ' . " Well , " says Old Hickory , squintin ' sharp at me from under his bushy eyebrows , " what have you to offer ? " " It 's by me , " says I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he goes on . " With that high tension brain of yours , surely you can advance some idea . " " Why , " says I , " offhand I should say that some of them mushy lady typists out there might be smugglin ' in floral tributes to you , Sir . " Old Hickory grins sarcastic . " Without going into the question of motive , " says he , " that suggestion may be worth considering . What say , Mr. Piddie ? " " It might be that Miss Smicks , " says Piddie . " She 's quite sentimental , Sir , and I 've thought at times she --  --  " " Stop ! " roars Old Hickory , almost workin ' up a blush . " Mr. Piddie , I am a fat , cross-grained old man , about as attractive personally as a hippopotamus . Great stuttering tadpoles ! Ca n't you think of anything but sappy romance ? More likely someone wants a raise . " " Very true , Sir ; I had n't thought of that , " chimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one at a time , Sir , and --  --  " " And what ? " snaps Old Hickory . " Think I 'm going to ask all those young women if they 've been leaving flowers on my desk ? " " Could n't you fake up some job for each one , " says I , " and when they came in be wearin ' the flowers conspicuous , and watch if they --  --  " " Bah ! " breaks in Old Hickory . " What driveling tommyrot ! Besides , I do n't believe any of them had a hand in this . How could they ? Why , I tell you , there was n't a soul in this room between noon and twelve forty-five to-day ; and yet , with me facing that door , these things appear right at my elbow . It -- it 's getting on my nerves , and , by the seven sizzling sisters , I want to know what it all means ! " " We could have in the detectives , " suggests Piddie . " If it was a bomb or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scornful ; " but to trace a few dad-blistered flowers -- no , thank you ! It 's foolish enough as it stands . " " But there is something behind all this , I 'm sure , " insists Piddie , " and if you will allow me to do it , I shall send at once for Dr. Rudolph Bingstetter . " " Who 's he ? " demands Old Hickory . " A distinguished scientist who is a friend and neighbor of mine , " says Piddie , swellin ' up important . " He was formerly a dentist , I believe ; but now he devotes himself to research and literature . He writes magazine articles on psychological phenomena , crime mysteries , and so on . Dr. Bingstetter has a wonderful mind , and is often called on to unravel baffling cases . It was only a few months ago that he successfully investigated a haunted house out our way and found --  --  " " But I 'm not accusing ghosts of this , " says Old Hickory . " Of course not , Sir , " says Piddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out just how those flowers come here . He 's an extremely brilliant man , Sir , and I 'm quite positive he could --  --  " " Well , well , send for him , then , " says Old Hickory . " Only see that you keep still about it outside there , both of you . I do n't care to have the whole office force chattering and snickering over this affair . Understand ? " You bet we did ; for when the boss gets real peevish about anything it 's not safe to get your signals mixed ! I stands guard on the ' phone booth while Piddie was sendin ' the message , and for once we plots away together real chummy . " He 's coming right over this afternoon , " whispers Piddie , as he slides out of the booth . " You 're to take him directly into Mr. Ellins ' office ,  - -  a large , impressive looking man , you know , with a full round face and wearing eye-glasses . " Piddie forgets to mention the shiny frock coat and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the minute he hits the brass gate , which he does about ten minutes before closin ' time . " Dr. Bingstetter ? " says I cautious . " I am he , " is the answer . " S-s-s-s-sh ! " says I , puttin ' a forefinger to my lips warnin ' . " S-s-s-s-sh ! " echoes the Doc , tiptoein ' through the gate . Then up comes Piddie , walkin ' on his toes too , and the three of us does a footpad sneak into Old Hickory 's office . There wa' n't any wild call for me to stay as I knows of ; but as long as no one threw me out I thought I 'd stick around . I must say too the Doc looked and acted the part . First off he sits there blinkin ' wise behind his glasses , and not a sign on his big , heavy face as he listens to all Piddie and Mr. Ellins can tell him about the case . Also when he starts askin ' questions on his own hook he makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " M-m-m-m ! " says he , pursin ' up his lips and studyin ' the bouquet thoughtful . " Six ox-eyed daisies , four sprays of goldenrod , and three marshmallow blooms ,  - -  thirteen in all . And this is the fourth bunch . Now , the others , Mr. Ellins , they were not precisely like this one , were they ? " " Blessed if I know ! " says Old Hickory . " No , come to think of it , they were all different . " " Ah , I thought so ! " says the Doc , sort of suckin ' in his breath satisfied . " Now , just what flowers did the first one contain , I should like to know . " " Why , hang it all , man , I ca n't remember ! " says Old Hickory . " I threw the things into the waste basket . " " Ah , that was careless , very careless , " says the Doc . " It would have helped . One ought to cultivate , Mr. Ellins , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see what can be done with this , " and once more he puckers his lips , furrows up his noble brow , and gazes steady at floral exhibit No. 4 , turnin ' it round slow between his fat fingers and almost goin ' into a trance over it . " Had n't you better take a look around the offices , " suggests Old Hickory , " examine the doors , and so on ? " " No , no ! " says Bingstetter , wavin ' away the interruption . " No bypaths . The trained mind rejects everything contributory , subordinate . It refuses to be led off into a maze of unsupported conjecture . It seeks only the vital , primogenitive fact , the hidden truth at the heart of things . And that is all here -- here ! " Piddie leans forward for another look at the flowers , and wags his head solemn , I edges around for a closer view myself , and Old Hickory stares puzzled . " You do n't mean to say , " says he , " that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S-s-s-sh ! " breaks in the Doc , holdin ' up a warnin ' hand . " It is coming . I am working outward from the primal fact toward the objective . It is evolving , taking on definite proportions , assuming shape . " " Well , what 's the result ? " demands the boss , hitchin ' restless in his chair . " Patience , my dear Sir , patience , " says the Doc soothin ' . " The introdeductive method can not be hurried . It is an exact process , requiring utmost concentration , until in the fullness of the moment --  --  Ah , I have it ! " " Eh ? " says Old Hickory . " One moment , " says the Doc . " A trifling detail is still missing ,  - -  the day of the week . To-day is Wednesday , is it not ? Now , on what day of last week did you receive a -- er -- similar token ? " Old Hickory finally reckons up that it must have been last Wednesday . " And the week before ? " goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Wednesday , did it not ? " Yes , he was pretty sure it did . " Ah ! " says Bingstetter , settlin ' back in his chair like it was all over , " then the cumulative character is established . And such exact recurrence can not be due to chance . No , it has all been nicely calculated , carried out with relentless precision . Four Wednesdays , four floral threats ! " " Threats ? " says Mr. Ellins , sittin ' up prompt . " You failed to read them , " says the Doc . " That is what comes of neglecting minor details . But fortunately I came in time to decipher this one . Observe the fateful number ,  - -  thirteen . Note the colors here ,  - -  brown , golden , pink . The pink of the mallow means youth , the goldenrod stands for hoarded wealth , the brown for age . And all are bound together by wire grass , which is the tightening snare . A menacing missive ! There will come another on Wednesday next . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am positive , " says the Doc . " One more . We will allude to it for the present , if you choose , as the fifth bouquet . And this fifth token will be red , blood red ! Mr. Ellins , you are a marked man ! " " The blazes you say ! " snorts Old Hickory . " Well , it wo n't be the first time . Who 's after me now , though ? " " Five desperate men , " says the Doc , countin ' ' em off on his fingers . " Four have given evidence of their subtle daring . The fifth is yet to appear . He will come on Wednesday next , and then -- he will find that his coming has been anticipated . I shall be here in person . Now , let me see -- there is a room connecting with this ? Ah , very well . Have three policemen in readiness there . I think it can be arranged so that our man will walk in among them of his own accord . That is all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week you will be undisturbed . Until then , Sir , au revoir . " With that he bows dignified and motions Piddie to lead the way out . I slides out too , leavin ' Old Hickory sittin ' there starin ' sort of puzzled and worried at the wall . And , honest , whether you took any stock in the Doc 's yellow forecast or not , it listens kind of creepy . Course , with him usin ' all that highbrow language , I could n't exactly follow how he gets to it ; but there 's no denyin ' that it sounds mighty convincin ' . And yet -- well , I ca n't say just what there was about Bingstetter that got me leery ; but somehow he reminds me of a street faker or a museum lecturer . And it does seem sort of fishy that , just by gazin ' at a bunch of flowers , he could dope out all this wild tale about five desp'rate men . Still , there was no gettin ' away from the fact that he had hit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That must mean something . But why Wednesdays ? Now , what was there that happens on Wednesday that don't --  --  Say , you know how you 'll get a fool hunch sometimes , that 'll seem such a nutty proposition first off that you 'll almost laugh at yourself for havin ' it ; and yet how it 'll rattle around in your bean persistent , until you quit tryin ' to get rid of it ? Well , this one of mine strikes me about as I 'm snugglin ' down into the hay that night , and there was no gettin ' away from it for hours . I expect I did tear off a few chunks of slumber between times ; but I was wide awake long before my regular hour for rollin ' out , and after makin ' three or four stabs at a second nap I gives it up , slips down for an early breakfast , and before eight A.M. I 'm down in the basement of the Corrugated Buildin ' interviewin ' the assistant superintendent in his little coop of an office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that night after I 'd made a trip over to Long Island across the Queensboro Bridge I looks wiser still . Nothin ' to do until next Wednesday . And when it comes it sure opens up like it 's goin ' to be a big day , all right ! At first Old Hickory announces that he ai n't goin ' to have any cops campin ' around in the directors ' room . It was all blithering nonsense ! Had n't he lived through all sorts of warnin 's before ? And he 'd be eternally blim-scuttled if he was goin ' to get cold feet over a few faded flowers ! There was Piddie , though , with his say . His idea is to have the reserves from two precincts scattered all over the shop , and he lugs around such a serious face and talks so panicky that at last the boss compromises on havin ' two of the buildin ' specials detailed for the job . We smuggles ' em into the big room at eleven o'clock , and tells ' em to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blinkin ' mysterious , and has himself concealed behind a screen in the private office . By that time Old Hickory is almost as nervous as anybody . " Fine state of affairs , things are at now , " he growls , " when a man is n't safe unless he has a bodyguard ! That 's what comes of all this political agitation ! " " Have no fear , " says the Doc ; " you will not receive the fifth bouquet . Boy , leave that door into the next room slightly ajar . He will try to escape that way . " " Ajar she is , " says I , proppin ' it open with a ' phone directory . " ' T is well , " says the Doc . " Now leave us . " I was goin ' to , anyway ; for at exactly noon I had a date somewhere else . There was a window openin' ' off the bondroom that was screened by a pile of cases , and out from that was an iron fire escape runnin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd picked that window out as bein ' a good place to scout from . And I could n't have been better placed ; for I saw just who I was expectin ' the minute he heaves in sight . I 'd like to have had one glimpse , though , of Old Hickory and the Doc and Piddie while they was watchin ' and listenin ' and holdin ' their breath inside there . But I 'm near enough when the time comes , to hear that chorus of gasps that 's let loose at twelve-twenty-six exact . " Ha ! " says the Doc . " As I told you -- a red rose ! " " Well , I 'll be slam-whizzled ! " explodes Old Hickory . " But -- but where did it come from ? " pants Piddie . " Who -- who could have --  --  " And that 's just when little Willie , after creepin ' cautious along the fire escape , gives his unsuspectin ' victim the snappy elbow tackle from behind and shoves him into view . " Here 's your desperado ! " says I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small of his back . " Ah , scramble in there , Old Top ! You ai n't goin ' to be hurt . In with you now ! " " Look out ! " squeals Piddie . " Police , police ! " " Ah , can that ! " I sings out , helpin ' my prisoner through the window and followin ' after . " Police nothin ' ! Shoo ' em back , will you ? He 's as harmless as a kitten . " " Torchy , " calls Old Hickory , recoverin ' his nerve a little , " what is the meaning of this , and who have you there ? " " This , " says I , straightenin ' my man up with a shoulder slap , " is the bearer of the fifth bouquet -- also the fourth , and the third , and so on . This is Mr. Cubbins of the Consolidated Window Cleanin ' Company . Ai n't that right , eh , old sport ? " " ' Enery Cubbins , Sir , " says he , scrapin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And was it you who just threw this thing on my desk ? " demands Old Hickory , pointin ' to the red rose . " Meanin ' no ' arm at all , Sir , no ' arm at all , " says Cubbins . " And do I understand that you brought those other flowers in the same way ? " goes on Mr. Ellins . " Not thinkin ' you 'd mind , Sir , " says Cubbins ; " but if there 's henny hoffense given , I asks pardon , Sir . " And there could n't be any mistakin ' the genuine tremble in that weak , pipin ' voice , or the meek look in them watery old eyes . For Cubbins is more or less of a human wreck , when you come to size him up close ,  - -  a thin , bent-shouldered , faded lookin ' old party , with wispy , whitish hair , a peaked red nose , and a peculiar , whimsical quirk to his mouth corners . Old Hickory looks him over curious for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . " So you 're the one , eh ? But why the blue-belted blazes did you do it ? " All Cubbins does , though , is to finger his cap bashful . " Well , Torchy , " says Mr. Ellins , " you seem to be running this show . Perhaps you 'll tell us . " " That 's further'n I 've got , " says I. " You see , when I traced this floral tribute business down to a window washer , I --  --  " " In the name of all that 's brilliant , " breaks in Old Hickory , " how did you ever do that ? " ' " Why , I got to thinkin ' about it , " says I , " and it struck me that we had our glass cleaned every Wednesday , and if there was no way of anyone smugglin ' flowers in through the doors , the windows was all there was left , wa' n't it ? Also who 's most likely to be monkeyin ' around outside , fifteen stories up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Hickory through his teeth . " And did you do that by the introdeductive process , may I ask ? " " No such bunk as that , " says I. " Just used my bean , that 's all . Then I got Mac , the assistant buildin ' super , to put me wise as to who had the windows on our floor , and by throwin ' a bluff over the ' phone I made the Consolidated people locate Mr. Cubbins for me . Found him putterin ' round in his garden over in Astoria , and pumped more or less out of him ; but when it come to gettin ' him to explain why it was he 'd picked you out , Mr. Ellins , as a mark for his bouquets , I fell down complete . Mr. Cubbins is English , as maybe you noticed by his talk , and he used to be a house painter before his health got so bad . Now he lives with his son-in-law , who tells me that the old gent --  --  " " ' E 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes up Cubbins ; " a bally Socialist , Sir , and I 'm ashymed to s'y ' as ' ow ' e 's fond of abusin ' ' is betters . Thet 's ' ow it all come abaht , Sir . Alw'ys tykin ' on over the rich , ' e is ; and ' e 's most fond of s'yin ' wrong things abaht you special , Sir ; callin ' you a bloodsucking predatory person , Sir , and himpolite nimes like thet . ' Ah , stow thet , Jimmy ! ! ' says I. ' All bloomin ' lies , they are . There ay n't a finer man lives than Mr. Ellins , ' says I. ' ' Ow do you know ? ' says ' e . ' ' Ow ? ' says I. ' Do n't I wash ' is hoffice windows ? ' But ' e keeps at it of evenin 's , s'yin ' as ' ow you do this and that , an ' ' e fair talks me down , Jimmy does . But I know w'at I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been bringin ' you the flowers on the sly , Sir ; meanin ' , as I says before , no ' arm at all , Sir . " " Well , I 'll be dashed ! " says Old Hickory , squintin ' at Cubbins humorous . " So you think I 'm a good man , eh ? " " I 'm quite sure of it , Sir , " says he . " As I was tellin ' Jimmy only last night , ' W'y , at ' ome ' e 'd be a Lord ! ' And so you would , Sir . But , as I sees it , you 're just as much ' ere , Sir . You build things up , and keep things goin ' ,  - -  big things , such as the likes of me and Jimmy mykes our livin ' from . And it ay n't just your money mykes you a gryte man ; it 's your brains and your big ' eart . I know w'at I knows , Sir , an ' I ' opes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir . " " Not a bit , Cubbins , " says Old Hickory , smilin ' grim . " In fact , that 's a first rate idea of yours . We ought to have some sort of flowers here all the time . Got many left in your garden , have you , Cubbins ? " " Plenty , Sir , " says Cubbins . " The roses 'll be gone soon now , Sir ; but there 's golden glow , and hasters comin ' on , and zinnias , and --  --  " " Then you 're engaged , Cubbins , " says Old Hickory , " to supply the office with fresh ones every day . When yours give out we 'll have to buy some , I suppose . And you 'll give up this window cleaning job at once . It 's too dangerous . I ca n't afford to have the only man in the United States who holds a good opinion of me risking his neck like that . " " Thankee kindly , Sir , " says Cubbins , beamin ' grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to s'y to that , so we will ! " " Report that in full , " says Old Hickory . " And , Mr. Piddie , see that Mr. Cubbins ' name goes on the payroll from today . But , by the way , where is your distinguished friend , the scientific investigator ? " " Why -- er -- why --  --  " says Piddie , flushin ' up and swallowin ' hard , " Dr. Bingstetter left a moment ago . " " Did , eh ? " grunts Old Hickory . " He should have stayed awhile and allowed Torchy to give him a few pointers on evolving things from primal facts . " " Ye-e-e-es , Sir , " says Piddie , his face all tinted up lovely . Which winds up , as you might say , the Mystery of the Fifth Bouquet . But , believe me , there ai n't any tamer party around the shop these days than this same J. Hemmingway Piddie . And if the old habits get to croppin ' out any time , all I got to do is shut one eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ah , go tell that to Doc Bungstarter ! " That gets him behavin ' . And Cubbins , why -- he 's blossomed out in a new fall suit , and he stops at the desk every few days to tell me how he put it all over Jimmy the night before . So that was some stroke , what ? CHAPTER III WHEN IRA SHOWED SOME PEP It was good domework of Mr. Robert 's to tip me off about this Higgins party , or there 's no knowin ' how hard a time he might have had gettin ' through the brass gate . As it is , the minute I spots the watch chain and the round cuffs and the neck freckles , I sizes him up as the expected delegate from the fresh mackerel and blueberry pie district . One of these long , lanky specimens , he is , with a little stoop to his shoulders , ginger-colored hair and mustache , and a pair of calm , sea-blue eyes that look deep and serious . I finds him pacin ' deliberate up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two minutes ahead of my schedule for openin' ' the Corrugated for gen'ral business . His overcoat and a crumpled mornin ' paper are on the bench ; so I figures he 's been there quite some time . Course , it might have been a stray Rube of most any name ; but I thinks I 'll take a chance . " Mornin ' , Ira , " says I. " Howdy , " says he , as natural as if this was a reg'lar habit of ours . Which puts it up to me to find out if I 'm right , after all . " Mr. Higgins , ai n't it ? " says I. He nods . " When did you get in ? " says I. " About six , " says he . " Come down by train or boat ? " says I. " Train , " says he . " You 've had breakfast , I suppose ? " I goes on . Another nod . Oh , yes , for an economical converser , he was about the most consistent breath saver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a little chat with him . You 'd need lots of time too ; for after every one of my bright little sallies Ira looks me over in that quiet , thoughtful way of his , then counts fifty to himself , and fin'lly decides whether it 'll be a grunt or just a nod . Gettin ' information out of him was like liftin ' a trunk upstairs one step at a time . I manages to drag out , though , that he 'd been hangin ' around ever since the buildin ' was opened by the day watchman at seven o'clock . " Well , " says I , " Mr. Robert was lookin ' for you to blow in today ; but not quite so early . It 'll be near ten before he shows up . Better come inside and have a comf'table chair . " He takes that proposition up with himself , fin'lly passin ' on it favorable ; and from then on he sits there , with never a move or a blink , watchin ' solemn all the maneuvers that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' down for a forenoon 's work . I 'll bet he could tell you too , a month from now , just how many started with gum , and which ones renewed their facial scenery with dabs from the chamois . So you can see why I was some relieved when Mr. Robert arrives and takes him off my hands . I knew from what he 'd said the day before that he 'd planned to have about a half-hour interview with Mr. Higgins ; but when the noon hour struck : Ira was still there . At one-fifteen they goes out to lunch together , and at two-thirty they comes back . It 's after four when Mr. Robert fin'lly comes out to the gate with his brow wrinkled up . " Torchy , " says he , " how is your bump of diplomacy today ? " " It 's a dimple , I expect , " says I. " You 're entirely too modest , " says he . " Now , I remember several occasions when you have --  --  " " Oh , I gen'rally have my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says I. " But I do n't mean that , " says he . " Perhaps finesse is the better word . " " It 's all the same to me , " says I. " If I 've got it in stock , it 's yours . What do I work it on ? " " Mr. Higgins , " says he . " Then score up a goose egg in advance , " says I. " It would take a strong-arm hypnotizer to put the spell on Ira . " Mr. Robert grins . " Then you have already tested Mr. Higgins ' conversational powers ? " says he . " Almost lost my voice gettin ' him to say good mornin ' , " says I. " Say , you 'd think he 'd done all his talkin ' by cable , at a dollar a word . Where 'd he drift in from , anyway ? " " Boothbay Harbor , " says Mr. Robert . " Is that a foreign country , " says I , " or a nickname for some flag station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe , " says Mr. Robert , " up on the coast of Maine . " " Oh , Maine ! " says I. " Up there they 're willin ' to call a town anything that 'll get a laugh . But what 's the rest of the scandal ? " It was n't any thrillin ' tale , though . Seems Mr. Robert had gone into the yachtin ' regattas as usual this last summer ; but , instead of liftin ' the mugs , as he 'd been in the habit of doin ' , he 'd been beat out by a new entry ,  - -  beat bad too . But he would n't be an Ellins if he let it go at that . Not much ! His first move is to find out who built the Stingaree , and his next is to wire in an order to the same firm to turn out a sixty-footer that 'll go her just one better . Not gettin ' any straight answer to that , he sends word for the head of the yacht works to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But the deuce of it is , " says Mr. Robert , " that , while I 'm convinced he is the cleverest designer of racing yawls that we have in the whole country , and while he admits quite cheerfully that he can improve on this year 's model , I ca n't get him to say positively that he will build such a boat for me . " " Yes , I should expect that would be more'n he 'd let go of all in one day , " says I. " But , confound it all ! " says Mr. Robert , " I want to know now . All I can get out of him , though , is that he ca n't decide for a while . Seems to have something or other on his mind . Now , if I knew what was bothering him , you see , I might -- well , you get the point , Torchy . I 'm going to leave it to you to find out . " " Me ! " says I. " Gee ! I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I should explain to Mr. Higgins my regret at being unable to take him out to dinner , and should present you as my substitute for the evening -- why , you might get some hint , you see . At least , I wish you 'd try it . " " Bring him on , then , " says I ; " but it 's like playin ' a 30 to 1 shot . Oh , sure , a couple of tens 'll be more'n enough for all the expense account we can cook up . " And you should have seen me towin ' this Down East sphinx around town , showin ' him the sights , and tryin ' to locate his chummy streak . It was most like makin ' a long distance call over a fuzzy wire ; me strainin ' my vocal chords bein ' chatty , and gettin ' back only now and then a distant murmur . It was Ira 's first trip to a real Guntown , where we have salaried crooks and light up our Main-st. with whisky signs ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass . He just allows them calm eyes of his to wander placid here and there over the passersby , almost like he was expectin ' to see someone he knew , and takin ' mighty little notice of anything in partic'lar . " That 's the Metropolitan tower over there , Mr. Higgins , " says I. " See the big clock ? " Ira takes one glance and nods his head . " And here comes one of them new double-decker Broadway cars they 're tryin ' out , " I goes on . " How 's that ? " But no enthus 'm from Ira . Must be a hot town , that Boothbay joint ! Along about six-thirty I suggests that it 's time for the big eats , and tries to sound him on his partic'lar fancy in the food line . " Plate of fish chowder would suit me , " says Ira after due contemplation . " Fish what ? " says I. " ' Fraid we do n't grow anything like that on Broadway . Nix on the shore dinner ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll steer you up against some appetite teasers that 'll make you forget all the home cookin ' you ever met . " With that I leads him to the flossiest French cafe I knew of , got him planted comf'table under an illuminated grape arbor , signals **44;3502;TOOLONG to stand by , and remarks casual , " Wine list for this gentleman . Cut loose , Mr. Higgins . This is on the boss , you know . " " What say ? " says he , runnin ' his eye over the book that the waiter holds out . " Rum ? No , Sir ! " " Flit then , Francois , " says I. " We 're two dry ones . " And my hope of gettin ' a tongue loosener into Ira goes glimmerin ' . When it comes to tacklin ' strange dishes , though , he was no quitter , followin ' me from bouillabaisse to cafe parfait without battin ' an eyelash , and me orderin ' reckless from the card just to see what the things looked like . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporty crowd around us , or the jiggly music , or a combination of all three ; but by the time I 've induced Mr. Higgins to tackle a demitasse and light up a seven-inch Havana he mellows enough so that he 's almost on the point of makin ' a remark all by himself . " Well , " says I encouragin ' , " why not let it come ? " And it does . " By gorry ! ! " says he . " It 's most eight o'clock . What time do the shows begin ? " " I was just go in ' to mention that , " says I. " Plenty of time , though . Anything special you 'd like to see ? " " Why , yes , " says he . And then , glancin ' around cautious , he leans across the table and asks mysterious , " Say , where 's Maizie Latour actin ' ? " Honest , it comes out so unexpected he had me gaspin ' . " Oh , you Boothbay ringer ! " says I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it ? And you only landed this mornin ' ! Maizie -- er -- what was that again ? " " Latour , " says he , flushin ' up some and tryin ' not to notice my josh . " It 's by me , " says I. " Sounds like musical comedy , though . Is she a showgirl , or one of the chicken ballet ? " Ira shakes his head puzzled . " All I know , " says he , " is that she 's actin ' somewhere in New York , and -- and I 'd like to find out where . I -- I got to ! " he adds emphatic . " Then you ought to have said that before , " says I , " and Mr. Robert would have put one of his chappy friends on the job . Sorry , but when it comes to chorus girls , I ain't --  --  " " Hold on ! " he breaks in . " You 're sort of jumpin ' at things , Son . The fact is I -- well , I guess I might 's well tell you as anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " thinks I. " The dam 's goin ' to give way . " " You see , " he goes on , " it 's like this : Nellie 's an old friend of mine , and --  --  " " Nellie ! " says I. " You just said Maizie . " " That 's what I hear she goes by on the stage , " says he . " She was Nellie Mason up to the Harbor . " " You do n't mean it ? " says I. " What was she doin ' there ? " " She was table girl at the Mansion House , " says he . " Which ? " says I. " Oh , dish juggler , eh ? And now she 's on the stage ? Some jump for Nellie ! But , honest now , Higgins , you do n't mean to spring one of them mossy ' Way Down East drammers on me as the true dope ? Come now , do n't tell me you and she used to go to school together , and all that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was only one of Boothbay 's fairest daughters by adoption , havin ' drifted in from some mill town -- Biddeford , I think it was -- where a weaver 's strike had thrown her out of a job . She was half Irish and half French-Canadian , and , accordin ' to Ira 's description , she was some ornamental . Anyway , she had the boys all goin ' in no time at all . Ira was mealin ' at the Mansion House just then , though ; so he was in on the ground floor from the start . Even at that , how he managed to keep the rail with so much competition is more'n I can say ; but there 's something sort of clean and wholesome lookin ' about him , and I expect them calm , sea-blue eyes helped along . Anyway , him and Nellie kept comp'ny there , I take it , for three or four months quite steady , and Ira admits that he was plumb gone on her . " Well , what was the hitch ? " says I. " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would if I had asked her , " says he ; " but I did n't get around to it quick enough . Fact is , I 'd just bought out the boat shop , and I had fifteen or twenty men to work for me , with four new keels laid down at once , and -- well , I was mighty rushed with work just then and --  --  " " I get you , " says I. " While you was makin ' up your mind what to say , some wholesale drug drummer with a black mustache won her away . " It 's more complicated than that , though . One of the chambermaids had a cousin who was assistant property man with a Klaw &; Erlanger comp'ny , and he 'd sent on the tip how some enterprisin ' manager was lookin ' for fifty new faces for a Broadway production ; and so , if Cousin Maggie wanted to shake the hotel business , here was her chance . Maggie wanted to , all right ; but she lacked the nerve to try it alone . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was one night when Ira had overlooked a date he had with Nellie , and that while he was doin ' overtime at the boatworks Nellie was waitin ' lonesome on the corner all dressed to go over to South Bristol to a dance . So this bulletin from the great city finds her in a state of mind . " Course , " says Maggie , " you got a feller , and all that . " " Humph ! " says Nellie . " And there 's no tellin ' , " Maggie goes on , glancin ' at her critical , " if your figure would suit . " " If they can stand for yours , " says Nellie , " I guess I 'll take a chance too . Come on . We 'll take the early morning boat . " And they did . Ira did n't get the details until about a month later , when who should drift back to the Mansion House but Maggie . Along with two or three hundred other brunettes and imitation blondes , she 'd been shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first rattle out of the box , and accordin ' to the one postcard that had come back from her since she was now flaggin ' as Maizie Latour . But no word at all had come to Ira . " If I 'd only bought that ring sooner ! " he sighs . " I 've got it now , though . Bought it in Portland on my way down . See ? " and he snaps open a white satin box , disclosin ' a cute little pearl set in a circle of chip diamonds . " That 's real dainty and classy , " says I. " Ought to be , " says Ira . " It cost me seventeen-fifty . But there 's so blamed much to this place that I do n't see just how I 'm goin ' to find her , after all . " " Ah , cheer up , Ira ! " says I. " You 've got me int'rested , you have , and , while I ai n't any theatrical directory , I expect I could think up some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here a few blocks , where they have all the casts and programmes . Let 's go have a look . " It wa' n't a long hunt , either . The third one we looked at was " Whoops , Angelina ! " and halfway down the list of characters we finds this item : " Sunflower Girls -- Tessie Trelawney , Mae Collins , Maizie Latour --  --  " " Here we are ! " says I. " And there 's just time to get in for the first curtain . " Say , I expect you 've seen this " Whoops , Angelina ! " thing . Just punk enough to run a year on Broadway , ai n't if ? And do you remember there along towards the end of the first spasm where they ring in that " Field Flowers Fair " song , with a deep stage and a diff'rent chorus for each verse ? Well , as the Sunflowers come on , did you notice special the second one from the right end ? That 's Maizie . And , believe me , she 's some queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around , or they would n't be havin ' the S.R.O . sign out so often ; but got up the way she was , with all them yellow petals makin ' a sort of frame for her , and them big dark eyes rollin ' bold and sassy , this ex-table girl from the Mansion House stands out some prominent . " By gorry ! " explodes Ira , as he gets his first glimpse . And from then on he sits with his eyes glued on her as long as she 's on the stage . Illustration : " By gorry ! " explodes Ira , as he gets his first glimpse . He had a good view too ; for comin ' late all I could get was upper box seats at three a throw , and I shoves Ira close up to the rail . That one remark is all he has to unload durin ' the whole performance , and somehow I did n't have the heart to break in with any comments . You see , I wa' n't sure how he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain , and then nudges him out of his dream . " Well , how about it ? " says I. " Ready to scratch your entry now , are you ? " " Eh ? " says he , rousin ' up . " Pull out ? No , Sir ! I -- I 'm going to give her a chance to take that ring . " " You are ? " says I. " Well , well ! Right there with the pep , ai n't you ? But how you goin ' to manage it ? " " Why , I -- I do n't know , " says he , lookin ' blank . " Say , Son , ca n't you fix it for me some way ? I -- I want Nellie to go back with me . If I could only see her for a minute , and explain how it was I couldn't --  --  " " You win , Ira ! " says I. " Hanged if there ai n't Tucky Moller down there in an usher 's uniform . He 's an old friend of mine . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' enough too ; but the best he can promise is to smuggle a note into the dressin ' rooms . We waits in the lobby for the answer , and inside of five minutes we has it . " Ai n't they the limit , these spotlight chasers ? " says Tucky . " She tells me to chuck it in the basket with the others , and says she 'll read it to-morrow . Huh ! And only a quarter tip after the second act when I lugs her in a bid to a cabaret supper ! " " Tonight ? " says I. " Where at , Tucky ? " " Looey 's , " says he , " with a broker guy that 's been buyin ' B-10 every night for a week . " But when I leads Ira outside and tries to explain how the case stands , and breaks it to him gentle that his stock has taken a sudden slump , it develops that he 's one of these gents who do n't know when they 're crossed off . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says he . " What 's the matter with our going to the same place ? " " For one thing , " says I , " they would n't let us in without our open-faced clothes on . Got yours with you ? " " Full evenin ' dress ? " says Ira , with his eyes bugged . " Why , I never had any . " " Then it 's by-by , Maizie , " says I. " Dog-goned if it is ! " says he . " Guess I can wait around outside , ca n't I ? " " Well , you have got sportin ' blood , Ira , " says I. " Sure , there 's nothin ' to stop your waitin ' if you do n't block the traffic . But maybe it 'll be an hour or more . " " I do n't care , " says he . " And -- and let 's go and have a glass of soda first . " Course , I could n't go away and leave things all up in the air like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cabaret joint and I helps him stick around . It 's some lively scene in front of Looey 's at that time of night too ; with all the taxis comin ' and goin ' and the kalsomined complexions driftin' ' in and out , and the head waiters coppin ' out the five-spots dexterous . And every little while there 's something extra doin ' ; like a couple of college hicks bein ' led out by the strong-arm squad for disputin ' a bill , or a perfect gent all ablaze havin ' a debate with his lady-love , or a bunch of out-of-town buyers discoverin ' the evenin ' dress rule for the first time and gettin ' peeved over it . But nothin ' can drag Ira 's gaze from that revolvin ' exit door for more'n half a minute . There he stands , watchin ' eager every couple that comes out ; not excited or fidgety , you understand , but calm and in dead earnest . It got to be midnight , then half past , then quarter to one ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-pitched laugh , and out trips a giddy-dressed fairy in a gilt and rhinestone turban effect with a tall plume stickin ' straight up from the front of it . She 's one of these big , full-curved , golden brunettes , with long jet danglers in her ears and all the haughty airs of a grand opera star . I did n't dream it was the one we was lookin ' for until I sees Ira straighten up and step out to meet her . " Nellie , " says he , sort of choky and pleadin ' . It 's a misfire , though ; for just then she 's turned to finish some remark to a fat old sport with flat ears and bags under his eyes that 's followin ' close behind . So it ai n't until she 's within a few feet of Higgins that she sees him at all . Then she stares at him sort of doubtful , like she could hardly believe her eyes . " Nellie , " he begins again , " I 've been wanting to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks in . And with that she throws her head back and laughs . It wa' n't what you might call a pleasant laugh , either . It sounds cold and hard and bitter . That 's the extent of the reunion too . She 's still laughin ' as she brushes by him and lets the old sport help her into the taxi ; and a second later we 're left standin ' there at the edge of the curb with another taxi rollin ' up in front of us . I notices that Ira 's holdin ' something in his hand that he 's starin ' at foolish . It 's the satin box with the seventeen-fifty ring in it . " Well , " says I , as we steps back , " returns all in , ai n't they ? " " Not by a long shot ! " says Ira . " Dinged if I do n't know someone that 'll be glad to take a ring from me , and that 's Maggie ! " " Whew ! " says I. " Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to linger round with a busted heart ? " " Not much ! " says Ira . " Guess I 've played fool about long enough . I 'm goin ' home . " " That 's gen'rally a safe bet too , " says I. " But how about buildin ' that boat for Mr. Robert ? " " I 'll build it , " says he ; " that is , soon as I can fix it up with Maggie . " " Then it 's a cinch , " says I ; " for you look to me , Ira , like one of the kind that can come back strong . " So , you see , I had somethin ' definite to report next mornin ' . " He will , eh ? Bully ! " says Mr. Robert . " But why could n't he have said as much to me yesterday ? What was the trouble ? " " Case of moth chasin ' , " says I , " from the kerosene circuit to the white lights . But , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruitin ' stations . They ought to put Boothbay Harbor on the map for this . " CHAPTER IV TORCHY BUGS THE SYSTEM Guess I ai n't mentioned Mortimer before . Did n't seem hardly worth while . You know -- there are parties like that , too triflin ' to do any beefin ' about . But , honest , for awhile there first off this young shrimp that was just makin ' his debut as one of Miller 's subslaves in the bondroom did get on my nerves more or less . He 's a slim , fine-haired , fair-lookin ' young gent , with quick , nervous ways and a habit of holdin ' his chin well up . No boob , you understand . He was a live one , all right . And it wa' n't his havin ' his monogram embroidered on his shirt sleeves or his wearin ' a walkin ' stick down to work that got me sore . But you do n't look for the raw rebuff from one of these twelve-dollar file jugglers . That 's what he slips me , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greetin ' ! " Well , Percy , " says I , seein ' him wanderin ' around lonesome durin ' lunch hour , " is it you for the Folies today , or are you takin ' a chance on one of them new automatic grub factories with me ? " " Beg pardon ? " says he , givin ' me that frigid , distant look . " Ah , can the hauteur ! " says I. " We 're on the same payroll . Maybe you did n't notice me before , though . Well , I 'm the guardian of the gate , and I 'm offerin ' to tow you to a new sandwich works that 's quite popular with the staff . " " Thanks , " says he . " I am lunching at my club . " And with that he does a careless heel-spin , leavin ' me stunned and gawpin ' . " Slap ! " thinks I. " You will go doin ' the little ray of sunshine act , will you ? Lunchin ' at his club ! Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll spring that myself sometime . Score up for Percy ! " But I wa' n't closin ' the incident at that , and , while in my position it would n't have been hardly the thing for me to get out the war club and camp on his trail , him only a four-flushin ' bond clerk ,  - -  I was holdin ' myself ready for the next openin' ' . It comes only a few mornin 's later when he strolls in casual about nine-thirty and starts to pike by into the cloakroom . But I had my toe against the brass gate . " What name ? " says I. " Why , " says he , flushin ' up , " I -- er -- I work here . " " Excuse , " says I , drawin ' back the foot . " Mistook you for Alfy Vanderbilt come to buy us out . " " Puppy ! " says he explosive through his front teeth . " Meanin ' me ? " says I. " Why , Algernon ! How rough of you ! " He just glares hack over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll bet he got it too ; for here in the Corrugated we do n't stand for any of that nine-thirty dope except from Mr. Robert . It 's only the next week , though , that Mortimer pulls a couple more delayed entrances in succession , and I sure was lookin ' to see him come out with a fresh-air pass in his hand . But it did n't happen . Instead , as I 'm in Old Hickory 's office a few days later , allowin ' him to give me a few fool directions about an errand , in breaks Miller all glowin ' under the collar . " Mr. Ellins , " says he , " I ca n't stand that young Upton . He 's got to go ! " " That 's too bad , " says Old Hickory , shiftin ' his cigar to port . " I 'd promised his father to give the boy a three months ' trial at least . One of our big stockholders , Colonel Upton is , you know . But if you say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , in that case , " says Miller ; " but he 's worse than useless in the department , and if there 's no way of getting him to observe office hours it 's going to be bad for discipline . " " Try docking him , Miller , " suggests Mr. Ellins . " Dock him heavy . And pile on the work . Keep him on the jump . " " Yes , Sir , " says Miller , grinnin ' at me ' as he goes out . And of course this throws a brighter light on Mortimer 's case ,  - -  pampered son takin ' his first whirl at honest toil , and all that . Then later in the day I gets a little private illumination . Mother arrives . Rather a gushy , talky party she is , with big , snappy eyes like Mortimer 's , and the same haughty airs . Just now , though , she 's a little puffy from excitement and deep emotion . Seems Mother and Sister Janice are on their way to the steamer , billed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , standin ' grim and bored in the background , has ruled that Son must n't quit business for any farewell lallygaggin ' at the pier . Hence the fam'ly call . As the touchin ' scene all takes place in the reception room , just across the brass rail from my desk , I 'm almost one of the party . " Oh , my darling boy ! " wails Ma , pushin ' back her veils and wrappin ' him in the fond clinch . " Aw , Mother ! " protests Mortimer . " But we are to be so far apart , " she goes on , " and with your father in California you are to be all alone ! And I just know you 'll be forlorn and lonesome in that dreadful boarding house ! Oh , it is perfectly awful ! " " Oh , quit it , Mother . I 'll be all right , " says Mortimer . " But the work here , " comes back Mother . " Does it come so hard ? How are you to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at college , then all this would n't have been necessary . " " Well , I did n't , that 's all , " says Mortimer ; " so what 's the use ? " " I shall worry about you all the time , " insists Mother . " And you are so careless about writing ! How am I to know that you are not ill , or in trouble ? Now promise me , if you should break down under the strain , that you will cable me at once . " " Oh , sure ! " says Mortimer . " But time 's up , Mother . I must be getting back . Good-by . " I had to turn my shoulder on the final break-away , and I thought the whole push had cleared out , when I hears a rustle at the gate , and here 's Mother once more , with her eyes fixed investigatin ' on me . " Boy , " says she , " are you employed here regularly ? " " I 'm one of the fixtures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she . " I am glad to hear it . And you have rather an intelligent appearance . " " Mostly bluff , though , " says I. " You must n't bank too much on looks . " " Ah , but I can tell ! " says she , noddin ' her head and squintin ' shrewd . " You have a kind face too . " " Ye-e-es ? " says I. " But what 's this cue for ? " " I will tell you , Boy , " says she , comin ' up confidential . " You see , I must trust someone in this matter . And you will be right here , where you can see him every day , wo n't you -- my son Mortimer , I mean ? " " I expect I 'll have to , " says I , " if he sticks . " " Then you must do this for me , " she goes on . " Keep close to him . Make yourself his friend . " " Me ? " says I. " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I understand , " says she . " It will be difficult , under the circumstances . And Mortimer has such a proud , reserved nature ! He has always been that way . But now that he is thrown upon his own resources , and if you could once gain his confidence , he might allow you to -- well , you 'll try , wo n't you ? And then I shall depend upon you to send word to me once every week as to how he looks , if he seems happy , how he is getting on in business , and so on . Come , do you promise ? " " Is this a case of philanthropy , or what ? " says I. " Oh , I shall see that you are well repaid , " says she . " That listens well , " says I ; " but it 's kind of vague . Any figures , now ? " " Why -- er -- yes , " says she , hesitatin ' . " Suppose I should send you , say , five dollars for every satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says I. And in two minutes more she 's left me the address of her London bankers , patted me condescendin ' on the shoulder , and has flitted . So here I am with a brand new side line , an assignment to be friendly at so much per . Can you beat that ? It wa' n't until afterwards , either , when I 'm busy throwin ' on the screen pictures of how that extra five 'll fat up the Saturday pay envelope , that I remembers the exact wordin ' of the contract . Five for every satisfactory report . Gee ! that 's different ! Then here 's where I got to see that Mortimer behaves , or else I lose out . And I do n't waste any time plannin ' the campaign . I tackles him as he strolls out thirty seconds ahead of the twelve o'clock whistle . " After another one of them clubby lunches ? " says I. " What 's that to you ? " he growls . " I 'm interested , that 's all , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says he ; " you 're just fresh . " " Ah , come now , Morty , " says I. " This ai n't no reg'lar feud we 're indulgin ' in , you know . Ditch the rude retort and lemme tow you to a joint where for --  --  " " Thanks , " says Mortimer . " I prefer my own company . " " Gee ! what poor taste ! " says I. And it looked like I 'd gone and bugged any five-spot prospects with my first try . So I lets Mortimer simmer for a few days , not makin ' any more cracks , friendly or otherwise . I was about to hand in a blank report too , when one noon he sort of hesitates as he passes the desk , and then stops . " I say , " he begins , " show me that cheap luncheon place you spoke of , will you ? " It 's more of an order than anything else ; but that only makes this sudden shift of his more amusin ' . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club , have you ? " " Not exactly , " says he ; " but -- well , the fact is , Father must have forgotten to send a check for last month 's bill , and I 'm on the board -- posted , you know . " " Then that wa' n't any funny dream of yours , eh , " says I , " this club business ? Which is it , Lotos or the Union League ? " " It 's my frat club , of course , " says Mortimer . " And I do n't mind saying that it 's a deucedly expensive place for me to go , even when I can sign checks for my meals . I 'm always being dragged into billiards , dollar a corner , and that sort of thing . It counts up , and I -- I 'm running rather close to the wind just now . " " What ! And you gettin ' twelve ? " says I. " Why , say , some supports fam'lies on that . Takes managin ' , though . But I 'll steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can --  --  " " A quarter ! " breaks in Mortimer . " But -- but that 's more than I have left . " " And this only Wednesday ! " says I. " Gee ! but you have been goin ' the pace , ai n't you ? What is the sum total of the reserve , anyway ? " Mortimer scoops into his trousers pockets , fishin ' up a silver knife , a gold cigar clipper , and seventeen cents cash . " Well , well ! " says I. " That is gettin ' down to hardpan ! It 's breakin ' one of my business rules , but I see where I underwrite your lunch ticket for the next few days . " " You mean you 're going to stake me ? " says he . " But why ? " " Well , it ai n't on account of your winnin ' ways , " says I. " Humph ! " says he . " Here ! You may have this stickpin as security . " " Gwan ! " says I. " I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' an investment in you . Come on to Max 's . " I could see Mortimer 's nose begin to turn up as we crowds in at a table where a couple of packers from the china store next door was doin ' the sword swallowin ' act . " What a noisy , messy place ! " says he . " The service ai n't quite up to Louis Martin 's , that 's a fact , " says I ; " but then , there 's no extra charge for the butter and toothpicks . " We tried the dairy lunch next time ; but he do n't like that much better . Pushin ' up to the coffee urn with the mob , and havin ' a tongue sandwich slammed down in front of him by a grub hustler that had n't been to a manicure lately was only a couple of the details Mortimer shies at . " Ah , you 'll soon get to overlook little things like that , " says I. Mortimer shakes his head positive . " It 's the disgusting crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Such a cheap lot of -- of roughnecks ! " " Huh ! " says I. " Lots of ' em are pullin ' down more'n you or me . Some of ' em are almost human too . " " I do n't care , " says he . " I dislike to mix with them . It 's bad enough at the boarding house . " " None of the aristocracy there , either ? " says I. " They 're freaks , all of them , " says he . " What do you think -- one fellow wears an outing shirt in to dinner ! Then there 's an old person with gray whiskers who -- well , I ca n't bear to watch him . The others are almost as bad . " " When you get to know the bunch you wo n't mind , " says I. " But I do n't care to know them , " says Mortimer . " I have n't spoken to a soul , and do n't intend to . They 're not my kind , you see . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyway , you 're in for a lonesome time . What do you do evenin 's ? " " Walk around until I 'm tired , that 's all , " says he . " That 's excitin '  - -  I do n't think , " says I. Next he branches off on Miller , and starts tellin ' me what a deep and lastin ' grouch he 'd accumulated against his boss . But I ai n't encouragin ' any hammer play of that kind . " Stow it , Morty , " says I. " I 'm wise to all that . Besides , you ought to know you ca n't hold a job and come floatin ' in at any old hour . No wonder you got in Dutch with him ! Say , is this your first stab at real work ? " He admits that it is , and when I gets him to describe how he 's been killin ' time when he wa' n't in college it develops that one of his principal playthings has been a six-cylinder roadster ,  - -  mile- a- minute brand , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver to snuggle in among the levers on the small of his back . " I 've had her up to sixty-five an hour on some of those Rhode Island oiled stretches , " says Mortimer . " I expect , " says I. " And what was it you hit last ? " " Eh ? " says he . " Oh , I see ! A milk wagon . Rather stiff damages they got out of us , with the hospital and doctor 's bills and all that . But it was more the way I was roasted by the blamed newspapers that made Father so sore . Then my being canned from college soon after -- well , that finished it . So he sends Mother and Sis off to Europe , goes on a business trip to California himself , closes the house , and chucks me into this job . " " Kind of poor trainin ' for it , I 'll admit , " says I. " But buck up , Morty ; we 'll do our best . " " We ? " says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I. " Me and you . " " What 's it got to do with you ? I 'd like to know ! " he demands . " I 've been retained , " says I. " Never you mind how , but I 'm here to pass out the friendly shove , coach you along , see that you make good . " " Well , I like your nerve ! " says he , stoppin ' short as we 're crossin ' Broadway . " A young mucker like you help me make good ! Say , that 's rich , that is ! Huh ! But why do n't you ? Come ahead with it , now , if you 're such an expert ! " It was a dare , all right . And for a minute there we looked each other over scornful , until I decides that I 'll carry on the friend act if I have to risk gettin ' my head punched . " First off , Mortimer , " says I , " forgettin ' what a great man you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's figure on just what your standin ' is now . You 're a bum bond clerk , on the ragged edge of bein ' fired , ai n't you ? " He winces some at that ; but he still has a comeback . " If it was n't for that bonehead Miller , I 'd get on , " he growls . " Bah ! " says I. " He 's only layin ' down the rules of the game ; so it 's up to you to follow ' em . " " But he 's unreasonable , " whines Mortimer . " He snoops around after me , finds fault with everything I do , and fines me for being a little late mornings . " I takes a long breath and swallows hard . Next I tries to strike the saintly pose , and then I unreels the copybook dope just like I believed it myself . " He does , eh ? " says I. " Then beat him to it . Do n't be late . Show up at eight-thirty instead of nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Be the last to quit too . Play up to Miller . Do things the way he wants ' em done , even if you have to do ' em over a dozen times . And use your bean . " " But it 's petty , insignificant work , " says Mortimer . " All the worse for you if you ca n't swing it , " says I. " See here , now -- how are you goin ' to feel afterwards if you 've always got to look back on the fact that you begun by fallin ' down on a twelve-dollar job ? " Must have got Mortimer in the short ribs , that last shot ; for he walks all the rest of the way back to the Corrugated without sayin ' a word . Then , just as we gets into the elevator , he unloosens . " I do n't believe it will do any good to try , " says he ; " but I 've a mind to give it a whirl . " I did n't say so , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So that night I has to send off a report which reads like this : Mortimer 's health O. K. ; disposition ragged ; business prospects punk . Hoping you are the same , TORCHY . It 's a wonder Mortimer did n't have mental indigestion , with all that load of gilt-edged advice on his mind , and I wa' n't lookin ' for him to lug it much further'n the door ; but , if you 'll believe me , he seems to take it serious . Every mornin ' after that I finds his hat on the hook when I come in , and whenever I gets a glimpse of him durin ' the day he has his coat off and is makin ' a noise like the busy bee . At this it takes some time before he makes an impression on Miller ; but fin'lly Morty comes out to me with a bulletin that seems to tickle him all over . " What do you know ? " says he . " When Miller was looking over some of my work to-day he breaks out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . ' " " Well , I expect you told him to chase himself , eh ? " says I. " No , " says Mortimer . " I sprung that new scheme of mine for filing the back records , and perhaps he 's going to adopt it . " " Think of that ! " says I. " Say , you keep on , and you 'll be presented with that job for life . But , honest , you do n't find Miller such a fish , do you ? " " Oh , I guess he 's all right in his way , " says Mortimer . " Then brace yourself , Morty , " says I , " while I slip you some more golden words . Tackle that boardin ' house bunch of yours . Ah , hold your breath while you 're doin ' it , if you want to , and spray yourself afterwards with disinfectant , but see if you ca n't learn to mix in . " " But why ? " says he . " I ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pete , " says I , " ai n't it hard enough for me to press out all this wise dope without drawin ' diagrams ? I do n't know why , only you should . Go on now , take it from me . " Maybe it was followin ' my hunch , or maybe there wa' n't anything else for him to do , but blamed if this did n't work too . Inside of two weeks he gives me the whole tale , one day as we 're sittin ' in the armchairs at the dairy lunch . " Remember my telling you about the fellow who wore the outing shirt ? " says he . " Well , say , he 's quite a chap , you know . He 's from some little town out in Wyoming , and he 's on here trying to be a cartoonist -- runs a hoisting engine day times and goes to an art school evenings . How 's that , eh ? " " Sounds batty , " says I. " There 's most as many would-be cartoonists as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But this Blake 's going to get there , " says Mortimer . " I was up in his room Sunday , and he showed me some of his work . Clever stuff , a lot of it . He 's landed a couple of things already . Then there 's old man McQuade , the one with the whiskers . Say , he 's been all over the world ,  - -  Siberia , Africa , Japan , South America . Used to be selling agent for a mill supply firm . He has all his savings invested in an Egyptian cotton plantation that has n't begun to pay yet , but he thinks it will soon . You ought to hear the yarns he can spin , though ! " " So-o-o ? " says I. " But Aronwitz is the fellow I 'm traveling ' around with most just now , " goes on Mortimer enthusiastic . " Say , he 's a wonder ! Been over here from Hungary only six years , worked his way through Columbia , copping an A. M. and an A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right along . He 's a Socialist , or something , and writes for one of those East Side papers . Then evenings he teaches manual training in a slum settlement house . He took me over with him the other night and got me to help him with his boys . My , but they 're a bright lot of youngsters -- right off the street too ! I 've promised to take a class myself . " " In what , " says I , " table etiquette ? " " I 'm going to start by explaining to them how a gasolene engine works , " says Mortimer . " They 're crazy to learn anything like that . It will be great sport . " " Mortimer , " says I , " a little more of that , and I 'll believe you 're the guy that put the seed in succeed . Anyone would n't guess you was doin ' penance . " " I feel that I 'm really living at last , " says he in earnest . So in that next report to Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and filled in the usual health chart and so on , I proceeds to throw in a few extras about how Son was makin ' the great discovery that most folks was more or less human , after all . Oh , I spread myself on that part of it , givin ' full details ! " And if that do n't charm an extra five out of the old girl , " thinks I , " I miss my guess . " Does it ? Well , say , that happy thought stays with me for about ten days . At times I figured the bonus might be as high as a fifty . And then one mornin ' here comes a ruddy-faced old party that I spots as Colonel Upton . He calls for Mortimer , and the two of ' em has a ten-minute chat in the corridor . Afterwards Morty interviews Miller , and when he comes out next he has his hat and overcoat with him . " So long , Torchy , " says he . " I 'm leaving . " " Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mother , " says he . " In some way she 's found out about the sort of people I 've been going around with , and she 's kicked up a great row , got Father on the cable , and -- well , it 's all off . I 'm to travel abroad for a year or so to get it out of my system . " " Gee ! " says I as he goes out to join the Colonel . " Talk about boobing a swell proposition ! But that was too good to last , anyway . And , believe me , if I 'm ever asked again to be friendly on a salary , I bet I do n't overdo the thing . " CHAPTER V BREEZING BY WITH PEGGY He 's a great old scout , Mr. Ellins . But he always knows where he wants to get off , all right . He do n't whisper his ideas on the subject , either . " Boy , " says he the other mornin ' as I answers the buzzer , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young wards of mine . Huh ! Wards ! As though I was n't busy enough with my own affairs without --  --  But never mind . Chandler is the name . " " Yes , Sir , " says I. " Chandler . Rush ' em right in , shall I ? " " No ! " snorts Old Hickory . " What I want you to do is to use a little sense , if you have any . Now , here ! I have a committee meeting at ten ; those K. &; T. people will be here at ten-forty-five ; and after that I ca n't say whether I 'll be free or not . Of course I must see the young nuisances ; but meantime I want to forget ' em . I am trusting to you to work ' em in when they 'll be the least bother . " " Got you , " says I. " Chink in with Chandlers . Yes , Sir . Anything more ? " " No . Get out ! " he snaps . Fair imitation of a grouch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hickory . Besides , there was some excuse for his bein ' peeved , havin ' a pair of kids camp down on him this way . Course I was wise to the other details . Did n't I take their ' phone message to Mr. Robert only the day before , and send back the answer for ' em to come on ? Seems this was a case of a second cousin , or something like that , a nutty college professor , who 'd gone and left a will makin ' Mr. Ellins a guardian without so much as askin ' by your leave . There was a Mrs. Chandler ; but she do n't figure in the guardianship . The youngsters had been in school somewhere near Boston ; but , this bein ' the holidays , what do they do but turn up in New York and express a wild desire to see dear old Guardy . " Gee ! " thinks I. " They do n't know when they 're well off . " For Old Hickory ai n't got a lot of use for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments on that point . " Impudent , ill-mannered , selfish , spoiled young barbarians , the boys , " says he , " and the girls are n't much better ,  - -  silly , giggling young chatterboxes ! " And the way I has it framed up , this was rather a foxy move of the young Chandlers , discoverin ' their swell New York relations just as the holiday season was openin' ' . So I do n't figure that the situation calls for any open-arm motions on my part . No , nothin ' like that . I 'm here to give ' em their first touch of frost . So about eleven-fifteen , as I glances across the brass rail and sees this pair advancin ' sort of uncertain , I 'm all prepared to cause a drop in the mercury . They wa' n't exactly the type I had in mind , though . What I 'd expected was a brace of high school cutups . But these two are older than that . The young fellow was one of these big-boned , wide-shouldered chaps , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull . I could n't tell at first look whether he was a live wire or not . No such suspicions about the girl . She ai n't what you 'd call a queen , exactly . She 's too tall and her face is too long for that . Kind of a cute sort of face , though , with rather a wide mouth that she can twist into a weird , one-sided smile . But after one look at them lively blue eyes you knew she was n't walkin ' in her sleep . It 's my cue , though , to let ' em guess what nuisances they were . " May I see Mr. Ellins ? " says the young chap . " Cards , " says I. He produces the pasteboards . " Oh , yes ! " I goes on . " The wards , eh ? Marjorie Chandler , Dudley Winthrop Chandler . Well , you 've picked out a busy day , you know . " " Oh , have we ? " says Marjorie . " There , Dud ! I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all . " " Good ! " says Dudley . " I did n't want to , anyway . We can just send in our cards and leave word that we --  --  " " Ah , can it ! " says I. " Mr. Ellins is expectin ' you ; only he ai n't a man you can walk in on casual . " " But really , " puts in Marjorie , " it 's just as well if we do n't see him . " " Yes , and get me fired for not carryin ' out instructions , " says I. " My orders are to work you in when there 's a chance . " " Oh , in that case , " says Marjorie , " perhaps we had better wait . We do n't wish to cause trouble for anyone , especially such a bright , charming young --  --  " " Nix on the josh , " says I. " And have a seat while I skirmish . " " Very well , then , " says she , screwin ' her face up cunnin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Say , she pretty near had me goin ' right from the start . And as I tiptoes into the boss 's room I sees he ai n't doin ' anything more important than signin ' letters . " They 're here , " says I , " the wards . Is it all right to run ' em in now ? " He grunts , nods his head , and keeps on writin ' . So I strolls back to the reception room . " All right , " says I. " I 've fixed it up for you . " " Now , was n't that sweet in you ? " gurgles Marjorie , glancin ' sideways at Brother . I could n't swear it was a wink , either ; but it 's one of them knowin ' fam'ly looks , and she follows it up with a ripply sort of a giggle . " That 's right ! " says I. " Have all the fun you want with me ; but I 'd warn you to ditch the mirth stuff while you 're on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How interesting ! " says Marjorie . " Dudley , I hope you understand . We must ditch the mirth stuff . " They swaps another grin at that , and I have a suspicion I 'm bein ' kidded . Just for that too I decides to stick around while they 're gettin ' theirs from Old Hickory . " This way , " says I cold and haughty , as I tows ' em into the private office . Mr. Ellins lets ' em stand there a minute or so without sayin ' a word , and then he turns and looks ' em over deliberate . " Humph ! " he grunts . " Thought you were younger . " " Yes , Sir , " says Marjorie , " we -- er -- we were at one time . " Old Hickory shoots a quizzin ' glance at her ; but there ai n't the ghost of a smile on her face . " Huh ! " says he . " I 've no doubt . And I presume that in due course you 'll be older . Having agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing in New York ? " Marjorie starts in to give him the answer to that ; but Dudley shakes his head at her and takes the floor himself . " You see , Sir , " says he real respectful , " Mother 's abroad this winter , and when we were asked to visit friends on Long Island we thought --  --  " " Amy abroad , is she ? " breaks in Mr. Ellins . " How does that happen ? " " The Adamses took her with them to Egypt , " says Dudley . " They are old friends of ours . " " Humph ! " says Old Hickory . " Your mother must be rather popular ? " " Oh , everyone likes Mama , " put in Marjorie . " She 's asked around everywhere . " " Yes , yes , I 've no doubt , " says he . " As I remember her , she was rather a -- but we wo n't go into that . Did you come to consult me about anything in particular ? " " No indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to bother about our affairs , and you 've done such wonders with the little property poor Dad left , that we thought , as we were so near , we ought to --  --  " " We wanted , " breaks in Dudley , " to call and thank you personally for your kindness . You have been awfully kind , Sir . " " Think so , do you ? " says Mr. Ellins . " Well , is that all ? " " Yes , " says Marjorie ; " only -- only -- oh , Dud , I 'm going to do it ! " And with that she makes a rush , lets out a giggle or two , grabs Old Hickory in a perfectly good hug , and kisses him twice on his bald spot . He do n't even have a chance to struggle , and before he can get out a word it 's all over and she has backed off , givin ' him the full benefit of one of them twisty smiles . I was lookin ' for him to blow up for fair at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " says he . " Not in the least necessary , you know . But if it was something you had to get out of your system , all right . So you 've been visiting , eh ? Now , what ? " " Why , Marjorie 's going back to her school , Sir , " says Dudley , " and I to college . " " Before the holidays are over ? " says Mr. Ellins . " Oh , we do n't mind , " says Marjorie . " We do n't want to go home and open up the house ; for we should miss Mother so much . " " Suppose you finish out your vacation with us , then ? " suggests Old Hickory . " Oh , thank you , Sir , " says Dudley ; " but we --  --  " " Mother wrote us , you see , " breaks in Marjorie , " that we must n't think of bothering you another bit . " " Who says you 're a bother ? " he demands . " At this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the right kind . " " But I 'm not sure we are the right kind , " says Marjorie . " I -- I 'm not very serious , you know ; and Dud 's apt to be noisy . He thinks he can sing . " At which Dudley gets fussed and Old Hickory chuckles . " I 'll take a chance , " says Mr. Ellins . " If I 'm to be your guardian , I ought to know you better . So you two trot right up to the house and prepare to stay the week out . Here , Torchy ! ' Phone for the limousine . No , not a word , young woman ! I have n't time to discuss it . Clear out , both of you ! See you at dinner . " " There ! " says Marjorie as a partin ' shot . " I just knew you were an old dear ! " " Stuff ! " protests Mr. Ellins . " ' Old bear , ' is more like it . " And me , I picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gen'ral office with all the honors . " I 'll have that car down in a jiffy , Miss , " says I. " Oh , thank you , " says Marjorie . " And if you think of anything we ought to ditch in the meantime --  " " Ah , what 's the use rubbin ' it in on me , " says I , " after the way you put it over Mr. Ellins ? I do n't count . Besides , anybody that fields their position like you do has got me wearin ' their button for keeps . " " Really ? " says she . " I shall remember that , you know ; and there 's no telling what dreadful thing I may do before I go . Is there , Dud ? " " Oh , quit it , Peggy ! " says he . " Behave , ca n't you ? " " Certainly , Brother dear , " says she , runnin ' her tongue out at him . Ever see anyone who could make a cute play of that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , the sudden hit them two seemed to make with Old Hickory . Honest , the few days they was around the house his disposition clears up like coffee does when you stir in the egg . I heard him talkin ' to Mr. Robert about ' em , how well brought up and mannerly they was . He even unloads some of it on me , by way of suggestin ' ' em as models . You 'd most think he 'd trained ' em himself . Bein ' chased up to the house on so many errands , I had a chance to get the benefit of some of this improvin ' influence . And it was kind of good , I admit , to watch how prompt Dudley hops up every time any older party comes into the room ; and how sweet Marjorie is to everybody , even the butler . They was just as nice to each other too ,  - -  Brother helpin ' Sister on with her wraps , and gettin ' down on his knees to put on her rubbers ; while Marjorie never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cheek . " Gee ! " thinks I. " A sister like that would n't be so bad to have around . " Course , I knew this was comp'ny manners , exhibition stuff ; but all the same it was kind of inspirin ' to see . It 's catchin ' too . I even finds myself speakin ' gentle to Piddie , and offerin ' to help Mr. Ellins with his overcoat . All of which lasts until here one afternoon , as I 'm waitin ' in the Ellins ' lib'ry for some presents I 'm to deliver , when the spell is shattered . I 'd heard ' em out in the hall , talkin ' low and earnest , and next thing I know they 've drifted in where I am and have opened up a lively debate . " Pooh ! " says Marjorie . " You ca n't stop me . " " See here , Peggy ! " comes back Dudley . " Did n't Mother say I was to look after you ? " " She did n't tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not bossy , " comes back Dudley . " You are so ! " says she . " Old fuss budget ! Stewcat ! " " Rattlehead ! " says Dudley . " Do n't mind me , " I breaks in . " I 'm havin ' my manners improved . " All that brings out , though , is a glance and a shoulder shrug , and they proceed with the squabble . " Dud Chandler , " says Marjorie determined , " I am going to drive the car today ! You did yesterday for an hour . " " That 's entirely different , " says Dudley . " I 'm used to it , and Henry said I might . " " And Henry says I may too -- so there ! " says Marjorie . " And you know I 'm just crazy to try it on Fifth Avenue . " " You 'd look nice , would n't you ? " says Brother scornful . " A limousine ! " " But Bud Adams let me drive theirs ; in Boston too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , " says Dudley . " Dudley Chandler , " snaps Sister , her eyes throwin ' off sparks , " do n't you dare talk that way about my friends ! " " Huh ! " says Brother . " If there ever was a boob , that Bud Adams is --  --  " Say , there 's only a flash and a squeal before Sister has landed a smack on his jaw and has both hands in his hair . Looked like a real rough-house session , right there in the lib'ry , when there comes a call for me down the stairs from Mrs. Ellins . She wants to know if I 'm ready . Illustration : Sister has landed a smack on his jaw . " Waitin ' here , Ma'am , " says I , steppin ' out into the hall . " And Marjorie and Dudley ? " says she . " Are the dear young folks ready too ? " " I 'll ask ' em , " says I. And with that I dodges hack where they 're standin ' glarin ' at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is it to be a go to a finish , or --  --  " " Come , Marjorie , " says Dudley , " be decent . " " I -- am going to do it ! " announces Marjorie . " Mule ! " hisses Dudley . And that 's the status quo between these two models when we starts for the car . Marjorie makes a quick break and plants herself in front by the chauffeur , leavin ' Brother to climb inside with me and the bundles . He grits his teeth and murmurs a few remarks under his breath . " Some pep to that sister of yours , eh ? " says I. " She 's an obstinate little fool ! " says Dudley . " Look at that , now ! I knew she would ! " Yep , she had . We 're no sooner under way than the obligin ' Henry slides out of his seat and lets Miss Marjorie slip in behind the wheel . She can drive a car all right too . You ought to see her throw in the high and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the traffic cops at crossing , skinnin ' around motor busses , and crowdin ' out a fresh taxi driver that tried to hog a corner on her . Nothin ' timid or amateurish either about the way she handled that ten-thousand-dollar gas wagon of Old Hickory 's . Where I 'd be jammin ' on both brakes and callin ' for help , she just breezes along like she had the street all to herself . Meantime Brother is sittin ' with both feet braced and one hand on the door , now and then sighin ' relieved as we scrape through a tight place . But we 'd been down quite a ways and was part way back , headed for Riverside Drive , and was rollin ' along merry too , when all of a sudden a fruit faker 's wagon looms up out of a side street unexpected , there 's a bump and a crash , and there we are , with a spokeless wooden wheel draped jaunty over one mud guard , the asphalt strewed with oranges , and int'rested spectators gatherin ' gleeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old plug of a horse is down , kickin ' the stuffin ' out of the harness , and a few feet off is the huckster , huddled up in a heap like a bag of meal . Course , there 's a cop on the spot . He pushes in where Dudley is tryin ' to help the wagon driver up , takes one look at the wreck , and then flashes his little notebook . He puts down our license number , calls for the owner 's name , prods the wagon man without result , tells us we 're all pinched , and steps over to a convenient signal box to ring up an ambulance . Inside of three minutes we 're the storm center of a small mob , and there 's two other cops lookin ' us over disapprovin ' . " Take ' em all to the station house , " says one , who happens to be a roundsman . That did n't listen good to me ; so I kind of sidles off from our group . It just struck me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside lookin ' in . But at that I got to the station house almost as soon as they did . The trio was lined up before the desk Sergeant . Miss Marjorie 's kind of white , but keepin ' a stiff lip over it ; while Dudley is holdin ' one hand and pattin ' it comfortin ' . " Well , who was driving ? " is the first thing the Sergeant wants to know . " If you please , Sir , " speaks up Dudley , " I was . " " Why , Dudley ! " says Peggy , openin' ' her eyes wide . " You know --  --  " " Hush up ! " whispers Brother . " Sha'nt ! " says Marjorie . " I was driving , Mr. Officer . " " Rot ! " says Dudley . " Pay no attention to her , Sergeant . " " Suit yourself , " says the Sergeant . " I 'd just as soon lock up two as one . Then we 'll be sure . " " There ! You see ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now keep out , will you ? " " But , Dudley --  --  " protests Marjorie . " That 'll do , " says the Sergeant . " You 'll have plenty of time to talk it over afterwards . Hospital case , eh ? Then we ca n't take bail . Names , now ! " And it 's while their names are bein ' put on the blotter that I slides out , hunts up a pay station , and gets Mr. Robert on the ' phone . " Better lug along a good-sized roll , " says I , after I 've explained the case , " and start a lawyer or two this way . You 'll need ' em . " " I will , " says Mr. Robert . " And you 'll meet me at the station , will you ? " " Later on , " says I. " I want to try a little sleuthin ' first . " You see , I 'd spotted the faker 's name on the wagon license , and it occurs to me that before any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good scheme to discover just how bad he was bunged up . So my bluff is that it 's an uncle of mine that 's been hurt . By pushin ' it good and hard too , and insistin ' that I 'd got to see him , I gets clear into the cot without bein ' held up . And there 's the victim , snoozin ' peaceful . " Gee ! " says I to the nurse , sniffin ' the atmosphere . " Had to brace him up with a drink , did you ? " She smiles at that . " Hardly , " says she . " He had attended to that , or he would n't be in here . This is the alcoholic ward , you know . " " Huh ! " says I. " Pickled , was he ? But is he hurt bad ? " " Not at all , " says she . " He will be all right as soon as he 's sober . " Did I smoke it back to the station house ? Well , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two volunteer witnesses who was ready to swear the faker was drivin ' on the wrong side of the street and not lookin ' where he was goin ' . " How could he , " says I , " when he was soused to the ears ? " Course , it took some time to convince the Sergeant ; but after he 'd had word from the hospital he concludes to accept a hundred cash , let Dudley go until mornin ' , and scratch Marjorie 's name off the book . Goin ' back to the house we four rides inside , with Henry at the wheel . " I 'm awfully sorry , Dud , " says Marjorie , snugglin ' up to Brother , " but -- but it was almost worth it . I did n't know you could be so -- so splendid ! " " Stow it , Peggy , " says Dudley . " You 're a regular brick ! " " No , I 'm not , " says she . " And think what Mr. Ellins will say ! " There , there ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame . I will have someone see the fellow in the morning and settle the damage , however . There 's no need to trouble Father about it , none in the least . " " Besides , Peggy , " adds Dudley , " I 'm the one the charge is made against . So butt out . " Looked like it was all settled that way too , and that Old Hickory 's faith in his model wards wa' n't to be disturbed . But when we pulls up at the house there he is , just goin ' up the front steps . " Ah ! " says he , beamin ' . " There you are , eh ? And how has my little Peggy been enjoying herself today ? " " Mr. Ellins , " says she , lookin ' him square in the eye , " you must n't call me your Peggy any more . I 've just hit a man . He 's in the hospital . " " You -- you hit someone ! " gasps Old Hickory , starin ' puzzled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the car , " says she . " I was driving . Dudley tried to stop me ; but I was horrid about it . We had a regular fight over it . Then I coaxed Henry to let me , and -- and this happened . Do n't listen to Dudley . It was all my fault . " " Wow ! " I whispers to Mr. Robert . " Now she 's spilled the beans ! " Did she ? Say , I wa' n't in on the fam'ly conference that follows , but I gets the result from Mr. Robert next day , after he 's been to court and seen Dudley 's case dismissed . " No , the young folks have n't been sent away , " says he . " In fact , Father thinks more of them than ever . He 's going to take ' em both abroad with him next summer . " Would n't that smear you , though ? Say , I wish someone would turn me loose with a limousine ! CHAPTER VI GLOOM SHUNTING FOR THE BOSS Trouble ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for awhile , our stocks on the slump , a quarterly bein ' passed , Congress actin ' up , a lot of gloom rumors floatin ' around about what was goin ' to happen to the tariff on steel , and the I Wo n't Workers pullin ' off a big strike at one of our busiest plants . But all these things was side issues compared to this scrap that develops between Old Hickory and Peter K. Groff . Maybe you do n't know about Peter K. ? Well , he 's the Mesaba agent of Corrugated affairs , the big noise at the dirt end of the dividends . It 's Groff handles the ore proposition , you understand , and it 's his company that does the inter-locking act between the ore mines and us and the railroads . Course , I ca n't give you all the details without pullin ' down a subpoena from the Attorney-General 's office , and I ai n't anxious to crowd Willie Rockefeller , or anybody like that , out of the witness chair . But I can go as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could dope it out , Peter K. was only standin ' on his rights , and if only him and Mr. Ellins could have got together for half an hour peaceable-like things could have been squared all around . We needed Groff every tick of the clock , and just because he ai n't always polite in statin ' his views over the wire wa' n't any first-class reason for us extendin ' him an official invitation to go sew his head in a bag . Uh-huh , them was Old Hickory 's very words . I stood by while he writes the message . Then I takes it out and shows it to Piddie and grins . You should have seen Piddie 's face . He turns the color of green pea soup and gasps . He 's got all the fightin ' qualities of a pet rabbit in him , Piddie has . " But -- but that is a flat insult , " says he , " and Mr. Groff is a very irascible person ! " " A which ? " says I. " Never mind , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to pep in the disposition , he 's the real Tabasco Tommy . " " But I still contend , " says Piddie , " that this reply should not be sent . " " Course it should n't , " says I. " But who 's goin ' to point that out to the boss ? You ? " Piddie shudders . I 'll bet he went home that night and told Wifey to prepare for the end of the world . Course , I knew it meant a muss . But when Old Hickory 's been limpin ' around with a gouty toe for two weeks , and his digestion 's gone on the fritz , and things in gen'ral has been breakin ' bad -- well , it 's a case of low barometer in our shop , and waitin ' to see where the lightnin ' strikes first . Might 's well be pointed at Peter K. , thinks I , as at some Wall Street magnate or me . Course , Groff goes up in the air a mile , threatens to resign from the board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to end most anywhere . Then , right in the midst of it , Old Hickory accumulates his annual case of grip , runs up a temperature that ai n't got anything to do with his disposition , and his doctor gives orders for him not to move out of the house for a week . So that throws the whole thing onto me and Mr. Robert . I was takin ' it calm enough too ; but with Mr. Robert it 's different . He has his coat off that mornin ' , and his hair mussed up , and he 's smokin ' long brunette cigars instead of his usual cigarettes . He was pawin ' over things panicky . " Hang it all ! " he explodes . " Some of these papers must go up to the Governor for his indorsement . Perhaps you 'd better take them , Torchy . But you 're not likely to find him in a very agreeable mood , you know . " " Oh , I can dodge , " says I , gatherin ' up the stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these on the bed and make a slide for life , or so I take out accident insurance and then stick around for orders ? " " You may -- er -- stick around , " says Mr. Robert . " In fact , my chief reason for sending you up to the house is the fact that at times you are apt to have a cheering effect on the Governor . So stay as long as you find any excuse . " Gee ! " says I. " I do n't know whether this is a special holiday , or a sentence to sudden death . But I 'll take a chance , and if the worst happens , Mr. Robert , see that Piddie wears a black armband for me . " He indulges in the first grin he 's had on for a week , and I makes my exit on that . The science of bein ' fresh is to know where to quit . But , say , that wa' n't all guff we was exchangin ' about Old Hickory . I do n't find him tucked away under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the butler , whispers the boss is in the lib'ry , and sort of shunts me in without appearin ' himself . A wise guy , Marston . For here 's Mr. Ellins , wearin ' a padded silk dressin ' gown and old slippers , pacin ' back and forth limpy and lettin ' out grunts and growls at every turn . Talk about your double-distilled grouches ! He looks like he 'd been on a diet of mixed pickles and scrap iron for a month , and hated the whole human race . " Well ? " he snaps as he sees me edgin ' in cautious . " Papers for your O. K , " says I , holdin ' the bunch out at arm 's length . " My O. K. ? " he snarls . " Bah ! Now what the zebra-striped Zacharias do they send those things to me for ? What good am I , anyway , except as a common carrier for all the blinkety blinked aches and pains that ever existed ? A shivery , shaky old lump of clay streaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Sir , " says I , from force of habit . " Eh ? " says he , whirlin ' and snappin ' his jaws . " N-n-no , Sir , " says I , sidesteppin ' behind a chair . " That 's right , " says he . " Dodge and squirm as if I was a wild animal . That 's what they all do . What are you afraid of , Boy ? " " Me ? " says I. " Why , I 'm havin ' the time of my life . I do n't mind . It only sounds natural and homelike . And it 's mostly bluff , ai n't it , Mr. Ellins ? " " Discovered ! " says he . " Ah , the merciless perspicacity of youth ! But do n't tell the others . And put those papers on my desk . " " Yes , Sir , " says I , and after I 've spread ' em out I backs into the bay window and sits down . " Well , what are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says I. " Any errands , Mr. Ellins ? " " Errands ? " says he . Then , after thinkin ' a second , he raps out , " Yes . Do you see that collection of bottles and pills and glasses on the table ? Enough to stock a young drugstore ! And I 've been pouring that truck into my system by wholesale ,  - -  the pink tablets on the half-hour , the white ones on the quarter , a spoonful of that purple liquid on the even hour , two of the greenish mixtures on the odd , and getting worse every day . Bah ! I have n't the courage to do it myself , but by the blue-belted blazes if --  --  See here , Boy ! You 're waiting orders , you say ? " " Uh-huh ! " says I. " Then open that window and throw the whole lot into the areaway , " says he . " Do you mean it , Mr. Ellins ? " says I. " Do I -- yah , do n't I speak plain English ? " he growls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got you , " I breaks in . " Out it goes ! " I do n't drop any of it gentle , either . I slams bottles and glasses down on the flaggin ' and chucks the pills into the next yard . I makes a clean sweep . " Thanks , Torchy , " says he . " The doctor will be here soon . I 'll tell him you did it . " " Go as far as you like , " says I. " Anything else , Sir ? " " Yes , " says he . " Provide me with a temporary occupation . " " Come again , " says I. " I want something to do , " says he . " Here I 've been shut up in this confounded house for four mortal days ! I ca n't read , ca n't eat , ca n't sleep . I just prowl around like a bear with a sore ear . I want something that will make me forget what a wretched , futile old fool I am . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , sir , " says I. " Then think , " says he . " Come , where is that quick-firing , automatic intellect of yours ? Think , Boy ! What would you do if you were shut up like this ? " " Why , " says I , " I -- I might dig up some kind of games , I guess . " " Games ! " says he . " That 's worth considering . Well , here 's some money . Go get ' em . " " But what kind , Sir ? " says I. " How the slithering Sisyphus should I know what kind ? " he snaps . " Whose idea is this , anyway ? You suggested games . Go get ' em , I tell you ! I 'll give you half an hour , while I 'm looking over this stuff from the office . Just half an hour . Get out ! " It 's a perfectly cute proposition , ai n't it ? Games for a heavy-podded old sinner like him , who 's about as frivolous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the new city lib'ry ! But here I was on my way with a yellow-backed twenty in one hand ; so it 's up to me to produce . I pikes straight down the avenue to a joint where they 've got three floors filled with nothin ' but juvenile joy junk , blows in there on the jump , nails a clerk that looks like he had more or less bean , waves the twenty at him , and remarks casual : " Gim me the worth of that in things that 'll amuse a fifty-eight-year-old kid who 's sick abed and walkin ' around the house . " Did I say clerk ? I take it back . He was a salesman , that young gent was . Never raised an eyebrow , but proceeded to haul out samples , pass ' em up to me for inspection , and pile in a heap what I gives him the nod on . If I established a record for reckless buyin ' , he never mentions it . Inside of twenty minutes I 'm on my way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The doctor has come , " says Marston . " He 's in with Mr. Ellins now , Sir . " " Ob , is he ? " says I. " Makes it very nice , do n't it ? " And , bein ' as how I was Old Hickory 's alibi , as you might say , I pikes right to the front . " Here he is now , " says Mr. Ellins . And the Doc , who 's a chesty , short-legged gent with a dome half under glass , you know , sort of a skinned diamond with turf outfield effect ,  - -  he whirls on me accusin ' . " Young man , " says he , " do I understand that you had the impudence to --  --  " " Well , well ! " breaks in Old Hickory , gettin ' a glimpse of what the porter 's unloading " What have we here ? Look , Hirshway ,  - -  Torchy 's drug substitute ! " " Eh ? " says the Doc , starin ' puzzled . " Games , " says Mr. Ellins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toys for a weary toiler . Let 's inspect his selection . Now what 's this in the box , Torchy ? " " Cut-up picture puzzle , " says I. " Two hundred pieces . You fit ' em together . " " Fine ! " says Old Hickory . " And this ? " " Ring toss , " says I. " You try to throw them rope rings over the peg . " " I see , " says he . " Excellent ! That will be very amusing and instructive . Here 's an airgun too . " " Ellins , " says Doc Hirshway , " do you mean to say that at your age you are going to play with such childish things ? " " Why not ? " says Old Hickory . " You forbid business . I must employ myself in some way , and Torchy recommends these . " " Bah ! " says the Doc disgusted . " If I did n't know you so well , I should think your mind was affected . " " Think what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raps back the boss , pokin ' him playful in the ribs . " I 'll bet you a fiver I can put more of these rings over than you can . " " Humph ! " says the Doc . " I 've no time to waste on silly games . " And he stands by watchin ' disapprovin ' while Old Hickory makes an awkward stab at the peg . The nearest he comes to it is when he chucks one through the glass door of a curio cabinet , with a smash that brings the butler tiptoein ' in . " Did you ring , Sir ? " says Marston . " Not a blamed one ! " says Mr. Ellins . " Take it away , Marston . And then unwrap that large package . There ! Now what the tessellated teacups is that ! " It 's something I did n't know anything about myself ; but the young gent at the store had been strong for puttin ' it in , so I 'd let it slide . It 's a tin affair , painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk in it . Some rubber balls and a kind of croquet mallet goes with it . " Indoor golf ! " says Old Hickory , readin ' the instruction pamphlet . " Oh , I see ! A putting green . Set it there on the rug , Marston . Now , let 's see if I 've forgotten how to putt . " We all gathers around while he tries to roll the balls into the cups . Out of six tries he lands just one . Next time he do n't get any at all . " Pooh ! " says the Doc edgin ' up int'rested . " Wretched putting form , Ellins , wretched ! Do n't tap it that way : sweep it along -- -follow through , with your right elbow out . Here , let me show you ! " But Hirshway do n't do much better . He manages to get two in ; but one was a rank scratch . " Ho-ho ! " cackles Old Hickory . " Is n't so easy as it looks , eh , Hirshway ? Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I beat you . " " I take you , " says the Doc . And blamed if Old Hickory do n't pull down the money ! Well , that 's what started things . Next I knew they 'd laid out a regular golf course , drivin ' off from the rug in front of the desk , through the double doors into the drawin ' room , then across the hall into the music room , around the grand piano to the left , through the back hall , into the lib'ry once more , and onto the tin green . Marston is sent to dig out a couple sets of old golf clubs from the attic , and he is put to caddyin ' for the Doc , while I carries the bag for the boss . Course they was usin ' putters mostly , except for fancy loftin ' strokes over bunkers that they 'd built out of books and sofa pillows . And as the balls was softer than the regulation golf kind , with more bounce to ' em , all sorts of carom strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " announces Old Hickory . " All pieces of furniture are natural hazards . " " Agreed , " says the Doc . " Playing stimies too , I suppose ? " " Stimies go , " says the boss . Say , maybe that wa' n't some batty performance , with them two old duffers golfin ' all over the first floor of a Fifth-ave. house , disputin ' about strokes , pokin ' balls out from under tables and sofas , and me and Marston followin ' along with the bags . They got as excited over it as if they 'd been playin ' for the International Championship , and when Old Hickory loses four strokes by gettin ' his ball wedged in a corner he cuts loose with the real golfy language . We was just finishin ' the first round , with the score standin ' fourteen to seventeen in favor of the Doc , when the front doorbell rings and a maid comes towin ' in Piddie . Maybe his eyes do n't stick out some too , as he takes in the scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for position in front of the green and he do n't pay any attention . " It 's Mr. Piddie , Sir , " says I. " Hang Mr. Piddie ! " says Old Hickory . " I ca n't see him now . " " But it 's very important , " says Piddie . " There 's someone at the office who --  --  " " No , no , not now ! " snaps the boss impatient . And I gives Piddie the back-out signal . But you know how much sense he 's got . " I assure you , Mr. Ellins , " he goes on , " that this is --  --  " " S-s-s-st ! " says I. " Boom-boom ! Outside ! " and I jerks my thumb towards the door . That settles Piddie . He fades . A minute later Old Hickory gets a lucky carom off a chair leg and holes out in nineteen , with the Doc playin ' twenty-one . " Ha , ha ! " chuckled the boss . " What 's the matter with my form now , Hirshway ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Doc was sore and eager to get back . They wa' n't much more'n fairly started , though , before there 's other arrivals , that turns out to be no less than two of our directors , lookin ' serious and worried . " Mr. Rawson and Mr. Dunham , " announces the maid . " Here , Boy ! " says the boss , catchin ' me by the elbow . " What was that you said to Mr. Piddie ,  - -  that ' Boom-boom ! ' greeting ? " I gives it to him and the Doc in a stage whisper . " Good ! " says he . " Get that , Hirshway ? Now let 's spring it on ' em . All together now -- S-s-s-st ! Boom-boom ! Outside ! " Say , it makes a hit with the directors , all right . First off they did n't seem to know whether they 'd strayed into a bughouse , or were just bein ' cheered ; but when they sees Old Hickory 's mouth corners they concludes to take it as a josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf cranks too , and inside of three minutes they 've forgot whatever it was they 'd come for , they 've shed their coats , and have been rung into a foursome . Honest , of all the nutty performances ! For there was no tellin ' where them balls would roll to , and wherever they went the giddy old boys had to follow . I remember one of ' em was stretched out full length on his tummy in the front hall , tryin ' to make a billiard shot from under a low hall seat , when there 's another ring at the bell , and Marston , with a golf bag still slung over his shoulder , lets in a square-jawed , heavy-set old gent who glares around like he was lookin ' for trouble and would be disappointed if he did n't find it . " Mr. Peter K. Groff , " announces Marston . " Good night ! " says I to myself . " The enemy is in our midst . " But Old Hickory never turns a hair . He stands there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old minin ' plute , and then I sees a kind of cut-up twinkle flash in them deep-set eyes of his as he summons his foursome to gather around . I did n't know what was coming either , until they cuts loose with it . And for havin ' had no practice they rips it out strong . " S-s-s-st ! Boom-boom ! Outside ! " comes the chorus . It gets Peter K. 's goat too . His jaw comes open and his eyes pop . Next he swallows bard and flushes red behind the ears . " Ellins , " says he , " I 've come fifteen hundred miles to ask what you mean by telling me --  --  " " Oh , that you , Groff ? " breaks in the boss . " Well , do n't interrupt our game . Fore ! You , I mean . Fore , there ! Now go ahead , Rawson . Playing eleven , are n't you ? " And Rawson 's just poked his ball out , makin ' a neat carom into the music room , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " exclaims Doc Hirshway . " Sorry , but I must quit . Should have been in my office an hour ago . I really must go . " " Quitter ! " says Mr. Ellins . " But all right . Trot along . Here , Groff , you 're a golfer , are n't you ? " " Why -- er -- yes , " says Peter K. , actin ' sort of dazed ; " but I --  --  " " That 's enough , " says Old Hickory . " You take Hirshway 's place . Dunham 's your partner . We 're playing Nassau , ten a corner . But I 'll tell you ,  - -  just to make it interesting , I 'll play you on the side to see whether or not we accept that proposition of yours . Is it a go ? " " But see here , Ellins , " conies back Peter K. " I want you to understand that you or any other man ca n't tell me to sew my head in a bag without --  --  " " Oh , drop that ! " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ought to know that . And if you can beat me at this game I 'll agree to let you have your own way out there . Are you on , or are you too much of a dub to try it ? " " Maybe I am a dub , Hickory Ellins , " says Peter K. , peelin ' off his coat , " but any game that you can play -- er --  --  Which is my ball ? " Well , it was some warm contest , believe me , with them two joshin ' back and forth , and at the game time usin ' as much foxy strategy as if they was stealin ' railroads away from each other ! They must have been at it for near half an hour when a maid slips in and whispers how Mr. Robert is callin ' for me on the wire . So I puts her on to sub for me with the bag while I slides into the ' phone booth . " Sure , Mr. Robert , " says I , " I 'm still on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he . " Did n't Groff come up ? " " Yep , " says I. " He 's here yet . " " You do n't say ! " says Mr. Robert . " Whe-e-ew ! He and the governor having it hot and heavy , I suppose ? " " And then some , " says I. " Peter K. took first round 12-17 , he tied the second , and now he 's trapped in the fireplace on a bad ten . " " Wha-a-at ? " gasps Mr. Robert . " Uh-huh , " says I. " Mr. Ellins is layin ' under the piano ,  - -  only seven , but stimied for an approach . " " In Heaven 's name , Torchy , " says Mr. Robert , " what do you mean ? Mr. Groff trapped in the fireplace , father lying under the piano -- why --  --  " " Ah , did n't Piddie tell you ? The boob ! " says I. " It 's just golf , that 's all -- indoor kind -- a batty variation that they made up themselves . But do n't fret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saved . Come up and look ' em over . " Yep ! Peter K. got the decision by slipping over a smear in the fourth , after which him and Old Hickory leans up against each other and laughs until their eyes leak . Then Marston wheels in the tea wagon full of decanters and club soda , and when I left they was clinkin ' glasses real chummy . " Son , " says Old Hickory , as he pads into the office about noon next day , " I believe I forgot the usual caddie fee . There you are . " " Z-z-z-zing ! " says I , starin ' after him . Cute little strips of Treasury kale , them with the C 's in the corners , are n't they ? Well , I should worry ! CHAPTER VII COMING IN ON THE DRAW Nothin ' like bein ' a handy man around the shop . Here at the Corrugated I 'm worked in for almost any old thing , from seein ' that Mr. Ellins takes his gout tablets regular , to arrangin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to subbin ' for Mr. Robert -- say , what do you guess is the latest act he bills me for ? Art expert ! Yep , A-r-t , with a big A ! Sounds foolish , do n't it ? But at that it wa' n't such a bad hunch on his part . He 's a rash promiser , Mr. Robert is ; but a shifty proposition when you try to push a programme on him , for the first thing you know he 's slid from under . I suspicioned some play like that was comin ' here the other afternoon when Sister Marjorie shows up at the general offices and asks pouty , " Where 's Robert ? " " On the job , " says I. " Session of the general sales agents today , you know . " " But he was to meet me at the Broadway entrance half an hour ago , " says she , " and I 've been sitting in the car waiting for him . Call him out , wo n't you , Torchy ? " " Wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's booked up for the rest of the day . " " The idea ! " says Marjorie . " And he promised faithfully he would go up with me to see those pictures ! You just tell him I 'm here , that 's all . " There 's more or less light of battle in them bright brown eyes of Marjorie 's , and that Ellins chin of hers is set some solid . So when I tiptoes in where they 're dividin ' the map of the world into sellin ' areas , and whispers in Mr. Robert 's ear that Sister Marjorie is waitin ' outside , I adds a word of warnin ' . " It 's a case of pictures , you remember , " says I. " Oh , the deuce ! " says Mr. Robert . " Hang Brooks Bladen and his paintings ! I ca n't go , positively . Just explain , will you , Torchy ? " " Sure ; but I 'd go hoarse over it , " says I. " You know Marjorie , and if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better come out and face the music . " " Oh , well , then I suppose I must , " says he , leadin ' the way . And Marjorie wa' n't in the mood to stand for any smooth excuses . She did n't care if he had forgotten , and she guessed his old business affairs could be put off an hour or so . Besides , this meant so much to poor Brooks . His very first exhibit , too . Ferdy could n't go , either . Another one of his sick headaches . But he had promised to buy a picture , and Marjorie had hoped that Robert would like one of them well enough to --  --  " Oh , if that 's all , " puts in Mr. Robert , " then tell him I 'll take one , too . " " But you ca n't buy pictures without seeing them , " protests Marjorie . " Brooks is too sensitive . He wants appreciation , encouragement , you see . " " A lot I could give him , " says Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sort of thing than -- well , than --  --  " And just here his eye lights on me . " Oh , I say , though , " he goes on , " it would be all right , would n't it , if I sent a -- er -- a commissioner ? " " I suppose that would do , " says Marjorie . " Good ! " says Mr. Robert . " Torchy , go with Marjorie and look at that lot . If they 're any good , buy one for me . " " Wha-a-at ! " says I. " Me buy a picture ? " " Full power , " says he , startin ' back towards the meetin ' . " Pick out the best , and tell Bladen to send me the bill . " And there we 're left , Marjorie and me , lookin ' foolish at each other . " Well , he 's done a duck , " says I. " If you mean he 's got himself out of buying a picture , you 're mistaken , " says she . " Come along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Course , I tries to show her , all the way up in the limousine , how punk a performer I 'd be at a game like that , and how they 'd spot me for a bush leaguer the first stab I made . " Not at all , " says Marjorie , " if you do as I tell you . " With that she proceeds to coach me in the art critic business . The lines wa' n't hard to get , anyway . " For some of them , " she goes on , " you merely go ' Um-m-m ! ' under your breath , you know , or ' Ah-h-h-h ! ' to yourself . Then when I give you a nudge you may exclaim , ' Fine feeling ! ' or ' Very daring ! ' or ' Wonderful technic , wonderful ! ' " " Yes ; but when must I say which ? " says I. " It does n't matter in the least , " says Marjorie . " And you think just them few remarks , " says I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an entire exhibit at the National Academy , " says she . " And when you decide which you like best , just point it out to Mr. Bladen . " " Gee ! " says I. " Suppose I pick a lemon ? " " Robert wo n't know the difference , " says she , " and it will serve him right . Besides , poor Brooks needs the encouragement . " " Kind of a dub beginner with no backing is he ? " says I. Marjorie describes him different . Accordin ' to her , he 's a classy comer in the art line , with all kinds of talent up his sleeve and Fame busy just around the corner on a laurel wreath exactly his size . Seems Brooks was from a good fam'ly that had dropped their bundle somewhere along the road ; so this art racket that he 'd taken up as a time killer he 'd had to turn into a steady job . He wa' n't paintin ' just to keep his brushes soft . He was out to win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that before she hooked up with Ferdy , the head-achy one , Marjorie had been some mushy over Brooks boy herself . He 'd done a full length of her , it appears , and was workin ' up quite a portrait trade , when all of a sudden he ups and marries someone else , a rank outsider . " Too bad ! " sighs Marjorie . " It has sadly interfered with his career , I 'm afraid . " " Ai n't drivin ' him to sign work , is it ? " says I. " Goodness , no ! " says Marjorie . " Just the opposite . Of course , Edith was a poor girl ; but her Uncle Jeff is ever so rich . They live with him , you know . That 's the trouble -- Uncle Jeff . " She 's a little vague about this Uncle Jeff business ; but it helps explain why we roll up to a perfectly good marble front detached house just off Riverside Drive , instead of stoppin ' at one of them studio rookeries over on Columbus-ave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' young artists do n't have a butler on the door unless there 's something like an Uncle Jeff in the fam'ly . From the dozen or more cars and taxis hung up along the block I judge this must be a regular card affair , with tea and sandwich trimmin 's . It 's a good guess . A maid tows us up two flights , though , before we 're asked to shed anything ; and before we lands Marjorie is gaspin ' some , for she ai n't lost any weight since she collected Ferdy . Quite a studio effect they 'd made too , by throwin ' a couple of servants ' rooms into one and addin ' a big skylight . There was the regulation fishnet draped around , and some pieces of tin armor and plaster casts , which proves as well as a court affidavit that here 's where the real , sure-fire skookum creative genius holds forth . It 's a giddy bunch of lady gushers that 's got together there too , and the soulful chatter is bein ' put over so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm introduced proper to Brooks boy and Wifey ; but I 'd picked ' em both out at first glimpse . No mistakin ' him . He 's got on the kind of costume that goes with the fishnet and brass tea machine ,  - -  flowin ' tie , velvet coat , baggy trousers , and all , even to the Vandyke beard . It 's kind of a pale , mud-colored set of face alfalfa ; but , then , Brooks boy is sort of that kind himself -- that is , all but his eyes . They 're a wide-set , dreamy , baby-blue pair of lamps , that beams mild and good-natured on everyone . But Mrs. Brooks Bladen is got up even more arty than Hubby . Maybe it wa' n't sugar sackin ' or furniture burlap , but that 's what the stuff looked like . It 's gathered jaunty just under her armpits and hangs in long folds to the floor , with a thick rope of yellow silk knotted careless at one side with the tassels danglin ' below her knee , while around her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinched off from a Christmas tree . She 's a tall , willowy young woman , who waves her bare arms around vivacious when she talks and has lots of sparkle to her eyes . " You dear child ! " is her greetin ' to Marjorie . " So sweet of you to attempt all those dreadful stairs ! No , do n't try to talk yet . We understand , do n't we , Brooks ? Nice you 're not sensitive about it , too . " I caught the glare Marjorie shoots over , and for a minute I figured how the picture buyin ' deal had been queered at the start ; but the next thing I knew Brooks boy is holdin ' Marjorie 's hand and beamin ' gentle on her , and she is showin ' all her dimples once more . Say , they 're worth watchin ' , some of these fluff encounters . My act ? Ah , say , most of that good dope is all wasted . Nobody seems excited over the fact that I 've arrived , even Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , I judge . Do n't tout up his stuff any , or try to shove off any seconds or shopworn pieces . He just tells me to look around , and half apologizes for his line in advance . Well , for real hand-painted stuff it was kind of tame . None of this snowy-mountain-peak or mirror-lake business , such as you see in the department stores . It 's just North River scenes ; some clear , some smoky , some lookin ' up , some lookin ' down , and some just across . In one he 'd done a Port Lee ferryboat pretty fair ; but there 's another that strikes me harder . It shows a curve in the drive , with one of them green motor busses goin ' by , the top loaded , and off in the background to one side the Palisades loomin ' up against a fair-weather sunset , while in the middle you can see clear up to Yonkers . Honest , it 's almost as good as some of them things on the insurance calendars , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marjorie drifts along . " Well ? " says he , sort of inquirin ' . " That must be one of the Albany night boats goin ' up , " says I. " She 'll be turnin ' her lights on pretty quick . And it 's goin ' to be a corkin ' evenin ' for a river trip . You can tell that by --  --  " But just here Marjorie gives me a jab with her elbow . " Ow , yes ! " says I , rememberin ' my lines . " Um-m-m-m-m ! Fine feelin ' . Very darin ' too , very ! And when it comes to the tech stuff -- why , it 's there in clusters . Much obliged -- er -- that is , I guess you can send this one . Mr. Robert Ellins . That 's right . Charge and send . " Maybe he was n't used to makin ' such quick sales ; for he stares at me sort of puzzled , and when I turns to Marjorie she 's all pinked up like a strawberry sundae and is smotherin ' a giggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . Strikes me I 'd put it over kind of smooth ; but as there seems to be a slip somewhere it 's me for the rapid back-away . " Thanks , that 'll be all to-day , " I goes on , " and -- and I 'll be waitin ' downstairs , Marjorie . " She do n't stop me ; so I pushes through the mob at the tea table , collects my coat and lid , and slips down to the first floor , where I wanders into the drawin ' room . No arty decorations here . Instead of pictures and plaster casts , the walls are hung with all kinds of mounted heads and horns , and the floor is covered with odd-lookin ' skin rugs ,  - -  tigers , lions , and such . I 'd been waitin ' there sometime , inspectin ' the still life menagerie , when all of a sudden in from the hall rolls one of these invalid wheeled chairs with a funny little old bald-headed gent manipulatin ' levers . What hair he has left is real white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of close-cropped white whiskers ; but under the frosty shrubb'ry , as well as over all the bare space , he 's colored up as bright as a bottle of maraschino cherries . It 's the sort of sunburn a sandy complexion gets on ; but not in a month or a year . You know ? One of these blond Eskimo tints , that seems to go clear through the skin . How he could get it in a wheel chair , though , I could n't figure out . Anyway , there was n't time . Quick as he sees me he throws in his reverse gear and comes to a stop between the portieres . " Well , young man , " he raps out sharp and snappy , " who the particular blazes are you ? " But , say , I 've met too many peevish old parties to let a little jab like that tie up my tongue . " Me ? " says I , settin ' back easy in the armchair . " Oh , I 'm a buyer representin ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he . " Art , " says I. " Just picked up a small lot ,  - -  that one with the Albany night boat in it , you know . " He stares like he thought I was batty , and then rolls his chair over closer . " Do I understand , " says he , " that you have been buying a picture -- here ? " " Sure , " says I. " Say , ai n't you on yet , and you right in the house ? Well , you ought to get next . " " I mean to , " says he . " Bladen 's stuff , I suppose ? " " Uh-huh , " says I. " And , believe me , Brooksy is some paint slinger ; that is , fine feelin ' , darin ' technic , all that sort of dope . " " I see , " says he , noddin ' his head . " Holding a sale , is he ? On one of the upper floors ? " " Top , " says I. " Quite a classy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , he has , has he ? " says the old boy , snappin ' his eyes . " Well , of all the confounded -- er -- young man , ring that bell ! " Say , how was I goin ' to know ? I was beginnin ' to suspect that this chatty streak of mine wa' n't goin ' to turn out lucky for someone ; but it 's gone too far to hedge . I pushes the button , and in comes the butler . " Tupper , " says the old man , glarin ' at him shrewd , " you know where the top-floor studio is , do n't you ? " " Ye-e-es , Sir , " says Tapper , almost chokin ' over it . " You 'll find Mr. and Mrs. Bladen there , " goes on old Grouchy . " Ask them to step down here for a moment at once . " Listened sort of mussy from where I sat , and I wa' n't findin ' the armchair quite so comf'table . " Guess I 'll be loafin ' along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just where you are for the present ! " says he , wheelin ' himself across the door-way . " Oh , well , if you insist , " says I. He did . And for two minutes there I listens to the clock tick and watches the old sport 's white whiskers grow bristly . Then comes the Bladens . He waves ' em to a parade rest opposite me . " What is it , Uncle Jeff ? " says Mrs. Bladen , sort of anxious . And with that I begins to piece out the puzzle . This was Uncle Jeff , eh , the one with the bank account ? " So , " he explodes , like openin' ' a bottle of root beer , " you 've gone back to your paint daubing , have you ? And you 're actually trying to sell your namby-pamby stuff on my top floor ? Come now , Edith , let 's hear you squirm out of that ! " Considerable fussed , Edith is . No wonder ! After one glance at me she flushes up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothin ' in the way of a not guilty plea seems to occur to her . As for Hubby , he blinks them mild eyes of his a couple of times , and then stands there placid with both hands in the pockets of his velvet coat , showin ' no deep emotion at all . " It 's so , is n't it ? " demands Uncle . " Ye-e-es , Uncle Jeff , " admits Edith . " But poor Brooks could do nothing else , you know . If he 'd taken a studio outside , you would have wanted to know where he was . And those rooms were not in use . Really , what else could he do ? " " Mean to tell me he could n't get along without puttering around with those fool paints and brushes ? " snorts Uncle Jeff . " It -- it 's his life work , Uncle Jeff , " says Mrs. Bladen . " Rubbish ! " says the old boy . " In the first place , it is n't work . Might be for a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know my sentiments on that point well enough . In the second place , when I asked you two to come and live with me , there was no longer any need for him to do that sort of thing . And you understood that too . " Edith sighs and nods her head . " But still he goes on with his sissy paint daubing ! " says Uncle . " They 're not daubs ! " flashes back Edith . " Brooks has been doing some perfectly splendid work . Everyone says so . " " Humph ! " says Uncle Jeff . " That 's what your silly friends tell you . But it does n't matter . I wo n't have him doing it in my house . You thought , just because I was crippled and could n't get around or out of these confounded four rooms , that you could fool me . But you ca n't , you see . And now I 'm going to give you and Brooks your choice ,  - -  either he stops painting , or out you both go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir , " says Brooks , speakin ' up prompt but pleasant , " if that is the way you feel about it , we shall go . " " Eh ? " says Uncle Jeff , squintin ' hard at him . " Do you mean it ? Want to leave all this for -- for the one mean little room I found you in ! " " Under your conditions , most certainly , Sir , " says Brooks . " I think Edith feels as I do . Do n't you , Edith ? " " Ye-e-es , of course , " says Mrs. Bladen . Then , turnin ' on Uncle Jeff , " Only I think you are a mean , hard-hearted old man , even if you are my uncle ! Oh , you do n't know how often I 've wanted to tell you so too ,  - -  always prying into this , asking questions about that , finding fault , forever cross and snappish and suspicious . A waspish , crabbed old wretch , that 's what you are ! I just hate you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these last jabs ; but he only turns to Brooks and asks quiet , " And I suppose those are your sentiments too ? " " Edith is a little overwrought , " says Brooks . " It 's true enough that you 're not quite an agreeable person to live with . Still , I hardly feel that I have treated you just right in this matter . I should n't have deceived you about the studio . When I found that I could n't bear to give up my work and live like a loafer on your money , I should have told you so outright . I have n't liked it , Sir , all this dodging and twisting of the truth . I 'm glad it 's over . Would you prefer to have us go tonight or in the morning ? " " Come now , that 's not the point , " says Uncle Jeff . " You hate me , too , do n't you ? " " No , " says Brooks , " and I 'm sure Edith does n't either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Edith . Brooks shrugs his shoulders sort of hopeless . " In that case , " says he , " we shall leave at once -- now . I will send around for our traps later . You have been very generous , and I 'm afraid I 've shown myself up for an ungrateful ass , if not worse . Goodby , Sir . " He stands there holdin ' out his hand , with the old gent starin ' hard at him and not movin ' . Fin'lly Uncle Jeff breaks the spell . " Well , I 'll be hanged ! " says he . " Bladen , I did n't think it was in you . I took you for one of the milksop kind ; which shows just how big a fool an old fool can be . And Edith is right . I 'm a crazy , quarrelsome old wretch . It is n't all rheumatism , either . Some of it is disposition . And do n't you go away thinking I 've been generous , trying to tie you two young people down this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how hard it comes , being shut up like this and able only to move around on wheels -- after the life I 've led too ! I suppose I ought to be satisfied . I 've had my share -- nearly thirty years on the go , in jungle , forest , mountains , all over the globe . I 've hunted big game in every -- but you know all about that . And now I suppose I 'm worn out , useless . I was trying to get used to it , and having you young folks around has helped a lot . But it has n't been fair to you -- not fair . " He sort of chokes up at the end , and his lower lip trembles some ; but only for a second . He straightens up once more in his chair . " You must try to make allowances , Edith , " he goes on . " Don't -- do n't hate the old wretch too hard ! " That got to her , all right . She ' wa' n't gush all the way through , any more'n Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was givin ' him the fond tackle and sobbin ' against his vest . " There , there ! " says he , pattin ' her soothin ' . " We all make our mistakes , old and young ; only us old fellows ought to know better . " " But -- but they are n't daubs ! " sobs out Edith . " And -- and you said they were , without even seeing them . " " Just like me , " says he . " And I 'm no judge , anyway . But perhaps I 'd better take a look at some of them . How would that be , eh ? Could n't Tupper bring a couple of them down now ? " " Oh , may he ? " says Edith , brightenin ' up and turnin ' off the sprayer . " I have wished that you could see them , you know . " So Tupper is sent for a couple of paintings , and Brooks chases along to bring down two more . They ranges ' em on chairs , and wheels Uncle Jeff into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tries hard to work up some enthusiasm . " Ferryboats , sugar refineries , and the North River , " says he . " All looks natural enough . I suppose they 're well done too ; but -- but see here , young man , could n't you find anything better to paint ? " " Where ? " says Brooks . " You see , I was able to get out only occasionally without --  --  " " I see , " says Uncle Jeff . " Tied to a cranky old man in a wheel chair . But , by George ! I could take you to places worth wasting your paint on . Ever heard of Yangarook ? There 's a pink mountain there that rises up out of a lake , and on still mornings -- well , you ought to see it ! I pitched my camp there once for a fortnight . I could find it again . You go in from Boola Bay , up the Zambesi , and through the jungle . Then there 's the Khula Klaht valley . That 's in the Himalayas . Pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've no doubt I could , Sir , " says Brooks . " I 've dreamed of doing something like that some day , too . But what 's the use ? " " Eh ? " says Uncle Jeff , almost standin ' up in his excitement . " Why not , my boy ? I could take you there , chair or no chair . Did n't I go in a litter once , halfway across Africa , when a clumsy Zulu beater let a dying rhino gore me in the hip ? Yes , and bossed a caravan of sixty men , and me flat on my back ! I 'm better able to move now than I was then , too . And I 'm ready to try it . Another year of this , and I 'd be under the ground . I 'm sick of being cooped up . I 'm hungry for a breath of mountain air , for a glimpse of the old trails . No use taking my guns ; but you could lug along your painting kit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could start within a week . What do you say , you two ? " Brooks he looks over at Edith . " Oh , Uncle Jeff ! " says she , her eyes sparklin ' . " I should just love it ! " " I could ask for nothing better , " says Brooks . " Then it 's settled , " says Uncle Jeff , reachin ' out a hand to each of ' em . " Hurrah for the long trail ! We 're off ! " " Me too , " says I , " if that 's all . " " Ah ! " says Uncle Jeff . " Our young friend who 's at the bottom of the whole of this . Here , Sir ! I 'm going to teach you a lesson that will make you cautious about gossiping with strange old men . Pick up that leopard skin at your feet . " " Yes , Sir , " says I , holdin ' it out to him . " No , examine it carefully , " says he . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shores of Lake Tanganyika . It 's the finest specimen of the kind in my whole collection . Throw it over your arm , you young scamp , and get along with you ! " And they 're all grinnin ' amiable as I backs out with my mouth open . " What the deuce ! " says Mr. Robert after lunch next day , as he gazes first at a big package a special messenger has just left , and then at a note which comes with it . " ' The Palisades at Dusk ' five hundred dollars ? " " Gee ! " I gasps . " Did he sting you that hard ? " " But it 's receipted , " says he , " with the compliments of Brooks Bladen . What does that mean ? " " Means I 'm some buyer , I guess , " says I. " Souvenir of a little fam'ly reunion I started , that 's all . But you ai n't the only one . Wait till you see what I drew from Uncle Jeff . " CHAPTER VIII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert did ; but , say , between you and me , he come blamed near spillin ' the beans . Course , I could see by the squint to his eyelids that he 's about to make what passes with him for a comic openin' ' . " I hate to do it , Torchy , " says he , " especially on such a fine afternoon as this . " " Go on , " says I , " throw the harpoon ! Got your yachtin ' cap on , ai n't you ? Well , have I got to sub for you at a directors ' meeting or what ? " " Worse than that , " says he . " You see , Marjorie and Ferdy are having a veranda tea this afternoon , up at their country house . " " Help ! " says I. " But you ai n't billin ' me for any such --  --  " " Oh , not exactly that , " says he . " They can get along very well without me , and I shall merely ' phone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his new forty-footer . But there remains little Gladys . I 'd promised to bring her out with me when I came . " " Ye-e-e-es ? " says I doubtful . " She 's a little joker , eh ? " " Why , not at all , " says he . " Merely a young school friend of Marjorie 's . Used to be in the kindergarten class when Marjorie was a senior , and took a great fancy to her , as little girls sometimes do to older ones , you know . " Also it seems little Gladys had been spendin ' a night or so with another young friend in town , and someone had to round her up and deliver her at the tea , where her folks would be waitin ' for her . " So I 'm to take her by the hand and tow her up by train , am I ? " says I. " I had planned , " says Mr. Robert , shakin ' his head solemn , " to have you go up in the machine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it -- Miss Vee , by the way . Sure it would n't bore you ? " " Z-z-z-ing ! " says I. " Say , if it does you 'll never hear about it , believe me ! " Mr. Robert chuckles . " Then take good care of little Gladys , " says he . " Wo n't I , though ! " says I. " I 'll tell her fairy tales and feed her stick candy all the way up . " Honest , I did blow in a quarter on fancy pink gumdrops as I 'm passin ' through the arcade ; but when I strolls out to the limousine Martin touches his hat so respectful that I gives him a dip into the first bag . " Got your sailin ' orders , ai n't you , Martin ? " says I. " You know we collect a kid first . " " Oh , yes , Sir , " says he . " Madison avenue . I have the number , Sir . " Just like that you know . " I have the number , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore , ai n't it , specially right there on Broadway with so many folks to hear ? " Very well , " says I , languid . Then it 's me lollin ' back on the limousine cushions and starin ' haughty at the poor dubs we graze by as they try to cross the street . Gee , but it 's some different when you 're inside gazin ' out , than when you 're outside gawpin ' in ! And even if you do n't have the habit reg'lar , but are only there just for the time bein ' , you 're bound to get that chesty feelin ' more or less . I always do . About the third block I can look slant-eyed at the cheap skates ridin ' in hired taxis and curl the lip of scorn . I 've noticed , though , that when I work up feelin 's like that there 's bound to be a bump comin ' to me soon . But I was n't lookin ' for this one until it landed . Martin pulls up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , and rings the bell . " Little Miss Gladys ready ? " says I to the maid . She sort of humps her eyebrows and remarks that she 'll see . With that she waves me into the reception hall , and pretty soon comes back to report that Miss Gladys will be down in a few minutes . She had the real skirt notion of time , that maid . For more'n a solid half-hour I squirms around on a chair wonderin ' what could be happenin ' up in the nursery . Then all of a sudden a chatter of goodbys comes from the upper hall , a maid trots down and hands me a suitcase , and then appears this languishin ' vision in the zippy French lid and the draped silk wrap . It 's one of these dinky brimless affairs , with skyrocket trimmin ' on the back , and it fits down over her face like a mush bowl over Baby Brother ; but under the rim you could detect some chemical blonde hair and a pair of pink ears ornamented with pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complexion to match , one of the kind that 's laid on in layers , with the drugstore red only showing through the whitewash in spots , and the lips touched up brilliant . Believe me , it was some artistic makeup ! Illustration : Believe me , it was some artistic makeup ! Course , I frames this up for the friend ; so I asks innocent , " Excuse me , but when is little Miss Gladys comin ' ? " " Why , I 'm Gladys ! " comes from between the carmine streaks . I gawps at her , then at the maid , and then back at the Ziegfeld vision again . " But , see here ! " I goes on . " Mr. Robert he says how --  --  " " Yes , I know , " she breaks in . " He ' phoned . The stupid old thing could n't come himself , and he 's sent one of his young men . That 's much nicer . Torchy , did n't he say ? How odd ! But come along . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do my hair this way again sometime . " And next thing I know I 'm helpin ' her into the car , while Martin tries to smother a grin . " There you are ! " says I , chuckin ' her suitcase in after her . " I -- I guess I 'll ride in front . " " What ! " says she . " And leave me to take that long ride all alone ? I 'll not do it . Come in here at once , or I 'll not go a step ! Come ! " No shrinking violet about Gladys , and as I climbs in I shakes loose the last of that kindergarten dope I 'd been primed with . I 'll admit I was some fussed for awhile too , and I expect I does the dummy act , sittin ' there gazin ' into the limousine mirror where she 's reflected vivid . I was tryin ' to size her up and decide whether she really was one of the chicken ballet , or only a high school imitation . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has the same chance of watchin ' me . " Well ? " says she , as we swings into Central Park . " I trust you approve ? " " Eh ? " says I , comin ' out of the trance . " Oh , I get you now . You 're waitin ' for the applause . Let 's see , are you on at the Winter Garden , or is it the Casino roof ? " " Now do n't be rude , " says she . " Whatever made you think I 'd been on the stage ? " " I was only judgin ' by the get-up , " says I. " It 's fancy , all right . " " Pooh ! " says she . " I 've merely had my hair done the new way . I think it 's perfectly dear too . There 's just one little touch , though , that Marie did n't quite get . I wonder if I couldn't -- you 'll not care if I try , will you ? " " Oh , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd already yanked out three or four hatpins and has pried off the zippy lid . " There , hold that , will you ? " says she , crowdin ' over into the middle of the seat so 's to get a good view in the mirror , and beginnin ' to revise the scenic effect on her head . Near as I can make out , the hair do n't come near enough to meetin ' her eyebrows in front or to coverin ' her ears on the side . Meanwhile she goes on chatty , " I suppose Mother 'll be wild again when she sees me like this . She always does make such a row if I do anything different . There was an awful scene the first time I had my hair touched up . Fancy ! " " I was wonderin ' if that was the natural tint ? " says I. " Goodness , no ! " says Gladys . " It was a horrid brown . And when I used to go to the seminary they made me wear it braided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a sight ! The seminary was a stupid place , though . I was always breaking some of their silly rules ; so Mummah sent me to the convent . That was better . Such a jolly lot of girls there , some whose mothers were great actresses . And just think -- two of my best chums have gone on the stage since ! One of them was married and divorced the very first season too . Now was n't that thrilling ? Mother is furious because she still writes to me . How absurd ! And some of the others she wo n't allow me to invite to the house . But we meet now and then , just the same . There were two in our box party last night , and we had such a ripping lark afterward ! " Gladys was runnin ' on as confidential as if she 'd known me all her life , interruptin ' the flow only when she makes a jab with the powder-puff and uses the eyebrow pencil . And bein ' as how I 'd been cast for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tucks one into the off side of my face . The move do n't escape her , though . " Candy ? " says she , sniffin ' . " Sorry I ca n't offer you a cigarette , " says I , holdin ' out the bag . " Humph ! " says she . " I have smoked them , though . M-m-m-m ! Gumdrops ! You dear boy ! " Yes , Gladys and me had a real chummy time of it durin ' that hour 's drive , and I notice she put away her share of the candy just as enthusiastic as if she 'd been a kid in short dresses . As a matter of fact , she acts and talks like any gushy sixteen-year-old . That 's about what she is , I discovers ; though I would n't have guessed it if she had n't let it out herself . But , say , she 's some wise for her years , little Gladys is , or else she 's a good bluffer ! She had me holdin ' my breath more'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd seen all the ripe problem plays , was posted on the doin 's of the Reno colony , and read the Robert Chambers stuff as fast as it came out . And all the time she talks she 's goin ' through target practice with her eyes , usin ' me as the mark . A lively pair of lamps Gladys has too , the big , innocent , baby-blue kind that sort of opens up wide and kind of invites you to gaze into the depths until you get dizzy . Them and the little , openin' ' rosebud mouth makes a strong combination , and if it had n't been for the mural decorations I might have fallen hard for Gladys ; but ever since I leaned up against a shiny letterbox once I 've been shy of fresh paint . So I proceeds to hand out the defensive josh . " Roll ' em away , Sis , " says I , " roll ' em the other way ! " " Pooh ! " says she . " Ca n't a person even look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition , " says I. " You ca n't put any spell on me , you know . " " Oh , really ! " says she , rakin ' me with a quick broadside . " Do you mean that you do n't like me at all ? " " Since you 've called for it , " says I , " I 'll admit I ai n't strong for these spotlight color schemes , specially on kids . " " Kids ! " she sputters . " I think you 're perfectly horrid , so there ! " " Stick to it , " says I. " Makes me feel better satisfied with myself . " " Redhead ! " says she , runnin ' her tongue out . " Yes , clear to the roots , " says I , " and the tint did n't come out of a bottle , either . " " I do n't care , " says she . " All the girls do it . " " Your bunch , maybe , " says I ; " but there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , " says she . " I 'm glad you like that kind . You 're as bad as Mummah . " " Is that the worst you can say of me ? " says I. " How that would please Mother ! " Oh , sure , quite a homelike little spat we had , passin ' the left handers back and forth -- and inside of five minutes she has made it all up again and is holdin ' out her hand for the last gumdrop . " You 're silly ; but you 're rather nice , after all , " says she , poutin ' her lips at me . " Now quit that , " says I. " I got my fingers crossed . " " ' Fraid cat ! " says she . " But here 's the house , and we 're frightfully early . Now do n't act as though you thought I might bite you . I 'm going to take your arm . " She does too , and cuddles up kittenish as we lands at the porte cochere . I gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of a little group over by the front door , and she wants to make a showy entrance . And who do you guess it is we finds arrangin ' the flower vases ? Oh , only Marjorie and Miss Vee . Here I am too , with giddy Gladys , the imitation front row girl , clingin ' tight to my right wing . You should have seen Vee 's eyebrows go up , also Marjorie 's stare . It 's a minute or so before she recognizes our little friend , and stands there lookin ' puzzled at us . Talk about your embarrassin ' stage waits ! I could feel my face pinkin ' up and my ears tinglin ' . " Ah , say , " I breaks out , " do n't tell me I 've gone and collected the wrong one ! " At that there comes a giggle from under the zippy lid . " Why , it 's Gladys ! " says Marjorie . " Well , I never ! " " Of course , you dear old goose ! " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gladys ! " says Marjorie , holdin ' her off for another inspection . " How you have -- er -- grown up ! Why , your mother never told me a word ! " " Oh , Mummah ! " says she , indicatin ' deep scorn . " Besides , she has n't seen me for nearly two days , and -- well , I suppose she will fuss , as usual , about the way I 'm dressed . But I 've had a perfectly glorious visit , and coming up in the car with dear Torchy was such sport . Was n't it , now ? " With which she turns to me . " Was it ? " says I , and I notices both Vee and Marjorie gazin ' at me int'rested . " Of course , " says Gladys , prattlin ' on , " we quarreled all the way up ; but it was all his fault , and he -- oh , phsaw ! Here come my dear parents . " Takin ' Gladys as a sample , you 'd never guessed it ; for Mother is a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown hair parted in the middle and brushed back low . She 's wearin ' her own complexion too , and , while she 's dressed more or less neat and stylish , she do n't sport ear danglers , or anything like that . With Father in the background she comes sailin ' up smilin ' , and it ai n't until she gets a peek under the mush-bowl lid that her expression changes . " Why , Gladys ! " she gasps . " Now , Mummah ! " protests Gladys peevish . " For goodness sake do n't begin -- anyway , not here ! " " But -- but , my dear ! " goes on Mother , starin ' at her shocked . " That -- that hat ! And your hair ! And -- and your face ! " " Oh , bother ! " says Gladys , stampin ' her high-heeled pump . " You 'd like to have me dress like Cousin Tilly , I suppose ? " " But you know I asked you not to -- to have that done to your hair again , " says Mother . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gladys emphatic . Mother sighs and turns to Father , who is makin ' his inspection with a weary look on his face . He 's just an average , stout-built , good-natured lookin ' duck , Father is , a little bald in front , and just now he 's rubbin ' the bald spot sort of aimless . " You see , Arthur , " says Mother . " Ca n't you do something ? " First Father scowls , and then he flushes up . " Why -- er -- ah -- oh , blast it all , Sallie , do n't put it up to me ! " says he . Then he pulls out a long black cigar , bites the end off savage , and beats it around the corner . That was a brilliant move of his ; for Mother turns out to be one of the weepy kind , and in a minute more she 's slumped into a chair and is sobbin ' away . She 's sure she do n't know why Gladys should do such things . Had n't she forbid her to use so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear those hideous ear jewels ? And so on and so on , with Gladys standin ' back poutin ' defiant . But , say , when they get too big to spank , what else can Father and Mother do ? Fin'lly Vee seems to have an idea . She whispers it into Marjorie 's ear , slips into the house , and comes back with a hand mirror and a damp washcloth , which she proceeds to offer to Gladys , suggestin ' that she use it . " Indeed I sha' n't ! " says Gladys , her big eyes flashin ' scrappy . " I shall stay just as I am , and if Mother wants to be foolish she can get over it , that 's all ! " And Gladys switches over to a porch chair and slams herself into it . Vee looks at her a minute , and then bites her upper lip like she was keepin ' back some remarks . Next she whispers again to Marjorie , who passes it on to Mother , and then the three of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on one side of the front door , and me in a porch swing on the other waitin ' for the next act . Must have been ten minutes or more before the two plotters appears again , chattin ' away merry with Mother , who 's between ' em . And , say , you should have seen Mother ! Talk about your startlin ' changes ! They 'd been busy with the make-up box , them two had , and now Mother 's got on just as much war paint as Daughter -- maybe a little more . Also they 've dug up a blond transformation somewhere , which covers up all the brown hair , and they 've fitted her out with long jet earrings , and touched up her eyebrows -- and , believe me , with all that yellow hair down over her eyes , and the rouged lips , she looks just like she 'd strayed in from the White Light district ! You would n't think just a little store hair and face calcimine could make such a change in anybody . Honest , when I tumbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Mother fixed up I almost falls out of the swing ! That 's nothin ' to the jolt that gets to Gladys . " Mother ! " she gasps . " Wha -- what have you been doing ? " " Why , I 've been getting ready for the tea , Gladys , " says she . " But -- but , Mother , " says Gladys , " you 're never going to let people see you like that , are you ? " " Why not , my dear ? " says Mother . " But your face -- ugh ! " says Gladys . " Oh , bother ! " says Mother . " I suppose you 'd like to have me look like Aunt Martha ? " Gladys stares at her for awhile with her eyes wide and set , like she was watchin ' somethin ' horrible that she could n't turn away from , and then she goes to pieces in a weepin ' fit of her own . Nobody interferes , and right in the midst of it she breaks off , marches over to a wicker porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ props the glass up against a vase , and goes to work . First off she sheds the pearl earrings . At that Mother sits down opposite and follows suit with her jet danglers . Next Gladys mops off the scenic effect . Marjorie produces another washcloth , and Mother makes a clean sweep too . Gladys snatches out a handful of gold hairpins , destroys the turban twist that Marie had spent so much time buildin ' up , and knots ' er hair simple in the back . Mother caps this by liftin ' off the blond transformation . And as I left for a stroll around the grounds they 'd both got back to lookin ' more or less nice and natural . They had gone to a close clinch and was sobbin ' affectionate on each other 's shoulders . Later the tea got under way and went on as such things generally do , with folks comin ' and goin ' , and a buzz of chin music that you could hear clear out to the gate , where I was waitin ' with Martin until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know just how it would be , but I suspected I might be invited to ride in front on the home trip . I 'd made up my mind to start there , anyway . But , say , when the time comes and Vee trips out to the limousine , where I 'm holdin ' the door open and lookin ' sheepish , I takes a chance on a glance into them gray eyes of hers . I got a chill too . It 's only for a second , though . She was doing her best to look cold and distant ; but behind that I could spot a smile . So I changes the programme . " Say , " says I , followin ' her in and shuttin ' the door , " wa' n't that kid Gladys the limit , though ? " " Why , " says she , givin ' me the quizzin ' stare , " I thought you had just loads of fun coming up . " " Hearing which cruel words , " says I , " our hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " And locked the haughty maiden out in the cold , I suppose ? " says she . " If it was you , " says I , " I 'd take the gate off the hinges . " " Silly ! " says she . " Do you know , Gladys looked real sweet afterward . " " I 'll bet the reform do n't last , though , " says I. " But that was a great scheme of yours for persuadin ' her to scrub off the stencil work . There 's so many of that kind nowadays , maybe the idea would be worth copyrightin ' . What do you think , Vee ? " Never mind the rest , though . We had a perfectly good ride back , and up to date Aunty ai n't wise to it . Of course by next mornin ' too Mr. Robert has forgot all about the afternoon before , and he seems surprised when I puts in an expense bill of twenty-five cents . " What 's this for ? " says he . " Gumdrops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he forks over a quarter I never cracks a smile . Wait until he hears the returns from Marjorie , though ! I 'll give him some string to pay up for that kindergarten steer of his . Watch me ! CHAPTER IX LATE RETURNS ON POPOVER " Well ? " says I , keepin ' my feet up on the desk and glancin ' casual over the brass rail . " What 's your complaint , Spaghetti ? " It 's a wrong guess , to begin with ; but I wa' n't even takin ' the trouble to place him accurate . He 's some kind of a foreigner , and that 's enough . Besides , from the fidgety way he 's grippin ' his hat in both hands , and the hesitating sidlin ' style he has of makin ' his approach , I figured he must be a stray that had got the wrong number . " If -- if you please , Sir , " says he , bowin ' elaborate and humble , " Mr. Robert Ellins . " " Gwan ! " says I. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know Mr. Robert . " " But -- but if you please , Sir , " he goes on , " I wish to speak with him . " " You do , eh ? " says I. " Now , ai n't that cute of you ? Think you can pick out any name on the board and drift in for a chat , do you ? Come now , what you peddlin '  - -  dollar safety-razors , bullpups , or what ? " He ai n't a real live wire , this heavy-faced , wide-shouldered , squatty-built party with the bumper crop of curly black hair . He blinks his big , full eyes kind of solemn , starin ' at me puzzled , and about as intelligent as a cow gazin ' over a fence . An odd lookin ' gink he was , sort of a cross between a dressed up bartender on his day off and a longshoreman havin ' his picture taken . " Excuse , " says he , rousin ' a little , " but -- but it is not to peddle . I would wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , you ca n't , " says I , wavin ' towards the door ; " so beat it ! " This do n't make any more impression than as if I 'd tried to push him over with one finger . " I would wish , " he begins again , " to speak with --  --  " " Say , that 's all on the record , " says I , " and the motion 's been denied . " " But I --  --  " he starts in once more , " I have --  --  " Just then Piddie comes turkeyin ' over pompous and demands to know what all the debate is about . " Look what wants to see Mr. Robert ! " says I. " Impossible ! " says Piddie , takin ' one look . " Send him away at once ! " " Hear that ? " says I to Curlylocks . " Not a chance ! Fade , Spaghetti , fade ! " The full force of that decision seems to penetrate his nut ; for he gulps hard once or twice , the muscles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big round tear leaks out of his off eye and trickles down over his cheek . Maybe it do n't look some absurd too , seein ' signs of such deep emotion on a face like that . " Now , none of that , my man ! " puts in Piddie , who 's as chicken hearted as he is peevish . " Torchy , you -- you attend to him . " " What 'll I do , " says I , " call in a plumber to stop the leak ? " " Find out who he is and what he wants , " says he , " and then pack him off . I am very busy . " " Well , " says I , turnin ' to the thick guy , " what 's the name ? " " Me ? " says he . " I -- I am Zandra Popokoulis . " " Help ! " says I. " Popo -- here , write it on the pad . " But even when he 's done that I ca n't do more than make a wild stab at sayin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I goes on . " Popover for short , eh ? Think Mr. Robert would recognise you by that ? " " Excuse , Sir , " says he , " but at the club he would speak to me as Mike . " " Oh , at the club , eh ? " says I. " Say , I 'm beginnin ' to get a glimmer . Been workin ' at one of Mr. Robert 's clubs , have you ? " " I am his waiter for long time , Sir , " says Popover . Course , the rest was simple . He 'd quit two or three months ago to take a trip back home , havin ' been promised by the head steward that he could have his place again any time inside of a year . But imagine the base perfidy ! A second cousin of the meat chef has drifted in meanwhile , been set to work at Popover 's old tables , and the result is that when Mike reports to claim his job he gets the cold , heartless chuck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd thought , though , to see the gloomy way he shakes his head , that this was the last chance he had left . I gather too that club jobs are fairly well paid , steadier than most kinds of work , and harder to pick up . " Also , " he adds , sort of shy , " there is Armina . " " Oh , always ! " says I. " Bunch of millinery in the offing . It never fails . You 're her steady , eh ? " Popover smiles grateful and pours out details . Armina was a fine girl , likewise rich -- oh , yes . Her father had a flower jobbin ' business on West 28th-st.  - -  very grand . For Armina he had ideas . Any would-be son-in-law must be in business too . Yet there was a way . He would take in a partner with two hundred and fifty dollars cash . And Mr. Popokoulis had saved up nearly that much when he 'd got this fool notion of goin ' back home into his head . Now here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not only a case of goin ' hungry , but of losin ' out on the fair Armina . Hence the eye moisture . " Yes , yes , " says I. " But the weeps wo n't help any . And , even if Mr. Robert would listen to all this sad tale , it 's ten to one he would n't butt in at the club . I might get a chance to put it up to him , though . Suppose you drop in to-morrow sometime , and I 'll let you know . " " But I would wish , " says Popover , " to speak with --  --  " " Ah , ditch it ! " I breaks in weary . " Say , you must have been takin ' militant lessons from Maud Malone . Look here ! If you 're bound to stick around and take a long chance , camp there on the bench . Mr. Robert 's busy inside , now ; but if he should get through before lunch -- well , we 'll see . But do n't go bankin ' on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested mental anguish that I has before me for the next hour or so ,  - -  this Popokoulis gent , with his great , doughy face frozen into a blank stare , about as expressive as a half-baked squash pie , his eyes fixed on the opposite wall , and only now and then a spasm in his throat showin ' that he was still thinkin ' an occasional thought . Course , Piddie discovers him after a while and demands pettish , " That person still here ! Who is he ? " " Club waiter with a mislaid job , " says I. " What ! " says Piddie . " A waiter ? Just a common waiter ? " I could n't begin to put in all the deep disgust that Piddie expresses ; for , along with his fondness for gettin ' next to swell people , he seems to have a horror of mixin ' at all with the common herd . " Waiters ! " he sniffs . " The scum of mankind . If they had a spark of courage , or a gleam of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be waiters . Bah ! " " Also I expect , " says I , " if they was all noble specimens of manhood like us , Sherry 's and Rector 's would have to be turned into automatic food dispensaries , eh ? " " No fear ! " says Piddie . " The lower classes will always produce enough spineless beings to wear aprons and carry trays . Look at that one there ! I suppose he never has a thought or an ambition above --  --  " Bz-z-z-zt ! goes the buzzer over my desk , and I 'm off on the jump for Mr. Robert 's room . I wa' n't missin ' any of his calls that mornin ' ; for a partic'lar friend of mine was in there -- Skid Mallory . Remember Skid , the young college hick that I helped find his footin ' when he first hit the Corrugated ? You know he married a Senator 's daughter , and got boosted into an assistant general manager 's berth . And Skid 's been making good ever since . He 'd just come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weddin ' tour , and you ca n't guess what he 'd pulled off . I 'd only heard it sketched out so far , but it seems while him and young Mrs. Mallory was over there in Athens , or some such outlandish place , this late muss with the Turks was just breakin ' loose . Skid he leaves Wifey at the hotel one mornin ' while he goes out for a little stroll ; drifts down their Newspaper Row , where the red ink war extras are so thick the street looks like a raspberry patch ; follows the drum music up as far as City Hall , where the recruits are bein ' reviewed by the King ; listens to the Greek substitute for " Buh-ruh-ruh ! Soak ' em ! " and the next thing he knows he 's wavin ' his lid and yellin ' with the best of ' em . It must have stirred up some of that old football fightin ' blood of his ; for he 'd organized a regular cheerin ' section , right there opposite to the royal stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth down and two to go on the five-yard line , when all of a sudden over pikes a Colonel or something from the King 's staff and begins poundin ' Skid on the back gleeful . It 's a young Greek that used to be in his engineerin ' class , back in the dear old college days . He says Skid 's just the man he wants to come help him patch up the railroad that the Turks have been puttin ' on the blink as they dropped back towards headquarters . Would he ? Why , him bein ' railroad construction expert of the Corrugated , this was right in his line ! Sure he would ! And when Mrs. Mallory sees him again at lunchtime he 's all costumed as a Major in the Greek army , and is about to start for the scene of atrocities . That 's Skid , all over . He was n't breathin ' out any idle gusts , either . He not only rebuilds their bloomin ' old line better'n new , so they can rush soldiers and supplies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he springs his order book on the gover'ment and lands such a whackin ' big contract for steel rails and girders that Old Hickory decides to work day and night shifts in two more rollin ' mills . Course , since it was Mr. Robert who helped me root for Skid in the first place , he 's tickled to death , and he tells me confidential how they 're goin ' to get the directors together at a big banquet that evenin ' and have a reg'lar lovefeast , with Skid at the head of the table . Just now I finds Mr. Robert pumpin ' him for some of the details of his experience over there , and after I lugs in an atlas they sent me out for , so Skid can point out something on the map , I just naturally hangs around with my ear stretched . " Ah , that 's the place , " says Skid , puttin ' his finger on a dot , " Mustapha ! Well , it was about six miles east from there that we had our worst job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to build a decent railroad , but believe me they 're stars at wrecking a line thoroughly ! At Mustapha they 'd ripped up the rails , burned the ties , and blown great holes in the roadbed with dynamite . But I soon had a dozen grading gangs at work on that stretch , and new bridges started , and then I pushed on alone to see what was next . " That was when I got nearest to the big noise . Off across the hills the Turks were pounding away with their heavy guns , and I was anxious for a look . I kept going and going ; but could n't find any of our people . Night was shutting in too , and the first thing I knew I was n't anywhere in particular , with nothing in sight but an old sheep pen . I tried bunking there ; but it was n't restful , and before daylight I went wandering on again . I wanted to locate our advance and get a cup of coffee . " I must have gone a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a most infernal racket broke loose not one hundred yards ahead . Really , you know , I thought I 'd blundered into the midst of a battle . Then in a minute the noise let up , and the smoke blew away , and there , squatting behind a machine gun up on the side of a hill , was one lone Greek soldier . Not another soul in sight , mind you ; just this absurd , dirty , smoke-stained person , calmly feeding another belt of cartridges into his gun ! " ' Hello ! ' says I. ' What the deuce are you doing here ? '  - -  'Holding the hill , Sir , ' says he , in good United States . ' Not all alone ? ' says I. He shrugs his shoulders at that . ' The others were killed or hurt , ' says he . ' The Red Cross people took them all away last night ,  - -  Lieutenant , Sergeant , everyone . But our battery must keep the hill . ' ' Where 's the rest of the advance , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' says he . ' And you mean to say , ' says I , ' you 've been here all night with the Turkish artillery hammering away at you ? ' ' They are bad shots , those Turks , very bad , ' says he . ' Also they send infantry to drive me away , many times . See ! There come some more . Down there ! Ah-r-r-r ! You will , will you ? ' And with that he turns loose his big pepperbox on a squad that had just started to dash out of a ravine and rush him . They were coming our way on the jump . Scared ? Say , if there 'd been anything to have crawled into , I 'd have been in it ! As there was n't , I just flattened myself on the ground and waited until it was all over . " Oh , he crumpled ' em up , all right ! He had n't ground out one belt of cartridges before he had ' em on the run . But I want to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next affair would turn out . I legged it back where I 'd come from , and by nine o'clock I was behind our own lines , trying to find out what sort of campaign this was that left one machine gun to stave off the whole Turkish army . Of course no one knew anything very definite . The best guess was that our advance had been swung off for a flank movement , and that this particular one-man battery had been overlooked . I do n't even know whether he was picked up again , or whether the Turks finally got him ; but let me tell you , talk as much about your gallant Bulgarians as you like , some of those little Greeks were good fighters too . Anyway , I 'll take off my hat any day to that one on the hill . " " Gee ! " I breaks out . " Some scrapper , what ? " At which Mr. Robert swings around and gives me a look . " Ah ! " says he . " I had n't realized , Torchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't mention it , " says I. " I was just goin ' to -- er -- by the way , Mr. Robert , there 's a poor scrub waitin ' outside for a word with you , an old club waiter . Says you knew him as Mike . " " Mike ? " says he , looking blank . " His real name sounds like Popover , " says I. " It 's a case of retrievin ' a lost job . " " Oh , very well , " says Mr. Robert . " Perhaps I 'll see him later . Not now . And close the door after you , please . " So I 'm shunted back to the front office , so excited over that war story that I has to hunt up Piddie and pass it on to him . It gets him too . Anything in the hero line always does , and this noble young Greek doin ' the come-one-come-all act was a picture that even a two-by-four imagination like Piddie 's could n't fail to grasp . " By Jove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Thermopylae all over again ! I wish I could have seen that ! " " As close as Skid did ? " says I. " Ah , you 'd have turned so green they 'd taken you for a pickled string bean . " " Oh , I do n't pretend to be a daredevil , " admits Piddie , with a sudden rush of modesty . " Still , it is a pity Mr. Mallory did not stay long enough to find out the name of this unknown hero , and give it to the world . " " The moral of which is , " says I , " that all heroes ought to carry their own press agents with ' em . " We 'd threshed it all out , Piddie and me , and I 'd gone back to my desk some reluctant , for this jobless waiter was still sheddin ' his gloom around the reception room , and I was just thinkin ' how it would be to put a screen in front of him , when Mr. Robert and Skid comes out arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be pulled off . " Of course you 'll come . " Mr. Robert is insistin ' . " Only a few directors , you know . No , no set speeches , or anything like that . But they 'll want to hear how you came to get that big order , and about some of the interesting things you saw over there , just as you 've told me . " I had hopped up and was holdin ' the gate wide open , givin ' Skid all the honors , and Mr. Robert was escortin ' him out to the elevator , when I notices that this Popover party has got his eye on the boss and is standin ' right where he 's blockin ' the way . " Hey , Poppy ! " says I in a stage whisper . " Back out ! Reverse yourself ! Take a sneak ! " But of all the muleheads ! There he stands , grippin ' his hat , and thinkin ' only of that lost job . " All right , " Skid is saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gushy introductions , or sitting in the spotlight for me at this -- er -- er --  --  Well , as I 'm a living mortal ! " He gets this last out after a gasp or two , and then stops stock still , starin ' straight in front of him . " What is it ? " says Mr. Robert . " What 's up ? " And we sees that Skid Mallory has his eyes glued to this waiter shrimp . " In the name of all that 's good , " says he , " where did you come from ? " You ca n't jar Popover , though , by any little thing like that . When he gets an idea in his dome it 's a fixture there . " I would wish to speak , " says he , " with Mr. Ellins . " " Yes , yes , another time , " says Mr. Robert hasty . " But see here ! " says Skid , still gazin ' steady . " Do n't you remember me ? Take a good look now . " Popover gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I serve you at the club , Sir , " says he . " Club be blowed ! " says Skid . " The last time I saw you you were serving a machine gun , six miles east of Mustapha . Is n't that so ? " " Oh , Mustapha ! " says Popover , his eyes lightin ' up a little . " On the hill just beyond where the bridge was blown up ? You came at the night 's end . Oh , yes ! " " I knew it ! " exclaims Skid . " I 'd have bet a thousand -- same curly hair , same shoulders , same eyes . Ellins , here 's that lone hero I was telling you about . Here ! " " But -- hut that 's only Mike , " says Mr. Robert , gazin ' from one to the other . " Used to be a waiter at the club , you know . " " I do n't care what he used to be , " says Skid , " or what he is now , I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acts foolish about swappin ' grips ; but Skid insists . " So you beat ' em out in the end , did you ? " Skid goes on . " Just naturally put it all over that whole bunch of Turks , did n't you ? But how did it happen ? " " I do n't know , " says Popover , fingerin ' his hat nervous . " I am very busy all the time , and -- and I have nothing to eat all night . You see , all other Greek soldiers was hurt ; and me , I must stay to keep the Turks from the hill . Very busy time , Sir . And I am not much for fight , anyway . " " Great Scott ! " says Skid . " He says he 's not much for -- but see here , how did it end ? " Popover gives a shoulder shrug . " Once more they run at me after you go , " says he , " and then come our brave Greek General with big army and chase Turks away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool as to stay behind . That is all I know . Three weeks ago I am discharged from being soldier . Now I come back here , and I have no more my good job . I am much sorry . " " Think of that ! " breaks out Skid . " Talk about the ingratitude of Republics ! Why , England would have given him the Victoria Cross for that ! But ca n't something or other be done about this job of his ? " " Why , certainly , " says Mr. Robert . " Here , let 's go back into my office . " " Hey , Popover , " says I , steerin ' him respectful through the gate . " Do n't forget to tell them about Armina too . " And as the three of ' em streams in , with the waiter in the middle , I turns to find Piddie gazin ' at the sight button-eyed . " Wa' n't you sayin ' how much you 'd like to see the lone hero of the hill ? " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's him , the squatty one . Uh-huh . Mike , alias Popover , who quit bein ' a waiter to fight for his country , and after he 'd licked all the Turks in sight comes pikin ' back here to hunt around for his tray again . Say , all of ' em ai n't such scum , are they ? " It was a great old banquet too ; for Skid insists that if they must have a conquerin ' hero to drink to Mr. Popokoulis is the only real thing in sight . Mike would n't stand for a seat at the table , though ; so they compromised by havin ' him act as head waiter . Skid tells the story just the same , and makes him stand out where they can all see him . There was some cheerin ' done too . Mr. Robert was tellin ' me about it only this mornin ' . " And you 've got him his old place at the club , eh ? " says I. " No , " says he . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shop for Mr. Popokoulis . " " Oh ! " says I. " Backin ' him for the Armina handicap , eh ? It ought to be a cinch . Some chap , that Popover , even if he was a waiter , eh ? It 's tough on Piddie , though . This thing has tied all his ideas in double bow-knots . " CHAPTER X MERRY DODGES A DEAD HEAT Somehow I sensed it as a kind of a batty excursion at the start . You see , he 'd asked me offhand would I come , and I 'd said " Sure , Bo , " careless like , not thinkin ' any more about it until here Saturday afternoon I finds myself on the way to spend the week-end with J. Meredith Stidler . Sounds imposing do n't it ? But his name 's the weightiest part of J. Meredith . Course , around the Corrugated offices we call him Merry , and some of the bond clerks even get it Miss Mary ; which ai n't hardly fair , for while he 's no husky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , either . Just one of these neat , finicky featherweights , J. Meredith is ; a well finished two-by-four , with more polish than punch . You know the kind ,  - -  fussy about his clothes , gen'rally has a pink or something in his coat lapel , hair always just so , and carries a vest pocket mirror . We ai n't got a classier dresser in the shop . Not noisy , you understand : quiet grays , as a rule ; but made for him special and fittin ' snug around the collar . Near thirty , I should guess Merry was , and single , of course . No head of a fam'ly would be sportin ' custom-made shoes and sleeve monograms , or havin ' his nails manicured reg'lar twice a week . I 'd often wondered how he could do it too , on seventy-five dollars a month . For J. Meredith wa' n't even boss of his department . He just holds down one of the stools in the audit branch , where he has about as much show of gettin ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown up Broadway on a windy day . We got a lot of material like that in the Corrugated ,  - -  just plain , simple cogs in a big dividend-producin ' machine , grindin ' along steady and patient , and their places easy filled when one wears out . A caster off one of the rolltop desks would be missed more . Yet J. Meredith takes it cheerful . Always has a smile as he pushes through the brass gate , comin ' or goin ' , and stands all the joshin ' that 's handed out to him without gettin ' peevish . So when he springs this over-Sunday invite I do n't feel like turnin ' it down . Course , I 'm wise that it 's sort of a charity contribution on his part . He puts it well , though . " It may be rather a dull way for you to pass the day , " says he ; " but I 'd like to have you come . " " Let 's see , " says I. " Vincent wo n't be expectin ' me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradley Martins are still abroad , I 've cut the Reggy Vanderbilts , and -- well , you 're on , Merry . Call it the last of the month , eh ? " " The fourth Saturday , then , " says he . " Good ! " I was blamed near lettin ' the date get past me too , when he stops me as I 'm pikin ' for the dairy lunch Friday noon . " Oh , I say , Torchy , " says he , " ah -- er -- about tomorrow . Hope you do n't mind my mentioning it , but there will be two other guests -- ladies -- at dinner tomorrow night . " He seemed some fussed at gettin ' it out ; so I catches the cue quick . " That 's easy , " says I. " Count me out until another time . " " Oh , not at all , " says he . " In fact , you 're expected . I merely wished to suggest , you know , that -- er -- well , if you cared to do so , you might bring along a suit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I. " Swell comp'ny . Trust me . " I winks mysterious , and chuckles to myself , " Here 's where I slip one on J. Meredith . " And when I packs my suitcase I puts in that full evenin ' regalia that I wins off 'm Son-in-Law Ferdy , you remember , in that real estate deal . Some Cinderella act , I judged that would be , when Merry discovers the meek and lowly office boy arrayed like a night-bloomin ' head waiter . " That ought to hold him for a spell , " thinks I. But , say , you should see the joint we fetches up at out on the south shore of Long Island that afternoon . Figurin ' on a basis of seventy-five per , I was expectin ' some private boardin ' house where Merry has the second floor front , maybe , with use of the bath . But listen ,  - -  a clipped privet hedge , bluestone drive , flower gardens , and a perfectly good double-breasted mansion standin ' back among the trees . It 's a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  slate roof , jigsaw work on the dormers , and a cupola ,  - -  but it 's more or less of a plute shack , after all . Then there 's a real live butler standin ' at the carriage entrance to open the hack door and take my bag . " Gee ! " says I. " Say , Merry , who belongs to all this ? " " Oh ! Had n't I told you ? " says he . " You see , I live with my aunt . She is -- er -- somewhat peculiar ; but --  --  " " I should worry ! " I breaks in . " Believe me , with a joint like this in her own name , I would n't kick if she had her loft full of hummin ' birds . Who 's next in line for it ? " " Why , I suppose I am , " says J. Meredith , " under certain conditions . " " Z-z-zin ' ! " says I. " And you hangin ' onto a cheap skate job at the Corrugated ! " Well , while he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the sketch . Seems butlers and all that was no new thing to Merry . He 'd been brought up on ' em . He 'd lived abroad too . Studied music there . Not that he ever meant to work at it , but just because he liked it . You see , about that time the fam'ly income was rollin ' in reg'lar every month from the mills back in Pawtucket , or Fall River , or somewhere . Then all of a sudden things begin to happen ,  - -  strikes , panics , stock grabbin ' by the trusts . Father 's weak heart could n't stand the strain . Meredith 's mother followed soon after . And one rainy mornin ' he wakes up in Baden Baden , or Monte Carlo , or wherever it was , to find that he 's a double orphan at the age of twenty-two , with no home , no cash , and no trade . All he could do was to write an S. O. S. message back to Aunt Emma Jane . If she had n't produced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of pawn . Panics and so on had n't cleaned out her share of the Stidler estate -- not so you 'd notice it ! She 'd been on the spot , Aunt Emma had , watchin ' the market . Long before the jinx hit Wall Street she 'd cashed in her mill stock for gold ballast , and when property prices started tumblin ' she dug up a lard pail from under the syringa bush and begun investin ' in bargain counter real estate . Now she owns business blocks , villa plots , and shore frontage in big chunks , and spends her time collectin ' rents , makin ' new deals , and swearin' ' off her taxes . You 'd most thought , with a perfectly good nephew to blow in some of her surplus on , she 'd made a fam'ly pet of J. Meredith . But not her . Pets was n't in her line . Her prescription for him was work , something reg'lar and constant , so he would n't get into mischief . She did n't care what it brought in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' money . And that was about Merry 's measure . He could add up a column of figures and put the sum down neat at the bottom of the page . So he fitted into our audit department like a nickel into a slot machine . And there he stuck . " But after sportin ' around Europe so long , " says I , " do n't punchin ' the time clock come kind of tough ? " " It 's a horrible , dull grind , " says he . " Like being caught in a treadmill . But I suppose I deserve nothing better . I 'm one of the useless sort , you know . I 've no liking , no ability , for business ; but I 'm in the mill , and I ca n't see any way out . " For a second J. Meredith 's voice sounds hopeless . One look ahead has taken out of him what little pep he had . But the next minute he braces up , smiles weary , and remarks , " Oh , well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to that I shifts the subject by tryin ' to get a line on the other comp'ny that 's expected for dinner . " They 're our next-door neighbors , " says he , " the Misses Hibbs . " " Queens ? " says I. He pinks up a little at that . " I presume you would call them old maids , " says he . " They are about my age , and -- er -- the truth is , they are rather large . But really they 're quite nice ,  - -  refined , cultured , all that sort of thing . " " Specially which one ? " says I , givin ' him the wink . " Now , now ! " says he , shakin ' his head . " You 're as bad as Aunt Emma . Besides , they 're her guests . She asks them over quite often . You see , they own almost as much property around here as she does , and -- well , common interests , you know . " " Sure that 's all ? " says I , noticin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " says he . " That is -- er -- well , I suppose I may as well admit that Aunt Emma thinks she is trying her hand at match-making . Absurd , of course . " " Oh-ho ! " says I. " Wants you to annex the adjoinin ' real estate , does she ? " " It -- it is n't exactly that , " says he . " I 've no doubt she has decided that either Pansy or Violet would make a good wife for me . " " Pansy and Violet ! " says I. " Listens well . " " Perhaps their names are hardly appropriate ; but they are nice , sensible , rather attractive young women , both of them , " insists Merry . " Then why not ? " says I. " What 's the matter with the Hymen proposition ? " " Oh , it 's out of the question , " protests J. Meredith , blushin ' deep . " Really I -- I 've never thought of marrying anyone . Why , how could I ? And besides I should n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , I could n't ! You -- you ca n't understand . I 'm such a duffer at most things . " There 's no fake about him bein ' modest . You could tell that by the way he colored up , even talkin ' to me . Odd sort of a gink he was , with a lot of queer streaks in him that did n't show on the outside . It was more or less entertainin ' , followin ' up the plot of the piece ; but all of a sudden Merry gets over his confidential spasm and shuts up like a clam . " Almost time to dress for dinner , " says he . " We 'd best be going in . " And of course my appearin ' in the banquet uniform do n't give him any serious jolt . " Well , well , Torchy ! " says he , as I strolls into the parlor about six-thirty , tryin ' to forget the points of my dress collar . " How splendid you look ! " " I had some battle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow lopsided ? " " A mere trifle , " says he . " Allow me . There ! Really , I 'm quite proud of you . Aunty 'll be pleased too ; for , while she dresses very plainly herself , she likes this sort of thing . You 'll see . " I did n't notice any wild enthusiasm on Aunty 's part , though , when she shows up . A lean , wiry old girl , Aunty is , with her white hair bobbed up careless and a big shell comb stickin ' up bristly , like a picket fence , on top . There 's nothin ' soft about her chin , or the square-cut mouth , and after she 'd give me one glance out of them shrewd , squinty eyes I felt like she 'd taken my number ,  - -  pedigree , past performances , and cost mark complete . " Howdo , young man ? " says she , and with out wastin ' any more breath on me she pikes out to the front door to scout down the drive for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and inside of three minutes Aunty has shooed us into the dinin ' room . And , say , the first good look I had at Pansy and Violet I nearly passed away . " Rather large , " Merry had described ' em . Yes , and then some ! They wa' n't just ordinary fat women ; they was a pair of whales ,  - -  big all over , tall and wide and hefty . They had their weight pretty well placed at that ; not lumpy or bulgy , you know , but with them expanses of shoulder , and their big , heavy faces -- well , the picture of slim , narrow-chested Merry Stidler sittin ' wedged in between the two , like the ham in a lunch counter sandwich , was most too much for me . I swallows a drink of water and chokes over it . I expect Merry caught on too . I 'd never seen him so fussed before . He 's makin ' a brave stab at bein ' chatty ; but I can tell he 's doin ' it all on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then turns quick to the left ; but on both sides he 's hemmed in by them two human mountains . They wa' n't such bad lookers , either . They has good complexions , kind of pleasant eyes , and calm , comf'table ways . But there was so much of ' em ! Honest , when they both leans toward him at once I held my breath , expectin ' to see him squeezed out like a piece of lead pipe run through a rollin ' machine . Nothin ' tragic like that happens , though . They do n't even crowd him into the soup . But it 's an odd sort of a meal , with J. Meredith and the Hibbs sisters doin ' a draggy three-handed dialogue , while me and Aunty holds down the side lines . And nothin ' that 's said or done gets away from them narrow-set eyes , believe me ! Looked like something wa' n't goin ' just like she 'd planned ; for the glances she shoots across the table get sharper and sourer , and finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butler , and the next thing J. Meredith knows , as he glances up from his carvin ' , he sees James uncorkin ' a bottle of fizz . Merry almost drops his fork and gawps at Aunty sort of dazed . " Meredith , " says she , snappy , " go on with your carving ! Young man , I suppose you do n't take wine ? " " N-n-no , Ma'am , " says I , watchin ' her turn my glass down . I might have chanced a sip or two , at that ; but Aunty has different ideas . I notice that J. Meredith seems to shy at the bubbly stuff , as if he was lettin ' on he hated it . He makes a bluff or two ; but all he does is wet his lips . At that Aunty gives a snort . " Meredith , " says she , hoistin ' her hollow-stemmed glass sporty , " to our guests ! " " Ah , to be sure , " says Merry , and puts his nose into the sparkles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot soon after that . It was one of the Miss Hibbs askin ' him something about life abroad that starts Merry off . He begins tellin ' about Budapest and Vienna and a lot more of them guidebook spots , and how comf'table you can live there , and the music , and the cafes , and the sights , gettin ' real enthusiastic over it , until one of the sisters breaks in with : " Think of that , Pansy ! If we could only do such things ! " " But why not ? " says Merry . " Two women alone ? " says a Miss Hibbs . " True , " says J. Meredith . " One needs an escort . " " Ah-h-h-h , yes ! " sighs Violet . " Ah-h-h , yes ! " echoes Pansy . " James , " puts in Aunty just then , " fill Mr. Stidler 's glass . " Merry wa' n't shyin ' it any more . He insists on clickin ' rims with the Hibbs sisters , and they does it real kittenish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unload that old one about the Irishman that the doctor tried to throw a scare into by tellin ' him if he did n't quit the booze he 'd go blind within three months . You know -- when Mike comes back with , " Well , I 'm an old man , and I 'm thinkin ' I 've seen most everything worth while . " Pansy and Violet shook until their chairs creaked , and one of ' em near swallows her napkin tryin ' to stop the chuckles . In all the time I 've known J. Meredith I 'd never heard him try to spring anything comic before ; but havin ' made such a hit with this one he follows with others , robbin ' the almanac regardless . " Oh , you deliciously funny man ! " gasps Pansy , tappin ' him playful on the shoulder . Course , it wa' n't any cabaret high jinks , you understand . Meredith was just limbered up a little . In the parlor afterwards while we was havin ' coffee he strings off quite a fancy line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the piano , where he ripples through a few things from Bach and Beethoven and Percy Moore . It 's near eleven o'clock when the Hibbs sisters get their wraps on and Merry starts to walk home with ' em . " You might wait for me , Torchy , " says he , pausin ' at the door . " Nonsense ! " says Aunt Emma Jane . " Time young people were in bed . Good night , young man . " There do n't seem to be any chance for a debate on the subject ; so I goes up to my room . But it 's a peach of a night , warm and moony ; so after I turns out the light I camps down on the windowseat and gazes out over the shrubby towards the water . I could see the top of the Hibbs house and a little wharf down on the shore . I do n't know whether it was the moonlight or the coffee ; but I did n't feel any more like bed than I did like breakfast . Pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his door , which was next to mine . I was goin ' to hail him and give him a little josh about disposin ' of the sisters so quick ; but I did n't hear him stirrin ' around any more until a few minutes later , when it sounds as if he 'd tiptoed downstairs again . But I was n't sure . Nothin ' doin ' for some time after that . And you know how quiet the country can be on a still , moonshiny night . I was gettin ' dopy from it , and was startin ' to shed my collar and tie , when off from a distance , somewhere out in the night , music breaks loose . I could n't tell whether it was a cornet or a trombone ; but it 's something like that . Seems to come from down along the waterfront . And , say , it sounds kind of weird , hearin ' it at night that way . Took me sometime to place the tune ; but I fin'lly makes it out as that good old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bein ' well done too , with long quavers on the high notes and the low ones comin ' out round and deep . Honest , that was some playin ' . I was wide awake once more , leanin ' out over the sill and takin ' it all in , when a window on the floor below goes up and out bobs a white head . It 's Aunty . She looks up and spots me too . " Quite some concert , eh ? " says I. " Is that you , young man ? " says she . " Uh-huh , " says I. " Just takin ' in the music . " " Humph ! " says she . " I believe it 's that fool nephew of mine . " " Not Merry ? " says I. " It must be , " says she . " And goodness knows why he 's out making an idiot of himself at this time of night ! He 'll arouse the whole neighbourhood . " " Why , I was just thinkin ' how classy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunty . " A lot you know about it . Are you dressed , young man ? " I admits that I am . " Then I wish you 'd go down there and see if it is Merry , " says she . " If it is , tell him I say to come home and go to bed . " " And if it ai n't ? " says I. " Go along and see , " says she . I begun to be sorry for Merry . I 'd rather pay board than live with a disposition like that . Down I pikes , out the front door and back through the shrubby . Meantime the musician has finished " Promise Me " and has switched to " Annie Laurie . " It 's easy enough to get the gen'ral direction the sound comes from ; but I could n't place it exact . First off I thought it must be from a little summer house down by the shore ; but it wa' n't . I could n't see anyone around the grounds . Out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was somethin ' dark . And a swell time I had too , buttin ' my way through a five-foot hedge and landin ' in a veg'table garden . But I wades through tomatoes and lettuce until I strikes a gravel path , and in a couple of minutes I 'm out on the dock just as the soloist is hittin ' up " Believe Me , if All Those Endearing Young Charms . " Aunty had the correct dope . It 's Merry , all right . The first glimpse he gets of me he starts guilty and tries to hide the cornet under the tails of his dress coat . " No use , Merry , " says I. " You 're pinched with the poultry . " " Wha-a-at ! " says he . " Oh , it 's you , is it , Torchy ? Please -- please do n't mention this to my aunt . " " She beat me to it , " says I. " It was her sent me out after you with a stop order . She says for you to chop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how did she --  --  Oh , dear ! " he sighs . " It was all her fault , anyway . " " I do n't follow you , " says I. " But what was it , a serenade ? " " Goodness , no ! " gasps J. Meredith . " Who suggested that ? " " Why , it has all the earmarks of one , " says I. " What else would you be doin ' , out playin ' the cornet by moonlight on the dock , if you wa' n't serenadin ' someone ? " " But I was n't , truly , " he protests . " It -- it was the champagne , you know . " " Eh ? " says I. " You do n't mean to say you got stewed ? Not on a couple of glasses ! " " Well , not exactly , " says he . " But I ca n't take wine . I hardly ever do . It -- it goes to my head always . And tonight -- well , I could n't decline . You saw . Then afterward -- oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I could n't go to sleep . I simply had to do something to let off steam . I wanted to play the cornet . So I came out here , as far away from anyone as I could get . " " Too thin , Merry , " says I. " That might pass with me ; but with strangers you 'd get the laugh . " " But it 's true , " he goes on . " And I did n't dream anyone could hear me from here . " " Why , you boob , " says I , " they could hear you a mile off ! " " Really ? " says he . " But you do n't suppose Vio -- I mean , the Misses Hibbs could hear , do you ? " " Unless it 's their habit to putty up their ears at night , " says I. " But -- but what will they think ? " he gasps breathless . " That they 're bein ' serenaded by some admirin ' friend , " says I. " What 's your guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' down on a settee . " I -- I had not thought of that . " " Ah , buck up ! " say I. " Maybe you can fake an alibi in the mornin ' . Anyway , you ca n't spend the night here . You got to report to Aunty . " He lets out another groan , and then gets on his feet . " There 's a path through the bushes along here somewhere , " says he . " No more cross country work in full dress clothes for me , " says I. " We 'll sneak down the Hibbs 's drive where the goin 's easy . " We was doin ' it real sleuthy too , keepin ' on the lawn and dodgin ' from shadow to shadow , when just as we 're passin ' the house Merry has to stub his toe and drop his blamed cornet with a bang . Then out from a second story window floats a voice : " Who is that , please ? " Merry nudges me in the ribs . " Tell them it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it's -- it 's me -- Torchy , " says I reluctant . " Oh ! Ah ! " says a couple of voices in chorus . Then one of ' em goes on , " The young man who is visiting dear Meredith ? " " Yep , " says I. " Same one . " " But it was n't you playing the cornet so beautifully , was it ? " comes coaxin ' from the window . " Tell them yes , " whispers Merry , nudgin ' violent . " Gwan ! " I whispers back . " I 'm in bad enough as it is . " With that I speaks up before he can stop me , " Not much ! " says I. " That was dear Meredith himself . " " Oh-oh ! " says the voices together . Then there 's whisperin ' between ' em . One seems urgin ' the other on to something , and at last it comes out . " Young man , " says the voice , smooth and persuadin ' , " please tell us who -- that is -- which one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deepest groan of all from J. Meredith . " Come on , now , " says I , hoarse and low in his ear . " It 's up to you . Which ? " " Oh , really , " he whispers back , " I -- I ca n't ! " " You got to , and quick , " says I. " Come now , was it Pansy ? " " No , no ! " says he , gaspy . " Huh ! " says I. " Then Violet gets the decision . " And I holds him off by main strength while I calls out , " Why , ai n't you on yet ? It was for Violet , of course . " " Ah-h-h-h ! Thank you . Good night , " comes a voice -- no chorus this time : just one -- and the window is shut . " There you are , Merry , " says I. " It 's all over . You 're as good as booked for life . " He was game about it , though , Merry was . He squares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right after breakfast next mornin ' he marches over to the Hibbses real business-like . Half an hour later I saw him strollin ' out on the wharf with one of the big sisters , and I knew it must be Violet . It was his busy day ; so I says nothin ' to anybody , but fades . And you should have seen the jaunty , beamin ' J. Meredith that swings into the Corrugated Monday mornin ' . He stops at the gate to give me a fraternal grip . " It 's all right , Torchy , " says he . " She -- she 'll have me -- Violet , you know . And we are to live abroad . We sail in less than a month . " " But what about Pansy ? " says I. " Oh , she 's coming with us , of course , " says he . " Really , they 're both charming girls . " " Huh ! " says I. " That 's where you were when I found you . You 're past that point , remember . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was you helped me too , and I wish in some way I could show my --  --  " " You can , " says I. " Leave me the cornet . I might need it some day myself . " CHAPTER XI THE PASSING BY OF BUNNY It 's a shame the way some of these popular clubmen is bothered with business . Here was Mr. Robert , only the other day , with an important four-cue match to be played off between four-thirty and dinnertime ; and what does the manager of our Chicago branch have to do but go and muss up the schedule by wirin ' in that he might have to call for headquarters ' advice on that Burlington order maybe after closin ' time . " Oh , pshaw ! " remarks Mr. Robert , after he 's read the message . " The simp ! " says I. " Guess he thinks the Corrugated gen'ral offices runs night and day shifts , do n't he ? " " Very well put , " says Mr. Robert . " Still , it means rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are counting on me for this match , and if I should --  --  Oh , but I say , Torchy , " he breaks off sudden , " perhaps you have no very important engagement for the early evening ? " " Me ? " says I. " Nothing I could n't scratch . I can shoot a little pool too ; but when it comes to balk line billiards I expect I 'd be a dub among your crowd . " " Refreshing modesty ! " says Mr. Robert . " What I had in mind , however , was that you might wait here for the message from Nixon , while I attend to the match . " " Oh , any way you choose , " says I. " Sure I 'll stay . " " Thanks , " says he . " You need n't wait longer than seven , and if it comes in you can get me on the ' phone and --  --  No , it will be in code ; so you 'd best bring it over . " And it wa' n't so much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for at six-fifteen I 've been over to the club , had Mr. Robert called from the billiard room , got him to fix up his answer , and am pikin ' out the front door with it when he holds me up to add just one more word . Maybe we was some conspicuous from Fifth-ave. , him bein ' still in his shirt sleeves and the steps bein ' more or less brilliant . Anyway , I 'd made another start and was just gettin ' well under way , when alongside scuffs this hollow-eyed object with the mangy whiskers and the mixed-ale breath . " Excuse me , young feller , " says he , " but --  --  " " Ah , flutter by , idle one ! " says I. " I 'm no soup ticket . " Illustration : " Ah , flutter by , idle one ! " says I. " But just a word , my friend , " he insists . " Save your breath , " says I , " and have it redistilled . It 's worth it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my elbow ; " but -- but was n't that Bob Ellins you were just talking to ? " " Eh ? " says I , glancin ' at him some astonished ; for a seedier specimen you could n't find up and down the avenue . " What do you know about him , if it was ? " " More than his name , " says the wreck . " He -- he 's an old friend of mine . " " Oh , of course , " says I. " Anyone could tell that at a glimpse . I expect you used to belong to the same club too ? " " Is old Barney still on the door ? " says he . And , say , he had the right dope on that . Not three minutes before I 'd heard Mr. Robert call the old gink by name . But that hardly proved the case . " Clever work , " says I. " What was it you used to do there , take out the ashes . " " I do n't wonder you think so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bob and I are old friends . " " Why do n't you tackle him , then , " says I , " instead of botherin ' a busy man like me ? Go back and call him out . " " I have n't the face , " says he . " Look at me ! " " I have , " says I , " and , if you ask me , you look like something the cat brought in . " He winces a little at that . " Do n't tell Bob how bad it was , then , " says he . " Just say you let me have a fiver for him . " " Five bucks ! " says I. " Say , I 'm Mr. Robert 's office boy , not his bank account . " " Two , then ? " he goes on . " My , but I must have the boob mark on me plain ! " says I. " Could n't you spare a half , " he urges , " just a half , to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pay for a bed ? " " Oh , sure ! " says I. " I carry a pocketful of halves to shove out to all the bums that presents their business cards . " " But Bob would give it back to you , " he pleads . " I swear he would ! Just tell him you gave it to -- to --  --  " " Well ? " says I. " Algernon who ? " " Tell him it was for Melville Slater , " says he . " He 'll know . " " Melly Slater , eh ? " says I. " Sounds all aright . But I 'd have to chew it over first , even for a half . I have chances of gettin ' stung like this about four times a day , Melly . And , anyway , I got to file a message first , over at the next corner . " " I 'll wait outside , " says he . " That 's nice of you , " says I. " It ai n't any cinch you 'll connect , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a blue sign out he leans up against a window gratin ' , sort of limp and exhausted , and it looks like he means to take a sportin ' chance . How you goin ' to tell , anyway ? Most of ' em say they 've been thrown out of work by the trusts , but that they 've heard of a job in Newark , or Bridgeport , or somewhere , which they could get if they could only rustle enough coin to pay the fare . And they 'll add interestin ' details about havin ' a sick wife , or maybe four hungry kids , and so on . But this rusty bunch of works has a new variation . He 's an old friend of the boss . Maybe it was partly so too . If it was -- well , I got to thinkin ' that over while the operator was countin ' the words , and so the next thing I does is to walk over to the telephone queen and have her call up Mr. Robert . " Well ? " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says I. " I 've filed the message , all right . But , say , there 's a piece of human junk that I collected from in front of the club who 's tryin ' to panhandle me for a half on the strength of bein ' an old chum of yours . He says his name 's Melville Slater . " " Wha-a-at ! " gasps Mr. Robert . " Melly Slater , trying to borrow half a dollar from you ? " " There 's no doubt about his needin ' it , " says I. " My guess is that a half would be a life saver to him just now . " " Why , it does n't seem possible ! ! " says Mr. Robert . " Of course , I have n't seen Melly recently ; but I ca n't imagine how --  --  Did you say he was still there ? " " Hung up on the rail outside , if the cop ai n't shooed him off , " says I. " Then keep him there until I come , " says Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . I 'll be right over . But do n't say a word to him until I get there . " " Got you , " says I. " Hold Melly and keep mum . " I could pipe him off through the swing door vestibule ; and , honest , from the lifeless way he 's propped up there , one arm hangin ' loose , his head to one side , and that white , pasty look to his nose and forehead -- well , I did n't know but he 'd croaked on the spot . So I slips through the cafe exit and chases along the side street until I meets Mr. Robert , who 's pikin ' over full tilt . " You 're sure it 's Melly Slater , are you ? " says he . " I 'm only sure that 's what he said , " says I. " But you can settle that soon enough . There he is , over there by the window . " " Why ! " says Mr. Robert . " That can never be Melly ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he marches up and taps the object on the shoulder . " I say , " says he , " you 're not really Melly Slater , are you ? " There 's a quick shiver runs through the man against the rail , and he lifts his eyes up cringin ' , like he expected to be hit with a club . Mr. Robert takes one look , and it almost staggers him . Next he reaches out , gets a firm grip on the gent 's collar , and drags him out into a better light , twistin ' the whiskered face up for a close inspection . " Blashford ! " says he , hissin ' it out unpleasant . " Bunny Blashford ! " " No , no ! " says the gent , tryin ' to squirm away . " You -- you 've made a mistake . " " Not much ! " says Mr. Robert . " I know those sneaking eyes of yours too well . " " All right , " says he ; " but -- but do n't hit me , Bob . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Robert , holding him at arm 's length and glarin ' at him hostile . " A ringer , eh ? " says I. " Worse than that , " says Mr. Robert , " a sneaking , contemptible hound ! Trying to pass yourself off for Melly , were you ? " he goes on . " Of all men , Melly ! What for ? " " I -- I did n't want you to know I was back , " whines Bunny . " And I had to get money somehow , Bob -- honest , I did . " " Bah ! " says Mr. Robert . " You -- you --  --  " But he ai n't got any such vocabulary as old Hickory Ellins has ; so here , when he needs it most , all he can do is express his deep disgust by shakin ' this Bunny party like a new hired girl dustin ' a rug . He jerks him this way and that so reckless that I was afraid he 'd rattle him apart , and when he fin'lly lets loose Bunny goes all in a heap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real wrathy before ; but it 's all over in a minute , and he glances around like he was ashamed . " Hang it all ! " says he , gazin ' at the wreck . " I did n't mean to lay my hands on him . " " He 's in punk condition , " says I. " What 's to be done , call an ambulance ? " That jars Mr. Robert a lot . I expect he was so worked up he did n't know how rough he was handlin ' him , and my suggestin ' that he 's qualified Bunny for a cot sobers him down in a minute . Next thing I knows he 's kneelin ' over the Blashford gent and liftin ' his head up . " Here , what 's the matter with you ? " says Mr. Robert . " Do n't ! Do n't strike me again , " moans Bunny , cringin ' . " No , no , I 'm not going to , " says Mr. Robert . " And I apologize for shaking you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in , " says Bunny , beginnin ' to sniffle . " Don't -- do n't beat me ! I -- I 'm going to die ; but -- but not here , like -- like this . I -- I do n't want to live ; but -- but I do n't want to finish this way , like a rat . Help me , Bob , to -- to finish decent . I know I do n't deserve it from you ; but -- but you would n't want to see me go like this -- dirty and ragged ? I -- I want to die clean and -- and well dressed . Please , Bob , for old time 's sake ? " " Nonsense , man ! " says Mr. Robert . " You 're not going to die now . " " Yes , I am , Bob , " says Bunny . " I -- I can tell . I want to , anyway . I -- I 'm no good . And I 'm in rotten shape . Drink , you know , and I 've a bad heart . I 'm near starved too . It 's been days since I 've eaten anything -- days ! " " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have something to eat . Here , let me help you up . Torchy , you take the other side . Steady , now ! I did n't know you were in such a condition ; really , I did n't . And we 'll get you filled up right away . " " I -- I could n't eat , " says Bunny . " I do n't want anything . I just want to quit -- only -- not like this ; but clean , Bob , clean and dressed decent once more . " Say , maybe you can guess about how cheerin ' it was , hearin ' him say that over and over in that whiny , tremblin ' voice of his , watchin ' them shifty , deep-set eyes glisten glassy under the light . About as comfortin ' a sight , he was , as a sick dog in a corner . And of all the rummy ideas to get in his nut -- that about bein ' dressed up to die ! But he keeps harpin ' away on it until fin'ly Mr. Robert takes notice . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to that , old man . But you need some nourishment in you first . " So we drags him over to the opposite corner , where there 's a drugstore , and got a glass of hot milk under his vest . Then I calls a taxi , and we all starts for the nearest Turkish bath joint . " That 's all , Torchy , " says Mr. Robert . " I wo n't bother you any more with this wretched business . You 'd best go now . " " Suppose something happens to him ? " says I. " You 'll need a witness , wo n't you ? " " I had n't thought of that , " says he . " There 's no tellin ' , " says I. " Them coroners deputies are mostly boneheads . I 'd better stay on the job . " " I know of no one I 'd rather have , Torchy , " says he . Course , he was stretchin ' it there . But we fixes it up that while Bunny is bein ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile Mr. Robert will ' phone his man to dig out one of his old dress suits , with fixin 's , which I 'm to collect and have waitin ' for Blashford . " Better have him barbered some too , had n't I ? " says I. " A lot , " says Mr. Robert , slippin ' me a couple of tens for expenses . " And when he 's all ready call me at the club . " So , take it all around , I has quite some busy evenin ' . I stayed long enough to see Bunny wrapped in a sheet and helped into the steam-room , and then I hustles out for a late dinner . It 's near nine-thirty before I rings Mr. Robert up again , and reports that Bunny would pass a Board of Health inspection now that he 's had the face herbage removed , that he 's costumed proper and correct , and that he 's decided not to die immediate . " Very well , " says Mr. Robert . " What does he want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " says I. " The deuce he does ! " says Mr. Robert . " Well , I suppose we might as well have it out ; so bring him up here . " That 's how it happens I 'm rung in on this little club corner chat ; for Mr. Robert explains that whatever passes between ' em it might be as well to have someone else hear . And , say , what a diff'rence a little outside upholstery can make , eh ? The steamin ' out had helped some , I expect , and a couple more glasses of hot milk had braced him up too ; but blamed if I 'd expect just a shave and a few open-face clothes could change a human ruin into such a perky lookin ' gent as this that leans back graceful against the leather cushions and lights up one of Mr. Robert 's imported cigarettes . Course , the eye hollows had n't been filled in , nor the face wrinkles ironed out ; but somehow they only gives him a sort of a distinguished look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's holdin ' his chin up once more , he 's almost ornamental . He do n't even seem embarrassed at meetin ' Mr. Robert again . If anyone was fussed , it was the boss . " Well ? " says he , as we gets settled in the cozy corner . " Seems natural as life here ; eh , Bob ? " says Bunny , glancin ' around approvin ' . " And it 's nearly four years since I -- er --  --  " " Since you were kicked out , " adds Mr. Robert . " See here , Bunny -- just because I 've helped you out of the gutter when I thought you were half dead , do n't run away with the idea that I 've either forgotten or forgiven ! " " Oh , quite so , " says he . " I 'm not asking that . " " Then you 've no excuse , " goes on Mr. Robert , " for the sneaking , cowardly way in which you left little Sally Slater waiting in her bridal gown , the house full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeBrett person ? " " No , " says Bunny , flippin ' his cigarette ashes off jaunty , " no excuse worthy of the name . " " Cad ! " says Mr. Robert . Bunny shrugs his shoulders . " Precisely , " says he . " But you are not making the discovery for the first time , are you ? You knew Sally was far too good for me . Everyone did , even Brother Melly . It could n't have been much of a secret to either of you how deep I was with the DeBrett too . Yet you wanted me to go on with Sally . Why ? Because the governor had n't chucked me overboard then , because I could still keep up a front ? " " You might have taken a brace , " says Mr. Robert . " Not I ! " says Bunny . " Anyway , not after Trixie DeBrett got hold of me . The trouble was , Bob , you did n't half appreciate her . She had beauty , brains , wit , a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrictor . I was just a rabbit to her , a meal . She thought the governor would buy her off , say , for a couple hundred thousand or so . I suppose he would too , if it had n't been for the Sally complication . He thought a lot of little Sally . And the way it happened was too raw . I do n't blame him , mind you , nor any of you . I do n't even blame Trixie . That was her game . And , by Jove ! she was a star at it . I 'd go back to her now if she 'd let me . " " You 're a fool ! " snorts Mr. Robert . " Always was , my dear Bob , " says Bunny placid . " You often told me as much . " " But I did n't think , " goes on Mr. Robert , " you 'd get as low as -- as tonight -- begging ! " " Quite respectable for me , I assure you , " says Bunny . " Why , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hardly a crime on the calendar I should n't have committed for a dollar -- barring murder , of course . That requires nerve . How long do you suppose the few thousands I got from Aunt Eunice lasted ? Barely six months . I thought I knew how to live rather luxuriously myself . But Trixie ! Well , she taught me . And we were in Paris , you know . I did n't cable the governor until I was down to my last hundred-franc note . His reply was something of a stinger . I showed it to Trixie . She just laughed and went out for a drive . She did n't come back . I hear she picked up a brewer 's son at Monte Carlo . Lucky devil , he was ! " And I ? What would you expect ? In less than two weeks I was a stowaway on a French liner . They routed me out and set me to stoking . I could n't stand that , of course ; so they put me to work in the kitchens , cleaning pots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to make the round trip too . Then I jumped the stinking craft , only to get a worse berth on a P. &; O. liner . I worked with Chinese , Lascars , coolies , the scum of the earth ; worked and ate and slept and fought with them . I crawled ashore and deserted in strange ports . I think it was at Aden where I came nearest to starving the first time . And I remember the docks at Alexandria . Sometimes the tourists threw down coppers for the Arab and Berber boys to scrabble for . It 's a pleasant custom . I was there , in that scrabbling , cursing , clawing rabble . And when I 'd had a good day I spent my coppers royally in a native dance-hall which even guides do n't dare show to the trippers . " Respectability , my dear Bob , is all a matter of comparison . I acquired a lot of new standards . As a second cabin steward on a Brazos liner I became quite haughty . Poverty ! You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Far East and the Far South . Here you have the Bowery Mission bread line . That 's a fair sample , Bob , of our American opulence . Free bread ! " " So you 've been in that , have you ? " asks Mr. Robert . " Have I ? " says Bunny . " I 've pals down there tonight who will wonder what has become of me . " Mr. Robert shudders . And , say , it made me feel chilly along the spine too . " Well , what now ? " says Mr. Robert . " I suppose you expect me to find you some sort of work ? " " Not at all , " says Bunny . " Another of those cigarettes , if you do n't mind . Excellent brand . Thanks . But work ? How inconsiderate , Bob ! I was n't born to be useful . You know that well enough . No , work does n't appeal to me . " Mr. Robert flushes up at that . " Then , " says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , what 's the hurry ? " says Bunny . " This is heaven to me , all this ,  - -  the old club , you know , and good tobacco , and -- say , Bob , if I might suggest , a pint of that ' 85 vintage would add just the finishing touch . Come , I have n't tasted a glass of fizz since -- well , I 've forgotten . Just for auld lang syne ! " Mr. Robert gasps , hesitates a second , and then pushes the button . Bunny inspects the label critical when it 's brought in , waves graceful to Mr. Robert , and slides the bottle back tender into the cooler . " Ah-h-h ! " says he . " And does n't Henri have any more of those dainty little caviar canapes on hand ? They go well with fizz . " " Canapes , " says Mr. Robert to the waiter . " And another box of those gold-tipped Russians . " " A vous ! " says Bunny , raisin ' a glassful of bubbles and salutin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But what I 'd like to know , " says Mr. Robert , " is what you propose doing . " " You , my dear fellow , " says Bunny , settin ' down the glass . " Truly enterprising ! " says Mr. Robert . " But you 're going to be disappointed . In just ten minutes I mean to escort you to the sidewalk , and then wash my hands of you for good . " Bunny laughs . " Impossible ! " says he . " In the first place , you could n't sleep tonight , if you did . Secondly , I should hunt you up tomorrow and make a nuisance of myself . " " You 'd be thrown out by a porter , " says Mr. Robert . " Perhaps , " says he ; " but it would n't look nice . I 'd be in evening clothes , you see . The crowd would know at once that I was a gentleman . Reporters would come . I should tell a most harrowing tale . You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would believe me . No , no , Bob ! Three hours ago , in my old rags , you might have kicked me into the gutter , and no one would have made any fuss at all . But now ! Why , it would be absurd ! I should make a mighty row over it . " " You threaten blackmail ? " says Mr. Robert , leanin ' towards him savage . " That is one of my more reputable accomplishments , " says Bunny . " But why force me to that ? I have quite a reasonable proposal to submit . " " If it has anything to do with getting you so far away from New York that you 'll never come back , I 'll listen to it , " says Mr. Robert . " You state the case exactly , " says Bunny . " In Paris I got to know a chap by the name of Dick Langdon ; English , you know , and a younger son . His uncle 's a Sir Something or Other . Dick was going the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found lying around loose . Purely a family affair ; no prosecution . A nice youth , Langdon . We were quite congenial . " A year or so ago I ran across him again , down in Santa Marta . He was wearing a sun helmet and a white linen suit . He said he 'd been shipped down there as superintendent of a banana plantation about twenty miles back from the port . He had half a hundred blacks and as many East Indian coolies under him . There was no one else within miles . Once a month he got down to see the steamer load and watch the white faces hungrily . I was only a cabin steward leaning over the rail ; but he was so tickled to see me that he begged me to quit and go back to the plantation with him . He said he 'd make me assistant superintendent , or permanent guest , or anything . But I was crazy to see New York once more . I would n't listen . Well , I 've seen New York , seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say ? " " When could you get a steamer ? " asks Mr. Robert . " The Arapequa sails at ten in the morning , " says Bunny eager . " Fare forty-eight dollars one way . I could go aboard now . Dick would hail me as a man and a brother . I 'm his kind . He 'd see that I never had money enough to get away . I think I might possibly earn my keep bossing coolies too . And the pulque down there helps you to forget your troubles . " " Torchy , " says Mr. Robert , " ask Barney to call a cab . " " And , by the way , " Bunny is sayin ' as I come back , " you might chuck in a business suit and a few white flannels into a grip , Bob . You would n't want me to arrive in South America dressed like this , would you ? " " Very well , " says Mr. Robert . " But what I 'm most concerned about is that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Robert , " says I next mornin ' , " that he will ? " " Because I locked him in his stateroom myself , " says he , " and bribed a steward not to let him out until he could see Barnegat light over the stern . " " Gee ! " says I. " That 's one way of losin ' a better days ' proposition . And in case any others like him turns up , Mr. Robert , have you got any more old dress suits ? " " If I have , " says he , " I shall burn them . " CHAPTER XII THE GLAD HAIL FOR TORCHY I 'll say this for Aunty : She 's doin ' her best . About all she 's omitted is lockin ' Vee in a safety deposit vault and forgettin ' the combination . Say , you 'd most think I was as catchin ' as a case of measles . I wish it was so ; for once in awhile , in spite of Aunty , Vee gets exposed . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes ' chat with the only girl that ever was ? It 's a wonder we do n't have to be introduced all over again . That would be the case with some girls . But Vee ! Say , lemme put you wise -- Vee 's different ! Uh-huh ! I found that out all by myself . I do n't know just where it comes in , or how , but she is . All of which makes it just so much worse when she and Aunty does the summer flit . Course , I saw it comin ' ' way back early in June , and then the first thing I know they 're gone . I gets a bulletin now and then ,  - -  Lenox , the Pier , Newport , and so on ,  - -  sometimes from Vee , sometimes by readin ' the society notes . Must be great to have the papers keep track of you , the way they do of Aunty . And it 's so comfortin ' to me , strayin ' lonesome into a Broadway movie show of a hot evening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in the Casino by Mrs. Percy Bonehead yesterday afternoon was Miss Verona Hemmingway . " Oh , sure ! Say , how many moves am I from a tea dance -- me here behind the brass rail at the Corrugated , with Piddie gettin ' fussy , and Old Hickory jabbin ' the buzzer ? And then , just when I 'm peevish enough to be canned and served with lamb chops , here comes this glad word out of the State of Maine . " It 's nice up here , " says she ; " but awfully stupid . VEE . " That 's all -- just a picture postcard . But , say , I 'd have put it in a solid gold frame if there 'd been one handy . As it is , I sticks the card up on the desk in front of me and gazes longin ' . Some shack , I should judge by the picture , one of these low , wide affairs , all built of cobblestones , with a red tile roof and yellow awnin 's . Right on the water too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front steps . Roarin ' Rocks , Maine , is the name of the place printed underneath . " Nice , but stupid , eh ? " says I confidential to myself . " That 's too bad . Wonder if I 'd be bored to death with a week or so up there ? I wonder what she 'd say if --  --  " B-r-r-r-r ! B-r-r-r-r-r ! That 's always the way ! I just get started on some rosy dream , and I 'm sailin ' aloft miles and miles away , when off goes that blamed buzzer , and back I flop into this same old chair behind the same old brass rail ! All for what ? Why , Mr. Robert wants a tub of desk pins . I gets ' em from Piddie , trots in , and slams ' em down snappy at Mr. Robert 's elbow . " Eh ? " says he , glancin ' up startled . " Said pins , dintcher ? " says I. " Why -- er -- yes , " says he , " I believe I did . Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my heel . " Oh -- er -- Torchy , " he adds . " Well ? " says I over my shoulder . " Might one inquire , " says he , " is it distress , or only disposition ? " " It ai n't the effect of too much fresh air , anyway , " says I. " Ah ! " says he , sort of reflective . " Feeling the need of a half holiday , are you ? " " Humph ! " says I. " What 's the good of an afternoon off ? " He 'd just come back from a two weeks ' cruise , Mr. Robert had , lookin ' tanned and husky , and a little later on he was goin ' off on another jaunt . Course , that 's all right , too . I 'd take ' em oftener if I was him . But hanged if I 'd sit there starin ' puzzled at any one else who could n't , the way he was doin ' at me ! " Mr. Robert , " says I , spunkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takin ' a vacation ? " " Why , " says he , " I -- I presume it might be arranged . When would you wish to go ? " " When ? " says I. " Why , now -- tonight . Say , honest , if I try to stick out the week I 'll get to be a grouch nurser , like Piddie . I 'm sick of the shop , sick of answerin ' buzzers , sick of everything ! " It was n't what you might call a smooth openin' ' , and from most bosses I expect it would have won me a free pass to all outdoors . But I guess Mr. Robert knows what these balky moods are himself . He only humps his eyebrows humorous and chuckles . " That 's rather abrupt , is n't it ? " says he . " But perhaps -- er -- just where is she now , Torchy ? " I grins back sheepish . " Coast of Maine , " says I. " Well , well ! " says he . " Then you 'll need a two weeks ' advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cashier . And there is a good express , I believe , at eight o'clock tonight . Luck to you ! " " Mr. Robert , " says I , choky , " you -- you 're I-double-It with me . Thanks . " " My best regards to Kennebunk , Cape Neddick , and Eggemoggen Reach , " says he as we swaps grips . Say , there 's some boss for you , eh ? But how he could dope out the symptoms so accurate is what gets me . Anyhow , he had the answer ; for I do n't stop to consult any vacation guidebook or summer tours pamphlet . I beats it for the Grand Central , pushes up to the ticket window , and calls for a round trip to Roaring Rocks . " Nothing doing , " says the guy . " Give you Bass Rocks , Seal Rocks , or six varieties of Spouting Rocks ; but no Roaring ones on the list . Any choice ? " " Gwan , you fresh Mellen seed ! " says I. " You got to have ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I shoves the postal at him . " Ah , yes , my young ruddy duck , " says he . " Postmarked Boothbay Harbor , is n't it ? Bath for yours . Change there for steamer . Upper 's the best I can do for you -- drawing rooms all gone . " " Seein ' how my private car 's bein ' reupholstered , I 'll chance an upper , " says I. " Only do n't put any nose trombone artist underneath . " Yes , I was feelin ' some gayer than a few hours before . What did I care if the old town was warmin ' up as we pulls out until it felt like a Turkish bath ? I was bound north on the map , with my new Norfolk suit and three outing shirts in my bag , a fair-sized wad of spendin ' kale buttoned into my back pocket , and that card of Vee 's stowed away careful . Say , I should worry ! And do n't they do some breezin ' along on that Bar Harbor express while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? " says I to Rastus in the washroom next mornin ' about six-thirty A. M. " Pohtland , Suh , " says he . " Breakfast stop , Suh . " " Me for it , then , " says I. " When in Maine be a maniac . " So I tackles a plate of pork-and on its native heath ; also a hunk of pie . M-m-m-m ! They sure can build pie up there ! It 's quite some State , Maine . Bath is several jumps on , and that next joint --  --  Say , it wa' n't until I 'd changed to the steamer and was lookin ' over my ticket that I sees anything familiar about the name . Boothbay ! Why , wa' n't that the Rube spot this Ira Higgins hailed from ? Maybe you remember ,  - -  Ira , who 'd come on to see Mr. Robert about buildin ' a new racin ' yacht , the tall , freckled gink with a love affair on his mind ? Why , sure , this was Ira 's Harbor I was headed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strange about explorin ' the State after that . For Ira , you know , is a friend of mine . Havin ' settled that with myself , I throws out my chest and roams around the decks , climbin ' every flight of stairs I came to , until I gets to a comfy little coop on the very top where a long guy wearin ' white suspenders over a blue flannel shirt is jugglin ' the steerin ' wheel . " Hello , Cap ! " says I. " How 's she headin ' ? " He ai n't one of the sociable kind , though . You 'd most thought , from the reprovin ' stare he gives me , that he did n't appreciate good comp'ny . " Ca n't you read ? " says he . " Ah , you mean the Keep-Out sign ? Sure , Pete , " says I ; " but I ca n't see it from in here . " " Then git out where you can see it plainer , " says he . " Ah , quit your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common herd , ai n't it ? Now , I --  --  Say , if it 'll make you feel any better , I 'll tell you who I am . " " Say it quick then , " says he . " Are you Woodrow Wilson , or only the Secretary of the Navy ? " " You 're warm , " says I. " I 'm a friend of Ira Higgins of Boothbay Harbor . " " Sho ! " says he , removin ' his pipe and beginnin ' to act human . " Happen to know Ira ? " says I. " Ought to , " says he . " First cousins . You from Boston ? " " Why , Cap ! " says I. " What have I ever done to you ? Now , honest , do I look like I -- but I 'll forgive you this time . New York , Cap : not Brooklyn , or Staten Island or the Bronx , you know , but straight New York , West 17th-st . And I 've come all this way just to see Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ira always did have all the luck . " Next crack he calls me Sorrel Top , and inside of five minutes we was joshin ' away chummy , me up on a tall stool alongside , and him pointin ' out all the sights . And , believe me , the State of Maine 's got some scenery scattered along the wet edge of it ! Honest , it 's nothin ' but scenery ,  - -  rocks and trees and water , and water and trees and rocks , and then a few more rocks . " How about when you hit one of them sharp ones ? " says I. " Government files a new edge on it , " says he . " They keep a gang that does nothin ' else . " " Think of that ! " says I. " I do n't see any lobsters floatin ' around , though . " " Too late in the day , " says he . " ' Fraid of gittin ' sunburned . You want to watch for ' em about daybreak . Millions then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. " All hangin ' onto a string , I expect . But why the painted posts stickin ' up out of the water ? " " Hitchin ' posts , " says he , " for sea hosses . " Oh , I got a bunch of valuable marine information from him , and when the second mate came up he added a lot more . If I had n't thought to tell ' em how there was always snow on the Singer and Woolworth towers , and how the East Side gunmen was on strike to raise the homicide price to three dollars and seventy-five cents , they 'd had me well Sweeneyed . As it was , I guess we split about even . Him findin ' Boothbay Harbor among all that snarl of islands and channels was n't any bluff , though . That was the real sleight of hand . As we 're comin ' up to the dock he points out Ira 's boatworks , just on the edge of the town . Half an hour later I 've left my baggage at the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same old Ira ; only he 's wearin ' blue overalls and a boiled shirt with the sleeves rolled up . " Roarin ' Rocks , eh ? " says he . " Why , that 's the Hollister place on Cunner Point , about three miles up . " " Can I get a trolley ? " says I. " Trolley ! " says he . " Why , Son , there ai n't any ' lectric cars nearer'n Bath . " " Gee , what a jay burg ! " says I. " How about a ferry , then ? " Ira shakes his head . Seems Roarin ' Rocks is a private joint , the summer place of this Mr. Hollister who 's described by Ira as " richer'n Croesus "  - -  whatever that might mean . Anyway , they 're exclusive parties that do n't encourage callers ; for the only way of gettin ' there is over a private road around the head of the bay , or by hirin ' a launch to take you up . " Generally , " says Ira , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , if they was expectin ' you --  --  " " That 's just it , " I breaks in , " they ai n't . Fact is , Ira , there 's a young lady visitin ' there with her aunt , and -- and -- well , Aunty and me ai n't so chummy as we might be . " " Just so , " says Ira , noddin ' wise . " Now my plan was to go up there and kind of stick around , you know , " says I , " sort of in the shade , until the young lady strolled out . " Ira shakes his head discouragin ' . " They 're mighty uppish folks , " says he . " Got ' No Trespass ' signs all over the place -- dogs too . " " Hellup ! " says I. " What am I up against ? Why do n't Aunty travel with a bunch of gumshoe guards and be done with it ? " " Tell you what , " says Ira , struck by a stray thought , " if lookin ' the place over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eb Westcott this afternoon when he baits . He 's got pots all around the point . " That do n't mean such a lot to me ; but my middle name is Brodie . " Show me Eb , " says I. He wa' n't any thrillin ' sight , Eb ; mostly rubber hip boots , flannel shirt , and whiskers . He could have been cleaner . So could his old tub of a lobster boat ; but not while he stuck to that partic'lar line of business , I guess . And , say , I know now what baitin ' is . It 's haulin ' up lobster pots from the bottom of the ocean and decoratin ' ' em inside with fish -- ripe fish , at that . The scheme is to lure the lobsters into the pot . Seems to work too ; but I guess a lobster ai n't got any sense of smell . " Better put on some old clothes fust , " advised Eb , and as I always like to dress the part I borrows a moldy suit of oilskins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonnets , and climbs aboard . It 's a one-lunger putt-putt -- and take it from me the combination of gasolene and last Tuesday 's fish ai n't anything like Eau d'Espagne ! Quite different ! Also I do n't care for that jumpy up and down motion one of these little boats gets on , specially after pie and beans for breakfast . Then Eb hands me the steerin ' ropes while he whittles some pressed oakum off the end of a brunette plug and loads his pipe . More perfume comin ' my way ! " Ever try smokin ' formaldehyde ? " says I. " Gosh , no ! " says Eb . " What 's it like ? " " You could n't tell the difference , " says I. " We git tin tags off 'm Sailor 's Pride , " says Eb . " Save up fifty , and you git a premium . " " You ought to , " says I , " and a pension for life . " " Huh ! " says Eb . " It 's good eatin ' too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug invitin ' . " Do n't tempt me , " says I. " I promised my dear old grandmother I would n't . " " Lookin ' a little peaked , ai n't you ! " says he . " Most city chaps do when they fust come ; but after ' bout a month of this --  --  " " Chop it , Eb ! " says I. " I 'm feelin ' unhappy enough as it is . A month of this ? Ah , say ! " After awhile we begun stoppin ' to bait . Eb would shut off the engine , run up to a float , haul in a lot of clothesline , and fin'lly pull up an affair that 's a cross between a small crockery crate and an openwork hen-coop . Next he 'd grab a big needle and string a dozen or so of the gooey fish on a cord . I watched once . After that I turned my back . By way of bein ' obligin ' , Eb showed me how to roll the flywheel and start the engine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I looked , and he did n't mind lettin ' me do it right along . Friendly old yap , Eb was . I kept on rollin ' the wheel . So about three P. M. , as we was workin ' our way along the shore , Eb looks up and remarks , " Here 's the Hollister place , Roarin ' Rocks . " Sure enough there it was , almost like the postcard picture , only not colored quite so vivid . " Folks are out airin ' themselves too , " he goes on . They were . I could see three or four people movin ' about on the veranda ; for we wa' n't more'n half a block away . First off I spots Aunty . She 's paradin ' up and down , stiff and stately , and along with her waddles a wide , dumpy female in pink . And next , all in white , and lookin ' as slim and graceful as an Easter lily , I makes out Vee ; also a young gent in white flannels and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swingin ' a racket jaunty . I could even hear Vee 's laugh ripple out across the water . You remember how she put it too , " nice , but awfully stupid . " Seems she was makin ' the best of it , though . And here I was , in Ira 's baggy oilskins , my feet in six inches of oily brine , squattin ' on the edge of a smelly fish box tryin ' to hold down a piece of custard pie ! No , that wa' n't exactly the rosy picture I threw on the screen back in the Corrugated gen'ral offices only yesterday . Nothing like that ! I do n't do any hoo-hooin ' , or wave any private signals . I pulls the sticky sou'wester further down over my eyes and squats lower in the boat . " Look kind o ' gay and festive , do n't they ? " says Eb , straightenin ' up and wipin ' his hands on his corduroys . " Who 's the party in the tennis outfit ? " says I. " Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must be young Hollister , that owns the mahogany speed boat . Stuck up young dude , I guess . Wall , five more traps to haul , and we 're through , Son . " " Let 's go haul ' em , then , " says I , grabbin ' the flywheel . Great excursion , that was ! Once more on land , I sneaked soggy footed up to the hotel and piked for my room . I shied supper and went to the feathers early , trustin ' that if I could get stretched out level with my eyes shut things would stop wavin ' and bobbin ' around . That was good dope too . I rolled out next mornin ' feelin ' fine and silky ; but not so cocky by half . Somehow , I wa' n't gettin ' any of the lucky breaks I 'd looked for . My total programme for the day was just to bat around Boothbay . And , say , of all the lonesome places for city clothes and a straw lid ! Honest , I never saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white ducks and sneakers and canvas shoes , girls in middie blouses , old guys in white flannels and yachtin ' caps , even old ladies dressed sporty and comf'table -- and more square feet of sunburn than would cover Union Square . I felt like a blond Eskimo at a colored camp meetin ' . As everyone was either comin ' from or goin ' to the docks , I wanders down there too , and loafs around watchin ' the steamers arrive , and the big sailin ' yachts anchored off in the harbor , and the little boats dodgin ' around in the choppy water . There 's a crisp , salty breeze that 's makin ' the flags snap , the sun 's shinin ' bright , and take it altogether it 's some brilliant scene . Only I 'm on the outside peekin ' in . " What 's the use ? " thinks I. " I 'm off my beat up here . " Fin'lly I drifts down to the Yacht Club float , where the launches was comin ' in thick . I must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word with anybody , and gettin ' lonesomer by the minute , when in from the harbor dashes a long , low , dark-colored boat and comes rushin ' at the float like it meant to make a hydroplane jump . At the wheel I gets sight of a young chap who has sort of a worried , scared look on his face . Also he 's wearin ' a striped blazer . " Young Hollister , maybe , " thinks I. " And he 's in for a smash . " Just then he manages to throw in his reverse ; but it 's a little late , for he 's got a lot of headway . Honest , I did n't think it out . And I was achin ' to butt into something . I jumped quick , grabbed the bow as it came in reach , shoved it off vigorous , and brought him alongside the fenders without even scratchin ' the varnish . " Thanks , old chap , " says he . " Saved me a bad bump there . I -- I 'm greatly obliged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You was steamin ' in a little strong . " " I have n't handled the Vixen much myself , " says he . " You see , our boatman 's laid up ,  - -  sprained ankle ,  - -  and I had to come down from the Rocks for some gasolene . " " Oh ! Roarin ' Rocks ? " says I. " Yes , " says he . " Where 's that fool float tender ? " " Just gone into the clubhouse , " says I. " Maybe I could keep her from bumpin ' while you 're gone . " " By Jove ! would you ? " says he , handin ' over a boathook . Even then I was n't layin ' any scheme . I helps when they puts the gas in , and makes myself generally useful . Also I 'm polite and respectful , which seems to make a hit with him . " Deuced bother , " says he , " not having any man . I had a picnic planned for today too . " " That so ? " says I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just killin ' time around here , and if I could help any way --  --  " " Oh , I say , but that 's jolly of you , " says he , " I wonder if you would , for a day or so ? My name 's Hollister , Payne Hollister . " He was n't Payne to me . He was Joy . Easy ? Why , he fairly pushes me into it ! Digs a white jumper out of a locker for me , and a little round canvas hat with " Vixen " on the front , and trots back uptown to buy me a swell pair of rubber-soled deck shoes . Business of quick change for yours truly . Then look ! Say , here I am , just about the yachtiest thing in sight , leanin ' back on the steerin ' seat cushions of a classy speed boat that 's headed towards Vee at a twenty-mile clip . CHAPTER XIII AUNTY FLAGS A ROSY ONE Lemme see , I was headed out of Boothbay Harbor , Maine , bound for Roarin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in a white jumper and little round canvas hat with " Vixen " printed across the front , white shoes too , and altogether as yachty as they come . Do n't forget young Mr. Payne Hollister at the wheel , either ; although whether I 'd kidnapped him , or he 'd kidnapped me , is open for debate . Anyway , here I was , subbin ' incog for the reg'lar crew , who was laid up with a sprained ankle . All that because I 'd got the happy hail from Vee on a postcard . It wa' n't any time for unpleasant thoughts then ; but I could n't help wonderin ' how soon Aunty would loom on the horizon and spoil it all . " So there 's a picnic on the slate , eh ? " I suggests . Young Mr. Hollister nods . " I 'd promised some of the folks at the house , " says he . " Guests , you know . " " Oh , yes , " says I , feelin ' a little shiver flicker down my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So was Aunty . The picnic prospects might have been more allurin ' . But I 'd butted in , and this was no time to back out . Besides , I was more or less interested in sizin ' up Payne Hollister . Tall , slim , young gent ; dark , serious eyes ; nose a little prominent ; and his way of speakin ' and actin ' a bit pompous , one of them impatient , quick-motioned kind that wants to do everything in a minute . He keeps gettin ' up and starin ' ahead , like he wa' n't quite sure where he was goin ' , and then leanin ' over to squint at the engine restless . " Just see if those forward oil cups are full , will you ? " says he . I climbs over and inspects . Everything seems to be O. K. ; although what I do n't know about a six-cylinder marine engine is amazin ' . " We 're slidin ' through the water slick , " says I. " She can turn up much faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't dare open her wide . " I was satisfied . I could use a minute or so about then to plot out a few scenarios dealin ' with how a certain party would act in case of makin ' a sudden discovery . But I had n't got past picturin ' the cold storage stare before the Hollister place shows up ahead , Payne throttles the Vixen down cautious , shoots her in between a couple of rocky points , and fetches her up alongside a rope-padded private float . There 's some steps leadin ' up to the top of the rocks . " Do you mind running up and asking if they 're ready ? " says Payne . " Why , no , " says I ; " but -- but who do I ask ? " " That 's so , " says he . " And they 'll not know who you are , either . I 'll go . Just hold her off . " Me with a boathook , posin ' back to for the next ten minutes , not even darin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the coffee bottles ? "  --  " Do n't forget the steamer rugs . "  --  " I put the olives on the top of the sandwiches . "  --  " Be careful when you land , Mabel dear . "  --  " Oh , we 'll be all right . " This last from Vee . Another minute and they 're down on the float , with Payne Hollister explainin ' , " Oh , I forgot . This is someone who is helping me with the boat while Tucker 's disabled . " I touches my hat respectful ; but I 'm too busy to face around -- much too busy ! " Now , Cousin Mabel , " says young Hollister , " right in the middle of that seat ! Easy , now ! " A squeal from Mabel . No wonder ! I gets a glimpse of her as she steps down , and , believe me , if I had Mabel 's shape and weight you could n't tease me out on the water in anything smaller'n the Mauretania ! All the graceful lines of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down , and ' most as much around . Vee is on one side , Payne on the other , both lowerin ' away careful ; but as she makes the final plunge before floppin ' onto the seat she reaches out one paw and annexes my right arm . Course that swings me around sudden , and I finds myself gazin ' at Vee over Payne Hollister 's shoulders , not three feet away . " Oh ! " says she , startled , and you could n't blame her . I just has to lay one finger on my lips and shake my head mysterious . " All right ! " sings out Payne , straightenin ' up . " Always more or less exciting getting Cousin Mabel aboard ; but it 's been accomplished . Now , Verona ! " As he gives her a hand she floats in as light as a bird landin ' in a treetop . I could feel her watchin ' me curious and puzzled as I passes the picnic junk down for Hollister to stow away . Course , it wa' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makin ' at Roarin ' Rocks ; but it 's a lot better , thinks I , than not bein ' there at all . " Oh , dear , " sighs Mabel , " what a narrow , uncomfortable seat ! " " Is it , really ? " asks Vee . " Ca n't it be fixed someway , Payne ? " " Lemme have a try ? " says I. With that I stuffs extra cushions around her , folds up a life preserver to rest her feet on , and drapes her with a steamer rug . " Thanks , " says she , sighin ' grateful and rewardin ' me with a display of dimples . " What is your name , young man ? " " Why , " says I , with a glance at Vee , " you can just call me Bill . " " Nonsense ! " says Mabel . " Your name is William . " " William goes , Miss , " says I ; and as she snuggles down I chances a wink Vee 's way . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ought to grin or give me the call-down . " Cast off ! " says Payne , and out between the rocks we shoot , with Aunty and Mrs. Hollister wavin ' from the veranda . Anyway , that was some relief . This wa' n't Aunty 's day for picnickin ' . She did n't know what she was missin ' , I expect ; for , say , that 's good breathin ' air up off Boothbay . There 's some life and pep to it , and rushin ' through it that way you ca n't help pumpin ' your lungs full . Makes you glow and tingle inside and out . Makes you want to holler . That , and the sunshine dancin ' on the water , and the feel of the boat slicin ' through the waves , the engine purrin ' away a sort of rag-time tune , and the pennants whippin ' , and all that scenery shiftin ' around to new angles , not to mention the fact that Vee 's along -- well , I was enjoyin ' life about then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I did n't care what happened next . Me bein ' the crew , I expect I should have been fussin ' around up front , coilin ' ropes , or groomin ' the machinery . But I ca n't make my eyes behave . I has to turn around every now and then and grin . Mabel do n't seem to mind . " William , " says she , signalin ' me , " see if you ca n't find a box of candy in that basket . " I hops over the steerin ' seat back into the standin ' room and digs it out . Also I lingers around while Mabel feeds in a few pieces . " Have some ? " says she . " You 're so good-natured looking . " " That 's my long suit , " says I. Then I see Vee 's mouth corners twitching and she takes her turn . " You live around here , I suppose , William ? " says she . " No such luck , " says I. " I come up special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts in Mabel , holdin ' a fat chocolate cream in the air , " Tucker was n't hurt until yesterday . " " That 's when I landed , " says I. " Someone must have sent you word then , " says Vee , impish . " Uh-huh , " says I. " Someone mighty special too . Sweet of her , wa' n't it ? " " Oh ! A girl ? " asks Mabel , perkin ' up . " The girl , " says I. " Tee-hee ! " snickers Mabel , nudgin ' Vee delighted . " Is -- is she very nice , William ? Tell us about her , wo n't you ? " " Oh , do ! " says Vee , sarcastic . " Well , " says I , lookin ' at Vee , " she 's about your height and build . " " How interesting ! " says Mabel , with another nudge . " Go on . What kind of hair ? " " Never was any like it , " says I. " But her complexion , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pink roses in the mornin ' , with the dew on , " says I. " Bravo ! " says Mabel , clappin ' her hands . " And her eyes ? " " Why , " says I , " maybe you 've looked down into deep sea water on a still , gray day ? That 's it . " " She must be a beauty , " says Mabel . " Nothing but , " says I. " I hope she has a nice disposition too , " says she . " Nope , " says I , shakin ' my head solemn . " Humph ! What 's the matter with that ? " says Vee . " Jumpy , " says I. " Red pepper and powdered sugar ; sometimes all sugar , sometimes all pepper , then again a mixture . You never can tell . " " Then I 'd throw her over , " says Vee . " Honest , would you ? " says I , lookin ' her square in the eye . " If I did n't like her disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the best part of her to me , " says I. " Adds variety , you know , and -- well , I expect it 's about the only way I 'm like her . Mine is apt to be that way too . " " Why , of course , " comes in Mabel . " If she was as pretty as all that , and angelic too --  --  " " You got the idea , " says I. " She 'd be in a stained glass window somewhere , eh ? " " You 're a silly boy ! " says Vee . " That sounds natural , " says I. " I often get that from her . " " And is she living up here ? " asks Mabel . " Visiting , " says I. " She 's with her --  --  " " William , " breaks in Vee , " I think Mr. Hollister wants you . " I 'd most forgot about Payne ; for , while he 's only a few feet off , he 's as much out of the group as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them high-powered launches with the engine runnin ' . You ca n't hear a word unless you 're right close to . And Payne 's twistin ' around restless . " Yes , Sir ? " says I , goin ' up and reportin ' . " Ask Miss Verona if she does n't want to come up here , " says he . " I -- I think it will trim the boat better . " " Sure , " says I. But when I passes the word to Vee I translates . " Mr. Hollister 's lonesome , " says I , " and there 's room for another . " " I 've been wondering if I could n't , " says Vee . " You can , " says I. " Lemme help you over . " Gives me a chance for a little hand squeeze and another close glimpse into them gray eyes . I do n't make out anything definite , though . But as she passes forward she puckers her lips saucy and whispers , " Pepper ! " in my ear . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description you do n't want to stick too close to facts . Makin ' it all stained glass window stuff is safer . I goes back to Mabel and lets her demand more details . She 's just full of romance , Mabel is ; not so full , though , that it interferes with her absorbin ' a few eats now and then . Between answerin ' questions I 'm kept busy handin ' out crackers , oranges , and doughnuts , openin' ' the olive bottle , and gettin ' her drinks of water . Reg'lar Consumers ' League , Mabel . I never run a sausage stuffin ' machine ; but I think I could now . " You 're such a handy young man to have around , " says Mabel , after I 've split a Boston cracker and lined it with strawb'ry jam for her ; " so much better than Tucker . " " That 's my aim , " says I , " to make you forget Tucker . " Yes , I was gettin ' some popular with Mabel , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be havin ' quite a chatty time of it , Payne showin ' her how to steer , and lettin ' her salute passin ' launches , and explainin ' how the engine worked . As far as them two went , Mabel and me was only so much excess baggage . " Why , we 're clear out beyond Squirrel ! " exclaims Mabel at last . " Ask Payne where we 're going to stop for our picnic . I 'm getting hungry . " " Oh , yes , " says Payne , " we must be thinking about landing . I had planned to run out to Damariscove ; but that looks like a fog bank hanging off there . Perhaps we 'd better go back to Fisherman 's Island , after all . Tell her Fisherman 's . " I could n't see what the fog bank had to do with it -- not then , anyway . Why , it was a peach of a day ,  - -  all blue sky , not a sign of a cloud anywhere , and looked like it would stay that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea for awhile longer , and then all of a sudden he circles short and starts back . " Fog ! " he shouts over his shoulder to Mabel . " Oh , bother ! " says Mabel . " I hate fog . And it is coming in too . " Yes , that bank did seem to be workin ' its way toward us , like a big , gray curtain that 's bein ' shoved from the back drop to the front of the stage . You could n't see it move , though ; but as I watched blamed if it do n't creep up on an island , a mile or so out , and swallow it complete , same as a picture fades off a movie screen when the lights go wrong . Just like that . Then a few wisps of thin mist floats by , makin ' things a bit hazy ahead . Squirrel Island , off to the left , disappears like it had gone to the bottom . The mainland shore grows vague and blurred , and the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenery 's all smudged out , and nothin ' in sight but this pearl-gray mist . It ai n't very thick , you know , and only a little damp . Rummy article , this State of Maine fog ! Young Hollister is standin ' up now , tryin ' to keep his bearin 's and doin ' his best to look through the haze . He slows the engine down until we 're only just chuggin ' along . " Let 's see , " says he , " was n't Squirrel off there a moment ago ? " " Why , no , " says Vee . " I thought it was more to the left . " " By Jove ! " says he . " And there are rocks somewhere around here too ! " Funny how quick you can get turned around that way . Inside of three minutes I could n't have told where we were at , any more'n if I 'd been blindfolded in a cellar . And I guess young Hollister got to that condition soon after . " We ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he observes . But we did n't . He has me climb out on the bow to sing out if I see anything . But , say , there was less to see than any spot I was ever in . I watched and watched , and Payne kept on gettin ' nervous . And still we keeps chuggin ' and chuggin ' , steerin ' first one way and then the other . It seemed hours we 'd been gropin ' around that way when --  --  " Rocks ahead ! " I sings out as something dark looms up . Payne turns her quick ; but before she can swing clear bang goes the bow against something solid and slides up with a gratin ' sound . He tries backin ' off ; but she do n't budge . " Hang it all ! " says Payne , shuttin ' off the engine . " I guess we 're stuck . " " Then why not have the picnic right here ? " pipes up Mabel . " Here ! " snaps Payne . " But I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference ? " says Mabel . " Besides , I 'm hungry . " " I want to get out of this , though , " says Payne . " I mean to keep going until I know where I am . " " Oh , fudge ! " says Mabel . " This is good enough . And if we stay here and have a nice luncheon perhaps the fog will go away . What 's the sense in drifting around when you 're hungry ? " That did n't seem such bad dope , either . Vee sides with Mabel , and while Payne do n't like the idea he gives in . We seem to have landed somewhere . So we carts the baskets and things ashore , finds a flat place up on the rocks , and then the three of us tackles the job of hoistin ' Mabel onto dry land . And it was some enterprise , believe me ! " Goodness ! " pants Mabel , after we 'd got her planted safe . " I do n't know how I 'm ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either ; but after we 'd spread out five kinds of sandwiches within her reach , poured hot coffee out of the patent bottles , opened the sardines and pickles , set out the cake and doughnuts , Mabel ceases to worry . Payne do n't , though . He swallows one sandwich , and then goes back to inspect the boat . He announces that the tide is comin ' in and she ought to float soon ; also that when she does he wants to start back . " Now , Payne ! " protests Mabel . " Just when I 'm comfortable ! " " And there is n't any hurry , is there ? " asks Vee . I wa' n't so stuck on buttin ' around in the fog myself ; so when he asks me to go down and see if the launch is afloat yet , and I finds that she can be pushed off easy , I do n't hurry about tellin ' him so . Instead I climbs aboard and develops an idea . You see , when I was out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd noticed him stop the engine just by jerkin ' a little wire off the spark plug . Here was a whole bunch of wires , though . Would n't do to unhitch ' em all . But along the inside of the boat is a little box affair that they all lead into , with one big wire leadin ' out . Looked kind of businesslike , that one did . I unhitches it gentle and drapes it over a nearby screwhead . Then I strolls back and reports that she 's afloat . " Good ! " says Payne . " I 'll just start the engine and be tuning her up while the girls finish luncheon . " Well , maybe you can guess . I could hear him windin ' away at the crankin ' wheel , windin ' and windin ' , and then stoppin ' to cuss a little under his breath . " What 's the matter ? " sings out Mabel . She was one of the kind that 's strong on foolish questions . " How the blazes should I know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start the blasted thing . " " Never mind , " says Mabel cheerful . " We have n't finished the sandwiches yet . " Next time I takes a peek Payne has his tool kit spread out and is busy takin ' things apart . He 's getting ' himself all smeared up with grease and oil too . Pity ; for he 'd started out lookin ' so neat and nifty . Meanwhile we 'd fed Mabel to the limit , got her propped up with cushions , and she 's noddin ' contented . " Guess I 'll do some exploring " says I. " But I 've been wanting to do that this half-hour , " says Vee . " Well , let 's then , " says I. " Go on , " says Mabel , " and tell me about it afterward . " Oh , yes , we explores . Say , I 'm a bear for that too ! You have to go hand in hand over the rocks , to keep from slippin ' . And the fog makes it all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the edge . Then we cross in another direction , and comes to more edge . " Why , we 're on a little island ! " says Vee . " Big enough for us , " says I. " Here 's a good place to sit down too . " We settles ourselves in a snug little corner that gives us a fine view of the fog . " How silly of you to come away up here , " says Vee , " just because -- well , just because . " " It 's the only wise move I was ever guilty of , " says I. " I feel like I had Solomon in the grammar grade . " " But how did you happen to get here -- with Payne ? " says she . " Hypnotized him , " says I. " That part was a cinch . " " And until to-day you did n't know where we were , or anything , " says she . " I scouted around a bit yesterday afternoon , " says I. " Saw you too . " " Yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came near all the afternoon ; that is , only a couple of lobstermen in a horrid , smelly old boat . " " Uh-huh , " says I. " One was me , in disguise . " " Torchy ! " says she , gaspin ' . And somehow she snuggles up a little closer after that . " I did n't think when I wrote , " she goes on , " that you would be so absurd . " " Maybe I was , " says I. " But I took it straight , that part about it bein ' stupid up here . I was figurin ' on liftin ' the gloom . I had n't counted on Payne . " " Well , what then ? " says she , tossin ' her chin up . " Nothin ' , " says I. " Guess you were right , too . " " He only came the other day , " says Vee ; " but he 's nice . " " Aunty thinks so too , do n't she ? " says I. " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , is he ? " says I. Vee flushes . " I do n't care ! " says she . " He is rather nice . " " Correct , " says I. " I found him that way too ; but ai n't he -- well , just a little stiff in the neck ? " That brings out a giggle . " Poor Payne ! " says Vee . " He is something of a stick , you know . " " We 'll forgive him for that , " says I. " We 'll forgive Mabel . We 'll forgive the fog . Eh ? " Then my arm must have slipped . " Why , Torchy ! " says she . " Oh ! " says I. " Thought you were too near the edge . " And the side clinch wa' n't disturbed . Illustration : Then my arm must have slipped -- and the side clinch wa' n't disturbed . Some chat too ! I do n't know when we 've had a chance for any such a good long talk as that , and we both seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we chucked pebbles into the water , and Vee pulls some seaweed and decorates my round hat . You know ? It 's easy killin ' time when you 're paired off right . And the first thing we knows the fog begins to lighten and the sun almost breaks through . We hurries back to where Mabel 's just rousin ' from a doze . " Well ? " says she . " It 's a tiny little island we 're on , " says Vee . " Nice little island , though , " says I. " Hey ! " sings out Payne , pokin ' his head up over the rocks . " I 've been calling and calling . " " We 've been explorin ' , " says I. " Got her fixed yet ? " " Hang it , no ! " growls Payne , scrubbin ' cotton waste over his forehead . " And the fog 's beginning to lift . Why , there 's the shore , and -- and -- well , what do you think of that ? We 're on Grampus Ledges , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Roarin ' Rocks just showin ' up . " Now if I could only start this confounded engine ! " says he , starin ' down at it puzzled . By this time Vee and Mabel appears , and of course Mabel wants to know what 's the matter . " I 'm sure I ca n't tell , " says Payne , sighin ' hopeless . " Wirin ' all right , is it ? " says I , climbin ' in and lookin ' scientific . And -- would you believe it ?  - -  I only paws around a minute or so before I finds a loose magneto connection , hooks it up proper , and remarks casual , " Now let 's try her . " Pur-r-r-r-r ! Off she goes . " There ! " exclaims Mabel . " I shall never go out again unless William is along . He 's so handy ! " Say , she stuck to it . Four days I was chief engineer of the Vixen -- and , take it from me , they was perfectly good days . No more fog . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makin ' excursions here and there , with Vee trippin ' down to the dock every day in a fresher and newer yachtin ' costume , and lookin ' pinker and sweeter every trip . Course , as regards a certain other party , it was a case of artistic dodgin ' for me between times . You got to admit , though , that it wa' n't a fair test for Aunty . I had her off her guard . Might have been diff'rent too , if she 'd cared for motorboatin ' . So maybe I got careless . I remember once passin ' Aunty right in the path , as I 'm luggin ' some things up to the house , and all I does is to hoist the basket up on my shoulder between me and her and push right along . Then here the last morning just as we got under way for a run to Damariscotta , she and Mrs. Hollister was up on the cliff seein ' us off . All the rest was wavin ' ; so just for sport I takes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vee as I makes the play . But , say , next time I looks back she 's up on the veranda with the fieldglasses trained on us . I keeps my hat on after that . My kind of red hair is prominent enough to the naked eye at almost any distance -- but with fieldglasses ! Good night ! It was a day for forgettin ' things , though . Ever sailed up the Scotty River on a perfect August day , with the sun on the green hills , a sea breeze tryin ' to follow the tide in , and the white gulls swingin ' lazy overhead ? It 's worth doin ' . Then back again , roundin ' Ocean Point about sunset , with the White Islands all tinted up pink off there , and the old Atlantic as smooth as a skatin ' rink as far out as you can see , and streaked with more colors than a crazy cubist can sling , some peaceful picture . But what a jar to find Aunty , grim and forbidding waitin ' on the dock . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but me had started for the house . Then I got mine . " Boy , " says she icy , " take off that hat ! " I does it reluctant . " Humph ! " says she . " William ! I thought so . " That 's all ; but she says it mighty expressive . The programme for the followin ' day included a ten o'clock start , and I 'd been down to the boat ever since breakfast , tidyin ' things up and sort of wonderin ' . About nine-fifteen , though , young Hollister comes wanderin ' down by his lonesome . " It 's all off , " says he . " Miss Verona and her aunt have gone . " " Eh ? " says I , gawpin ' . " Gone ? " " Early this morning , " says he . " I do n't quite understand why ; something about Verona 's being out on the water so much , I believe . Gone to the mountains . And -- er -- by the way , Tucker is around again . Here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , " says I , peelin ' it off . " I guess I 'm due back on Broadway . " " It 's mighty good of you to help out , " says Payne , " and I -- I want to do the right thing in the way of --  --  " " You have , " says I. " You 've helped me have the time of my life . Put up the kale , Hollister . If you 'll land me at the Harbor , I 'll call it square . " He do n't want to let it stand that way ; but I insists . As I climbs out on the Yacht Club float , where he 'd picked me up , he puts out his hand friendly . " And , say , " says I , " how about Miss Vee ? " " Why , " says he , " I 'm very sorry she could n't stay longer . " " Me too , " says I. " Some girl , eh ? " Payne nods hearty , and we swaps a final grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not wearin ' a wig . CHAPTER XIV CUTTING IN ON THE BLISS We thought it was all over too . That 's the way it is in plays and books , where they do n't gen'rally take ' em beyond the final clinch , leavin ' you to fill in the bliss ad lib . But here we 'd seen ' em clear through the let-no-man-put-asunder stage , even watched ' em dodge the rice and confetti in their dash to the limousine . " Thank goodness that 's through with ! " remarks Mother , without makin ' any bones of it . Course , her reg'lar cue was to fall on Father 's neck and weep ; but , then , I expect Mrs. Cheyne Ballard 's one of the kind you ca n't write any form sheet for . She 's a lively , bunchy little party , all jump and go and jingle , who looks like she might have been married herself only day before yesterday . " I hope Robbie knows where she put those trunk checks , " says Father , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I stood , though , the guy who was pushin ' overboard the biggest chunk of worry was this I-wilt boy , Mr. Nicholas Talbot . He 'd got her at last ! But , z-z-z-zingo ! it had been some lively gettin ' . Not that I was all through the campaign with him ; but I 'd had glimpses here and there . You see , Robbie 's almost one of the fam'ly ; for Mr. Robert 's an old friend of the Ballards , and was bottle holder or something at the christenin ' . As a matter of fact , she was named Roberta after him . Then he 'd watched her grow up , and always remembered her birthdays , and kept her latest picture on his desk . So why should n't he figure more or less when so many others was tryin ' to straighten out her love affairs ? They was some tangled there for awhile too . Robbie 's one of the kind , you know , that would have Cupid cross-eyed in one season . A queen ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks was tinted up natural would have a gold medal rose lookin ' like it come off a twenty-nine-cent roll of wall paper . Then them pansy-colored eyes ! Yes , Miss Roberta Ballard was more or less ornamental . That wa' n't all , of course . She could say more cute things , and cut loose with more unexpected pranks , than a roomful of Billie Burkes . As cunnin ' as a kitten , she was . No wonder Nick Talbot fell for her the first time he was exposed ! Course , he was half engaged to that stunnin ' Miss Marian Marlowe at the time ; but wa' n't Robbie waverin ' between three young chaps that all seemed to be in the runnin ' before Nick showed up ? Anyway , Miss Marlowe should have known better than to lug in her steady when she was visitin ' . She 'd been chummy with Robbie at boardin ' school , and should have known how dangerous she was . But young Mr. Talbot had only two looks before he 's as strong for Robbie as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Impetuous young gent that way he was too ; and , bein ' handicapped by no job , and long on time and money , he does some spirited rushin ' . Seems Robbie Ballard did n't mind . Excitement was her middle name , novelty was her strong suit , and among Nick 's other attractions he was brand new . Besides , wa' n't he a swell one-stepper , a shark at tennis , and could n't he sing any ragtime song that she could drum out ? The ninety-horse striped racin ' car that he came callin ' in helped along some ; for one of Robbie 's fads was for travelin ' fast . Course , she 'd been brought up in limousines ; but the mile in fifty seconds gave her a genuine thrill . When it come to holdin ' out her finger for the big solitaire that Nick flashed on her about the third week , though , she hung back . The others carried about the same line of jew'lry around in their vest pockets , waitin ' for a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes too . Then there was another entry , with the dearest little mustache , who was a bear at doin ' the fish-walk tango with her ; not to mention the young civil engineer she 'd met last winter at Palm Beach . But he did n't actually count , not bein ' on the scene . Anyway , three was enough to keep guessin ' at once . Robbie was real modest that way . But she sure did have ' em all busy . If it was a sixty-mile drive with Nick before luncheon , it was apt to be an afternoon romp in the surf with the gray-eyed one , and a toss up as to which of the trio took her to the Casino dance in the evenin ' . Mother used to laugh over it all with Mr. Robert , who remarked that those kids were absurd . Nobody seemed to take it serious ; for Robbie was only a few months over nineteen . But young Mr. Talbot had it bad . Besides , he 'd always got about what he wanted before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first thing Mother and Father knew they were bein ' interviewed . Robbie had half said she might if there was no kick from her dear parents , and he wanted to know how about it . Mr. Cheyne Ballard supplied the information prompt . He called Nick an impudent young puppy , at which Mother wept and took the young gent 's part . Robbie blew in just then and giggled through the rest of the act , until Father quit disgusted and put it square up to her . Then she pouted and locked herself in her room . That 's when Mr. Robert was sent for ; but she would n't give him any decision , either . So for a week there things was in a mess , with Robbie balkin ' , Mother havin ' a case of nerves , Father nursin ' a grouch , and Nick Talbot mopin ' around doleful . Then some girl friend suggested to Robbie that if she did take Nick they could have a moonlight lawn weddin ' , with the flower gardens all lit up by electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbie perked up and asked for details . Inside of an hour she was plannin ' what she would wear . Late in the afternoon Nick heard the glad news himself , through a third party . First off the date was set for early next spring , when she 'd be twenty . That was Father 's dope ; although Mother was willin ' it should be pulled off around Christmas time . Nick , he stuck out for the first of October ; but Robbie says : " Oh , pshaw ! There wo n't be any flowers then , and we 'll be back in town . Why not week after next ? " So that 's the compromise fin'lly agreed on . The moonlight stunt had to be scratched ; but the outdoor part was stuck to -- and believe me it was some classy hitchin ' bee ! They 'd been gone about two weeks , I guess , with everybody contented except maybe the three losers , and all hands countin ' the incident closed ; when one forenoon Mother shows up at the general offices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away moppin ' her eyes . Then there 's a call for Mr. Cheyne Ballard 's downtown number , and Mr. Robert has a confab with him over the ' phone . Next comes three lively rings for me on the buzzer , and I chases into the private office . Mr. Robert is sittin ' scowlin ' , makin ' savage ' jabs with a paper knife at the blotter pad . " Torchy , " says he , " I find myself in a deucedly awkward fix . " " Another lobbyist been squealin ' ? " says I. " No , no ! " says he . " This is a personal affair , and -- well , it 's embarrassing , to say the least . " " Another lobbyist been squealin ' ? " says I. " It 's about Roberta , " says he . " What -- again ? " says I. " But I thought they was travelin ' abroad ? " " I wish they were , " says he ; " but they 're not . At the last moment , it seems , Robbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  too late in the season , and she did n't want to be going over just when everyone was coming back , you know . So they went up to Thundercaps instead . " " Sounds stormy , " says I. " You 're quite right , " says he . " But it 's a little gem of a place that young Talbot 's father built up in the Adirondacks . I was there once . It 's right on top of a mountain . And that 's where they are now , miles from anywhere or anybody . " " And spoony as two mush ladles , I expect , " says I. " Humph ! " says he , tossin ' the brass paper knife reckless onto the polished mahogany desk top . " They ought to be , I will admit ; but -- oh , hang it all , if you 're to be of any use in this beastly affair , I suppose you must be told the humiliating , ugly truth ! They are not spooning . Robbie is very unhappy . She -- she 's being abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says I. " You do n't mean he 's begun draggin ' her around by the hair , or --  --  " " Do n't ! " says Mr. Robert , bunchin ' his fists nervous . " I ca n't tell . Robbie has n't gone into that . But she has written her mother that she is utterly wretched , and that this precious Nick Talbot of hers is unbearable . The young whelp ! If I could only get my hands on him for five minutes ! But , blast it all ! that 's just what I must n't do until -- until I 'm sure . I ca n't trust myself to go . That is why I must send you , young man . " " Eh ? " says I , starin ' . " Me ? Ah , say , Mr. Robert , I would n't stand any show at all mixin ' it with a young husk like him . Why , after the first poke I 'd be --  --  " " You misunderstand , " says he . " That poke part I can attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst before I start in , and if I should go up there now , feeling as I do , I -- well , I might not be a very patient investigator . You see , do n't you ? " " Might blow a gasket , eh ? " says I. " And you want me to go up and scout around . But what if I 'm caught at it -- am I peddlin ' soap , or what ? " " A plausible errand is just what I 've been trying to invent , " says he . " Can you suggest anything ? " " Why , " says I , " I might go disguised as a lone bandit who 'd robbed a train and was --  --  " " Too theatrical , " objects Mr. Robert . " Or a guy come to test the gas meter , " I goes on . " Nonsense ! " says he . " No gas meters up there . Forget the disguise . They both know you , remember . " " Oh , well , " says I , " if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have to go as special messenger sent up with some nutty present or other ,  - -  a five-pound box of candy , or flowers , or --  --  " " That 's it -- orchids ! " breaks in Mr. Robert . " Robbie expects a bunch from me about every so often . The very thing ! " So less'n an hour later I 'm on my way , with fifty dollars ' worth of freak posies in a box , and instructions to stick around Thundercaps as long as I can , with my eyes wide open and my ears stretched . Mr. Robert figures I 'll land there too late for the night train back , anyway , and after that I 'm to use my bean . If I finds the case desp'rate , I 'm to beat it for the nearest telegraph office and wire in . " Poor little girl ! " is Mr. Robert 's closin ' remark . " Poor little Robbie ! " Cheerful sort of an errand , wa' n't it , bein ' sent to butt in on a Keno curtain raiser ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , she wa' n't much more'n a kid , and one who 'd been coddled and petted all her life , at that ! And here she ups and marries offhand this two-fisted young hick who turns out to be bad inside . You would n't have guessed it , either ; for , barrin ' a kind of heavy jaw and deep-set eyes , he had all the points of a perfectly nice young gent . Good fam'ly too . Mr. Robert knew two of his brothers well , and durin ' the coo campaign he 'd rooted for Nick . Then he had to show a streak like this ! " But wait ! " thinks I. " If I can get anything on him , he sure will have it handed to him hot when Mr. Robert arrives . I want to see it done too . " You do n't get to places like Thundercaps in a minute , though . It 's the middle of the afternoon before I jumps the way train at a little mountain station , and then I has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten-mile drive over a course like a roller coaster . They ought to smooth that Adirondack scenery down some . Crude stuff , I call it . But , say , the minute we got inside Thundercaps ' gates it 's diff'rent -- smooth green lawns , lots of flowerbeds , a goldfish pool ,  - -  almost like a chunk of Central Park . In the middle is a white-sided , red-tiled shack , with pink and white awnings , and odd windows , and wide , cozy verandas ,  - -  just the spot where you 'd think a perfectly good honeymoon might be pulled off . I 'm just unloadin ' my bag and the flowerbox when around a corner of the cottage trips a cerise-tinted vision in an all lace dress and a butterfly wrap . Course , it 's Robbie . She 's heard the sound of wheels , and has come a runnin ' . " Oh ! " says she , stoppin ' sudden and puckerin ' her baby mouth into a pout . " I thought someone was arriving , you know . " Which was a sad jolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , " says I ; " but I 'm all there is . " " You 're the boy from Uncle Robert 's office -- Torchy , is n't it ? " says she . " It is , " says I. " Fired up with flowers and Mr. Robert 's compliments . " " The old dear ! " says she , grabbin ' the box , slippin ' off the string and divin ' into the tissue paper . " Orchids , too ! Oh , goody ! But they do n't go with my coat . Pooh ! I do n't need it , anyway . " With that she , sheds the butterfly arrangement , chuckin ' it casual on the steps , and jams the whole of that fifty dollars ' worth under her sash . " There , how does that look , Mr. Torchy ? " says she , takin ' a few fancy steps back and forth . " All right , I guess , " says I. " Stupid ! " says she , stampin ' her double A-1 pump peevish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now -- are n't they nice on me ? " " Nice do n't cover it , " says I. " I was only wonderin ' whether orchids was invented for you , or you for orchids . " This brings out a frilly little laugh , like jinglin ' a string of silver bells , and she shows both dimples . " That 's better , " says she . " Almost as good as some of the things Bud Chandler can say . Dear old Bud ! He 's such fun ! " " He was the gray-eyed one , wa' n't he ? " says I. " Why , yes , " says she . " He was a dear . So was Oggie Holcomb . I wish Nick would ask them both up . " " Eh ? " says I. " The also rans ? Here ? " " Pooh ! " says she . " Why not ? It 's frightfully dull , being all alone . But Nick wo n't do it , the old bear ! " Which reminds me that I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or finger marks on her neck . Nothin ' of the kind shows up , though . " Been kind of rough about it , has he ? " says I. " He 's been perfectly awful ! " says she . " Sulking around as though I 'd done something terrible ! But I 'll pay him up . Come , you 're not going back tonight , are you ? " " Ca n't , " says I. " No train . " " Then you must play with me , " says she , grabbin ' my hand kittenish and startin ' to run me across the yard . " But , see here , " says I , followin ' her on the jump . " Where 's Hubby ? " " Oh , I do n't know , " says she . " Off tramping through the woods with his dog , I suppose . He 's sulking , as usual . And all because I insisted on writing to Oggie ! Then there was something about the servants . I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them have threatened to leave . Who cares ? Yesterday it was about the tennis court . What if he did telegraph to have it laid out ? I could n't play when I found I had n't brought any tennis shoes , could I ? Besides , there 's no fun playing against Nick , he 's such a shark . He did n't like it , either , because I would n't use the baby golf course . But I will with you . Come on . " " I never did much putting , " says I. " Nor I , " says she ; " but we can try . " Three or four holes was enough for her , though , and then she has a new idea . " You rag , do n't you ? " says she . " Only a few tango steps , " says I. " My feet stutter . " " Then I 'll show you how , " says she . " We have some dandy records , and the veranda 's just right . " So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ring up a couple of maids to clear away all the rugs and chairs , and push the music machine up to the open window . " Put on that ' Too Much Mustard , ' Annette , " says she , " and keep it going . " Must have surprised Annette some , as I had n't been accounted for ; but a little thing like that do n't bother Robbie . She gives me the proper grip for the onestep ,  - -  which is some close clinch , believe me !  - -  cuddles her fluffy head down on my necktie , and off we goes . " No , do n't try to trot , " says she . " Just balance and keep time , and swing two or three times at the turn . Keep your feet apart , you know . Now back me . Swing ! There , you 're getting it . Keep on ! " Some spieler , Robbie ; and whether or not that was just a josh about orchids bein ' invented for her , there 's no doubt but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lives . And me ? Well , I ca n't say I hated it . With her coachin ' me , and that snappy music goin ' , I caught the idea quick enough , and first I knew we was workin ' in new variations that she 'd suggest , doin ' the slow toe pivot , the kitchen sink , and a lot more . We stopped long enough to have tea and cakes served , and then Robbie insists on tryin ' some new stunts . There 's a sidewise dip , where you twist your partner around like you was tryin ' to break her back over a chair , and we was right in the midst of practisin ' that when who should show up but the happy bridegroom . And someway I 've seen ' em look more pleased . Illustration : We was right in the midst of practisin ' the sidewise dip , when who should show up but the happy bridegroom ! " Oh , that you , old Grumpy ? " says young Mrs. Talbot , stoppin ' for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office , do n't you ? He came up with some orchids . We 're having such fun too . " " Looks so , " says Nick . " Ca n't I cut in ? " " Oh , bother ! " says Robbie . " No , I 'm tired now . " " Just one dance ! " pleads Nick . " Oh , afterward , perhaps , " says she . " There ! Just look at those silly orchids ! Are n't they sights ? " With that she snakes ' em out and tosses the wilted bunch careless over the veranda rail . " And now , " she adds , " I must dress for dinner . " " You 've nearly two hours , Pet , " protests Nick . " Come to the outlook with me and watch the sunset . " " It 's too lonesome , " says Robbie , and off she goes . It should have happened then , if ever . I was standin ' by , waitin ' for him to cut loose with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . But Nick Talbot just stands there gazin ' after her kind of sad and mushy , not even grindin ' his teeth . Next he sighs , drops his chin , and slumps into a chair . Honest , that got me ; for it was real woe showin ' on his face , and he seems to be strugglin ' with it man fashion . Somehow it seemed up to me to come across with a few soothin ' remarks . " Sorry I butted in , " says I ; " but Mr. Robert sent me up with the flowers . " " Oh , that 's all right , " says he . " Glad you came . I -- I suppose she needed someone else to -- to talk to . " " But you would n't stand for invite the leftovers on your honeymoon , eh ? " I suggests . " No , hang it all ! " says he . " That was too much . She -- she mentioned it , did she ? " " Just casual , " says I. " I take it things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nods gloomy . " You were bound to notice it , " says he . " Anyone would . I have n't been able to humor all her whims . Of course , she 's been used to having so much going on around her that this must seem rather tame ; but I thought , you know , that when we were married -- well , she does n't seem to realize . And I 've offered to take her anywhere ,  - -  to Newport , to Lenox , to the White Mountains , or touring . Three times this week we 've packed to go to different places , and then she 's changed her mind . But I ca n't take her back to Long Island , to her mother 's , so soon , or ask a lot of her friends up here . It would be absurd . But things ca n't go on this way , either . It -- it 's awful ! " I leaves him with his chin propped up in his hands , starin ' gloomy at the floor , while I wanders out and pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Robbie insists on draggin ' me in for dinner with ' em . She 's some dream too , the way she 's got herself up , and lighted up by the pink candleshades , with them big pansy eyes sparkling and the color comin ' and goin ' in her cheeks -- say , it most made me dizzy to look . Then to hear her rattle on in her cute , kittenish way was better'n a cabaret show . Mostly , though , it 's aimed at me ; while Nick Talbot is left to play a thinkin ' part . He sits watchin ' her with sort of a dumb , hungry look , like a big dog . And it was a punk dinner in other ways . The soup was scorched somethin ' fierce ; but Robbie do n't seem to notice it . The roast lamb had n't had the red cooked out of it ; but Robbie only asks what kind of meat it is and remarks that it tastes queer . She has a reg'lar fit , though , because the dessert is peach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to know that I like strawberry better , " says she . " But it 's too late for strawberries , " explains Nick . " I do n't care ! " pouts Robbie . " I do n't like this , and I 'm going to send it all back to the kitchen . " She does it too , and the maid grins impudent as she lugs it out . That was a sample of the way Robbie behaved for the rest of the evenin ' ,  - -  chatterin ' and laughin ' one minute , almost weepin ' the next ; until fin'lly she slams down the piano cover and flounces off to her room . Nick Talbot sits bitin ' his lips and lookin ' desp'rate . " I 'm sure I do n't know what to do , " says he half to himself . At that I ca n't hold it any longer . " Say , Talbot , " says I , " before we get any further I got to own up that I 'm a ringer . " " A -- a what ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm supposed to be here just as a special messenger , " says I ; " but , on the level , I was sent up here to sleuth for brutal acts . Uh-huh ! That 's what the folks at home think , from the letters she 's been writin ' . Mr. Robert was dead sure of it . But I see now they had the wrong dope . I guess I 've got the idea . What you 're up against is simply a spoiled kid proposition , and if you do n't mind my mixin ' in I 'd like to state what I think I 'd do if it was me . " " Well , what ? " says he . " I 'd whittle a handle on a good thick shingle , " says I , " and use it . " He stiffens a little at that first off , and then looks at me curious . Next he chuckles . " By Jove , though ! " says he after awhile . Yes , we had a long talk , chummy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a substitute for the shingle programme that he promises to try on first thing next morning I did n't expect to be in on it ; but we happens to be sittin ' on the veranda waitin ' for breakfast , when out comes Robbie in a pink mornin ' gown with a cute boudoir cap on her head . " Why have n't they sent up my coffee and rolls ? " she demands . " Did you order them , Robbie ? " says Nick . " Why no , " says she . " Did n't you ? " " No , " says Nick . " I 'm not going to , either . You 're mistress of the house , you know , Robbie , and from now on you are in full charge . " " But -- but I thought Mrs. Parkins , the housekeeper , was to manage all those things , " says she . " You said yesterday you could n't bear Mrs. Parkins , " says Nick ; " so I 'm sending her back to town . She 's packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , which is enough . But they need straightening out . They are squabbling over their work , and neglecting it . You will have to settle all that . " " But -- but , Nick , " protests Robbie , " I 'm sure I know nothing at all about it . " " As my wife you are supposed to , " says Nick . " You must learn . Anyway , I 've told them they need n't do another stroke until they get orders from you . And I wish you 'd begin . I 'd rather like breakfast . " He 's real calm and pleasant about it ; but there 's somethin ' solid about the way his jaw is set . Robbie eyes him a minute hesitatin ' and doubtful , like a schoolgirl that 's bein ' scolded . Then all of a sudden there 's a change . The pout comes off her lips , her chin stops trembling and she squares her shoulders . " I'm -- I 'm sorry , Nicholas , " says she . " I -- I 'll do my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , say , half an hour later we were all sittin ' down to as good a ham omelet as I ever tasted . When I left with Nick to catch the forenoon express , young Mrs. Talbot was chewin ' the end of a lead pencil , with them pansy eyes of hers glued on a pad where she was dopin ' out her first dinner order . She would break away from it only long enough to give Hubby a little bird peck on the cheek ; but he seems tickled to death with that . So it wa' n't any long report I has to hand in to Mr. Robert that night . " All bunk ! " says I. " Just a case of a honeymoon that rose a little late . It 's shinin ' steady now , though . But , say , I hope I 'm never batty enough to fall for one of the butterfly kind . If I do -- good night ! " CHAPTER XV BEING SICCED ON PERCEY Maybe it ai n't figured in the headlines , or been noised around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , believe me , it was some battle ! Uh-huh ! What else could you expect with Old Hickory Ellins on one side and George Wesley Jones on the other ? And me ? Say , as it happens , I was right on the firin ' line . Talk about your drummer boys of ' 61 -- I guess the office boy of this A. M. ai n't such a dead one ! Course I knew when Piddie begins tiptoein ' around important , and Mr. Robert cuts his lunchtime down to an hour , that there 's something in the air besides humidity . " Boy , " says Old Hickory , shootin ' his words out past the stub of a thick black cigar , " I 'm expecting a Mr. Jones sometime this afternoon . " " Yes , Sir , " says I. " Any particular Jones , Sir ? " " That , " says he , " is a detail with which you need not burden your mind . I am not anticipating a convention of Joneses . " " Oh ! " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other guy by the same names should --  --  " " Yes , I understand , " he breaks in ; " but in that remote contingency I will do my best to handle the situation alone . And when Mr. Jones comes show him in at once . After that I am engaged for the remainder of the day . Is that quite clear ? " " I 'm next , " says I. " Pass a Jones , and then set the block . " If he thought he could mesmerize me by any such simple motions as that he had another guess . Why , even if it had been my first day on the job , I 'd have been hep that it wa' n't any common weekday Jones he was expectin ' to stray in accidental . Besides , the minute I spots that long , thin nose , the close-cropped , grizzly mustache , and the tired gray eyes with the heavy bags underneath , I knew it was George Wesley himself . Ai n't his pictures been printed often enough lately ? He looks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hammered the way he has , with seventeen varieties of Rube Legislatures shootin ' my past career as full of holes as a Swiss cheese , grand juries handin ' down new indictments every week end , four thousand grouchy share-holders howlin ' about pared dividends , and twice as many editorial pens proddin ' ' em along --  -- well , take it from me , I 'd be on my way towards the tall trees with my tongue hangin ' out ! Here he is , though , with his shoulders back and a sketchy , sarcastic smile flickerin ' in his mouth corners as he shows up for a hand-to-hand set-to with Old Hickory Ellins . Course it 's news to me that the Corrugated interests and the P. , B. &; R. road are mixed up anywhere along the line ; but it ai n't surprisin ' . Besides mines and rollin ' mills , we do a wholesale grocery business , run a few banks , own a lot of steam freighters , and have all kinds of queer ginks on our payroll , from welfare workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our directors onto a railroad board too ; so I takes it that the way P. , B. &; R. has been juggled lately was a game that touches us somewhere on the raw . Must be some kind of a war on the slate , or Old Hickory 'd never called for a topliner like George Wesley Jones to come on the carpet . If it had been a case of passin ' the peace pipe , Mr. Ellins would be goin ' out to Chicago to see him . " Mr. Jones , Sir , " says I , throwin ' the private office door wide open so it would take me longer to shut it . But Old Hickory do n't intend to give me any chance to pipe off the greetin ' . He just glances casual at Mr. Jones , then fixes them rock-drill eyes of his on me , jerks his thumb impatient over his shoulder , and waits until there 's three inches of fireproof material between me and the scene of the conflict . So I strolls back to my chair behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two of ' em giggles nervous . Say , they got more curiosity , them flossy key pounders ! Not one of the bunch but what knew things was doin ' ; but what it was all about would have taken me a week to explain to ' em , even if I 'd known myself . And I expect I would n't have had more'n a vague glimmer , either , if it had n't been for Piddie . You might know he 'd play the boob somehow if anything important was on . Say , if he 'd trotted in there once durin ' the forenoon he 'd been in a dozen times ; seein ' that the inkwells was filled , puttin ' on new desk blotters , and such fool things as that . Yet about three-fifteen , right in the middle of the bout , he has to answer a ring , and it turns out he 's forgotten some important papers . " Here , Boy , " says he , comin ' out peevish , " this must go to Mr. Ellins at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancin ' at the file title . " Copy of charter of the Palisades Electric ! At once is good . Ought to have been on Mr. Ellins 's desk hours ago . " " Boy ! " he explodes threatenin ' . " Ah , ditch the hysterics , Peddie ! " says I. " It 's all right now I 'm on the job , " and with a grin to comfort him I slips through Mr. Robert 's room and taps on the door of the boss 's private office before blowin ' in . And , say , it looks like I 've arrived almost in time for the final clinch . Old Hickory is leanin ' forward earnest , his jaw shoved out , his eyes narrowed to slits , and he 's poundin ' the chair arm with his big ham fist . " What I want to know , Jones , " he 's sayin ' , " is simply this : Are your folks going to drop that Palisades road scheme , or are n't you ? " Course , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I closes the door gentle behind me and backs against the knob , watchin ' George Wesley , who 's sittin ' there with his chin down and his eyes on the rug . " Really , Ellins , " says he , " I ca n't give you an answer to that . I -- er -- I must refer you to our Mr. Sturgis . " " Eh ? " snaps old Hickory . " Sturgis ! Who the syncopated sculping is Sturgis ? " " Why , " says Mr. Jones , " Percey J. Sturgis . He is my personal agent in all such matters , and this -- well , this happens to be his pet enterprise . " " But it would parallel our proposed West Point line , " says Mr. Ellins . " I know , " says G. Wesley , sighin ' weary . " But he secured his charter for this two years ago , and I promised to back him . He insists on pushing it through too . I ca n't very well call him off , you see . " " Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then let me try . Send for him . " " No use , " says Mr. Jones . " He understands your attitude . He would n't come . I should advise , if you have any proposal to make , that you send a representative to him . " " I go to him , " snorts Mr. Ellins , " to this understrapper of yours , this Mr. Percey -- er --  --  " " Sturgis , " puts in George Wesley . " He has offices in our building . And , really , it 's the only way . " Old Hickory glares and puffs like he was goin ' to blow a cylinder head . But that 's just what Hickory Ellins do n't do at a time like this . When you think he 's nearest to goin ' up with a bang , that 's the time when he 's apt to calm down sudden and shift tactics . He does now . Motionin ' me to come to the front , he takes the envelope I hands over , glances at it thoughtful a second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll send a representative to your Mr. Sturgis . I 'll send Torchy , here . " I do n't know which of us gasped louder , me or George Wesley . Got him in the short ribs , that proposition did . But , say , he 's a game old sport , even if the papers are callin ' him everything from highway robber to yellow dog . He shrugs his shoulders and bows polite . " As you choose , Ellins , " says he . Maybe he thinks it 's a bluff ; but it 's nothing like that . " Boy , " says Old Hickory , handin ' back the envelope , " go find Mr. Percey J. Sturgis , explain to him that the president of the P. , B. &; R. is bound under a personal agreement not to parallel any lines in which the Corrugated holds a one-third interest . Tell him I demand that he quit on this Palisades route . If he wo n't , offer to buy his blasted charter . Bid up to one hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I could say it backwards , " says I. " Shake the club first ; then wave the kale at him . Do I take a flyin ' start ? " " Go now , " says Old Hickory . " We will wait here until five . If he wants to know who you are , tell him you 're my office boy . " Wa' n't that rubbin ' in the salt , though ? But it ai n't safe to stir up Hickory Ellins unless you got him tied to a post , and even then you want to use a long stick . As I sails out and grabs my new fall derby off the peg Piddie asks breathless : " What 's the matter now , and where are you off to ? " " Outside business for the boss , " says I. " Buyin ' up a railroad for him , that 's all . " I left him purple in the face , dashes across to the Subway , and inside of fifteen minutes I 'm listenin ' fidgety while a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town on important business and ca n't possibly see me today . " Deah-uh me ! " says I. " How distressin ' ! Say , you watch me flag him on the jump . " " But I 've just told you , " insists the secretary , " that Mr. Sturgis cannot --  --  " " Ah , mooshwaw ! " says I. " This is a case of must -- see ? If you put me out I 'll lay for him on the way to the elevator . " Course with some parties that might be a risky tackle ; but anyone with a front name like Percey I 'm takin ' a chance on . Percey ! Listens like one of the silky-haired kind that wears heliotrope silk socks , do n't it ? But , say , what finally shows up is a wide , heavy built gent with a big , homespun sort of face , crispy brown hair a little long over the ears , and the steadiest pair of bright brown eyes I ever saw . Nothing fancy or frail about Percey J. Sturgis . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's up to the crown of his seven three-quarter hat . He has a raincoat thrown careless over one arm , and he 's smokin ' a cigar as big and black as any of Old Hickory 's . " Well , what is it , Son ? " says he in one of them deep barytones that you feel all the way through to your backbone . And this is what I 've been sent out either to scare off or buy up ! Still , you ca n't die but once . " I 'm from Mr. Ellins of the Corrugated Trust , " says I. " Ah ! " says he , smilin ' easy . Well , considerin ' how my knees was wabblin ' , I expect I put the proposition over fairly strong . " You may tell Mr. Ellins for me , " says he , " that I do n't intend to quit . " " Then it 's a case of buy , " says I. " What 's the charter worth , spot cash ? " " Sorry , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that just now . I 'm just starting for North Jersey . " " Suppose I trail along a ways then ? " says I. " Mr. Ellins is waitin ' for an answer . " " Is he ? " says Percey J. " Then come , if you wish . " And what does he do but tow me down to a big tourin ' car and wave me into one of the back seats with him . Listens quiet to all I 've got to say too , while we 're tearin ' uptown , noddin ' his head now and then , with them wide-set brown eyes of his watchin ' me amused and curious . But the scare I 'm tryin ' to throw into him do n't seem to take effect at all . " Let 's see , " says he , as we rolls onto the Fort Lee ferry , " just what is your official position with the Corrugated ? " I 'd planned to shoot it at him bold and crushin ' . But somehow it do n't happen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blushin ' apologizin ' ; " but Mr. Ellins sent me out himself . " " Indeed ? " says he . " Another of his original ideas . A brilliant man , Mr. Ellins . " " He 's some stayer in a scrap , believe me ! " says I. " And he 's got the harpoon out for this Palisades road . " " So have a good many others , " says Mr. Sturgis , chucklin ' . " In fact , I do n't mind admitting that I am as near to being beaten on this enterprise as I 've ever been on anything in any life . But if I am beaten , it will not be by Mr. Ellins . It will be by a hard-headed old Scotch farmer who owns sixty acres of scrubby land which I must cross in order to complete my right of way . He wo n't sell a foot . I 've been trying for six months to get in touch with him ; but he 's as stubborn as a cedar stump . And if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my charter lapses . So I 'm going up now to try a personal interview . If I fail , my charter is n't worth a postage stamp . But , win or lose , it is n't for sale to Hickory Ellins . " He wa' n't ugly about it . He just states the case calm and conversational ; but somehow you was dead sure he meant it . " All right , " says I. " Then maybe when I see how you come out I 'll have something definite to report . " " You should , " says he . That 's where we dropped the subject . It 's some swell ride we had up along the top of the Palisades , and on and on until we 're well across the State line into New York . Along about four-thirty he says we 're most there . We was rollin ' through a jay four corners , where the postoffice occupies one window of the gen'ral store , with the Masonic Lodge overhead , when alongside the road we comes across a little tow-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the grass and sobbin ' doleful . " Hold up , Martin , " sings out Mr. Sturgis to the chauffeur , and Martin jams on his emergency so the brake drums squeal . What do you guess ? Why Percey J. climbs out , asks the kid gentle what all the woe is about , and discovers that she 's lost a whole nickel that Daddy has given her to buy lolly-pops with on account of its bein ' her birthday . " Now that 's too bad , is n't it , little one ? " says Mr. Sturgis . " But I guess we can fix that . Come on . Martin , take us back to the store . " Took out his handkerchief , Percey did , and swabbed off the tear stains , all the while talkin ' low and soothin ' to the kid , until he got her calmed down . And when they came out of the store she was carryin ' a pound box of choc'late creams tied up flossy with a pink ribbon . With her eyes bugged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets go of his hand and dashes back up the road , most likely bent on showin ' the folks at home the results of the miracle that 's happened to her . That 's the kind of a guy Percey J. Sturgis is , even when he has worries of his own . You 'd most thought he was due for a run of luck after a kind act like that . But someone must have had their fingers crossed ; for as Martin backs up to turn around he connects a rear tire with a broken ginger ale bottle and -- s-s-s-sh ! out goes eighty-five pounds ' pressure to the square inch . No remark from Mr. Sturgis . He lights a fresh cigar and for twenty-five minutes by the dash clock Martin is busy shiftin ' that husky shoe . So we 're some behind schedule when we pulls up under the horse chestnut trees a quarter of a mile beyond in front of a barny , weather-beaten old farmhouse where there 's a sour-faced , square-jawed old pirate sittin ' in a home made barrel chair smokin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gen'ral . It 's Ross himself . Percey J. do n't waste any hot air tryin ' to melt him . He tells the old guy plain and simple who he is and what he 's after . " Dinna talk to me , Mon , " says Ross . " I 'm no sellin ' the farm . " " May I ask your reasons ? " says Mr. Sturgis . Ross frowns at him a minute without sayin ' a word . Then he pries the stubby pipe out from the bristly whiskers and points a crooked finger toward a little bunch of old apple trees on a low knoll . " Yon 's my reason , Mon , " says he solemn . " Yon wee white stone . Three bairns and the good wife lay under it . I 'm no sae youthful mysel ' . And when it 's time for me to go I 'd be sleepin ' peaceful , with none o ' your rattlin ' trolley cars comin ' near . That 's why , Mon . " " Thank you , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sentiments . However , our line would run through the opposite side of your farm , away over there . All we ask is a fifty-foot strip across your --  --  " " You canna have it , " says Ross decided , insertin ' the pipe once more . Which is where most of us would have weakened , I expect . Not Mr. Sturgis . " Just a moment , Friend Ross , " says he . " I suppose you know I have the P. , B. &; R. back of me , and it 's more than likely that your neighbors have said things about us . There is some ground for prejudice too . Our recent stock deals look rather bad from the outside . There have been other circumstances that are not in our favor . But I want to assure you that this enterprise is a genuine , honest attempt to benefit you and your community . It is my own . It is part of the general policy of the road for which I am quite willing to be held largely responsible . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road in mind ever since I came on here a poor boy , twenty-odd years ago , and took my first trip down the Hudson . This ought to be a rich , prosperous country here . It is n't . A good electric line , such as I propose to build , equipped with heavy passenger cars and running a cheap freight service , would develop this section . It would open to the public a hundred-mile trip that for scenic grandeur could be equaled nowhere in this country . Are you going to stand in the way , Mr. Ross , of an enterprise such as that ? " Yep , he was . He puffs away just as mulish as ever . " Of course , " goes on Percey , " it 's nothing to you ; but the one ambition of my life has been to build this road . I want to do for this district what some of our great railroad builders did for the big West . I 'm not a city-bred theorist , nor a Wall Street stock manipulator . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I was a boy we hauled our corn and potatoes thirty miles to a river steamboat . Then the railroad came through . Now my brothers sack their crops almost within sight of a grain elevator . They live in comfortable houses , send their children to good schools . So do their neighbors . The railroad has turned a wilderness into a civilized community . On a smaller scale here is a like opportunity . If you will let us have that fifty-foot strip --  --  " " Na , Mon , not an inch ! " breaks in Ross . How he could stick to it against that smooth line of talk I could n't see . Why , say , it was the most convincin ' , heart-throbby stuff I 'd ever listened to , and if it had been me I 'd made Percey J. a present of the whole shootin ' match . " But see here , Mr. Ross , " goes on Sturgis , " I would like to show you just what we --  --  " " Daddy ! Daddy ! " comes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barefooted youngster in a faded blue and white dress . It 's the little heroine of the lost nickel . For a second she gawps at us sort of scared , and almost decides to scuttle back into the house . Then she gets another look at Percey J. , smiles shy , and sticks one finger in her mouth . Percey he smiles back encouragin ' and holds out a big , friendly hand . That wins her . " Oh , Daddy ! " says she , puttin ' her little fist in Percey 's confidential . " It 's the mans what gim me the candy in the pitty box ! " As for Daddy Ross , he stares like he could n't believe his eyes . But there 's the youngster cuddled up against Percey J. 's knee and glancin ' up at him admirin ' . " Is ut so , Mon ? " demands Ross husky , " Was it you give the lass the sweeties ? " " Why , yes , " admitted Sturgis . " Then you shall be knowin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all I have left in the world that I care a bawbee for . You 've done it , Mon . Tak ' as much of the farm as you like at your own price . " Well , that 's the way Percey J. Sturgis won out . A lucky stroke , eh ? Take it from me , there was more'n that in it . Hardly a word he says durin ' the run back ; for he 's as quiet and easy when he 's on top as when he 's the under dog . We shakes hands friendly as he drops me uptown long after dark . I had all night to think it over ; but when I starts for Old Hickory 's office next mornin ' I had n't doped out how I was goin ' to put it . " Well , what about Percey ? " says he . " He 's the goods , " says I. " Could n't scare him , eh ? " says Old Hickory . " Not if I 'd been a mile high , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And say , Mr. Ellins , you want to get next to Percey J. The way I look at it , this George Wesley Jones stiff ai n't the man behind him ; Percey is the man behind Jones . " " H-m-m-m-m ! " says Old Hickory . " I knew there was someone ; but I could n't trace him . So it 's Sturgis , eh ? That being so , we need him with us . " " But ai n't he tied up with Jones ? " says I. " Jones is a dead dog , " says Old Hickory . " At least , he will be inside of a week . " That was some prophecy , eh ? Read in the papers , did n't you , how G. Wesley cables over his resignation from Baden Two Times ? Could n't stand the strain . The directors are still squabblin ' over who to put in as head of the P. , B. &; R. ; but if you want to play a straight inside tip put your money on Percey J. Uh-huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there over an hour now , and if he had n't flopped to our side would Mr. Ellins be tellin ' him funny stories ? Anyway , we 're backin ' that Palisades line now , and it 's goin ' through with a whoop . Which is earnin ' some int'rest on a pound of choc'lates and a smile . What ? CHAPTER XVI HOW WHITY GUNKED THE PLOT I knew something or other outside of business was puttin ' hectic spots in Old Hickory 's disposition these last few days ; but not until late yesterday did I guess it was Cousin Inez . I expect the Ellins family was n't any too proud of Cousin Inez , to start with ; for among other things she 's got a matrimonial record . Three hubbies so far , I understand , two safe in a neat kept plot out in Los Angeles ; one in the discards -- and she 's just been celebratin ' the decree by travelin ' abroad . They had n't seen much of her for years ; but durin ' this New York stopover visit she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About four foot eight Cousin Inez was in her French heels , and fairly thick through . Maybe it was the way she dressed , but from just below her double chin she looked the same size all the way down . Tie a Bulgarian sash on a sack of bran , and you 've got the model . Inez was a bear for sashes too . Another thing she was strong on was hair . Course , the store blond part did n't quite match the sandy gray that grew underneath , and the near-auburn frontispiece was another tint still ; but all that added variety and quantity -- and what more could you ask ? Her bein ' some pop-eyed helped you to remember Inez the second time . About the size of hard-boiled eggs , peeled , them eyes of hers was , and most the same color . They say she 's a wise old girl though ,  - -  carries on three diff'rent business propositions left by her late string of husbands , goes in deep for classical music , and is some kind of a high priestess in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with maybe a few bats in her belfry . But when it comes to investin ' some of her surplus funds in Corrugated preferred she has to have a good look at the books first , and makes Cousin Hickory Ellins explain some items in the annual report . Three or four times she was down to the gen'ral offices before the deal went through . This last visit of hers was something diff'rent , though . I took the message down to Martin , the chauffeur myself . It was a straight call on the carpet . " Tell Cousin Inez the boss wants to see her before she goes out this afternoon , " says I , " and wait with the limousine until she comes . " Old Hickory was pacin ' his private office , scowlin ' and grouchy , as he sends the word , and it did n't take any second sight to guess he was peeved about something . I has to snicker too when Cousin Inez floats in , smilin ' mushy as usual . She wa' n't smilin ' any when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed behind the ears , and her complexion was a little streaked under the eyes . She holds her chin up defiant , though , and slams the brass gate behind her . She 'd hardly caught the elevator before there comes a snappy call for me on the buzzer . " Boy , " says Old Hickory , glarin ' at me savage , " who is this T. Virgil Bunn ? " Almost had me tongue-tied for a minute , he shoots it at me so sudden . " Eh ? " says I. " T. Virgil ? Why , he 's the sculptor poet . " " So I gather from this thing , " says he , wavin ' a thin book bound in baby blue and gold . " But what in the name of Sardanapalus and Xenophon is a sculptor poet , anyway ? " " Why , it's -- it's -- well , that 's the way the papers always give it , " says I. " Beyond that I pass . " " Humph ! " grunts Old Hickory . " Then perhaps you 'll tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necklaces of diamonds hung About my lady sweet , So do we string our votive area All up and down each street . They shine upon the young and old , The fair , the sad , the grim , the gay ; Who gather here from far and near To worship in our Great White Way . ' " Now what 's your honest opinion of that , Son ? Is it poetry ? " Listens something like it , " says I ; " but I would n't want to say for sure . " " Nor I , " says Mr. Ellins . " All I 'm certain of is that it is n't sculpture , and that if I should read any more of it I 'd be seasick . But in T. Virgil Bunn himself I have an active and personal interest . Anything to offer ? " " Not a glimmer , " says I. " And I suppose you could find nothing out ? " he goes on . " I could make a stab , " says I. " Make a deep one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of tens for an expense fund . And , say , I knew when Old Hickory begins by unbeltin ' so reckless that he do n't mean any casual skimmin ' through club annuals for a report . " What 's the idea ? " says I. " Is it for a financial rating or a regular dragnet of past performances ? " " Everything you can discover without taking him apart , " says Old Hickory . " In short , I want to know the kind of person who can cause a fifty-five-year-old widow with grown sons to make a blinkety blinked fool of herself . " " He 's a charmer , eh ? " says I. " Evidently , " says Mr. Ellins . " Behold this inscription here , ' To dear Inez , My Lady of the Unfettered Soul -- from Virgie . ' Get the point , Son ? ' To dear Inez ' ! Bah ! Is he color blind , or what ails him ? Of course it 's her money he 's after , and for the sake of her boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what I want ? " " Sure ! " says I. " You got to have details about Virgie before you can ditch him . Well , I 'll see what I can dig up . " Maybe it strikes you as a chesty bluff for a juvenile party like me to start with no more clew than that to round up in a few hours what a high-priced sleuth agency would take a week for . But , say , I did n't stand guard on the Sunday editor 's door two years with my eyes and ears shut . Course , there 's always the city and ' phone directories to start with . Next you turn to the Who book if you suspect he 's ever done any public stunt . But , say , swallow that Who dope cautious . They let ' em write their own tickets in that , you know , and you got to make allowances for the size of the hat-band . I 'd got that far , discovered that Virgie owned up to bein ' thirty-five and a bachelor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. and Matilda Smith Bunn , and that he 'd once been president of the village literary club , when I remembers the clippin ' files we used to have back on Newspaper Row . So down I hikes -- and who should I stack up against , driftin' ' gloomy through the lower lobby , but Whity Meeks , that used to be the star man on the Sunday sheet . Course , it wa' n't any miracle ; for Whity 's almost as much of a fixture there as Old Gluefoot , the librarian , or the finger marks on the iron pillars in the press-room . A sad example of blighted ambitions , Whity is . When I first knew him he had a fresh one every Monday mornin ' , and they ranged all the way from him plannin ' to be a second Dicky Davis to a scheme he had for hookin ' up with Tammany and bein ' sent to Congress . Clever boy too . He could dash off ponies that was almost good enough to print , dope out the first two acts of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever finish it , and fake speeches that he 'd never heard a word of . When he got to doin ' Wall Street news , though , and absorbed the idea that he could stack his little thirty per against the system and break the bucketshops -- well , that was his finish . Two killings that he made by chance , and he was as good as chained to the ticker for life . No more new rosy dreams for him : always the same one , of the day when he was goin ' to show Sully how a cotton corner really ought to be pulled off , a day when the closin ' gong would find him with the City Bank in one fist and the Subtreasury in the other . You 've met that kind , maybe . Only Whity always tried to dress the part , in a sporty shepherd plaid , with a checked hat and checked silk socks to match . He has the same regalia on now , with a carnation in his buttonhole . " Well , mounting margins ! " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Torchy ! Whither away ? Come down to buy publicity space for the Corrugated , have you ? " " Not in a rag like yours , Whity , " says I , " when we own stock in two real papers . I 'm out on a little private gumshoe work for the boss . " " Sounds thrilling , " says he . " Any copy in it ? " " I 'd be chatterin ' it to you , would n't I ? " says I. " Nix ! Just plain fam'ly scrap over whether Cousin Inez shall marry again or not . My job is to get something on the guy . Do n't happen to have any special dope on T. Virgil Bunn , the sculptor poet , do you ? " Whity stares at me . " Do I ? " says he . " Say ! " Then he leads me over between the ' phone booth and the cigar stand , flashes an assignment pad , and remarks , " Gaze on that second item , my boy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I. " But what 's a bouillabaisse tea ? " " Heaven and Virgil Bunn only know , " says Whity . " But that does n't matter . Think of the subtle irony of Fate that sends me up to make a column story out of Virgie Bunn ! Me , of all persons ! " " Well , why not you ? " says I. " Why ? " says Whity . " Because I made the fellow . He -- why , he is my joke , the biggest scream I ever put over -- my joke , understand ? And now this adumbrated ass of a Quigley , who 's been sent on here from St. Louis to take the city desk , he falls for Virgie as a genuine personage . Not only that , but picks me out to cover this phony tea of his . And the stinging part is , if I do n't I get canned , that 's all . " " Ai n't he the goods , then ? " says I. " What about this sculptor poet business ? " " Bunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , he does putter around with modeling clay a bit , and writes the sort of club-footed verse they put in high school monthlies . " " Gets it printed in a book , though , " says I. " I 've seen one . " " Why not ? " says Whity . " Anyone can who has the three hundred to pay for plates and binding . ' Sonnets of the City , ' was n't it ? Did n't I get my commission from the Easy Mark Press for steering him in ? Why , I even scratched off some of those things to help him pad out the book with . But , say , Torchy , you ought to remember him . You were on the door then ,  - -  tall , wide-shouldered freak , with aureole hair , and a close cropped Vandyke ? " " Not the one who wore the Wild West lid and talked like he had a mouthful of hot oatmeal ? " says I. " Your description of Virgie 's English accent is perfect , " says Whity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mushbag , we used to call him . " " Charmingly accurate again ! " says Whity . " Verily beside him the quivering jellyfish of the salt sea was as the armored armadillo of the desert . Soft ? You could poke a finger through him anywhere . " " But what was his game ? " says I. " It was n't a game , my son , " says Whity . " It was a mission in life , to get things printed about himself . Had no more modesty about it , you know , than a circus press agent . Perfectly frank and ingenuous , Virgie was . He 'd just come and ask you to put it in that he was a great man -- just like that ! The chief used to froth at the mouth on sight of him . But Virgie looked funny to me in those days . I used to jolly him along , smoke his Coronas , let him take me out to swell feeds . Then when they gave Merrow charge of the Sunday side , just for a josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sculptor poet , threw in some views of him in his studio , and quoted some of his verse that I 'd fixed up . It got by . Virgie was so pleased he wanted to give a banquet for me ; but I got him to go in on a little winter wheat flier instead . He did n't drop much . After that I 'd slip in a paragraph about him now and then , always calling him the sculptor poet . The tag stuck . Other papers began to use it ; until , first thing I knew , Virgie was getting away with it . Honest , I just invented him . And now he passes for the real thing ! " " Where you boobed , then , was in not filin ' copyright papers , " says I. " But how does he make it pay ? " " He does n't , " says Whity . " Listen , Son , and I will divulge the hidden mystery in the life of T. Virgil Bunn . Cheese factories ! Half a dozen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , you know , by Pa Bunn ; a coarse , rough person , I am told , who drank whey out of a five-gallon can , but was cute enough to import Camembert labels and make his own boxes . He passed on a dozen years ago ; but left the cheese factories working night shifts . Virgie draws his share quarterly . He tried a year or two at some Rube college , and then went abroad to loiter . While there he exposed himself to the sculptor 's art ; but it did n't take very hard . However , Virgie came back and acquired the studio habit . And you ca n't live for long in a studio , you know , without getting the itch to see yourself in print . That 's what brought Virgie to me . And now ! Well , now I have to go to Virgie . " " Ai n't as chummy with him as you was , I take it ? " says I. Whity shrugs his shoulders disgusted . " The saphead ! " says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock deals he got cold feet . I have n't seen him for a year . I wonder how he 'll take it ? But you mentioned a Cousin Inez , did n't you ? " I gives Whity a hasty sketch of the piece , mentionin ' no more names , but suggestin ' that Virgie stood to connect with an overgrown widow 's mite if there wa' n't any sudden interference . " Ha ! " says Whity , speakin ' tragic through his teeth . " An idea ! He 's put the spell on a rich widow , has he ? Now if I could only manage to queer this autumn leaf romance it would even up for the laceration of pride that I see coming my way tonight . Describe the fair one . " " I could point her out if you could smuggle me in , " I suggests . " A cinch ! " says he . " You 're Barry of the City Press . Here , stick some copy paper in your pocket . Take a few notes , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on , " says I ; " but I guess I can stand it for an evenin ' . " So about eight-thirty we meets again , and ' proceeds to hunt up this studio buildin ' over in the East 30 's . It ai n't any bum Bohemian ranch , either , but a ten-story elevator joint , with clipped bay trees on each side of the front door . Virgie 's is a top floor suite , with a boy in buttons outside and a French maid to take your things . " Gee ! " I whispers to Whity as we pushes in . " There 's some swell mob collectin ' , eh ? " Whity is speechless , though , and when he gets his breath again all he can do is mumble husky , " Teddy Van Alstyne ! Mrs. Cromer Paige ! The Bertie Gardiners ! " They acted like a mixed crowd , though , gazin ' around at each other curious , groupin ' into little knots , and chattin ' under their breath . Bein ' gents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waits to see what happens . " There comes Cousin Inez ! " says I , nudgin ' Whity . " See ? The squatty dame with the pearl ropes over her hair . " " Sainted Billikens , what a make-up ! " says Whity . And , believe me , Cousin Inez was dolled for fair . She 'd peeled for the fray , as you might say . And if the dinky shoulder straps held it was all right ; but if one of ' em broke there 'd sure be some hurry call for four yards of burlap to do her up in . She seems smilin ' and happy , though , and keeps glancin ' expectant at the red velvet draperies in the back of the room . Sure enough , exactly on the tick of nine , the curtains part , and in steps the hero of the evenin ' . Dress suit ? Say , you do n't know Virgie . He 's wearin ' a reg'lar monk 's outfit , of some coarse brown stuff belted in with a thick rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of beans , look at his feet ! " I whispers . " Sandals , " says Whity , " and no socks ! Blessed if Virgie is n't going the limit ! " There 's a chorus of " Ah-h-h-h 's ! " as he steps out , and then comes a buzz of whispers which might have been compliments , and might not . But it do n't faze Virgie . He goes bowin ' and handshakin ' through the mob , smilin ' mushy on all and several , and actin ' as pleased with himself as if he 'd taken the prize at a fancy dress ball . You should have seen Cousin Inez when he gets to her ! " Oh , you utterly clever man ! " she gushes . " What a genuine genius you are ! " " Dear , sweet lady ! " says he . " It is indeed gracious of you to say so . " " Help ! " groans Whity , like he had a pain . " Ah , buck up ! " says I. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderin ' how Virgie was goin ' to simmer down enough to pass Whity the chilly greetin ' ; for he 's just bubblin ' over with kind words and comic little quips . But , say , he do n't even try to shade it . " Ah , Whity , my boy ! " says he , extendin ' the cordial paw . " Charming of you to look me up once more , perfectly charming ! " " Rot ! " growls Whity . " You know I was sent up here to do this blooming spread of yours . What sort of fake is it , anyway ? " " Ha , ha ! Same old Whity ! " says Virgil , poundin ' him hearty on the shoulder . " But you 're always welcome , my boy . As for the tea -- well , one of my little affairs , you know ,  - -  just a few friends dropping in -- feast of reason , flow of wit , all that sort of thing . You know how to put it . Do n't forget my costume -- picked it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you some photos I 've had taken in it . Ah , another knight of the pencil ? " and he glances inquirin ' at me . " City Press , " says Whity . " Fine ! " says Virgie , beamin ' . " Well , you boys make yourselves quite at home . I 'll send Marie over with cigars and cigarettes . She 'll help you to describe any of the ladies ' costumes you may care to mention . Here 's a list of the invited guests too . Now I must be stirring about . Au revoir . " " Ass ! " snarls Whity under his breath . " If I do n't give him a roast , though , one of the veiled sarcastic kind that will get past ! And we must find some way of queering him with that rich widow . " " Goin ' to be some contract , Whity , believe me ! " says I. " Look how she 's taggin ' him around ! " And , say , Cousin Inez sure had the scoopnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on his heels , gigglin ' and simperin ' at all his sappy speeches and hangin ' onto his arm part of the time . Folks was nudgin ' each other and pointin ' her out gleeful , and I could easy frame up the sort of reports that had set Old Hickory 's teeth on edge . T. Virgil , though , seems to be havin ' the time of his life . He exhibits some clay models , either dancin ' girls or a squad of mounted cops , I could n't make out which , and he lets himself be persuaded to read two or three chunks out of his sonnets , very dramatic . Cousin Inez leads the applause . Then , strikin ' a pose , he claps his hands , the velvet curtains are slid one side , and in comes a French chef luggin ' a tray with a whackin ' big casserole on it . " Voila ! " sings out Virgie . " The bouillabaisse ! " Marie gets busy passin ' around bowls and spoons , and the programme seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives each a helpin ' out of a long-handled silver ladle . It smells mighty good ; so I pushes in with my bowl . What do you guess I drew ? A portion of the tastiest fish soup you ever met , with a lobster claw and a couple of clams in it . M-m-m-m ! " He may be a punk poet , " says I to Whity ; " but he 's a good provider . " " Huh ! " growls Whity , who seems to be sore on account of the hit Virgie 's makin ' . Next thing I knew along drifts Cousin Inez , who has sort of been crowded away from her hero , and camps down on the other side of Whity . " Is n't this just too unique for words ? " she gushes . " And is not dear Virgil perfectly charming tonight ? " " Oh , he 's a bear at this sort of thing , all right , " says Whity , " this and making cheese . " " Cheese ! " echoes Cousin Inez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he told you about his cheese factories ? Ask him . " " But -- but I understood that -- that he was a poet , " says she , " a sculptor poet . " " Bah ! " says Whity . " He could n't make his salt at either . All just a pose ! " " Why , I can hardly believe it , " says Cousin Inez . " I do n't believe it , either . " " Then read his poetry and look at his so called groups , " goes on Whity . " But he 's such a talented , interesting man , " insists Inez . " With such an interesting family too , " says Whity , winkin ' . " Family ! " gasps Cousin Inez . " Wife and six children , " says Whity , lyin ' easy . " Oh -- oh ! " squeals Inez in that shrill , raspy voice of hers . " They say he beats his wife , though , " adds Whity . " Oh !  - -  oh ! " squeals Inez , again , higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less keyed up before ; but this adds the finishin ' touch . And she lets ' em out reckless . Course , everyone stops chatterin ' and looks her way . No wonder ! You 'd thought she was havin ' a fit . Over rushes Virgil , ladle in hand . " My dear Inez ! " says he . " What is it ? A fishbone ? " " Monster ! " she bowls . " Deceiver ! Leave me , never let me see your face again ! Oh -- oh ! Cheese ! Six children ! Oh -- oh ! " With that she tumbles over on Whity and turns purple in the face . Say , it was some sensation we had there for a few minutes ; but after they 'd sprinkled her face , and rubbed her wrists , and poured a couple of fingers of brandy into her , she revives . And the first thing she catches sight of is Virgie , standin ' there lookin ' puzzled , still holdin ' the soup ladle . " Monster ! " she hisses at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you forever ! " With that she dashes for the cloakroom , grabs her opera wrap , and beats it for the elevator . Course , that busts up the show , and inside of half an hour everybody but us has left , and most of ' em went out snickerin ' . " I -- I do n't understand it at all , " says Virgie , rubbin ' his eyes dazed . " She was talking with you , was n't she , Friend Whity ? Was it something you said about me ? " " Possibly , " says Whity , " I may have mentioned your cheese factories ; and I 'm not sure but what I did n't invent a family for you . Just as a joke , of course . You do n't mind , I hope ? " And at that I was dead sure someone was goin ' to be slapped on the wrist . But , say , all Virgie does is swallow hard a couple of times ; and then , as the full scheme of the plot seems to sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear boy , " says he , " you are my deliverer ! I owe you more than I can ever express . Really , you know , that ridiculous old person has been the bane of my existence for the last three weeks . She has fairly haunted me , spoiled all my receptions , and -- disturbed me greatly . Ever since I met her in Rome last winter she has been at it . Of course I have tried to be nice to her , as I am to everyone who -- er -- who might help . But I almost fancy she had the idea that I would -- ah -- marry her . Really , I believe she did . Thank you a thousand times , Whity , for your joke ! If she comes back , tell her I have two wives , a dozen . And have some cigars -- oh , fill your pockets , my boy . And here -- the photos showing me in my monk 's costume . Be sure to drop in at my next tea . I 'll send you word . Good night , and bless you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door open and patted us on the back as we went through . And the next thing we knew we was down on the sidewalk . " Double crossed ! " groans Whity . " Smothered in mush ! " " As a plotter , Whity , " says I , " you 're a dub . But if you gunked it one way , you drew a consolation the other . At this stage of the game I guess I 'm commissioned by a certain party to hand over to you a small token of his esteem . " " Eh ? " says Whity . " Twenty ? What for ? " " Ah , go bull the market with it , and do n't ask fool questions ! " says I. Say , it was a perfectly swell story about Virgie 's bouillabaisse function on today 's society page , double-column half-tone cut and all . I had to grin when I shows it to Mr. Ellins . " Were you there , young man ? " says he , eyin ' me suspicious . " Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he , " when Cousin Inez came home and began packing her trunks . I take it that affair of hers with the sculptor poet is all off ? ? ' " Blew up with a bang about ten-thirty P. M. , " says I. " Your two tenspots went with it . " " Huh ! " he snorts . " That 's as far as I care to inquire . Some day I 'm going to send you out with a thousand and let you wreck the administration . " CHAPTER XVII TORCHY GETS A THROUGH WIRE First off , when I pipes the party in the pale green lid and the fuzzy English topcoat , I thought it was some stray from the House of Lords ; but as it drifts nearer to the brass rail and I gets a glimpse of the mild blue eyes behind the thick , shell-rimmed glasses , I discovers that it 's only Son-in-law Ferdy ; you know , hubby to Marjorie Ellins that was . " Wat ho ! " says I. " Just in from Lunnon ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish . " Whatever made you think that ? " " Then it 's a disguise , is it ? " says I , eyin ' the costume critical . " Oh , bother ! " says Ferdy peevish . " I told Marjorie I should be stared at . And I just despise being conspicuous , you know ! Where 's Robert ? " " Mr. Robert ai n't due back for an hour yet , " says I. " You could catch him at the club , I expect . " " No , no , " protests Ferdy hasty . " I -- I would n't go to the club looking like this . I -- I could n't stand the chaff I 'd get from the fellows . I 'll wait . " " Suit yourself , " says I , towin ' him into Mr. Robert 's private office . " You can shed the heather wrap in here , if you like . " " I -- I wish I could , " says he . " Wha-a-at ! " says I. " She ai n't sewed you into it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it buttoned tight under your chin with all this steam heat on . " " I know , " says Ferdy , sighin ' . " I nearly roasted , coming down in the train . But , you see , it -- it hides the tie . " " Eh ? " says I. " Something else Marjorie picked out ? Let 's have a peek . " Ferdy blushes painful . " It 's awful , " he groans , " perfectly awful ! " " Not one of these nutty Futurist designs , like a scrambled rainbow shot full of pink polliwogs ? " says I. " Worse than that , " says Ferdy , unbuttonin ' the overcoat reluctant . " Look ! " " Zowie ! A plush one ! " says I. Course , they ai n't so new . I 'd seen ' em in the zippy haberdashers ' windows early in the fall ; but I do n't remember havin ' met one out of captivity before . And this is about the plushiest affair you could imagine ; bright orange and black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I. " That is something to have wished onto you ! Looks like a caterpillar in a dream . " " That 's right , " says Ferdy . " It 's been a perfect nightmare to me ever since Marjorie bought it . But I ca n't hurt her feelings by refusing to wear it . And this silly hat too -- a scarf instead of a band ! " It 's almost pathetic the way Ferdy holds the lid off at arm 's length and gazes indignant at it . " Draped real sweet , ai n't it ? " says I. " But most of the smart chappies are wearin ' ' em that way , you know . " " Not this sickly green shade , though , " says Ferdy plaintive . " I wish Marjorie would n't get such things for me . I -- I 've always been rather particular about my hats and ties . I like them quiet , you understand . " " You would get married , though , " says I. " But , say , ca n't you do a duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea had n't occurred to Ferdy . " But how ? Where ? " says he , brightenin ' up . " In the limousine as you 're drivin ' down to the station , " says I. " You could keep an extra outfit in the car . " " By Jove ! " says Ferdy . " Then I could change again on the way home , could n't I ? And if Marjorie did n't know , she wouldn't --  --  " " You 've surrounded the plot of the piece , " says I. " Now go to it . There 's a gents ' furnisher down in the arcade . " He 's halfway out to the elevator before it occurs to him that he ai n't responded with any grateful remarks ; so back he comes to tell how much obliged he is . " And , Torchy , " he adds , " you know you have n't been out to see baby yet . Why , you must see little Ferdinand ! " " Ye-e-es , I been meanin ' to , " says I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quite a kid by this time . " " Eleven months lacking four days , " says Ferdy , his face beamin ' . " Wait ! I want to show you his latest picture . Really wonderful youngster , I tell you . " So I has to inspect a snapshot that Ferdy produces from his pocketbook ; and , while it looks about as insignificant as most of ' em , I pumps up some gushy remarks which seem to make a hit with Ferdy . " Could n't you come out Sunday ? " says he . " ' Fraid not , " says I. " In fact , I 'm booked up for quite a spell . " " Too bad , " says Ferdy , " for we 're almost alone now ,  - -  only Peggy and Jane -- my little nieces , you know -- and Miss Hemmingway , who --  --  " " Vee ? " says I , comin ' straight up on my toes . " Say , Ferdy , I think I can break away Sunday , after all . Ought to see that youngster of yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " " Oh , he is , " says Ferdy ; " but if you ca n't come this week --  --  " " Got to , " says I. " ' Leven months , and me never so much as chucked him under the chin once ! Gee ! how careless of me ! " " All right , Sunday next , " says Ferdy . " We shall look for you . " That was throwin ' in reverse a little sudden , I admit ; but my chances of gettin ' within hailin ' distance of Vee ai n't so many that I can afford to overlook any bets . Besides , up at Marjorie 's is about the only place where I do n't have to run the gauntlet goin ' in , or do a slide for life comin ' out . She 'll shinny on my side every trip , Marjorie will -- and believe me I need it all ! Looked like a special dispensation too , this bid of Ferdy 's ; for I wanted half an hour 's private chat with Vee the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , my last two letters had come back with " Refused " scratched across the face , and I did n't know whether it was some of Aunty 's fine work , or what . Anyway , it 's been a couple of months now that the wires have been down between us , and I was more or less anxious to trace the break . So Sunday afternoon do n't find me missin ' any suburban local . Course , Ferdy 's mighty intellect ai n't suggested to him anything about askin ' me out for a meal ; so I has to take a chance on what time to land there . But I strikes the mat about two-thirty P. M. , and the first one to show up is Marjorie , lookin ' as plump and bloomin ' a corn-fed Venus as ever . " Why , Torchy ! " says she , with business of surprise . " Uh-huh , " says I. " Special invite of Ferdy 's to come see the heir apparent . Did n't he mention it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever know of him remembering anything worth while ? " " Oh , ho ! " says I. " In disgrace , is he ? " " He is , " says Marjorie , sniffin ' scornful . " But it 's nice of you to want to see baby . The dear little fellow is just taking his afternoon nap . He wakes up about four , though . " " Oh , I do n't mind waitin ' a bit , " says I. " You know , I 'm crazy to see that kid . " " Really ! " says Marjorie , beamin ' delighted . " Then you shall go right up now , while he is --  --  " " No , " says I , holdin ' up one hand . " I might sneeze , or something . I 'll just stick around until he wakes up . " " It 's too bad , " says Marjorie ; " but Verona is dressing and --  --  " " What ! " says I. " Vee here ? " " Just going , " says Marjorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an hour . " Say , then was no time for wastin ' fleetin ' moments on any bluff . " Say , Marjorie , " says I , " could n't you get her to speed up the toilet motions a bit and shoo her downstairs ? Do n't say who ; but just hint that someone wants to see her mighty special for a few moments . There 's a good girl ! " Marjorie giggles and shows her dimples . " I might try , " says she . " Suppose you wait in the library , where there 's a nice log fire . " So it 's me for an easy chair in the corner , where I can watch for the entrance . Five minutes by the clock on the mantel , and nothing happens . Ten minutes , and no Vee . Then I hears a smothered snicker off to the left . I 'd got my face all set for the cheerful greetin ' too , when I discovers two pairs of brown eyes inspectin ' me roguish , through the parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen before . " Huh ! " thinks I. " Nice way to treat guests ! " and I pretends not to notice . I 've picked up a magazine and am readin ' the pictures industrious , when there 's more snickers . I scowls , fidgets around some , and fin'lly takes another glance . The brown eyes are twinklin ' mischievous , all four of ' em . " Well , " says I , " what 's the joke ? Shoot it ! " At that into the room bounces a couple of girls , somewhere around ten and twelve , I should judge ; tall , long-legged kids , but cute lookin ' , and genuine live wires , from their toes up . They 're fairly wigglin ' with some kind of excitement . " We know who you are ! " singsongs one , pointin ' the accusin ' finger . " You 're Torchy ! " says the other . " Then I 'm discovered , " says I. " How 'd you dope it out ? " " By your hair ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a panicky clinch and giggles down each other 's necks . " Hey , cut out the comic relief , " says I , " and give me a turn . Which one of you is Peggy ? " " Why , who told you that ? " demands the one with the red ribbon . " Oh , I 'm some guesser myself , " says I. " It 's you . " " Pooh ! I bet it was Uncle Ferdinand , " says she . " Good sleuth work ! " says I. " He 's the guy . But I did n't know he had such a cunnin ' set of nieces . Most as tall as he is , ai n't you , Peggy ? " But that do n't happen to be the line of dialogue they 're burnin ' to follow out . Exchangin ' a look , they advance mysterious until there 's one on each side of me , and then Peggy whispers dramatic : " You came to see Miss Vee , did n't you ? " " Vee ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , you know , now ! " protests Jane , tappin ' me playful . " Sorry , " says I , " but this is a baby visit I 'm payin ' . Ask Uncle Ferdinand if it ai n't . " " Humph ! " says Peggy . " Anyone can fool Uncle Ferdy . " " Besides , " says Jane , " we saw a picture on Vee 's dressing table , and when we asked who it was she hid it . So there ! " " Not a picture of me , though , " says I. " Could n't be . " " Yes , it was , " insists Jane . " A snapshot of you , " says Peggy , " taken in a boat . " I wo n't deny that was some cheerful bulletin ; but somehow I had a hunch it might be best not to let on too much . Course , I could locate the time and place . I must have got on the film durin ' my stay up at Roarin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says I. " Of all things ! " " And Vee does n't want anyone to know about it , " adds Jane , " specially her aunty . " " Why not ? " comes in Peggy , lookin ' me straight in the eye . " Very curious ! " says I , shakin ' my head . " What else did Vee have to say about me ? " " M-m-m-m ! " says Peggy . " We ca n't tell . " " We promised not to , " says Jane . " You 're a fine pair of promisers ! " says I. " I expect you hold secrets like a wire basket holds water . " " We never said a word , did we , Peggy ? " demands Jane . " Nope ! " says Peggy . " Maybe he 's the one Vee 's aunty does n't like . " " Are you ? " says Jane , clawin ' my shoulder excited . " How utterly thrillin ' ! " says I. " Say , you 're gettin ' me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war club out for , do you ? " " It 's someone with hair just like yours , anyway , " says Peggy . " Think of that ! " says I. " Does red hair throw Aunty into convulsions , or what ? " " Aunt Marjorie says it 's because you -- that is , because the one she meant is n't anybody , " says Jane . " He 's poor , and all that . Are you poor ? " " Me ? " says I. " Why -- say , what is this you 're tryin ' to pull off on me , impeachment proceedings ? Come now , do n't you guess your Aunt Marjorie 'll be wantin ' you ? " " No , " says Peggy . " She told us for goodness sake to run off and be quiet . " " What about this Miss Vee party , then ? " says I. " Do n't she need you to help her hook up ? " " We just came from her room , " says Peggy . " She pushed us out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great strategy ! " says I. " Show me a door with a key in it . " " Pooh ! " says Peggy . " You could n't put us both out at once . " " Could n't I ? " says I. " Let 's see . " With that I grabs one under each arm , and with the pair of ' em strugglin ' and squealin ' and rough housin ' me for all they was worth , I starts towards the livin ' room . We was right in the midst of the scrimmage when in walks Vee , with her hat and furs all on , lookin ' some classy , take it from me . But the encouragin ' part of it is that she smiles friendly , and I smiles back . Illustration : We was right in the midst of the scrimmage when in walks Vee . " Well , you found someone , did n't you , girls ? " says she . " Oh , Vee , Vee ! " sings out Peggy gleeful . " Is n't this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tips Vee the signal for general denial and winks knowin ' . But , say , you ca n't get by with anything crude on a pair of open-eyed kids like that . " Oh , I saw ! " announces Jane . " And you do know him , do n't you , Vee ? " " Why , I suppose we have met before ? " says she , laughin ' ripply . " Have n't we , Torchy ? " " Now that you mention it , " says I , " I remember . " And we shakes hands formal . " Came to see the baby , I hear , " says Vee . " Oh , sure ! " says I. " Maybe you could tell me about him first , though , if we could find a quiet corner . " " Oh , we 'll tell you , " chimes in Peggy . " We know all about Baby . He has a tooth ! " " Say , " says I , wigglin ' away from the pair , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just for ten minutes or so ? " " What for ? " says Jane , eyin ' me suspicious . " We 'd rather stay here , " says Peggy decided . I catches a humorous twinkle in Vee 's gray eyes as she holds out her hands to the girls . " Listen , " says she confidential . " You know those hermit cookies you 're so fond of ? Well , Cook made a whole jarful yesterday . They 're in the pantry . " " I know , " says Jane . " We found ' em last night . " " The Glue Sisters ! " says I. " Now see here , Kids , I 've just thought of a message I ought to give to Miss Vee . " " Who from ? " demands Peggy . " From a young chap I know who thinks a lot of her , " says I. " It 's strictly private too . " " What 's it about ? " says Jane . Which was when my tactics gave out . " Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " beat it , wo n't you ? " No , they just would n't . The best they would do for me was to back off to the other side of the room , eyes and ears wide open , and there they stood . " Go on ! " whispers Vee . " What was it he wanted to say ? " " It was about a couple of notes he wrote , " says I. " Yes ? " says Vee . " What happened ? " " They came back , " says I , " without being opened . " " Oh , " says Vee , " those must have been the ones that --  --  " " Vee , Vee ! " breaks in Peggy from over near the window . " Here comes your aunty . " " Good night , nurse ! " says I. " Tell him it 's all right , " says Vee hasty . " He might send the next ones in care of Marjorie ; then I 'll be sure of getting them . By-by , Peggy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please do n't come out , Torchy . Goodby . " And in another minute I 'm left to the mercy of the near-twins once more . I camps down in the easy chair again , with one on each side , and the cross examination proceeds . Say , they 're a great pair too . " Did n't Vee want you to go out ' cause her aunty would see you ? " asks Peggy . " There ! " says I. " I wonder ? " " I 'm glad she is n't my aunty , " says Jane . " She looks too cross . " " If I was Vee 's aunty , " puts in Peggy , " I would n't be mad if she did have your picture in a silver frame . " " Honest ? " says I. " How 's that ? " " ' Cause I do n't think you 're so awful horrid , even if you are n't anybody , " says Peggy . " Do you , Jane ? " " I like him , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , well ! " says I. " Guess I got some gallery with me , anyway . And how does Vee stand with you ? " " Oh , she 's just a dear ! " says Peggy , clappin ' her hands . " M-m-m-m ! " echoes Jane . " She 's going to take us to see Maude Adams next Wednesday too . " " Huh ! " says I , indicatin ' deep thought . " So you 'll see her again soon ? " " I wish it was tomorrow , " says Jane . " Mr. Torchy , " says Peggy , grabbin ' me impulsive by one ear and swingin ' my face around , " truly now , are n't you awfully in love with Vee ? " Say , where do they pick it up , youngsters of that age ? Her big brown eyes are as round and serious as if she knew all about it ; and on the other side is Jane , fairly holdin ' her breath . " Whisper ! " says I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes ! " comes in chorus . " Well , then , " says I , " I 'm going to hand you one . I think Vee is the best that ever happened . " " Oh , goody ! " exclaims Peggy . " Then you do love her awfully ! But why do n't you --  --  " " Wait ! " says I. " When I get to be a little older , and some bigger , and after I 've made heaps and heaps of money , and have a big , black automobile --  --  " " And a big , black mustache , " adds Peggy . " No , " says I. " Cut out the miracles . Call it when I 'm in business for myself . Then , if somebody 'll only choke off Aunty long enough , I may -- well , some fine moonlight night I may tell her all about it . " " Oh ! " gasps Jane . " May n't we be there to hear you do it ? " " Not if I can bar you out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We would sit just as still and not --  --  Oh , here 's Aunt Marjorie . Aunty , what do you think ? Mr. Torchy 's been telling us a secret . " " There , there , Peggy , " says Marjorie , " do n't be silly . Torchy is waiting to see Baby . Come ! He 's awake now . " Yep , I had to do the inspection act , after all . And I must say that most of these infant wonders look a good deal alike ; only Ferdinand , Jr. , has a cute way of tryin ' out his new tooth on your thumb . Goin ' back towards the station I meets Ferdy , himself , trampin ' in lonesome from a long walk , and lookin ' mighty glum . " Of all the gloom carriers ! " says I. " What was it let you in bad this time ? " " You ought to know , " says he . " For why ? " says I. " Oh , fudge ! " says he . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of changing neckties ! " " Chinked it , did you ? " says I. " But how ? " " If you must know , " says he , " I forgot to change back on my way home , and Marjorie 's still furious . She simply wo n't let me explain , refuses to listen to a word . So what can I do ? " " A cinch ! " says I. " You got a pair of livin ' dictaphones in the house , ai n't you ? Work it off on Peggy and Jane as a secret , and you 'll have your defense on record inside of half an hour . Cheer up , Ferdy . Ishkabibble ! "
