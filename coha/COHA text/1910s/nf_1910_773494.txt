txt CHAPTER VII PITCHING Pitching is the most highly developed , most skillful and most important part of baseball , requiring more thought , more strength and more brains than any other position demands . Good pitching is the absolute essential to victory , and , considered in relation to the " inside game , " is vital , for unless the pitcher understands every move of his fellow players , and adjusts his pitching to the plan , the " inside game " becomes worse than useless . The development of the science of pitching has , from the inception of the game , been in advance of the development of the other departments of play and to such . an extent that the rule makers from the first have found it necessary to legislate to handicap the pitcher to prevent him from becoming absolute master of the game . In spite of the rules the pitchers have by persistent work and thought kept in advance of the progress of the national sport . Involving the study of wind pressures , dynamics , physics , and mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pitching is an art demanding closest attention at every instant , the concentration of every energy upon the game , so much so that in almost every game the pitchers lose all track of the number of innings played , of the score itself , forget the crowd , and too // neither hear the cheers nor hisses , because their minds are so focused on the batters . The story of the development of the art of pitching from the days of the straight arm , underhand pitch to the present is one of constant discoveries and triumphs , until , in the educated fingers of the great masters of the art , the ball seems endowed with life . The days of the underhand pitch were the kindergarten days of the game , and with the coming of overhand pitching the science began to develop . The discovery of the curve ball marked another era , and gave the foundation for modern pitching . Pitchers use , primarily , two kinds of pitches , the " straight one , " and the curve . They are the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " straight " balls and as many varieties of curve as there are pitchers . The majority of pitchers begin their careers with no other varieties than speed and a curve , and the strength of youthful arms to win success . The " straight " ball is a misnomer , for there is only one kind of ball a pitcher can not throw and that is a " straight " one , as every ball curves , regardless of the will of the pitcher . It is the study and development of these curves that makes great pitchers . ' The fast ball is sheer speed , its success depending entirely upon its velocity and the control the pitcher has of it . It is pitched with the sphere gripped with the thumb underneath and the first two fingers on top , and is thrown either underhand or overhand with full force . Pitched directly overhand , with the fingers held directly on top , the ball goes as straight to the plate as // it is possible to make it go , the speed and the downward angle make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in " the groove , " which is the natural angle . Pitched with the hand held sideways , the ball , taking friction from the finger tips , swerves slightly from its course and breaks in towards a right handed batter . If the ball is gripped tightly with the finger tips at the moment it is released from the hand its speed piles up a billow of air in front of it , and at some point before crossing the plate , the air resistance becomes so great that the ball " jumps " an inch or more upward or in the direction the greatest amount of pressure of the fingers was applied . Every man who pitches fast balls successfully has a powerful grip and a strong arm , the stronger the greater the jump to the fast ball . President Cleveland once received a crowd of baseball players in the White House and shook hands with all . When the ceremony was over he laughingly picked out the three pitchers , and explained that he knew by the grips of their hands that they were pitchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way in which the fast one is gripped , but the ball is released over the side and end of the first finger . The amount of curve or shoot depends upon the manner and strength of the grip of the hand and the way in which the wrist is turned at the moment of release , as well as upon the amount of power applied by the pitcher . These are the elementary principles of pitching , so well understood that every school boy knows them . // They are the beginning of the wonders of baseball pitching . After them come the change of pace , the slow ball , the " spit ball , " the " knuckle ball , " the " fadeaway , " a score of curves and varieties of curves , and to tell how these things are done it is necessary to tell who does them , and how . Cy Young and " Kid " Nichols were the leading pitchers of fast balls , although both used curves while depending upon the " straight " one for their greatest success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hand held as straight as possible and , at the instant of releasing the ball each gripped it tightly with the finger tips and loosely with the thumb . The finger pressure increased the speed of the natural revolution of the ball and caused it to jump more . It is odd that Young and Nichols who probably came nearer pitching " straight " balls than any other pitchers ever did , were so successful and it proves that the batter does not hit at the ball at all , but . swings his bat at a spot where he expects the ball to cross the plate . The success of the fast ball lies in this , and in the fact that it is coming so rapidly the batter has no opportunity to change the direction of his swing before the ball passes . The curve pitchers are a host . Every one has a different curve , faster , sharper , slower , with heavier twist , or some individual peculiarity to distinguish it . The first curves pitched were of the variety now known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pitched underhand , with the hand swung nearly to the level of the // knee , fingers downward and hand held almost at right angles with the wrist . As the hand was swung the wrist was jerked sharply and the ball , sliding off the first finger , revolved rapidly and the air pressure on one side of the sphere and the partial vacuum on the other caused by the rotation , forced the ball to move in a slow wide arc . All curves are developments of the " barrel hoop , " the same principle entering into each , whether it is Mordecai Brown 's marvelous " hook " curve , George Mullin 's meteoric shoot , or the wonderful curves of Camnitz , Overall , Wiltse , Krause , Adams , Ferguson and others . Brown 's " hook " curve is the highest present development of the fast overhand curve pitch which breaks sharply down and outward . Brown probably owes much of his success to a feed chopper which cut off part of his right hand , leaving him without an index finger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first joint . Brown pitches the " hook " overhand , releasing the ball at various points after his hand swings past his body . By the point at which he releases the ball he regulates the point at which it breaks in the air . He can make the ball either describe a wide fast arc , or by jerking his hand at the proper instant , make the ball go in almost a straight line , perhaps fifty feet , and then dart suddenly down and outward . There are many players , however , among them members of the Detroit team who faced him in the final game for the World 's Championship in 1908 , who believe Overall 's curve a more marvelous one . In that // game the Chicago giant had one of the most remarkable curves ever pitched . At times the ball darted down two feet and struck the ground while the batters struck more than a foot over it . Overall pitches his curve with a wide , sweeping overhand swing , releasing the ball over the side of the index finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are duplicates of those used by Terry , McCormick and some of the great pitchers of the past , and when his jerk motion at the finish of the wide swing is sharp , the curve actually darts downward . But speed and curves alone will not win and pitchers , baseball generations ago , discovered that there was not enough of an assortment to long puzzle batters . The batters guessed correctly too many times whether the ball would be curved or fast , and often detected by the position of the hand that a curve was coming even before it was pitched . With the necessity of a greater assortment came the " slow ball , " one of the paradoxes of the game . Slow balls are of three different kinds , with a huge number of varieties of each kind . The original slow ball was merely a ball thrown slowly , the pitcher depending entirely upon a false motion to deceive the batter into believing he was pitching a fast ball . The pitcher would swing his arm , check it suddenly and " lob " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceive the batter in the slightest after it left the pitcher 's hand , but before that he was thrown off his balance , deceived by the arm motion , and was out of position to lunge forward and hit the ball . // Keefe , O'Day and most of the old time pitchers used that kind of a slow ball , but after batters began to watch the motion and shift their feet so as to run forward and meet the slow pitch , they were compelled to find something new and the development of the slow ball followed . The difficulty was to pitch a ball with full force and with the exact motion used in pitching a fast ball , and yet make the ball travel slowly . It was discovered that if the ball be held far back in the palm of the hand , with the little finger and the thumb clinched on opposite sides of it , or the little finger and the third finger on one side and the thumb on the other , with the other fingers held so as not to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Held that way , and with the arm swung at full speed and force , the finger and thumb gripping the ball tightly at the moment of release , the result is peculiar . Instead of revolving and going rapidly the ball wabbles from side to side , scarcely turning over , and allowing the full atmospheric pressure to strike the forward side with no revolution to lessen the friction . The result is the air pressure stops the ball and it loses speed rapidly , obeys the call of gravity and drops quickly toward the earth after expending its force . The harder the ball is thrown and the tighter the finger pressure at the instant of release , the more sharply the ball drops . Expert after expert developed the slow ' ball , until its perfection was reached in the hands of Brown , Frank Sparks , of Philadelphia , and " Doc " White of the Chicago Americans . The odd thing about pitching is this : ? a ball which // revolves in the air appears much smaller to the eye than one that fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere the smaller it appears . The slow ball , floating in the air and " dead , " looks as " big as a balloon , " as everyone in the bleachers remarks , and it does not deceive the eye . In fact if slow balls of that variety are pitched three or four times in succession they look so large that an amateur can hit them out of the lot . Successful use of that kind of a pitched ball consists entirely in surprising the batter , fooling him when he expects something else . The batter may miss the ball a foot , yet his eye is not deceived . He saw the ball perfectly but was off balance , just as he was for the slow pitch . The discovery of another kind of slow ball , and the most successful pitched ball ever used , arose from the fact that to deceive the eye the ball must be made to appear small , and that revolution , and rapid revolution at that , is necessary to deceive the eye into the idea of smallness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on that theory , began to develop a slow ball that revolved rapidly . It seemed impossible , because a ball that revolves rapidly usually has great speed , the greater the speed , the greater the revolution . But Radbourne , pitching for Providence , kept practicing until he found his slow ball . Ile had been a good pitcher before that , and after his discovery he became one of the greatest the game has ever known . No one could understand his success ; yet his discovery fast ball , with the thumb on one side and the two first lingers on the other , and at the moment of releasing it from his hand clinched the finger tips tightly into the seams of the ball and jerked backwards with the hand , the ball not only would revolve rapidly but would travel almost on a straight line ? yet slowly . The revolution , which was the reverse of the natural twist , helped the ball to hold its straight course , and it lost speed quickly after exhausting the reverse revolution and fell rapidly towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The secret of his discovery , Radbourne imparted to Clark Griffith , now manager of the Cincinnati club , and for years after the passing of Radbourne , Griffith was one of the premier pitchers of the country , holding practically a monopoly on his slow ball and using it with wonderful effect . But the ultimate and greatest development of that slow ball was left for Mathewson of New York , in whose hands it became the most effective ball ever used ; the " fadeaway , " which is only a development of the idea and the style used by Radbourne and Griffith , is a ball which almost all the pitchers in the country are trying with more or less success to imitate , Yet before Mathewson learned the trick of pitching his " fader , " there was one who pitched the same ball in even more wonderful style . Virgil Garvin , a tall , slender young Texan , with extraordinarily long fingers , bitched the ball before Mathewson , but he did not understand its use or worth . He pitched it with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // released the ball his hand was turned almost upside down . He jerked the hand downward and backward , the ball going over the sides of the lapped fingers , giving it a rapid revolution that resulted in the impression of great speed . Mathewson achieved his " fadeaway " by holding the ball exactly as Griffith did his slow ball and releasing it over the side of the middle finger . By the sharp holding pressure and " draw " of his fingers he put the " reverse English " on the ball , causing it to revolve rapidly for a distance , then lose speed and " fade " towards the ground and inward like a left handed pitcher 's slow curve . The action of the ball is exactly that of a massed billiard ball , and when the ball " fades " it really is striving to get grip enough on the air to return toward the pitcher . Scores of pitchers have imitated Mathewson 's " fadeaway ; " some with success . Flakenberg , of Cleveland , Willis of St. Louis , and Reulbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willis , a veteran , ranks as one of the cleverest of pitchers , and his use of slow curves is a revelation to young players . Chicago signed a youngster once who thought he could hit . Willis , who never had seen him before , teased him with slow curves and drooping slow pitches , and the youngster struck out three times . " Are there more like him ? " he inquired anxiously . " He 's only a second rater , " complained an angry player . // " Then , " said the youngster with immense cheerfulness , " I wo n't be here long . " With all these varieties of speed and curves , pitchers were not satisfied and each kept seeking more varieties of slants warranted to prevent hitting . There came into baseball in 1903 a ball that came near revolutionizing the game . The Chicago White Sox had signed Elmer Stricklett . While the team was training at New Orleans , Stricklett was pitching to batters in practice when he pitched a ball which , whirling rapidly for a short distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a slow ball and then darted down and out like a fast curve , leaving the batter staring in astonishment . Stricklett repeated the pitch and immediately every man on the field was clamoring to see the ball and bat at it , suspecting some trick . That night correspondents sent messages filled with wild theories regarding the " spit ball . " It is odd to recall the " call down " one of the correspondents received from the managing editor who telegraphed : " Please confine yourself to facts . No such thing as a spit ball is possible and the expression is vulgar . " The managing editor was partly right ; the ball is not a spit ball but a thumb ball . It is pitched with two ( sometimes with three ) fingers held on one side and the thumb on the other . The ball is made slippery at the point touched by the fingers , so that it slides off the fingers with the minimum of friction . The thumb , gripped tightly against the seam on the opposite side , gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that the ball , leaving the thumb , takes " reverse English . " It whirls rapidly for a short distance , until the heavy friction begins to overcome the natural rotary motion of the ball , when it stops rotating , as if a struggle between the two forces was going on , then the thumb " English " gains control and the ball darts just as it would have done if curved naturally , shooting in the direction the heaviest friction was applied . A " spit ball , " when pitched directly overhand , darts almost straight downward , and when pitched sidearm , with the thumb toward the body , it darts as a fast curve does , down and outward . Immense power and speed are required to pitch the ball successfully as the faster it is pitched the faster and sharper the curve will be . The " thumb ball , " pitched without moisture , was used before Stricklett found saliva would negative the friction of the fingers , but the object was to get heavy friction on the thumb , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " spit hall " was used in Griffith 's and Radbourne 's slow balls . Those who saw Griffith pitch will remember how he always tapped the ball upon his heel spikes , and tried to persuade umpires he was knocking the dirt out of the spikes . His object was to make small cuts or abrasions on the surface of the ball , against which to press his thumb and get more friction at the desired point . He never thought of greasing or wetting the ball to lessen friction on the opposite side . Obtaining more friction at one point was the object // of many pitchers . Some rubbed the ball on gritty dirt , others carried small files to use surreptitiously . One sharp rasp of the file and the ball was " winged , " at a certain point . The pitcher gripped his fingers against the " winged " spot and not only was the sharpness of the curve accentuated , but the " wings " by offering more resistance to the air , caused the ball to make eccentric shoots in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saliva with astonishing success , but oddly enough never hit upon the most successful manner of using it . Orth came nearer pitching an upcurve than any pitcher ever did , and many think his underhand ball really curved upward . Ile at least made the unnatural rotation of the ball overcome gravity to such an extent that the ball did not drop , whether it rose or not . In pitching he held his thumb on top of the ball , pressed tightly against a seam , and two fingers tinder it , not touching the seam , and he spat upon the place where the fingers came in contact with the leather . Then he pitched underhand with great force , his hand swinging almost straight downward at the level of his knee . His object was to make the ball angle from his knee to the batter 's shoulder and the false revolution imparted by his thumb was to make the ball " ride " the air and help maintain the angle . In seven years the number of " popups " hit off Orth 's pitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost twice the normal , batters continually hitting under his " thumb ball , " which in reality was a " spit ball " pitched upside down . // The overhand " spit ball , " with its marvelous shoot , brought an army of strong armed pitchers into the game , revived veterans whose careers seemed over , and ruined many great hitters . Almost every pitcher learned to use it ? and in the hands of Ed Walsh , the giant of the Chicago White Stockings , it reached its highest stage of development and made him the pitching marvel of the decade . Immediately variations of the ball were developed . Slippery elm , talcum powder , crude oil , vaseline were used to lessen the friction of the fingers while other pitchers , to get more friction on the thumb , used gum , pumice stone , resin or adhesive tape . Stricklett had founded a new school of pitching . " Spit ball " pitchers who can control the ball need few other curves , and the ball , when it breaks at the right spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon found to have drawbacks . Some pitchers abandoned it because it injured their arms . The catchers dreaded it because it was hard to handle , and harder to throw . The fielders opposed it because the slippery ball was hard to throw , and because , when hit , the ball takes doubly unnatural English , both from the bat and when it strikes the ground , and darts in weird manner . The batters objected , naturally , as it stopped their slugging . Frank Chance disliked the ball and during one spring training trip every team the Cubs played presented a " spit ball " pitcher . Chance wanted batting practice and was aggravated . One day at Memphis a giant " spit ball ' ' pitcher made his debut . Early in the // game he pitched a " spitter " to Chance . The ball failed to break and Chance drove it back with terrific force . The pitcher threw up his hands . They were driven against his head , the ball caromed on to center field and Chance , spluttering with rage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher I put out of business . " Walsh , master artist of the " spit ball , " pitches it in the most common way . He uses a trifle of slippery elm bark in his mouth and moistens a spot an inch square between the seams of the ball . His thumb he clinches tightly lengthwise on the opposite seam and , swinging his arm straight overhand with terrific force , he drives the ball straight at the plate . At times it will dart two feet down or out , depending upon the way his arm is swung . The American League , during the early days of the " spit ball , " used it so much that Charlie Dryden , angler and scribe , remarked that : " The American League consists of Ban Johnson , the spit ball ' and the Wabash Railroad . " The " ' knuckle ball , " a freak , promised much , and is successfully used by some long fingered pitchers , but it can not be a general success because it is impossible for the fingers to grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball is pitched with the three middle fingers bent under , the ball resting against the first joints , and held by the thumb and little finger on opposite sides . Summers , of Detroit , pitches the ball with great effect at times , but it is uncertain , being nothing // more or less than a " spit ball " pitched in freakish manner . The " wrist ball " is only a contortion of the wrist and hands , resulting in a slow curve , and the " finger nail ball " is another freak effort at a slow ball . There is more to pitching , however , than curving or inventing curves , and some of the most effective pitching is by angles rather than by curves . For some reason , unexplained , the deadly " cross fire " used with wonderful effect fifteen years ago , almost has been abandoned . The left-handers of former generations " cross fired " almost as often as they curved the ball and many right-handers used it . The ball was pitched sidearm , the hand being extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand was swinging he stepped to right or left in the direction of his pitching arm and hurled the ball back across the inside corner of the plate , at an angle . The balk rules caused the left-handers to abandon the pitch partially , and the passing of the side arm right-handers , probably explains its abandonment . Pfiester , Leifield , " Doc " White and Krause use the ball effectively but not frequently . Pitching from angles consists in angling the ball from high overhand to the batter 's knee , from the pitcher 's knee to the batter 's shoulder and from the limit of the outstretched arm to the outside corner of the plate . One of the best exhibitions of pitching by angles ever given was in the now famous game between Chicago and New York in September , 1908 , in which Merkle forgot to touch second base . Pfiester had // strained a ligament in his pitching arm , and a lump had formed on his forearm two inches high , the muscle bunching . He could not bend his arm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight balls and he asked Chance to let him try , as he always had been successful against the Giants . During the game he pitched three curved balls , all to Donlin , and all wwhen he had to retire Donlin on strikes to save the game . After each time he curved the ball he had to be helped to the bench , as he was nearly fainting . By changing the angles he kept New York from winning until the famous mixup in which Merkle figured . Shadowing the ball , which was an art in former days , is almost lost . A few pitchers try it , but without the skill of Bert Cunningham , Mattie Kilroy , Willie McGill and many of the old school . Griffith was the last pitcher to use it steadily . Shadowing consists of the pitcher sidestepping and placing his body on the line of the batter 's vision , so that the ball has no background except the pitcher 's body and the batter can not see it plainly until the ball almost is upon him . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reulbach was pitching for Chicago and a green umpire was officiating on the bases , with whom Reulbach became friendly . When no one was on bases Reulbach invited the new umpire to watch how his fast curve was breaking . That brought the umpire behind the pitcher , and Reulbach maneuvered him around until he was on the line of vision . For five innings the umpire helped beat Cincinnati . // nor did he discover why Reulbach was so friendly until the veteran umpire behind the bat ordered him to quit shadowing the ball and Reulbach laughed . The study of backgrounds , air currents , and atmospheric conditions by pitchers is part of their business . They take advantage of every bad background , which may hamper the batters , and shift from side to side on the slab to make the ball come to the batter on a line with some blinding sign . The batters , being in the majority on each team , however , insist upon good solid green backgrounds to increase hitting , and overrule the pitchers who prefer glaring yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction and force of the wind affect pitching greatly . A cross wind from either direction may decide whether a left-hander or a right-hander will pitch . The weight of the atmosphere affects the curves and scouts looking for pitchers at Denver or Colorado Springs ' know that the curve balls in that altitude will curve hardly half as far as at sea level . Al Orth was a student of such conditions . He was pitching for Philadelphia one hot day and was winning easily up to the seventh inning . The Philadelphia National grounds are surrounded by high walls and stands and scarcely a breath of wind enters them . In the seventh inning Orth suddenly lost control . His " thumb ball " kept breaking away from the plate , he gave several bases on balls , and before New York was retired , the Giants were within one run of a tie . Orth was puzzled . As he started for the bench , where the 11S BIG LEAGUE BASEBALL manager was ordering another pitcher to warm up , he stopped , looked around , wetted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have those doors under the stand closed and I 'll win this game , " remarked Orth to the manager . The doors were closed , Orth regained control and won without trouble . The great exit doors under the stand had been opened , preparatory to letting the crowd disperse , and a half gale of wind , blowing around the stands , was driving Orth 's underhand ball off its course . In 1909 Mordecai Brown thought he had discovered a new curve , which he executed by releasing the ball with a sharp jerk of the wrist , while his hand was near his hip . He used it repeatedly in one game , the ball breaking down and in sharply and faster than his " fadeaway " would do . He started to practice it the next day and it would not work . He persisted for days , then he discovered that , when the wind was blowing from the southeast , moderately hard , he could pitch the ball . The curve was the result of the angle at which the wind was striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all be known by one man , or by one team , as every pitcher has his own theories , and tricks , but this will show there is more to it than throwing a ball sixty feet . CHAPTER VIII THE " INSIDE GAME " * Once the City Editor sent me ( Fullerton ) to a meeting of an engineering society to report a lecture . In the course of his remarks the lecturer said : " At a distance of 185 miles this force , roughly speaking , is one two hundred and forty millionth part of a watt . " Fearing he might begin to speak gently I decamped , but ever since then I have regretted that I did not stay and sign that rough-spoken gentleman to work out the mathematics of baseball . I know that it is ninety feet from first base to second base , ninety feet from second base to third base , and that a baseball batted between those points is fair . I know that approximately 20 out of every Too balls batted fair during the season are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls batted during the season of 1909 in the American and National Leagues ( 1,284 chosen at random ) 138 got past the infielders . I know that infielders of the National League ( pitchers not included ) fielded 9,382 ground balls errorlessly during the season of 1909 . But how many millionths of a watt constitutes the chances of a hit being safe I can not figure out . The average speed of fifty ground balls hit in three games during which three of us held twentieth-of-a-second watches we ca. 119 // in one and three twentieth seconds . We know that the third baseman plays ordinarily 88 to 96 feet from the home plate , that the short stop playing " middling deep " is about 130 feet from the batter , that the second baseman is about two feet closer , and the first baseman 90 feet from the batter when a runner is on first base and 1 o2 when no one is on bases . Given the speed and direction of the ball and the speed of the player , it is possible to figure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball , but just as you start to write Q. E. D. the ball will take a bad bound . Given the average speed of the infielders , it would be possible to calculate beforehand approximately the number of base hits each team will make in a season ? if the players were automatons . The study of geometrical baseball is interesting in itself . Every ball player knows there are five " infield grooves " and four " outfield grooves , " spaces between fielders where any ball hit with moderate force will be " safe " unless a marvelous stop intervenes . It is certain that the first base groove is a foot and a half wide at first base , and widens gradually through the outfield . There is a space 7/ feet wide between the territories covered by the first and second basemen through which the ball ought to be able to escape , as neither man can move fast enough to reach it . There is a gap in the defense directly over second base 71/2 feet wide which is safe territory unless the pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball as it tries to pass // him . The gap between the short stop and third baseman is 8% feet wide , a foot wider than between the first and second baseman , because the ball goes faster in that direction , and the space between the third baseman 's extreme limit of finger reach and the foul line is a foot and a half . Therefore , to get back to millionths of watts , as there is 26% feet of ground unguarded out of 180 feet of defensible territory , Mr. Watt would argue that one ball in every 6 4/25 hit on the ground at an average speed of 1 3/20 seconds for 100 feet will be safe . The fact is that , in the major leagues , only about one in 16 gets past . Why ? In the season of 1909 I arranged with scorers to record hits of various kinds and secured the scores thus kept on 40 Central League games , 26 American Association games , and fourteen college games , to compare with major league scores kept in the same manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/3 passed the infielders . In the Central League one in 10 7/12 , in the American Association one in 12 2/43 , and in the American and National Leagues ( 45 games of my own scoring ) one in every 15 3/10 , The figures were amazing , as they followed so closely the classification of the Ieagues . They proved that there is reason for the " class , " but the proof is not found in mathematics , but in two words ( unless you hyphenate them ) , " team work . " The truth is that the figures were truthful when baseball was in its swaddling clothes , but they Iie egregiously now . The falsity of baseball mathematics is // that the gaps in the infield exist just as wide as ever , but are closed by team work . The college player who reaches 8 in 9 grounders , may be faster than the major league player who gets his hands on 16 out of 17 , but he does not understand the science of filling the grooves . The best testimonial to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill these grooves was given on the bench of an opposing team last summer . " I lit ' em where they ai n't , " growled one player to another who had just been thrown out by Evers . " I do ; but he 's always there , " retorted the other . This science of defensive work which enables four men to cover 18o feet of ground is the most fascinating part of modern baseball . It has become so intricate and involved that the spectator at a game of baseball between two ' highly developed teams really does not see the game at all . He sees the plays , the stops , the throws , the catches . He sees men shift and swing , change position , move forward , move back , move to the right or left , and then move back again , but all the beauty of the inside game is lost to him , nor does he imagine that behind each move is the master mind of a field general . The spectator yells himself purple in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't " release that big stiff " for fumbling . Then he sits indignantly striving to imagine why the manager is plastering language upon Smith for failing to stop a ball he " could n't have got anyhow . " figure // " Inside baseball " is merely the art of getting the hits that " he could n't have got anyhow . " Now watch this play closely . See whether or not you can discover what is going on . Pat Moran stoops behind the batter and hides his right hand back of his mitt . Ed Reulbach , pitcher , shakes his head affirmatively . Johnny Evers stoops , pats his hand in the ( lust , touches it to his knee and rests it upon his hip . Jimmy Sheckard trots twenty feet across left field angling in toward the diamond . Steinfeldt creeps slowly to his left ; Tinker moves toward second base and Evers takes four or five steps back and edges toward Chance , who has backed up five feet . Reulbach pitches a fast ball high and on the out corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yells in sudden apprehension . The ball seems a sure hit ? going fast toward right field . Evers runs easily over , stops the ball , tosses it to Chance and Mitchell is out . You saw all that . The ball was hit in " the groove " directly at the 7/ foot gap the geometrician will say is vacant , yet Evers fielded it . Now this is what happened ; when Moran knelt clown he put the index finger of his right hand straight down , then held it horizontally on the top of his mitt . Evers saw that Moran had signaled Reulbach to pitch a fast ball high and outside the plate . He rubbed his hand in the dirt , signaling Tinker , who patted his right hand upon his glove , replying he understood . Then Evers rested his hand upon his hip , signaling Sheckard , the outfield captain , what ball was to be pitched . Sheckard crept toward // the spot where Mitchell would hit that kind of a ball 95 out of 100 times . While Reulbach was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , Evers called sharply to Chance ( whose good ear is toward him ) , and Tinker called to Steinfeldt . While Reulbach 's arm was swinging every man in the team was moving automatically toward right field , in full motion before Mitchell hit the ball . The gaps at first base , between first base and second , over second base and between third and short , were closed hermetically , while the gap between Steinfeldt and the third base line was opened up 22 feet . The ball , if hit on the ground , had no place to go except into some infielder 's hands , unless Reulbach blundered and Mitchell " pulled " the ball down the third base gap . Every man on the team knew if Reulbach pitched high , fast and outside , Mitchell would hit toward right field . The only chance Mitchell had to hit safe was to drive the ball over the head of the outfielders , or hit it on a line over 7 feet and less than 15 feet above the ground . If Reulbach had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and inside , or a slow ball , the team would have shifted exactly in the opposite way . Every club worthy the name uses the same system , but it is in the major leagues that it reaches its highest perfection . That is the explanation of the fact that college players stop eight out of nine grounders and big leaguers stop 15 out of 16 or thereabout . There is not much difference in the mechanical ability of // players in the minor and major leagues , and the managers are men of almost equal experience , but the major league teams remain together year after year , while the minor league managers are forced to make an almost new team each season and teach the system to many recruits . The Milwaukee American Association team probably played as intricate and involved inside baseball in 1909 as any team ever did and it came near winning the pennant . " Stoney " McGlynn , the veteran pitcher , was chiefly responsible . McGlynn " has n't much " ( which means he does not pitch great curves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em where he wants to , " and with a team behind him trained well enough to know every ball he pitches and to move in the direction the ball will be hit he is a great pitcher . With a broken up infield he is bad . The system of signaling used by major league teams is so involved that it requires constant thought and a good memory to follow the signals , even after knowing them . No team dares use the same signals for any length of time . Some players become so skillful in detecting the signals of opponents that they sometimes compel the other club to change them two or three times during a game . To show how complicated the system is , the Chicago Cubs catchers each have five signals which are plainly visible to the second baseman and short stop . If the pitcher gives the signal , the catcher repeats it by a different code . The catcher uses his hands , feet , knees or eyes in signaling . The commonest code is one finger // figure in various positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a snapping of the thumb for a spit ball , a closed fist for a slow ball and the palm out if he wants a " pitch out , " the ball being thrown wide to prevent the batter from hitting it when the defensive side suspects or , knows a hit and run play is to be attempted . Sometimes the signal is given by the position of the feet . Schmidt of Detroit , using hands to signal when the bases are clear , signals with his eyes when runners are on bases , also using his hands to deceive them . In the World 's Series between Detroit and Pittsburg last year Tommy Leach of Pittsburg tipped off Schmidt 's signals repeatedly by guessing that when Smith signaled one thing with his hands he was flashing the opposite signal with his eyes . The second baseman and short stop see the catcher 's signal and verify it by signaling to each other , deciding which is to cover second base . Also the intention of the pitcher is signaled to every member of the team . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of position and know what was to be pitched . He is , however , too intent on watching the pitcher to see anything else and , besides , the full motion of the defensive team is not noticeable until the pitcher starts to pitch , and then it is too late for the batter to realize anything except that the ball is coming . The coachers see the movement and half the time call out to the batter " last " or " Curve , " but he does not hear until the ball is past him . i f you doubt this , try some day to see what becomes of the bat when a batter hits the ball and you will realize how hard it is to watch anything except the ball . In addition the second baseman and short stop have a code of their own , consisting of two signals , given with the hands , feet , arms or eyes , ? sometimes by spoken words that are meaningless to any one else , ? by which they understand which one is to take throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of signals by which he directs the movements of the team . Each man on the defensive infield has at least nine signals he must remember , most of which are changed , in meaning at least , every day . Each batter has six , three with the three preceding batters and three with the three men following him , making fourteen signals a day , besides the ones used by the manager . The second baseman and short stop have from 20 to 24 signals to keep in mind , most of which are changed every day and sometimes three times during a game . In 1909 , when the hint had gone through the American League that the New York team was // stealing signals , the Chicago White Sox changed signals nine times in one game , no signal meaning the same thing in any two innings . There is no betrayal of secrets to explain how these signals are used or what they are , since they are changed so often that they may mean anything . Chance usually signals for a runner to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench . He orders hit and run plays by looking over the bats . He orders double steals by lifting his cap and sometimes varies this by using the names of players . If he calls " Sheckard " he means steal , if " Schulte , " hit and run , if " Hofman , " go on the first ball . Trained watchers at baseball games , men who have scored and reported hundreds of games , seldom observe the signals or understand what is happening . In one game a Chicago player , in defiance of Chance 's orders , insisted upon remaining at first base after receiving an order to steal . Possibly the runner thought the opposing pitcher had caught the signal and was watching him too closely . Whatever the reason he did not run . The batter allowed two strikes to go over without moving to hit the ball . The crowd was howling at the batter , who was obeying orders , and the batter happened to be Steinfeldt , whose name that day was being used as the signal to steal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Steinfeldt , " at the top of his voice and a veteran baseball man remarked : ' " What is Chance yelling at Steiny for ? He 's playing the game . He ought to yell at that lobster on first . " // But the signals used in attack have nothing to do with infield defensive work beyond showing how complicated the system is and how much the players must remember . This infield defense involves much beyond knowing the signals . Its primary object is to enable the players to start before the ball is hit , as half the time required to reach a ball fifteen feet to one side is occupied in starting . The faster the second baseman can go to the left , and the short stop to the right , the closer they can play to second base , reducing the gap there without widening the others . The strength of arm of the short stop is another important factor in closing the gaps , for the deeper he can play the narrower the gap . With every foot he moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be remembered that every runner who reaches a base " ties up " one of the defense 's players . On reaching first base , he forces the baseman to remain on the bag , and widens the right field gap by six feet at least . Runners on first and second tie up two men , and when this is the case and there is but one out , and a bunt expected or feared , the entire infield is " tied up " and the chances of the ball being batted safe are more than doubled . The primary object in signaling is to enable the defensive players to start in the direction the ball is expected to be hit , and this is more important when runners are on bases than at other times . A player in motion can travel twelve feet while one who is " flatfooted " when the ball is hit is getting under way . If figure // the pitcher blunders , disaster results , as the players in motion seldom can recover and field the ball if it is hit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " control " is the greatest element in a pitcher 's success . But it is ability to hit all around the field that makes great batters . Men like LaJoie , Wagner , Leach , Evers and the late " Cozy " Dolan , who can " pull , push , and poke "  --  that is , twist their bats and hit in unexpected directions ? break up the inside game and win many contests . I always shall ' believe that Detroit lost the World 's Championship of 1909 either through bad infield signaling or through too much signaling from the bench . Detroit 's system is rather intricate and confusing because Jennings continually signals from the bench and the coaching lines . His signals to batters are given with hands during his famous grass-pulling , and with his legs while doing his famous " E-yah " act . From the bench , however , he uses sometimes spoken words , sometimes signals with his hands . I may be mistaken and some of his men wrong in charging the Tiger leader with the fatal blunders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have failed to get the ball where he wanted it to go , or the Pittsburg players may have performed the seemingly impossible and hit balls in the wrong direction . However that may be , Leach upset the entire defensive infield work of the Tigers . On three occasions , Moriarity was running in fast when Leach , who was at bat , drove the ball past him , and once Bush was moving to cover // second when the ball went down " the groove . " Four of Wagner 's long hits in the series were to left field and two of them at least were made off balls that were ordered to be pitched outside whether they were or not . It is rather unfair to criticize infield work by exhibitions given in a series in which every man is strained to the limit and with immense crowds cheering and restricting the playing space , but the inside work of both Pittsburg and Detroit in the series was ragged and seemed to be wrong on many occasions . On two occasions , Bush and Delehanty were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no play on the diamond in which the importance of infield signaling is so openly demonstrated to spectators as when a runner on first and another on third base are planning to attempt a double steal , either straight or delayed . When that situation arises short stop and second basemen exchange signals deciding which shall cover the base and which shall " cut in , " which means , meet the throw before it gets to the base in order to return it to the catcher immediately should the runner at third start for home . Almost every team makes the play solely with regard to the strength of arm of the short stop or second baseman and the throwing force of the catcher . If the short stop has a " whip " strong enough to throw back the full distance , he covers second and the second baseman guards his territory . If either has a weak arm , the other runs in to meet the throw . Every player // watches sharply for the exchange of signals from bench , from the coachers , batter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught , the catcher instantly orders the ball " pitched out " high and fast in the best position for making a fast hard throw . To show how closely the two teams watch each other in that situation : Cincinnati was playing Chicago with Frank Roth catching for the former team . Runners were on first and third . Roth signaled to the pitcher for a curve ; Chance saw the signal and flashed a delayed double steal order . Huggins caught that signal , the Reds switched positions rapidly , and Roth signed for a pitch-out . The pitch-out signal was detected by Kane , who was coaching , and Chance signaled for a change . The result was the runners held their bases , and the pitcher wasted a ball . Roth signaled again , the infield changed , and Chance ordered the delayed steal . Roth was warned and ordered another pitchout , but no sooner had he flashed that signal and Chance had ordered another wait , than Roth ordered a fast straight ball pitched , thinking to out-guess Chance . But as Roth changed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , signaled a hit and run , with the result that a base hit tore through the infield and broke up the game . The great danger to the defense on the double steal is that unless a pitch-out is certain both the short stop and second baseman are running to a line between home and second base and gaps 35 feet wide are left on both sides of the pitcher if the batter elects to hit . // Consequently , if the attacking team decides to play hit and run instead of the double steal , and the defenders have been led to expect an attempt at the latter play , the chances of the batter hitting safe are tripled . Late in the season , after the men know each other and the opponents perfectly , the infielders frequently discard the signals , having become so familiar with the plays and the style of making them that they know exactly what to do without signaling . Evers and Tinker of Chicago play entire games with looking at each other except when an unknown batter comes up to hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the geometry of the game . The average " fan " thinks that about four out of every batter hit fly balls . Managers growl all the time for the batters to " hit ' em on the ground , " the theory being that more hits go safe on the ground than in the air . It is true more runners reach first base on ground hits than on fly balls , but the percentage of safe hits largely favors aerial batting . This is because so many grounders are fumbled and so few flies muffed . This involves another study of angles , and an entirely new departure in infield defensive work . To discover what proportion of balls are hit on the ground , I took a mass of score books and classified 10,000 batted balls , every team in the National and American Leagues being represented in the figures . Really I scored 10,074 plays , because the number ran over unexpectedly and I did not know which 74 to deduct . Of // them , 3,602 were fly balls , 5,171 were grounders , 344 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from flies . Of the 10,074 balls batted , 2,067 were scored as base hits . Of the 3,602 fly balls , 747 fell safe and only 18 were muffed , which shows that the fielders catch almost everything they get their hands upon . Of the 5,171 ground balls , 424 were scored hits . Of the 344 bunts , 155 went safe , and of those 155 the fielders got their hands on 114 . Of the 957 line drives , 741 resulted in safe hits . But to show the ground-covering ability of the infielders further calculation is necessary . In scoring , I place a small " T " above hits I believe too hard to handle , and a small " D " over hits which are doubtful either through bad bounding of the ball or other cause . Of the 424 hits through the infield , 162 were marked " T " and 49 were marked " D. " So the players reached the ball 211 times and failed to field it ; and of the 213 times the ball went through untouched 46 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong way , in other words , blundering or being outgeneraled by the batsman . Out of the 5,171 grounders the players actually reached all except 213 , or about .041 per cent. , whereas on the natural chances of covering the ground they should have reached only about 800 per cent . instead of 959 per cent . of batted balls . The figures seem to show that by team work they were enabled to get in touch with 159 per cent . more batted balls than the geometry of the diamond would indicate . // The geometry of the game becomes more complex the deeper it is studied . Not only must the players on the infield know when to start in a given direction , but they must know exactly what angle to take to meet each ball . Further , they must change the angle to meet the running speed of each batter . If , for instance , " Larry " McLean , of Cincinnati , hits the ball , a second baseman will run backward , his path and the path of the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the batter he will run forward , making the lines meet in an obtuse angle . Moreover , they know to a nicety just where they must meet a ball of any given speed , and they start there almost instinctively . Oddly enough , the men can go much faster toward certain points than toward others , even when they are of equal speed , and they can , if they judge the speed of the ball and the runner , close up the gaps still further by reaching the spot in the ball 's path toward which they can travel fastest . But all that is mechanical and habitual . It is the inside game which calls the brain into play to extend the reach of the arms . Therefore , as Mr. Euclid , who invented diamonds , would say : If X covers 24 feet with his arms and legs and i8 with his brain , Y , the base-runner , is out , provided Z , the umpire , does not call him safe . Q. E. D. CHAPTER IX OUTFIELDING An English cricketer , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his county many years and was considered one of the best bats in all England , was sitting in the stands at the Polo Grounds , New York , watching his first baseball game . A batter hit a long , high fly to center field and Seymour jogging over unconcernedly , caught the ball and tossed it back to the infield . " Bravo ! Bravo ! Well caught ! Well caught ! " shouted the Englishman , clapping his hands . His companion , an American , flushed with embarrassment while all the spectators in that part of the stand roared with laughter . The Englishman could not understand why the spectators regarded him as they would have a man who applauded during the death scene in a play . From an American standpoint , the Englishman 's outburst showed merely ignorance of the game , while as a matter of fact it proved that American crowds have become blase . The spectators take for granted really wonderful catches and unless the outfielder is compelled to climb a tree , turn a double somersault , leap over a ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he scarcely attracts attention . The viewpoint of the Englishman really was the proper one . He 140 // realized that Seymour had performed a difficult feat and was applauding the skill of the American player in catching fly balls . He had watched cricketers ludicrously pursuing easy pop ups and floundering all over themselves in the effort to catch them , while the Americans , accustomed to seeing nearly every fly caught , regarded the feat as commonplace . The marvelous work of the outfielders is perhaps the least appreciated part of the National game . Figures will prove how wonderful the fielding is . The fact is that any batted ball which remains in the air three and a quarter seconds will be caught unless it is hit over some fence , crowd , or stand . Ninety-nine out of Too fly ' balls that stay in the air three seconds will be caught . In fact any fly ball , unless a sharp line fly hit in an unexpected direction , or one hit far over the head of a player , will be caught in nine cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seeing fly balls caught that whenever the ball is hit into the air , the men who record the plays score the put out to the fielder before the ball strikes his hands , and when a fly is snuffed , they are the last to see what has happened . Further , while often lenient with the infielders on fumbles , they charge the outfielder with errors no matter how far he may run , or what position he may be in , if the ball strikes his hands . They expect him to catch every ball he can get his hands upon . Out of one thousand fly balls batted in games in the American and National Leagues during the season of 1909 ( games chosen at random from score books ) all except 27 were caught and nine of these were mis142 BIG LEAGUE BASEBALL judged either because of the glare of the sun , the bad background or heavy shadows under the stands caused the outfielders to start in the wrong direction so they were unable to recover in time to catch the ball . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire seasons without missing any ball upon which they can lay their hands . Catching flies is the least part of the work of outfielders . They must not only be able to catch fly balls , but catch them in position to make a throw the instant the ball touches the hands . They must have strength of arm , accuracy and absolute knowledge of the angles of the field and they must throw on the line and make the ball bound accurately into the hands of the catcher or baseman . Primarily the outfielder must know the " inside game " as well as does the infielder , although not called upon to get into the play as often . He can make more mistakes and be more careless , but he should make as close a study of batters and base runners and watch the signals . If he is to succeed he must have an intuitive sense of direction , keen hearing , a quick eye ; must make a study of backgrounds and take advantage of every light and shadow . The " grooves " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the positions and speeds of the outfielders . They run from a point directly behind the positions of the short stop and second basemen between the outfielders , widening rapidly after passing the line between the fielders . Down these " grooves " any // hard hit ball is certain to go safe unless the fielder has anticipated the direction of the hit . He must do this either through knowledge of where the batter usually hits or through signals informing him what kind of ball the pitcher is going to pitch , from which he can judge the general direction in which the batter is likely to hit . Intimate knowledge of batters , where they hit and how , is the primer of the outfielder . Each man must know how hard Fred Clarke , a left handed batter , is likely to hit a left handed pitcher 's fast curve towards left field , and how hard he will pull the ball to right if ' it is pitched inside the plate . The left fielder must know that he must play fifty feet nearer the diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every batter in the entire league must be played in the same manner and the range of an outfielder in one game frequently is one hundred feet between his inside and his outside distances . Frequently , of course , a batter will hit where he is not expected to hit , but if the fielder is playing correctly no criticism is offered . It is regarded as one of the inevitable happenings . Jimmy Slagle , for years regarded as one of the greatest judges of batters and the direction of their hits , went wrong one season . It was not because his judgment was at fault but because , for weeks and weeks , hatters hit exactly where they seemed least likely to hit . The same thing happened to Sheckard of Chicago in i 9 , and Mike Mitchell , of Cincinnati , in 1908 . Sheckard , after a phenomenal run of these accidents , // at the close of an inning one day took off his glove , closed his eyes and whirling around and around , let the glove fly . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his team mates . " I 'm getting so I 'm always wrong calling the turn on where batters will hit , " he replied , " So I 'm going to play wherever the glove lights . " The following inning he played on the spot where he picked up the glove . He was fifty feet out of proper position for the batter , but that unlucky man drove a hard line fly straight into Sheckard 's hands , and from that to the end of the season Sheckard guessed right . He claimed the scheme changed his luck . Different teams have widely varying systems of outfield play . Some play the " outside distance " on the theory that the fielders can come forward faster than they can go out after balls over their heads . Others play the " inside distance , " on the theory that their throws will be more accurate and faster and that the number of short flies they will reach will more than offset the few long ones that will pass over their heads . Others play the middle distance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more in favor among the thinking managers . The Boston American team of 1909 played the outside limit all the time , but the speed of the outfielders saved the team . Pittsburg , playing the greatest shifting game of the year , used all the limits , changing their outfield distances with regard to the pitcher who was // working for them . The Chicago National team played the " middle distance " and Detroit played the inside limit most of the time , although shifting frequently . Of course outfielders adapt their distances to their own weaknesses or strength . Some men can move forward with great speed and are uncertain either as to direction or distance on balls hit over them . With Cobb , Clarke , Schulte , Leach , Davy Jones and Speaker , the distance chosen amounts to little , as they can retrieve mistakes in judgment by speed of foot . With men like Lumley , Sheckard , and Crawford , who lack speed , the study of direction is much more necessary . They are compelled to make up by brainwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faster competitors . Willie Keeler , in his best days , was perhaps the greatest judge of where batters would hit that ever played , and in addition his quickness of perception gave him a running start after every fly ball . Walter Brodie , a great judge of fly balls , perhaps the greatest except O'Neill , could run with the ball , without looking , and catch it over his head , and he seemed to know from the crack of the bat exactly where the ball would land . " Big Bill " Lange had the same faculty of following balls hit over his head . " Kip " Selbach , in many respects nearly their equal , hardly could catch a ball that once went over him , and to defend himself he played the outside distance and came forward with wonderful speed . Clarke , leader of the Pittsburg World 's Champions in 1909 , is the rare combination who can go in // any direction , especially toward the foul line for curving line drives . Cobb , although forced as a right fielder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his equal in catching low line drives while going at top speed . How deeply outfielders make a study of backgrounds and other conditions affecting their fielding is little understood outside the profession . Nearly all grounds are laid out so that the batter hits from south-west to north-east , in order that the lowering sun in midsummer may interfere as little as possible with the outfielders . But in games during late July , August and early September , the players work under a heavy handicap . After the middle of the game the sun , slanting over the top or through the stands and reflecting off them , glares into the faces of the fielders and gives the men in the outer line of defense much trouble . But the glare of the brassy sky , and the sun is not so much of a handicap as the heavy shadow that fails in front of the stands and stretches to the pitcher 's box . The ball must rise out of this shadow before the fielder can gauge its flight accurately . In the construction of the modern skyscraper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of outfielders . The devices and ingenuity of players in striving to overcome this handicap are revelations as to their powers of observation and the fertility and quickness of their brains . One game between Pittsburg and New York in 1909 illustrates the point . McGraw had a mediocre outfield and knew it . He was unable to // strengthen the outfield so he devised a plan which made his outfield at least as good as that of the opponents in the games played on the Polo Grounds . New stands had been erected , and McGraw ordered them painted a washed yellow , a bilious-hued , glaring , eye-+racking yellow . The background offered by the stand was a desperate one against which to field , but McGraw had the satisfaction of knowing that the other fellows , no matter how much superior mechanically , could not derive much satisfaction from their superiority on that field . In the game with Pittsburg " Bull " McCormick was at bat and Clarke , in left field , seemed to be playing strangely out of position . He knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was playing nearly fifty feet from where he should have been . McCormick hit down the left line and Clarke was compelled to make a spectacular running catch to get the ball at all , although it would have been easy had he been in place . When criticised for misplaying the batter he grinned and explained . " Did you ever notice , " he said , still grinning , " that over by the New York bench , back of first base , there is a little gate ? " " No , what has that to do with it ? " " Well , that gate is green . By moving around toward center field I could keep my eyes on that green gate . It rested the eyes and relieved them from the glare of the yellow , so I could see the ball the moment it was hit . " // Players ordinarily dislike to play when the crowd , moving and turning , makes a dark shifting background . They welcome hot days when the majority of the spectators remove their coats and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a young woman in Chicago who became unpleasantly conspicuous because Schulte used her as a background for fly balls , and when she moved from the box which she always occupied Schulte mentioned the fact that her green gown had helped him play . She was a loyal rooter , and in spite of the publicity , returned to her post to help the team , but sad to relate , she missed the point and wore a new brown broadcloth . Green is the most restful color and many experiments have proved that it really aids both batting and fielding . There is one scientific player in the major leagues who has such faith in green that he carries a square of green cardboard in his uniform and gazes at it occasionally in order to rest his eyes . Outfield throwing is one of the features of the modern game in which it is inferior to the game as played fifteen to twenty-five years ago . The reason is that outfielders of today do not practice distance throwing , preferring to save their arms . There are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who possesses the speed and accuracy of Jimmy Ryan , formerly one of Anson 's champions . Ryan was left handed , and had the faculty of catching every ball in position and throwing with remarkable quickness , speed and accuracy . He threw to the plate from right // field on the first bound , and twenty feet from first base , inside the diamond , he kept a little patch of the turf rolled smooth , watered and hardened . His throws were aimed at that prepared patch and off it the ball carromed like a shot into the hands of the catcher . Tommy McCarthy , in left field , threw to the plate , to first base , to second , and threw at every opportunity . Ryan and McCarthy after thirty years in baseball , still have good arms . Fifteen or twenty years ago outfielders gave exhibitions of throwing to the plate before games , throwing from long distances . The Chicago White Stockings had a target at the plate at which they would throw in practice . This practice made outfield throwing much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements for successful outfielding are numerous enough , but the difference between outfielders seldom lies only in the mechanical abilities of the men . The chief difference is in the way in which they get into the team work , and close the gaps between the fields . Place the outfielders in their natural positions , that is , the center fielder directly on the line with the plate and second base , with the right and left fielders half way between him and the foul lines , and nearly every batter in the major leagues would be a 300 hitter . That shows the necessity of knowing all batters and shifting position with each pitched ball . The three fastest runners in the world can not cover the ground between fielders on hits traveling 250 feet in two seconds , unless they have antici- // pated the direction of the hit , shifted position with the pitch , and made the start before the ball was hit . If the outfielders know where a batter hits , what ball is being pitched , and make one step before the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gaps are closed . Against some rank right field hitters the fielders can shift until all three are playing within reach of almost any ball hit to right , while the only gap existing is perhaps 100 feet down the left field line , in which direction the batter can not hit the ball which is being pitched . With the man who hits all around the field the outfielder 's only chance is to know just what the pitcher is using , for there are certain kinds of balls that are batted in certain directions and hardly can be hit any other where . Each outfield , therefore , has its captain , who takes the signal and transmits it to the other two , who shift positions according to his orders . Some outfield captains rely upon the keenness of their eyes to get the signal from the catchers , but when the opposing team is watching closely for signals this is impossible . The New York pitchers , - for many seasons , reversed the process , and the pitchers pitched according to the positions taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , but the practice of centralizing the signaling so that every member of the team knows what is being done is regarded as better . The Pittsburg pitchers , because Manager Clarke is an outfielder , frequently take their cues from the position he assumes , and not infrequently during 1909 , he // signaled from the outfield to Gibson what ball to order pitched . Most outfielders , when they can not get the signal for pitched balls , play entirely on their knowledge of the batsman . The Chicago Cubs originated the best system of any yet used . Sheckard , the outfield captain , received every ball and strike signal given , via Evers , who passed the signal of the catcher to Sheckard by varying positions of his hand upon his hip . Sheckard declares the signals contributed greatly to the work of the outfield . When , in spite of all these precautions , the ball breaks through the outfield and goes " down the groove , " perfect understanding as to which fielder shall " chase , " and which shall relay the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a second 's delay will transform a three base hit into a home run ; a double into a three bagger . The signal is passed in one word , and the one elected to chase , pursues the ball without question , although he may return swearing . Each outfielder has special difficulties with which to contend , and of the three , the work of the right fielder is , perhaps , the most difficult . The reason for that is that balls hit towards right field curve sharply in the air and compel the fielder to extend his territory far over the foul line . The curve of the balls hit by right handers toward right field is especially troublesome . The left fielder has the difficulty in lesser degree . In the modern development of the game the left fielder has come in for some added troubles , especially as the result of the increasing skill of the left-handed batters // in poking and shoving short flies over the infield into his territory . The center fielder has easier work as regards the curving of batted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover more territory and to go in both directions . He has more chance to reach the home run drives " down the grooves . " His chief trouble , however , is with line flies so hard that the wind pressure is likely either to make them dart downward suddenly , or shoot upward on some heavier current of air , giving him more opportunities for misjudging hard hit balls . The study of air currents and wind directions is necessary for successful outfielding . The condition of the sky , the direction and force of the wind , whether it is steady or gusty , all are to be taken into consideration by the player before the game , and he must change positions with the force of the wind during the game . In one game in St. Louis in 1909 , the wind blowing across the field , crowded the fielders further and further over until all three were on the right side of the direct line through center field . There is a saying in baseball that " A high sky , a head wind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outfielders vouch for the truth of the adage . CHAPTER X BATTING Batting is the aggressive part of the game ; the true test of the nerve , courage and eye-speed of players , and the chief center of interest in every contest . The importance of batting has , it is true , been largely overestimated , and few even of the managers and owners who have sought in every part of the country for that rarest of players the " Three Hundred hitter , " realize the change that has come over batting in the last decade . The veterans who lament the passing of the sluggers of the " good old days , " the old timer who recalls times when six .300 batters played on one team , and the student who looks back over the records of the mighty men of the ash , all have the idea that present day batters are inferior to the old time sluggers . They are misled by figures . The batters of the modern game are better hitters , more scientific , and more effective than those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batsmen , their hits , and the results of their ' hits , will prove the point . If further proof is needed it is to be found in the strange acts of managers who , after scouring the country to find a .300 hitter , handicap him , restrain his batting , make a .250 hitter of him , and then consider him a better batter than when , perhaps , he batted .325 . The fact is , the batters of to-day are more scientific 154 // and resourceful , know more about handling bats , and better how to attack the weak points , than their predecessors did . The difference is the same as that between the slugging fighter , who rushed and pounded down his man by sheer strength , and the skilful boxer who , with one well directed blow , ends the battle . The reasons for the decline of the averages of safe hits , and the number of long hits , are varied . The pitching , it is known , has improved steadily and rapidly , the defensive work of teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , skill , and luck will make any batter a .300 hitter . There were great pitchers in the old days ; Clarkson , Keefe , Nat Hudson , Rusie , Ramsey ; a host of them , but the general average of pitching was lower . Every team now has six or seven high class pitchers , where the old clubs had one good , perhaps , and three weak twirlers . But the pitching itself is not the chief cause of the general decrease of batting , as will be shown . Frequently batters who slaughter the ball in the minor leagues , and hit any kind of pitching , fail utterly when drafted into the major leagues . Many followers of the sport imagine that the reason for this failure is to be found in the superiority of the major league pitchers , which is wrong . These men would hit in the major leagues , and hit hard , perhaps as hard as in the minors , if allowed to hit with the same freedom . There are , in the major leagues , many batters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reason for both is found in team // work , which is the chief cause of the decline in batting . Some batters are adapted to the system , others are not . In the perfected team work of the major leagues batters must hit to advance runners and score runs rather than to get base hits . They are compelled to permit the kind of ball they can hit to cut the plate unmolested and then hit at one which , perhaps , they are lucky to touch . Besides many times they are ordered to wait , and not to hit at all , in order to allow the pitcher to weary himself . A few years ago the Chicago club purchased a player late in the season who was one of the great batters of the American Association . His hitting helped the team to win the pennant , yet Chance released him without even bringing him to Chicago to play the final games . The act surprised the followers of the Cubs and someone asked Chance why the man was released . " First ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chance was right . The player was worthless as a team hitter , but if permitted to hit the first ball pitched to him he batted heavily and if he could have been the first man up in every inning he probably would have led the league in hitting . The reason for the improvement in scientific batting lies in practice , and the amount of batting practice indulged in during the season is astonishing . It is the one thing about the game of which the players never tire . Morning , afternoon and evening from March first until far into October players bat as long as any158 BIG LEAGUE BASEBALL one will pitch to them , and on November first the bat feels as good in their hands when it meets a ball squarely as it did the day spring training started . The first thing in the spring is the selection of bats and when the season closes the players still are sawing up disgraced bats and buying new ones . Bats get to be a mania with some . Roger Connor used to oil , polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from his window while he took his favorite to bed with him . There was a bat in the Boston club in 1909 which became famous . It belonged to Gessler , and a scorer one day jestingly marked upon it the symbols meaning a two base hit and a single . Gessler happened to make a double and a single that afternoon , and the players swarmed upon the scorer pleading with him to mark hits into the bat . He marked it full of hits ; the Red Sox began a wonderful hitting spurt , all using the same bat , and before long the scorer was claiming part of the credit for their winning streak . Before the season ended Gessler hardly would have traded the bat for its weight in gold . " Evelyn " the famous bat with which Isbell , of the Chicago White Sox , made four two base hits in one game and won the World 's Championship for his team , " Big Betsy , " Ed Delehanty 's famous war club , " Nellie , " used by Schulte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the favorites of good hitters and used by them during batting streaks . There is a player on the Brooklyn club who has an // odd habit of using in practice the bat he intends to use in a game to " fill it up with base hits . " He tries bat after bat during practice , and if he happens to hit well with one , get " two or three hits into it , " he uses that one during the game to get the hits out again . The eagerness with which the batting practice is indulged in often is laughable . One evening two members of the Cleveland club broke training and returned to the hotel at two A. M. , feeling jolly . They reached their own floor in the hotel without being caught by the manager and went to the room of a player who is a wonderful hitter . Banging on his door they urged him to get up . " What do you want ? " growled the awakened slugger . " Get up , we 're going to have batting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weakness of the inmate of the room . " There in a minute , " responded the player , and as they heard him scramble from bed the jokers fled . Ten minutes later the night clerk was startled to see the great player enter the lobby in his uniform , carrying his two favorite bats , nor did he see the joke until the clerk pointed into the darkness outside . In the early days of the game batting practice was neglected . The heavy hitters practiced , but there was no system to their work , and very little time or thought was given to the scientific hitting , except by a few men who realized the possibilities of play . " Dickey " Pearce invented the bunt and the " fair foul " hit in 1866 , but // generations passed before the bunt was used intelligently by all classes of players . Indeed it was the theory of players , as it now is with many followers of the game , that " place hitting " was more or less of a myth . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major league players have made intelligent efforts towards perfecting place hitting , and their successes in that line have been wonderful . Managers began to realize that the attacks could be directed at the vital spots of defending teams , and the attack has steadily become more resourceful , better calculated to bring results , and more adapted to cope with the improved pitching . Especially has it been made necessary in order to break up defensive team work . Whether the modern game of " push , poke , shove and chop " is better than the old " swing and kill it " style may be judged by a comparison . The Philadelphia club from 1894 to 1898 always had from five to seven .300 hitters in the game . In one game in 1897 there were nine .300 batters . Yet the team never won a pennant . The games were spectacular , but even when hitting hardest it was a bad hitting ball club . The Chicago White Sox , " the Hitless Wonders , " won the World 's Championship in 1906 when ranking almost last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any team ever organized in concentrating every move toward making runs , one at a time , and while nearly weakest in batting , scored the greatest average number of runs per hit of any club in the history of the game . // There is a wide difference of opinion among players themselves as to the placing of balls hit hard , but the fact remains that some players can do it by holding their bats at certain angles , and the increase in skill in the last five years has been great . None denies that balls can be poked , or pushed easily in a given direction . Many of the old timers were skilful in " pulling " the ball foul in order to wear down pitchers , and by hitting late in fouling off . The skill of batters in that direction increased through steady practice until McGraw , Keeler , Roy Thomas , Slagle and others could prolong the games indefinitely and tire out any pitcher . The rule makers promptly legislated against foul balls , and opened the new era of batting science . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delays and they thought that batters penalized one strike for a foul , would hit harder , and oftener . The players discovered , however , that hard driving did not pay against improved infield work , and that the new rule aided both the pitchers and fielders when the ball was hit hard , as it went too straight towards second base , and allowed the infield to concentrate their defense . One of the first results of the new rule was the increase in bunting , with variations tending to upset the infield . The " force bunt " was brought into prominence by little Butler , of Columbus , who afterward blew one hand off with a fire cracker and retired . He pushed the ball slowly down the infield , striving to make it roll fast enough to pass the pitcher either to his right or left , yet so slowly that the short stop or second baseman , // playing deep , would have to take it while sprinting forward at top speed and make a perfect throw . The gain by the play was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe hits , but it was productive of wild throws , and fumbles , and it at once became popular as a method of destroying infield team work and breaking up games . The Chicago Cubs used the force bunt during all their championship term , pushing the ball , instead of bunting it dead , a short distance in front of the plate . Their success with the ball was marvelous . In the fourth game of the World 's Championship series in 1907 at Detroit , Sheckard pushed a force bunt past Donovan in the critical moment of the game , and before the panic in the Tiger ranks ended , Chicago had made three runs as a result of the bunt , and won easily thereafter , 6 to 1 . In one game at Philadelphia in 1908 Tinker made the bunt with two men on bases , pushing a slow roller toward short stop . Doolan was running to cover second base and the ball rolled clear onto the grass behind short stop , Tinker taking two bases . Men of the type of Speaker , Cobb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leach for instance , use the force bunt with great effect . During the seasons of 1906 and 1907 Sheckard , of Chicago , used a bluff bunt which worked with great success . He bunted at the first ball pitched to him , and purposely missed it . Then he bluffed that he intended bunting again and , as the third baseman tore forward , Sheckard poked the ball over his head . Leach , in the . // World 's series of 1909 , beat Detroit two games by the same play . Three times he drew Moriority forward to field expected bunts and then drove the ball past him like a rifle shot . Beaumont , a veteran of many teams , has for years been regarded as one of the most dangerous place hitters , either when hitting the ball hard or when pushing it on a short line fly over fielders coming forward . In the hit and run game his batting was remarkable , for whichever fielder the runners managed to draw away from position it was almost certain Beaumont would hit through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of batting employed by some batsmen in trying to outguess the opposing pitcher . It means striving to guess what kind of a ball is about to be delivered . ' This style , while effective , is extremely dangerous for the batter , as to guess wrong is to court serious injury . In one game at Cincinnati a few years ago , Coakley pitching , Mc ( ; ann tried to outguess him . He guessed a curve was coming , and his wrist was broken by a fast inshoot . Two innings later Bresnahan guessed wrong and was knocked senseless . There are times when a play comes up to a batsman which compels him to try to outguess the pitcher . One of these times is when the hit and run play is ordered . With a runner on first or second base , and the batter giving the signal , he is compelled to attempt to guess when the pitcher will put the ball over the plate . He guesses , signals the runner , who is expected to start as if to steal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infielders out of position , and strives to hit through the deserted place . If the batter 's guess is wrong , the runner is the victim . Selee , when manager of the Cubs , once secured a player from the Coast League who was reputed to be a wonderful batter , who had hit over .400 in his league and could call the turn every time . Selee tried him in right field against Boston , and " Vic " Willis , one of the best " guessers " in the business , and a pitcher with a marvelous curve , both slow and fast , was on the slab . The recruit struck out four times and when he returned to the bench after the fourth effort some of the players sympathized with him . " Tough to start against Willis , " remarked one . " Yes , and I 'm calling the turn every time , too , " mourned the recruit . " Well , old boy , " said Chance , " I 'd like to watch you when you were n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is method in the jockeying of the batter . The moment a batter steps to the plate with the bases clear the game becomes a duel between him and the pitcher , and although the crowd may be calling for him to hit , his intention may be not to hit until compelled so to do . His first effort is to " get the pitcher in the hole ; " that is , make him pitch enough balls so the batter can be certain the next one will be over the plate . For , if the batter knows the ball is coming straight the chances of making a base hit are doubled . Then too , the batter may be under orders to follow // out a manager 's plan of battle . Frequently a manager , feeling certain the game will be close , orders his men to wait . The waiting may be either to discover whether the pitcher is likely to become wild , or to wear him out . Each batter then , instead of hitting , tries to make the pitcher throw as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three balls , foul off three , and then strike out , he may have accomplished far more toward the final result than he would have done had he made a base hit off the first ball pitched . The average number of balls pitched by one pitcher in a game of nine innings will run about 125 , and every additional ball pitched wearies the pitcher . Many " ninth inning rallies " by which spectacular games are won , are the results of the waiting of the batters who struck out during the early innings . Chance is a great believer in the waiting game , and insists upon his men trying out pitchers ( luring the early innings of games , especially new and unfamiliar pitchers , believing that what each man discovers , will help the succeeding batters . The practice of getting to first base by allowing the pitched ball to hit them , is more general with batters than usually is supposed . It is not indulged in as extensively as in former years when " Red " Galvin used to allow the ball to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it still is used extensively , despite rules forbidding umpires to allow batters to take first when purposely hit . There is scarcely an important . game // between contenders for pennant honors , in which a dozen batters do not strive to make the ball hit them . Batters who " crowd the plate " usually are good hitters . They have the courage to risk injury , the nerve to allow the ball to hit them , and the advantage in getting decisions because , knowing they crowd the plate habitually , the umpires decide that they tried to escape . Besides pitchers will pitch outside to them steadily through anxiety to avoid hitting them , if they know the men will let the ball break a rib in order to reach first . The actual gain through allowing the ball to hit him is not so much for a player 's team , as the moral effect upon the defending club . Nothing in baseball is so calculated to discourage a team , or destroy its confidence in a pitcher as to have him hit a batter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each season make the ball hit them , and take first in spite of the rules . The umpires must judge from the actions of the men whether they tried to avoid the ball , and in most cases any contortion of the arms is construed as such an effort , especially when there is a large home crowd on the field . In the season of 1908 , during the fierce struggles of New York , Chicago and Pittsburg for the pennant , New York won three games from Chicago because players allowed themselves to he hit , and they came near winning the game in which they played off the tie by the same method ? the second batter up throwing his arms across the plate and making the ball hit him . McGraw 's verbal orders to players to get hit were audible in the // stands , and in one game Doyle made three attempts to get hit before he succeeded and then was allowed to walk . Umpire O'Day unmasked one trick on the Polo Grounds that same season which was laughable . Bresnahan was batting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing his knees out toward the ball . O'Day stopped the game , ordered Bresnahan to adjust his clothing . Bresnahan argued , but O'Day made him obey , while the crowd roared at the umpire . Bresnahan had stuffed his shirt front out six inches , and inflated his trouser legs three inches in order to give the ball more surface to hit . Such tricks , however , are outside the real sphere of baseball and are the final resorts of desperate men in desperate situations . Only a quick eye , long practice , courage and accurate swinging of second growth ash will win steadily . CHAPTER XI BASE RUNNING A player who can run fifty yards in six seconds ought , with a lead of eight feet off first base , run to second base , 82 feet away , in three and one-half seconds . A pitched ball will travel from the pitcher 's slab 68 feet to the catcher 's glove ( fast ball with catcher standing nine feet back of the plate , timed from the start of the pitcher 's motion ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handles the pitch perfectly and gets the ball away fast , will start the ball towards second in one and a quarter seconds after it hits his hands and his throw from nine feet back of the plate , if perfect , ought to reach the second baseman in one second , and be caught and the ball be ready to apply to the runner in one-quarter of a second additional . Perfectly handled in that time , the ball ought to beat the runner to second base by from one-eighth to onequarter of a second , or by from 3% to 6/ feet and result in an easy out . The calculations are based on the pitcher holding the runner within eight feet of first base , and preventing a flying start , upon perfect handling of the ball , and upon the throw being " on the runner " at second . Hours spent in snapping split second watches have proved that every base runner , if properly held up at first base , ought to be caught stealing second base . 168 // Yet the same timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual play , is pitched , relayed by the catcher and handled by a second baseman in three seconds ; and , while figures based on perfect play prove one thing , actual timing indicates that 62 ( plus ) out of Too runners ought to reach second base if they can start and run 82 feet in 3 seconds . Shortening the catcher 's throw to approximately 93 feet and figuring that the runner can gain fifteen to eighteen feet running start , instead of eight feet as at first base , and calculating on perfect playing in average time , a man who can run 90 feet in 4 seconds ( including start ) ought to beat the ball to third base by nine inches in every attempt perfectly made . These are mathematical facts . Now for actual conditions as proved by what has been done . In one season ( 1896 ) a complete record was kept of Lange 's base running . He stole exactly too bases , stealing second base 68 times , third 31 and home once . Eliminating hit-and-run plays entirely , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal , and was successful in Too , or about 70.2 per cent . of his trials . The returns ( unofficial ) for the season of 1909 show that Ty Cobb stole 76 bases out of 105 attempts , or 72.4 per cent . While Cobb 's total attempts are unofficial , they are close enough to show that the first-class baserunners succeed in about seven out of ten efforts to steal second . The figures really reveal more than that . They show that , while the runners steal only about 64 out of every loo times they try for second base , they // succeed nearly eight of ten ( 78 plus out of Too ) times they start for third . The conclusion is clear that the pitchers do not hold up runners closely ; that the ball is pitched wide a large percentage of times , and that the catcher , for various reasons , is lucky to handle the ball perfectly three times in ten in actual play . If further proof is needed , here it is : Lee Tannehill , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 bases out of 19 attempts , two of which were palpable failures of batters to hit on hit-and-run signals . Even at that , he stole over 63 per cent . of the bases for which he tried . With these facts in view , the insistent query of baseball lovers , " Why does n't he steal ? " becomes pertinent . The truth is that base-running is fast becoming one of the lost arts of baseball . There is no possible doubt but that there are men today who could steal as many bases as Hamilton , Lange , Mike Kelly or any of the old-time star runners if they played the game the same way . There is not the slightest doubt but that Cobb today is as good a man as Hamilton , Lange , Keeler or Harry Stovey ; that Chance , Fred Clarke , Wagner , Bush or Collins could run bases with the best of the old-timers . Yet Stovey stole 156 bases one season , Hamilton 115 in one year , 102 another and nearly Too two other seasons , while Cobb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reasons for the elimination of base-stealing from the run-getting tactics of modern teams ; more // reasons than one . In the old days the motto of every manager was " run and keep running ; make the other fellow throw . " It was a baseball adage in those times that any team that could keep the opposing team throwing the ball around would win . As a matter of fact , the modern manager recognizes the same thing . He knows that if he can make the other team throw , it is only a question of time until they throw away the game . Why , then , does he not carry out his theory ? The first and greatest cause for the degeneration of the art of " sprinting and hitting the dirt " is that in modern baseball , more and more every year , individual effort is being sacrificed to team work . Team work , in many respects , has been overdone , and there are scores of players today who will not do anything on their own initiative or attempt a steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the batter . The modern ball player has been so trained to teams work that only a few with brain and daring pull off the brilliant individual feats that are necessary to win pennants , no matter how much team work there is . A player reaches first base , looks at the batter for a hit-and-run signal , looks toward the third-base coacher to see if a signal to steal has been flashed from the bench , takes his lead , watches the hatter , and anchors himself . Two balls and no strikes are pitched ; . he looks again for the signals . Failing to get them , he knows the batter is going to take a strike , and anchors himself again ? afraid to risk the displeasure of the manager by stealing . Even should the pitcher care172 BIG LEAGUE BASEBALL lessly permit him to get a big running start , he trots back to first base , perhaps slides back as hard as he would have had to slide to second . He catches a hitand-run signal on the next ball , takes his lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as he does that the stage of the game calls for an attempt to run and hit ; the pitcher pitches fast and out ; the catcher takes the ball perfectly , throws , and even if the runner is a speedy man he is out by at least three feet . The pitcher and catcher did the thinking , the base runner used stereotyped " team ball " and was caught . Another cause for the decline in base running is the vast improvement of pitchers in watching bases . The average pitcher of today holds the runners to the bases much more carefully than did those of fifteen years ago . ' There are exceptions on both sides . Kilroy , Griffith , O'Day , Red Ehret , Brietenstein and others of the old school held them close , while today there are some who allow a running start . The balk rule handicaps the modern pitcher somewhat but the chief improvement in watching runners is the result of constant training and practicing . Still there are few pitchers who do not give the runner at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every five pitched balls , no matter how closely a pitcher may watch , his mind is diverted and he leaves an opening which a quick thinking runner may use to gain a flying start . The hit-and-run and the bunt-and-run games , of course , reduce the number of opportunities to steal . // Ty Cobb was on first base about 310 times in 1909 and stole only 76 bases . He had 310 chances to steal second , perhaps 200 chances to steal third and nearly 150 chances to steal home , as he scored 150 times . The records show he stole second 52 times , third 21 times and home three times . Yet he is the most daring base runner of modern times . How often attempted hitand-run plays , or third outs prevented an effort to steal is not recorded . Cobb is one of the rare players who can play " inside ball " and individual ball at the same time . He is brilliant , thinks for himself and is not much hampered by bench orders . He runs mainly on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUNS and he wins pennants for Detroit by running . The pitchers try harder to ' hold him to the bases than they ( 10 any other player in the league ; the catchers give more pitch-out signs to catch him , but they do not stop him . He is a living proof of the fact that modern ball players could run bases with as much effect as the old-timers could ? if it were not for their lack of individual thinking . The more one studies the situation , the more convinced he must become that , despite the vaunted advances of the game , there is less brain work exhibited on the bases than there was twenty years ago . This is not to claim that the players of today are not as intelligent , but that they have subordinated their intelligence to the brains of the manager , and allow one man , or , rather , insist upon one man , doing the thinking for the entire team , which is an impossibility . // It is so seldom that one who watches a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base-running line that when he does it is refreshing . That the baseball-loving public sees it the same way is proved by the wild applause that greets unexpected steals , and by the public admiration for Cobb , Wagner , Bush , Collins , Evers and Chance . Philadelphia went wild over Collins , who ran with execrable judgment , but got results . Billy Maloney set Chicago to talking by just such running , and led the National League one season in base-stealing . He ran wild , ran at the wrong time , ran all the time ? and the showing that he and Collins made proves the wisdom of the old order to " keep the other fellows throwing . " The other fellows tell " how lucky such runners are , " and keep on making errors . A few years ago , Frank Chance , always a base-runner of rare judgment , coupled with great daring , started his team working the delayed steal . His runners started , stopped , and when the catcher relaxed from his throwing attitude and the man covering second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dash for second . Mathematically figured out , the runner will beat the ball to second by over two feet , on the basis of 3 1/3 seconds to run the distance . Really , the runner gains more , as the baseman usually is slow getting up to cover the base , and a slide in front of him causes him to lose almost half a second diving forward to touch the player , after catching the ball . // One day in 1909 Chicago and Pittsburg were playing , and a run meant victory for either side . Evers was on second base , with one out . He made a bluff run towards third , putting down his head and sprinting at top speed . Gibson whirled to throw to third . Evers stopped dead still ? and laughed . Gibson instantly made a perfect throw to second , and , like a flash , Evers dashed for third and slid safely . He scored on a fly ball and won the game . The play , magnificently executed as it was , set the crowd wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been made in Chicago in five years , yet it was common in the old clays , and the catcher had to watch every runner and calculate his distance between the bases before making a throw , else he would be trapped . Figures prove positively that the runner can go 32 feet up the line towards third , and , if he starts back quickly enough , can beat the throw back to second . If he goes the other way , he has 58 feet to run and slide only 23 feet farther , and the ball must travel almost twice as far and be relayed perfectly to catch him . If he makes the play correctly , the fastest possible handling of the ball will only catch him by three feet , unless he is blocked off the base . That calculation allows for the second baseman coming ten feet inside the base to meet the catcher 's throw . The play can be made every time by a fast man if he can draw the throw to second , yet Evers was applauded as a hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleverest bits of base-running Ty Cobb ever did was in one of the games of the first World 's series between Chicago and Detroit . Cobb was on first base , when Crawford drove a single to short right center , making Slagle cut in towards Shulte to reach the ball . When Cobb reached second base , Hofman had thrown and the ball was coming in to Evers , who had gone into the grass to meet it . Without hesitation , Cobb turned second and raced for third . He had figured the play in an instant . He knew that Slagle was a weak thrower ; that Evers ' back was to the diamond ; that he would have to catch the ball and swing entirely around before he knew what was going on . He calculated that Evers would expect him to stop at second , and , therefore , look at second base first , and so lose enough time to allow him ( Cobb ) to reach third . Evers looked at second , looked at third , saw Cobb already within ten feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw that went into the crowd and almost gave Detroit the game . No manager could have told Cobb to do that , and because 99 out of every 100 base-runners would have stopped at second to await orders , they would not have made the play . Baseball has been reduced to a science , and is in danger of becoming mechanical unless a few base-runners like Cobb , Collins , Evers and Clarke , exponents of the unexpected , convince managers that base-running pays , and that remaining anchored to bases is a poor policy . // The two glaring examples of the different schools of baseball playing appeared in 1909 , one in Boston on the American League grounds , and the other in St. Louis on Hedges ' Park . The St. Louis Browns of 1909 was the historical stationary team of baseball . Never again will there be another . It could make fewer runs on more hits than any team extant . If a player reached the plate on less than four hits , his fellows accused him of showing them up . The Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor league manager , exploited the old theory of making the other fellows throw , and without firstclass pitchers he made the teams in the American League fight to the finish to hold his " Speed Boys " out of pennant honors . The entire theory of the Boston team was " run , " and with the fleetest aggregation of runners in the circuit , perhaps in the country , the " Speed Boys " ran . It is history that Frank Isbell , when he was on bases , never stopped until he broke a leg , went out or some one shut the gate on him . He could take wilder chances than any runner who ever landed on a base , and he kept running after his legs wore out and his speed left him ? and running with excellent success because the opponents would be so surprised to see him going that they would throw wild . But Isbell , in his palmiest days , would have been a second rater for " crazy " base running in the Boston team of 1909 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran wild through the league . All the other players said they were " crazy , " // complained that they were not " playing the game , " that they were ignoring all the science of the hit-and-run , sacrifice and bunt-and-run , but the " Speed Boys " kept on running and winning . Eventually , of course , the pitchers and catchers let them run and caught them by pitching out , but not until Boston had come near winning the pennant by persistent recklessness . The kind of baseball played by the Red Sox would not win consistently , yet neither will the studied , systematic playing , exemplified by the Chicago Cubs , win always . That was proved by the way some of the National League clubs stopped Chance 's team and kept them from winning their fourth straight pennant . Pittsburg blocked Chicago 's system of attack , because in three seasons they had studied it and knew every move to expect . Gibson was chiefly responsible , but the pitchers did their part . The well developed plan of attack was becoming stereotyped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compelled to alter his campaign plans more frequently than ever before . Pittsburg , during the middle of the season of 19o9 , had the most varied and resourceful attack of any team in the league , and mixed up the base running style successfully , but before the finish the Pirates , too , became stereotyped . Base running consists chiefly of doing the unexpected , and the team that refuses to run bases because a strong throwing catcher is pitted against it is beaten . The strong throwing catchers , paradoxical as it may seem , have the least throwing to do , proving some teams surBASE // render before they are beaten , while the worse thrower a catcher is the more throws he has to make . Myers , the Indian , with New York , won a game from Chicago in 1909 by pretending to have a sore arm . He complained that his arm was so bad he did not want to catch . The Chicago players heard his cornplaint and decided to run bases . They ran for three innings , until four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . If they had persisted in running during the entire game , they probably would have won , as they needed only one run to get ahead in the eighth inning , and had two chances to steal , either one of which would have meant victory . The team that stops running because one or two men are thrown out is on a par with a man who puts up three stock margins and then quits . In thirty-two games in 1909 scores were kept to see how plays resulted with reference to stealing and hitting and running . In those games 66 efforts to steal were made and 41 were successful . Steals which were palpable efforts to make other plays , as well as failures of such steals were not counted . The average of successful stealing was .621 . In the same games 72 plain hit-and-run signals were detected . Eleven of the attempts ( 15.3 per cent. ) resulted in clean hits , eight of which ( 11.1 per cent. ) enabled the runner to take extra bases . Twenty-seven of the attempts ( nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retiring the batter at first base . Seven ( o9.6 per cent. ) resulted in the batter striking out , and three // of these strike-outs ( 04.2 per cent. ) resulted in the runner being doubled with the batter , while two of the strike-outs ( 02.8 per cent. ) resulted in the runner reaching second , anyhow . Seventeen runners ( 23.6 per cent. ) were forced at second for no gain ; three ( 04.2 per cent. ) were doubled on line drives , and seven ( 09.6 per cent. ) of the batters flied out . The object of the hit-and-run being to advance runners , the result in these games shows that it succeeded in 5o out of 72 times , or 69.4 per cent . Yet , while the percentage of success was larger in the hit-and-run than in stealing , it is extremely doubtful if the figures do not show that plain stealing was more effective as a ground-gainer . These figures were made while watching a slow team and one which is supposed to play the hit-and-run game perfectly . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games played by Detroit or Pittsburg . Figures accumulated that way ought to prove convincingly whether or not base-running should be neglected . The game needs more dash , less mechanical work , more brains by individuals , and fewer orders from the bench . John McCloskey was the only manager who could signal runners whether to slide feet or head first while they were stealing second .
