txt Differences passage in the speech Closely ? of the Imperial Restricted , ChanR cellor before the Reichstag was . the one in which , . while insisting that all Germans are of one mind as regards fighting the war through to a termination satisfactory to themselves , he admitted the existence of disagreements among the country 's political and military leaders as to the best means of attaining that end . " Certainly , " he said , " we have had our differences of opinion on such mat , ters as the U-boat ' question and the question of relations with America . " That there have been like differences of opinion among the German people he also admitted by clear implication , but there was nothing in his remarks to indicate that the men of his class or caste paid serious attention to what the German Ambassador to Italy contemptuously called " the voice of ' the piazza , " when he had to explain why Italy went into the war on the side she did . In Germany " the piazza " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while expressing regret at the need of a strict censorship , and the hope that it could soon be relaxed , made no distinction either as to necessity or as to value between the work of the military and the political consors . " We discussed these matters in committee , " he said , " and decided that it was impossible to satisfy the demands for a public allnouncement . We were , I believe , absolutely agreed that in these cases public discussion would damage the country . " That settled it , and there have been in Germany only a few irrepressibles like HARDEN and LIERKNECHT who have taken the risks incidental to making such criticism of and exhortation to the Government as have been constant in England . Possibly this accounts for Germany 's greater efficiency in the ways her superiority must be admitted , ' but it also may account for her failure in the higher efficiency claimed- , not without plausibility , for her foes to the north , south , and ; west . Her leaders have a magnificent knowledge of how to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something a good deal less than genius in determining what to do . Perhaps if they had heard and heeded the German equivalent for " the voice of the piazza " they would not have been so disastrously successful in subjugating Belgium , in sinking the Lusitania , and in dropping bombs on English coast towns . ? Pew things " made A Professor in Germany " since Sees a the war began have New Light . excited more of adverse comment , or , in its way , deserved it more , than did the amazing proclamation to the literary and scientific and artistic world that was signed in 1914 by ninety4hree of its most eminent " intellectuals . " Many of the names were those of men with more than national fame in their several domainF  --  names that had long been recognized as authoritative and worthy of respect  --  and yet what they had to say to us seemed like the cries of passionate and unreasoning children .

At least one of the signers ? Dr. MAX PLANCK . of the University of Berlin  --  has awAkened to the harm done by this proclamation to Germany , and he is trying to undo it . A letter of his , translated and published by Sir OLIVER LODGE , reveals this belated knowledge and this highly commendable purpose . Unfortunately , Dr. PLANCK does not begin with that confession which is well known to be good for souls and the best possible beginning of reform . Instead of apologizing for the fundamental errors made by the misguided ninetythree , he claims consideration for them as for men writing in " the patriotic excitement of the first weeks of the war , " and he insists that they were misunderstood . The excuse is a poor one , for men such as they should have been the last to lose their heads , if they did it at all , as a result of excitements patriotic or other , and it is nobody 's fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those whom they addressed could understand them . The truth is that they said what they meant  --  then . If , as Dr. PLANCK declares , they would not say it nowif they have come to realize , as he does , that science and literature and art are broader than nationality ? if they no longer scorn the foreign honors and associations which they once gladly accepted  --  then , of course , they have become sane again , and in due time can be welcomed back to the brotherhood which they so rashly denounced and abandoned . At first thought it Unexciting , seems rather absurd but Highly for the Department of Health to have made Effective . so many and such explicit announcements of its intention to Inspect hotel and restaurant kitchens . That , and telling just when the inspectors are coming , and what merits they will reward and what faults they will penalize , is , of course , no way to bring sinners to punishment or to drag exciting scandals into the sight of a shocked and interested public . Having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good care to have everything all right betimes , and if ' everything has n't been all right in the past , proof of that fact will be difficult or impossible . The health officials , however , are not without wisdom , and they are quite justified in thinking that it is not the previous condition of these kitchens that really counts , but their present and future condition . To accomplish that better end the board is using an excellent method . It provokes no animosities or resentments , it enables the proprietor of every hotel and restaurant to get a valuable advertisement for next to nothing , and it is no wonder that many of them are loudly proclaiming the joy with which they will welcome the arrival of the inquisitors . Whether the welcomers have hastily reformed or have always been virtuously clean in the more sequestered portions of their establishments is a question of no practical consequence . At least it is of none In comparison ' with what they are doing arid are going to do . But the forewarning scheme will not work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and the chances are that hereafter the inspectors will come unannounced .
