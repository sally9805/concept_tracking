txt Pending events on the English front are being awaited here with the tensest interest . Staff officers here cautiously say they " suspect " the English have at last begun their offensive , but that the situation has n't cleared as yet . The public is convinced that a great , perhaps a decisive , offensive is under way . It has been characterized as the bestadvertised offensive of the war , and the very publicity about it has afforded the Germans ample time to prepare for its coming . At no point on either the east or the west front , however , have the German lines been weakened as a result of the preparations to give the English offensive a warm welcome . Adequate reserves of picked , trainedto-the-minute troops have for nearly a year been held in readiness for the emergency of having to break up the supreme English offensive . Major Mcraht , the military critic of the Tageblatt , in what he entities " A Study of the General War Situation , " today says : " Such a study indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stadium . Our enemies , like ourselves , now stand on the pinnacle of their strained endeavors . Gradually they have learned in the course of the war to launch their attacks against the Central Powers simultaneously . We must honestly admit that the organization of the conduct of the war on the part of our enemies has grown more energetic and ' more uniform . They have learned some things from us , and their great resources in men and money , together with their many lines of communication on the open ' . seas , enable them to make the final victory more difficult for us to expect . " Of their strength we would be blind were we to overlook these phenomena at the end of the second year of the war , and that could not be consonant with the German character were we unwilling to realize the truth . Appreciation of the whole situation , however , nevertheless , gives us no grounds for looking pessimistically into the future . If our enemies ' war organization has made progress , so have we , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lead the way . Unity of the will to win is a prerequisite of Our final success . So far as one can see , this unity has I , been shaken by nothing , and we are conlident that the bands forged by our corn- ' mon interest will in future , too , continue I to bind Turkey and Bulgaria to us in devoted , self-sacrificing activity . On the side theatres of the war our enemies , i too , no longer make an attempt , unless I secretly , to separate our Eastern a ! oes I from the Central Powers . On the other hand , our enemies have had success In that , despite the strongest violation of the neutrals , they have known how to prevent every one of them from openly Joining our side . The situation on the western front is approaching a climax . The Russian offensive brought no relief from our pressure . Decisive battles , which wilt undoubtedly ? be hard , are still before us , but we do not doubt we shall be successful , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works that now form the extreme line of defense east of the Meuse has become very difficult . I One can now hope for a speedy isolation of theseveral supporting points of they inner fort chain . The English are going ahead very I systernatically and very cautiously , reconnoitring at many points by tactically I unimportant thrusts and letting their I artillery work at long range , having undoubtedly great masses of ammunition available . " Our English enemies are not making the mistake of losing their heads and rejoicing , like the Italians , seeing great things in little successes . The English have actually become very sober ; they ' avoid boasting and are not calculating on a quick repetition of the Russian and Italian successes . Because of this very sobriety of judgment we again and again recognize the English determination to hold on until victory , regardless of the length of time it may take . I repeat , without an earnest settlement with England on the battlefields in th west we shall never come a step near peace : "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
