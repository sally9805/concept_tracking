txt Dogs are in disfavor in the Great Neck , L. I. , home of Walter D. Clark , a lawyer , of 65 Liberty Street . ? The Irish terrier leashed to the newels post at the foot of the stairway in the front hall was the first to notice it when Mr. - Clark came downstairs yesterday morning . The fierce-looking butietog that nightly keeps vigil in the glass-inclosed vestibule just outside the door , less than three yards away , also realized it when he met his master 's eye . Thursday seems to have been an off night for vigils . Some time between 11 o'clock that night and 4 o'clock yesterday morning , careless alike of terrier and bulldog , one or more burglars forced open a widow on the front - Rorch , stepped into the parlor and began operations . As if of a literary bent , they scattered all the books in the library , but utterly disregarded the silverware and cut glass on the dining room sideboard . Creeping into the hall , where the terrier must have been vying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruders stepped past the big dog and over the little one , and stole upstairs , where , scarcely less soundly , slept Mr. and Mrs. Clark and their eight-year-old daughter , Julia . The burglars confined their activities to the bedroom of Mr. and Mrs. Clark , looting it of all that was valuable and easily portable . Then they departed as noiselessly as they had come . Neither terrier nor bulldog stirred an eye-lash as the loot-laden thieves crept once more downstairs and out the parlor window , by which they had entered . - Early yesterday morning when the daughter Julia awoke , she noticed that a lamp which generally is kept lighted in the second floor hall was not burning . She awakened her mother and told her about it , but Mrs. Clark said the lamp had probably burned out , and paid no further attention to the matter . At 8 o'clock . however , Mr. Clark awoke and reached for his watch , which he had ' left in his vest , within reach of the bed . , The watch was not there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking he might ' left the watch there . To 1 Ibis surprise he found all the bureau drawers open . Several jewelry cases usually I kept there were gone . Awakening Mrs. Clark , they discovered that besides his I own watch , two gold watches belonging Ito Mrs. Clark , a large number of rings and pins , a diamond butterfly , and a string of pearls were gone . Altogether , the stolen jewelry was valued at between $1,500 and 62,000 . Except two faint footprints on the silk upholstered sofa in the parlor , the burglars left no clue . The parlor window showed marks of a burglar 's jimmy , but the window lock was unbroken . Clark notified Constable John Dennelly , and summoned private detectives from Manhattan . AD made a careful examination . but they were unable to decide whether the burglary had been carried out by expert cracksmen or some one living in the neighborhood and known to the two dogs . Besides the members of Mr. Clark 's family , two maids were sleeping in the house , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest disturbance . The country home of James Baker , half a mile from the Clark house , also was entered and looted of 51,500 worth of jewelry and silverware . The burglars forced a side windown . The weight of the plunder led the police to believe the thieves had made use of a wagon .
