IN a convention - hall , where representatives of a national party had assembled to make a platform and nominate a candidate for the Presidency , many days of acrimony and strain between con-tending factions had surcharged the heated air with a dangerous spirit of passion . Men who sat in their shirt-sleeves , sullen and wilted under the goad of the sun and of a strong opponent 's domination , sensed the undercurrent of raw temper that played through the In-nocent formula of the day 's order of business ; by barks of applause they encouraged their leaders to push conten-tion to the point of open rupture . Spec-tators crowding the galleries to suffoca-tion felt the menace in the choked aisles below them and invited disorder by taunts and cat-calls . Only the chatter-ing telegraph instruments in the circle of the press benches before the speaker 's stage seemed oblivious to the unmasked passions abroad ; in the hushes between the roaring and snarling of many voices they spoke their unruffled monotone . A big man in an alpaca coat ? he who had cracked the whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention-hall opened ? rose from his place among the delegates of his state and started down the main aisle to the platform . His purpose was known . Consummate daring was his . He was going to read out of the party certain men considered by many to be among the party 's leaders . For a minute there was a hush , then ? outlawry . From the solid bank of the opposition , massed in the front of the hail , many jumped from their seats and crowded the aisle , set in the pose of fighters , to contend his pas-sage . Banners were swirled into his eyes . Wadded newspapers and crumpled paper fans were hurled at his head . He was bustled and buffeted . Then men of his own camp , seeing their leader 's humiliation , leaped to his assistance , formed a flying wedge about his body , and attempted to rush him to the stage . The affair instantly became a matter of fists and grapples . A fragile railing about the press benches gave before the crush of bodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look out ! The wire ! The wire ! " A correspondent , stripped to his shirt , jumped to his feet and with fluttering hands tried to fend off the fighting pack . He was butted back into his seat . Over his telegrapher 's shoulder he threw his arm : the free arm of the man at the key locked with his and they bent their backs protectively over the fragile , precious thing of coil and armature that linked the world to them . They were trampled and harried , but as the wave of bodies passed over them , carrying the fighting even onto the floor of the stage , they braced to take the brunt . The correspondent , his lips to the telegrapher 's ear , dictated the news of what was happening around him . His words , voiced in a torture of apprehension , of . acute bodily pain , leaped to New York with the swiftness of light , and thence out to the nation and the world beyond seas . The wire was saved and serving . Seventy years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jiggled a metal tab with nervous finger . In Baltimore an armature clacked , and one understanding its untried speech translated the click into " What hath God wrought ! " That day was born the wire . Born a creature of service . Born to obliterate space and make the earth a hack-yard for over-fence chattings between the peoples . Two days after the first message passed between Washington and Baltimore over the portrait painter 's stretched wire the Democratic convention in Baltimore nominated James K. Polk for President , and this fact was intrusted to the new messenger for transmission to the Democrats of Congress in Washington . That day the wire was christened the Servant of the News , and bound by its sponsors to the slavery of the world 's news-hunger . On a May day in 1844 a dozen words of news limped less than a hundred miles through the air and pious people heard preachers call the circumstance a revelation of divine favor to man . One night in April not many years ago a ship came in to New York from the sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between nine o'clock and an hour after midnight more than a million words of news the vivid narratives of those snatched from death went out over the wires from New York , and perhaps a third of that number more shot under the ocean . Yet not fifty people knew of that heavy burden on the slave of the news ; only its masters were aware , and they spoke casually of " extra - heavy traffic . ' So in the new revelation of to-day the marvel of yesterday is forgotten . An aeroplane soars upward , to the enchained wonder of a multitude ; to-morrow it gains no more notice than a hawk unless its operator gambles his neck against applause by driving his machine upsidedown . The world-hunger for news grows more acute each year ; as China , Africa , and the islands of the sea move into the back-yard comity of the peoples , gossip of their affairs must pass over the backyard fence . Each year the wire is called upon for sterner service . But no one pauses to be amazed at the increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , its existence . The news is there on the printed page , propped between the egg-cup and the coffee-pot ; that is the sole , satisfying fact the world reckons . Here is a bit of scandal from Seward , Alaska ; there a thrill from Teheran , a laugh out of Skiddo , California . What reader possesses the magic spectacles to read behind black lines of type the far more human , more dramatic stories of , say , a dog-team post buried in a blizzard , an imperial censor hoodwinked under the sword , a desert lineman dying of thirst ? The wire must serve ! The wire must serve ! Come flood , come fire , it must not be stopped . An emperor prohibits its tattling ; it tattles , nevertheless . An earthquake rends it five thousand fathoms down on the floor of ocean ; it flings its news burden through the unwired air . Though man made it his serf , many thousands of men are chained to it . Though men die and thrones are knocked into scrap , the wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith at his bacon in a Harlem flat and Chu Fang over his tea in a Cantonese shop must know how men die ? if their taking is abnormal ? and why a throne is knocked into scrap . If John Smith were elected President of the United States , Chu Fang would be pleased to know it . John Smith , by the same token , would carry a pleasurable thrill to business if the wire told him Chu Fang had been boiled in oil by pirates . Those whose lives are given to the grooming of the wire estimate that twenty-six hundred papers in the United States receive each day a telegraphic service , either from one of the great news associations , from their own correspondents , or both . At least four hundred papers divide between them each day a million words of telegraphed news from their correspondents abroad and at home , aside from the general news report furnished by the collecting agencies . In twenty-four hours of an average day 1,190,000 words of news are sent over the land wires of this country . Enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Orient , and our insular possessions to bring the daily average to over two millions . Given an event of startling character or of wide-spread interest , and the average will jump by tens of thousands . A full third of the day 's total outpouring may come from a single city : from San Francisco , burning ; from Chicago , in the grip of a political convention 's hysteria . A bulk of words approximating a novel of Dickens went under the key fingers of operators each day of the Republican convention of riprz , and again at Baltimore almost as many words as Samuel Pepys put into his diary of many busy and gossipy years were flashed to readers the country over before Woodrow Wilson was nominated for the Presidency . Abroad , the impatience of news-hunger is not so exacting as with up-to-the-minute Americans . The slower agency of the mails divides the labor of transmission with the telegraph . Data lacking , men who live with the wire in this country give it as an opinion that the day 's average news moving in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at most considerably less than in the United States . The impulse toward heavier wire traffic abroad is growing , however , and comes from the insistence of Amencan news agencies upon co-operation under the American spur of speed . The voice of the wire is constant as light . It rivals the speed of light-waves . On the last day of the year 19 to the airmen were in the sky above an aviation-field at Los Angeles . Because then the interest of people in exhibition flights was still keen , a news association had its " loop " from a direct wire circuit established at the press bench of the grand-stand ; a correspondent sat at the telegrapher 's side and through his efficient finger dictated the turn of events straight to the San Francisco office of his association . There an operator , receiving , sat at the shoulder of another who tapped the key of the direct New York circuit . Events at Dominguez Field progressed without incident . The reporter in the press-stand , his eyes aloft , droned a dull tale of " aerial Derbies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An announcer mega-phoned " a startling exhibition flight by the world 's most daring aviator , " and a yellow biplane leaped from the turf to cut a straight , upward slash in the blue field of space . Up and up the thin sheaves pushed their way until they hung , a buttonhole in the sky . Folk waited , necks strained , for the invisible master of the air to make his play with death . They saw the twin slivers pirouette , double in a dizzy sweep , balance on the brink of an air precipice , then- " Flash ! Hoxsey falling ! " the reporter shouted . " Flash ! Hoxsey falling ! " an operator three hundred miles away in San Francisco flung over his shoulder to the fellow-operator at his elbow . " Flash ! Hoxsey falling ! " cried a man at the Frisco key in a big room four floors above New York 's Broadway . Here was a prodigy . Before the biplane and the doomed airman had plunged a thousand feet to destruction , men in the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sky ? knew everything the hushed spectators three thousand miles away could know . The wire brought the message in less than thirty seconds . While men raced across Dominguez Field to the yellow jumble dropped from above ? before ever a hand was laid on the wreck of the biplane ? twenty wires out of San Francisco , Chicago , and New York were humming this message to a score of cities : " Bulletin ? Hoxsey fell 1,000 feet , Dominguez Field , Los Angeles . Probably dead . " Speed ! Speed ! That is the cry of the wire to-day . Sure of its own power , strong in its might to serve , the slave of the news demands that the human agency which must he co-ordinated with it shall be keyed to superhuman efficiency . Those who tend the wire must possess its instinct of swift sureness ; especially when the clamor of the newshungry makes a delay of seconds intolerable . Once a year in this country comes a test which cracks the nerves of men who groom the wire ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its aides are incapable of holding themselves to its lightning pace . This is when the baseball madness advances into the dog-days of the so-called World 's Series games ; when the police have to cleave a lane through the pack watching bulletin-boards and graphic diagrams before the newspaper offices in a score of great cities ; and when , even in the smaller towns , business yields to the lure of the hastily scrawled bulletin . Tens of thousands witness the games with their own eyes ; many millions demand to be spectators by proxy . Newspapers and news associations prepare for these pennant games as doctors plan to fight a fever . They are under the rowel of the mob 's impatience ; rivalry forces them to a fight wherein seconds lost mean prestige ? and dollars ? lost . Consider as typical the strategy employed in such crises by a certain resourceful news association . The deciding game between contending teams is to be played on NewYork 's Polo Grounds . Two wires are strung from the office of the association to the places allotted at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case the other fails . In the down-town operating office of the news agency connection is made between the active wire at the Polo Grounds and the Chicago " main trunk " ; at Chicago a " visible relay " records on an unwinding reel the message that is leaping , reinforced by fresh current , onto the San Francisco circuit . In the New York , Chicago , and San Francisco offices operators sit with their eyes on the unreeling tape , ready to flash each character appearing there over subsidiary circuits to Atlanta and the South , to St. Paul and the Northwest , to Los Angeles and all the coast . In each of the cities fed by the circuits the newspapers subscribing to the association 's service have loop wires leading to their offices ; these carry the message of the circuit automatically . Such the preparations of the news-distributor ; and for the telegraph company pains equally assiduous . At each relay point ? and that , in the phrase of the craft , is where an automatic " repeater " reinforces the carrying current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a wire chief " rides the wire , " with his ear to the quality of the voice that speeds . Does weather threaten to paralyze the wire in his territory , he has a " fall-back , " or substitute circuit , through unaffected country , built in the air and ready for instant use Over the entire stretch of wire from the Polo Grounds to San Francisco the circuit is made " blind " ; it can not be broken by human agency . All is ready . From Harlem to the Golden Gate the strain is at maximum ; men are tensed to action ; the wire is alive . " Cobb flies to Murphy , " dictates the baseball reporter in the press-stand , judging the trajectory of the batted ball almost with the crack of the bat . " Cobb flies to Murphy , " calls the assistant sporting editor of the San Francisco evening paper , and his voice is megaphoned to the crowd blocking Kearney Street . Before the high fly batted by Cobb on the Polo Field has smacked the glove of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fountain in the Pacific Coast city knows the play is made . . . " And is caught out , " the reporter in the press-stand supplements . " Murphy never misses ' em , " comments the San Francisco policeman before the outfielder has returned the ball to the pitcher 's box . Service such as this must represent the wire 's ultimate speed efficiency , Surely , until men become machines charged with a current of instantaneous reaction , man 's servant of stretched copper will not do better by him . Maximum speed obtained , the masters of the talking spark still have to face the problems of a constant warfare with the wire 's enemy , the elements . However cunningly they may contrive to drive the lightning flash of intelligence with the swiftness of light , whatever the magnitude of traffic the telegraph may be forced to carry , there is the everpresent menace of storm , fire , and flood to threaten wide-spread extinction of the spark . The leveling of miles of wires in the path of a tornado or their burdening by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters even more than does the exceptional call for speed . Only when the voice of the wire is stopped does the world come to know the tremendous part it plays in the world 's work . In recent years the failure of the wire to weather the assaults of storms has twice brought a startling sense of lack to all the peoples in North America and many thousands abroad . One of these instances was the blizzard that cut Washington out of existence on the day of President Taft 's inauguration , March 4 , 1908 . In the news sense , an inauguration is one of the major events . It possesses a strong human appeal for every American . A " feature " it is , to be spread over as many columns of type as possible . The night before the day Mr. Taft was to stand before the nation as its new Executive , a storm out of the northwest cut a white swath from Chicago to the Capes , leveled every pole about the national capital and cloaked with silence the one spot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawn came and Washington was not in the world . The nation was stunned ; it was being denied its great show . Frantically the wire stabbed at its crippled arms , striving to drive the spark into the silence . But Baltimore was mute ; Richmond answered not ; Hagerstown mumbled unintelligibly . Noon , and the procession to the steps of the Capitol ; still the country vainly hurled its demand for news against the barriers of the snow . A wireless spark began to flicker feebly , carrying the bare intelligence to New York that Mr. Taft was President . Then linemen plunging through the drifts south of the city contrived to string a single wire across the breach and the general manager of the telegraph himself sat at the key to grope for the frontier of the world outside . He " raised " Atlanta ; the Southern city had already provided a circuitous route around the boundaries of the storm havoc via New Orleans ; the long-delayed news , pared to the bone of fact , limped out of the lost capital hours after the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the wire finds itself playing to all the world the " heavy " role in melodrama . Each hour , bringing fresh disaster with the rising waters , snuffs out , one by one , the living sparks of the telegraph . Now Columbus , in agony , is shut away from the ear of men ; now Dayton sends out a last despairing cry and is still . The darkness and the yellow tides hide tragedies all the more poignant in the imagination of the peoples beyond the zone of the floods because of the silence ? the dreadful silence . A day passes and out of the water wastes comes not a word to tell of the salvation of those in peril or their last bitter fate . Then in the hour of greatest apprehension the voice of a girl ? the clear , strong voice of a girl ? breaks the silence . She is an operator in a sration on the telephone trunk-line a few miles out of Dayton and above the water 's encroachment . A single live wire out of the miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over this she talks to New York . A writer in a newspaper office makes notes of what she has to tell . It is as if she were in the next room , so close she seems , so fresh and vibrant is the life in her voice . VOL CXXXL ? No. 782-35 " Good night , " she finishes . " Ask the people to pray God for our deliverance . " Aye , the wire that carries tales of romance must have its own romances . Mysteries it whispers from land to land , and mysteries of its secret devising it possesses , too ? nor publishes them to the incredulous . Ask the men who give their lives to the wire to tell their tales of the achievement of the impossible , of miracles apparently supernatural . The wire , they will tell you , has a soul ; it is human . On occasions it will lie and cheat . Once the wire cheated when the destinies of two nations were in the lap of chance . That was during the conference of the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced each other across the Sha-ho in Manchuria , waiting to join again in battle if the negotiations in the American city failed . Fail they must , it appeared . A Sunday came when the deadlock between the representatives of Czar and Emperor was hopeless ; even Count Witte hinted broadly to the correspondents that the following day would see the definite rupture of all peace parleying and a resumption of fighting . Prayers for peace were offered in many churches throughout America that Sunday , though even the devout feared the futility of their appeal . Over in Tokio a correspondent for a London paper , who had a source of information he considered reliable , heard on this dark Sunday that the Emperor had cabled Baron Komura at Portsmouth explicit orders to make peace , even at a sacrifice of Japan 's interests . To get that information to his paper was for this correspondent a necessity as urgent as any possible . But the polite , smiling censor , the Emperor 's guardian set over a babbling cable , stood immovably in the way . The correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , then he presented himself at the cable-office and filed for transmission an innocent despatch of commonplaces , which included the words , " Rev. Ondit preached to-day ; text , ' Good will toward men . ' " The polite censor was not acquainted with the Gospel according to St. Luke ; he did not remember , if he ever knew , what the heavenly chorus sang on the Nativity morn . No more did he recognize anything reprehensible in the name of the worthy French clergyman , the Rev. Ondit . But the editor of the London paper into whose hands the uncensored cable came knew the full text of the angels ' chorus , recognized the beneficent sponsorship of the mythical Ondit . To him this single voice out of Tokio called in the hour most threatening to peace , " They say ? peace ! " His paper declared , alone , that peace was in sight , and peace came in fortyeight hours . Consider the wire in its fabrication of mysteries . Two instances may be cited . In March , 188g , American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apia , Samoa . Out of a native quarrel , known as the Tamasese rebellion , a grave international crisis had sprung , the ripples of disorder had carried to Washington and Berlin , and affairs were at such a pass between the two nations that a single untoward incident down in the remote South Sea harbor would have launched hostile shots from the guns of the disputants ' warders . A steamer connected Apia and the world once in every twenty-eight days . There was no cable . The last steamer from San Francisco to Sydney had been fifteen days out of Apia , and the island port was as far from the world as a harbor in the moon , when from an Australian city this message was flashed under seas to London : " German and American fleets at Apia both totally destroyed . Battle ? " The cable did not reveal the source of the rumor . The hazarded " Battle ? " was clearly an attempted explanation of the startling rumor , based on knowledge of the strained relations between the fleets . Great excitement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vagrant despatch until conservative judgment pointed out that it must be a canard ? there was no way Apia could have communicated with the world after the departure of the last steamer . Just thirteen days from the time the cable cried its message of disaster , the mail - steamer from Sydney arrived at Apia . She passed many dismantled andbeached hulks on the way to her anchorage ? the wrecks of the American and German warships . Then her people learned of the hurricane that had raged for three days from March 16th ; and , later , the world knew that the wire had not lied . In 1900 disturbing news came out of China , and the Occident began to hear of militant fanatics calling themselves " Boxers . " Disorder spread with alarming speed , and , of a sudden , Peking was isolated , its foreign residents driven to the legation compounds and there besieged by a horde of murderous natives . Just before telegraphic communication with the capital was cut by the Boxers , the Hong-Kong correspondent of a New York paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been assassinated . When this despatch was published the German Foreign Office made excited queries to determine the authenticity of the New York paper 's despatch , and with satisfaction announced the receipt of news from Peking telling that the minister was alive and in no danger . Forty-eight hours after the correspondent in Hong-Kong , a thousand miles from Peking , telegraphed the death of the minister , von Ketteler was killed by a Boxer . The wire had told the truth two days in advance of the event . The wire serves ? serves ? serves ! Engine of man 's devising , it has power beyond the imagination of many men , the physical capacity of any . It is untiring , undaunted . News ! The wire makes it and traffics in it . The newshunger of the world it whets even as it satisfies . No hit of gossip is too small to escape it ; none too momentous to abash it . A king may send an ultimatum by the wire ; but a bricklayer will know he has done so , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the wire buzzes and whispers over all the earth its many-tongued prattle of comedy and tragedy , of disaster and rejoicing , men 's hates and women 's loves . Perhaps a petty , foolish babble , this ; but it is the voice of humanity ? of humanity unconscious , away from its dignity . Who shall say the wire is not the present-day nerve-center of all mankind ?
