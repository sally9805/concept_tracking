txt // in her statesmen and her patriots , of whom they learn . They sing together the songs of the country , they learn the same stories of her early struggles and triumphs over difficulties , of the growth of her strength and power , of her advance from the humble position of a new and unrecognized government to an important place among the great nations of the world . Their love and pride of country is further aroused and fostered through a knowledge of the principles and ideals upon which our national life is founded . The resourceful teacher will make these facts the means of instilling love of country and the ideals of patriotism in the minds of his pupils ; and the teacher who fails to make use of the opportunities thus offered fails to fulfill one of the most important functions of the school . Every teacher should be careful to include , as one of the most important features of his teaching , those facts and ideals which instill patriotism in the minds of the young . Moreover , all teachers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of training the young for their duties as future citizens . If teachers did more fully understand their part in this training , they would give more attention to the use of history , geography , and other subjects of the curriculum for arousing feelings of patriotism and love of country in the young hearts , and would not waste so much of the time of their pupils in the memorizing of unrelated historical and other facts . The school standardizes knowledge . It is the duty of the school , as the agent of society for the education of the young , to take the world facts that are to be taught and relate them in such a way to the child 's previous knowledge and experiences that he may be able to interpret the new by means of the knowledge which he already possesses . It is the work of the school also to make use of all the information which the pupils have previously gained by perTHE // sonal experience , observation , or by any other means , in such a way that its relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will thus learn to interpret , define , and express this previous knowledge in terms used in the academic world . By this means the individual 's knowledge is standardized . An illustration may make more clear the way in which the child 's previous information and experience may be related to world facts and knowledge . Means of standardizing knowledge illustrated . A boy who has spent his childhood and early youth upon a farm , which he has helped to clear and cultivate , gathers certain facts and gains a body of information from his experiences and observations . As a matter of course , he learns to use a handspike in prying up or lifting heavy articles , such as logs , stones , and like objects . He learns how to place the bait under the handspike according to the weight of the body to be lifted and the amount of resistance to be overcome . He learns that in using a hoe or a pitchfork , if he places one hand near the lower end of the handle , the strength exerted becomes more effective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move , he can move it more readily and easily by placing his hands near the end distant from the pump . In these , and in other ways , while performing his daily tasks , he correctly and effectively applies the principle of the lever . He does this , however , without having any scientific knowledge of the principles involved or even knowing the names by which they are designated in the world of science . If this boy should study physics later , the knowledge of these scientific principles which he has thus unconsciously acquired through experience , would be translated into the language of science . The handspike and the bait , in the one case , would become the lever and the fulcrum , respectively . The hoe and the pitchfork in the other case would // become the lever , and one of his hands would serve as the fulcrum . With the ability which he has thus gained to apply his experience to scientific form , he can read and converse about the lever and can thus enter into fellowship with the scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic experience and language . Just as this boy unconsciously learned certain scientific facts through his own experiences , so all other persons have various experiences outside the school by which they have gained certain facts which may be translated into scientific or other departments of knowledge . Every individual , through his personal experiences , has some knowledge in the fields of physics , chemistry , biology , astronomy , sociology , and other departments of science ; and it is one of the functions of the school to translate this knowledge into universal academic language , ? in other words to standardize it in scientific terms . Relation of the school to vocational instruction . Theoretically the public school , as the agent of the State and of society , should fit the child for an all-round efficiency . No one questions the truth of this statement , so far as the mental and moral equipment for life are concerned ; but there is a wide difference of opinion regarding the duty of the school in its relation to the preparation of the young for vocational activity . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only among persons directly concerned with the education of the young , but by the people at large . Already many of the States have enacted laws requiring the schools to introduce into their curricula definite work in vocational guidance or in prevocational instruction . The reason for this is obvious , for modern conditions present little opportunity for the young to become acquainted through direct experience with the different occupations in which people are engaged . // Since the industries are no longer carried on at home or in the small shop , and the child has not the opportunity , which formerly he had , to become familiar with the occupation of his father and that of other men of his acquaintance , the various vocations are little more to him than mere names . He has no definite idea of their meaning , nor of the nature of the occupations which they designate . This state of general ignorance regarding the nature of the different vocations , in a large measure explains why the selection of a life-work is such a difficult and perplexing question to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being more and more recognized by parents and those interested in the problems of the rising generation ; and , as a result , many plans for remedying it are being devised and put into operation . In this work the school , as the institution best able to assist the young in solving this educational . problem , is taking an active part . It is devising plans and trying experiments in order to discover the best means for helping pupils to find the vocations most suited to their natural gifts and inclinations , and for aiding them in preparing for these vocations . The results already obtained indicate that this new phase of education will become an important feature of school work . Right of the State to require vocational instruction . The stability of a nation depends upon the intelligence and vocational efficiency of its people . Hence it is the prerogative of the State to require that her future citizens be fitted for vocational efficiency . Naturally , the first step toward definite vocational training is the selection of a vocation ; and in this matter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in two ways : first , by giving prevocational work which will lay a foundation and provide the preliminary instruction and preparation for the formal study of a particular vocation ; and second , by giving // instruction and help along the lines of vocational guidance . There is a sense in which all academic instruction is prevocational , in that it gives the information and contributes to the development which will be of service to the individual in whatever department of the industries or of business he may enter . It may , however , be made more practical than has been the case by relating it more directly to life and to the particular needs of the individual . To this instruction may be added practical experience through the manipulation of material and the various kinds of hand work which can be given in any school . This kind of instruction and teaching educates or fits for life , rather than away from life , as was the case with much of the schoolteaching of the past . To the end that the teaching of the schools may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is lived today in our own country , such courses as those in manual training and various kinds of hand work are given . This is for the purpose of giving direct experience with materials and in the use of the hands . These courses , if properly taught , also furnish a basis to pupils for forming somewhat definite ideas of the various departments of industrial activity . Such work will also enable some individuals to discover their natural inclination toward the industries , and thus it will be of practical value in helping them to decide upon their life-work . It is evident that no better addition can be made to the curriculum of our public schools in this industrial age than this practical experience in hand work . Vocational guidance an aid to efficiency . The second phase of the movement to prepare the young for vocational efficiency which is rapidly being delegated to the school is that of vocational guidance . The child , and in the majority of cases his parents as well , do not have a clear idea of his natural bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this reason , and because each individual should be fitted for economic efficiency if he is to become a useful member of society , the school has undertaken to add this feature to its work . Certainly no greater service could be rendered to the youth of our land than practical help in solving the perplexing problem of selecting a vocation that is suited to the individual 's taste and ability and is one in which he may make the most of his time , his talents , and his labor . Society as well as parents should welcome any assistance in solving this vital question ; for society in general , as well as the individuals closely concerned , would profit from conditions where skilled labor performed by those interested in their work would be the rule rather than the exception . It is evident , that a man who is vocationally efficient and can provide for his family satisfactorily by means of some calling that is suited to his taste will be an asset to the community . Such a man , by following an occupation that offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be a more happy and useful member of society and a better citizen of the State than one who is vocationally inefficient and makes a precarious living by drifting from one job to another as chance throws it in his way . The school the most effective method of educating the masses . Much time and properly directed effort is needed to acquire the desirable world facts and useful experiences which boys and girls must have to prepare them for their places and their work in the world , and very few parents could give all the help in this task that their children needed . Hence , some one else had to be found who could give the required assistance . Naturally , the teacher by virtue of his position was the one who could most effectively assist the young in this matter , and do so with the least expenditure of time on the part of the latter . For this reason , // additional phases of the educational problems have been assigned to the teacher in the school . With each addition , his sphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform the task , which no one else can do so well as himself , that those committed to his instruction may achieve a maximum of result for the effort and time expended . To this end he should be well informed regarding the function of the school , so that he will know what results to expect from this expenditure of time and effort . The most economical method of educating the masses . When it first became necessary for parents to employ others to assist them in the education of their children , there were many persons who could not meet the expense alone ; and plans had to be devised for securing education and training for the children at the least possible burden to their parents . It was found that the most practical and economical way of providing the needed instruction was for a number of persons to combine in employing a teacher to instruct their children in groups , instead of separately . The school , which has passed through many changes until the present system has been evolved , was the result . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the State , by distributing the expense among all its citizens according to their means , provides education for the children of the poor as well as of the rich , without imposing a great burden upon any one . From this it will be evident that the school is the most practical outgrowth of sociological changes and needs and of economic conditions that could have been devised for the education of the masses . Law of self-preservation forces the State to educate citizens . In a republic or democracy like the United States , sovereignty or authority is not vested in a single person , but in the whole body politic , this sovereignty being exTHE // pressed through the casting of a ballot or vote . The law or obligation of sovereignty is , however , always the same , whether vested in one person or in many persons . Authority must be exercised with intelligence , for the security and permanence of the State depends upon the intelligence of its sovereign ruler or its sovereign citizens . Therefore , it is the first duty of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ballot , should be prepared to use it intelligently . This is the fundamental reason why the State should contribute so generously to the support of the public schools . The law of self-preservation is as applicable to a state as it is to an individual . An ignorant ballot is a menace , and the great number of ignorant voters in this country is one of its greatest dangers . The fact that the ignorant voters are about equally divided between the two great political parties is our chief safeguard ; for the reason that the ignorant or unintelligent voters in the one party are usually fairly well offset or neutralized by the ignorant voters in the other . Schools should instruct in exercise of sovereignty . Sovereignty should be intelligent regarding all matters upon which it is called upon to express an opinion by the ballot ; it should be particularly intelligent in all matters pertaining to civic affairs . Therefore the public schools should give the kind of instruction and training that will enable the prospective voter to exercise his sovereign duties for the good of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this end the course of study and the instruction given should have in mind the education of all the children in the schools and not merely a certain class of pupils . It should be made so practical and be so closely related to the life and needs of all classes of children that they will be eager to receive its benefits , instead of having to be compelled by the law to do so . This does not mean that there should // not be compulsory school laws . These are necessary in many cases where children and their parents do not understand and appreciate the benefits of the school , and the welfare of the State requires that these laws be strictly enforced . The people are sovereign . They make the laws that govern the nation . Therefore , national stability and the best good of the people themselves require that these laws be made by intelligent citizens who have the welfare of the nation at heart . The right of sovereignty is one of the most sacred inheritances of our citizenship , and it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children in them what a great price our forefathers paid for this privilege and that it is their duty to keep this sacred inheritance pure and unsullied by any form of contamination . There is no more imperative duty before the schools to-day than this , and teachers should be alive to the fact that they are training the future sovereigns of our country . School most potent influence for preservation of the State . Since a democracy like our own can realize its ideals of government only by educating its citizens for intelligent self-government , it is evident that the public school is a necessity , not only for the individual and social good , but for the good of the State as well . As an outgrowth of this sentiment the founders of the American public-school system looked wisely into the future when they established the great system of free schools in which every child , the poorest as well as the richest , the child of the foreign immigrant as well as the one of native parentage , may be educated at state expense . Founded upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exalted aim of preparing a great people for wise self-government , for efficient service , for high thinking and noble living , the schools of our land should be the most practical and valuable of all // our social institutions , and at the same time , the most potent influence for the welfare and preservation of the State . To the end that they may be so , teachers should be informed regarding the function of the school in relation to the State , in order that they may use the course of study , not as a guide to the kind and amount of formal knowledge which must be crammed into the young minds , but rather as a means of really educating children for intelligent and efficient citizenship . CHAPTER VII THE LEARNING PROCESS Consciousness of self precedes conscious learning . There is some difference of opinion as to when conscious learning commences . A child undoubtedly learns something very soon after birth . During his early days his various sense : take up their work , and each contributes something to hi : mental growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self as separate from things about him , for he has not yet become conscious of himself as a being apart from other persons and from his environment . Even at this early stage of his existence , however , it is evident that he is a conscious being and a learner . The beginnings of a consciousness of self mark an important stage in the development of an individual . Until child knows or becomes conscious of himself as something apart and separate from the persons and things about him he is not conscious that he is acquiring a knowledge of thing : external to himself . Therefore , with the first steps in the acquisition of knowledge of self , the external world begin : to take on a new meaning to him and most of the impressions that come from sources external to the self have i different significance than ever before . When a child be comes conscious of himself , as separate and distinct fron the objects that he sees about him , these objects at once acquire a new interest to him and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . In the earlier years of a person 's life , consciousness of the self is probably possible only in the presence of things other that the self . Thus it will be seen that the self is discovered by // neans of the external world , and that the effect of the external world upon the conscious self affords the natural neans of gaining knowledge . Consciousness of self gained through sensation . A thing s brought into the plane of consciousness when the self ) ecomes aware that something is present of which it had not before taken cognizance . The self is made conscious ) f the presence of a thing external or apart from the ego ) r self by means of an effect which this thing produces upon the mind through the senses . This effect upon the mind by the senses is known as sensation . It is the simplest state ) f consciousness and is the basis or foundation of all knowledge . As a person becomes conscious of an external thing through sensations , it is also through sensations that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person may receive the sensation of color from an object presented to him , ? a red rose , for example . At the same time he is made conscious of self as perceiving or seeing the color of the rose . Through the sense of smell , he may receive the sensation or idea of odor as he holds the rose to Pis nostrils and become conscious of self in the sensation that is produced . From this and other examples of sensation which will suggest themselves to the reader , it is apparent that the senses have an important function to perorm in the process of gaining consciousness of the self and ) f acquiring knowledge of objects external to the self . It is because the mind receives impressions from objects external to itself through the senses that these impressions are called sensations . They are often spoken of as ideas . Ideas , however , relate to the objects , not to the senses . Sensations differ in character . The nature or character ) f a sensation becomes the means of identifying it and the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affords the means of remembering past sensations or of // recognizing new ones . Since sensations are caused by the different senses , they may be totally different in character . For example , by means of the eye the bird is perceived and its color , size and form are noted . By means of the ear , one is made conscious of its song and of the quality of its note . By means of the sense of sight , one may observe the color and size of the orange . By means of the sense of smell , one is made conscious of the odor of the orange . Through the sense of taste , the flavor or taste of the orange is obtained . Through the sense of touch , the character of the texture of the skin of the orange is learned . Thus the sensations and ideas of the orange which are produced by the different senses are totally different in character , but all are needed to convey to the mind a complete idea of this particular kind of fruit . Sensations may differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees of a sensation received through the same sense , as , for example , the varying intensity of sound from the low sweet note of the tiny bird to the loud roar of the lion or to the deafening peal of thunder . The character of these varying sensations is recorded in the mind , to be used when needed in identifying or distinguishing sensations and their causes . As new sensations or new ideas are received , they are compared with those previously experienced in order to determine to what class of sensations or ideas they belong . Thus sensations furnish the basal material which is used by the mind for comparison , selection , and combining in all its operations . Few distinct kinds of sensations . Since all sensations are received through the senses , the distinct basal sensations are relatively few in number . It is the variety in the quality and intensity of the same sensation that gives the idea of great number . Through the eye , the sensation is produced which is interpreted by the mind as color ; but // the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even many of the varying hues and tints of the color which nature presents . Through the ear , sound is produced ; but the sound may represent a particular sound with its wide range of intensity , or a combination of several sounds of infinite degrees of tone and character . Simple sensations , which a person has already had , often recur in new combinations ; and it is the result of these combinations , not the individual sensations , that are new to him . When sensations that are already familiar occur in new combinations , a person will recognize objects either as those already known or as altogether new ones . Color , form , sound , and all other sensations that appear in different combinations make it possible to recognize particular objects and to distinguish one object from another . Relation of memory to the learning process . When a sensation is produced by the presentation to the senses of an object or by any other way , at once a mental effort is made to identify it or to find out what it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mind , are called up to be compared with the sensation or the group of sensations produced by the new object upon the senses , in order to determine whether it has been experienced before . That condition , state , or process of the mind by which former experiences are reinstated is called memory . An examination of this process will show that there are three distinct phases of the mind united in what is commonly known as memory . First , there is the retention in the mind of the sensation or state of mind experienced ; second , the phase of reproduction by which the sensation is recalled ; and third , the phase of recognition by which the mind knows the past sensation or experience as having really been experienced . Therefore , in a general way memory may be defined as the power of // the mind to record , reproduce , and recognize past sensations and experiences . It is that " reproductive imagination " by which past experiences , that may for the time have been forgotten , are again brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinction is made between recollection and recognition ; but for our present purpose , this is not necessary , as we are considering memory in its widest sense as related to the learning process . Memory images . The recalled ideas and experiences which are brought into the field of consciousness by means of memory are called memory images . The value of these memory images is apparent when we consider that without them each sensation or combination of sensations would have the effect of new ones and would have to be continually acquired afresh . Thus , without memory and the power to recall memory images , a person could not make any advance in the acquisition of knowledge ; for without memory he could not accumulate and retain sensations , ideas , and experiences . Hence he would not have a stock of previously acquired material to which new experiences and sensations could be added . From this it is evident that memory is an important factor in the learning process . It is because man can retain and recall mental states , and when desired can add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to other animals . Relation of judgment to the learning process . Since the function of the memory is merely to retain the mental states , facts , and experiences which are recorded in the mind , and to recall or set them up for examination when desired , it is evident that other activities of the mind must be employed in the learning process . In order to make advancement in the acquisition of knowledge , one must add useful and usable facts and experiences to those already accumulated . This requires a process of comparison and selection by // which the new sensations and experiences are compared with the ones which memory furnishes , in order to determine their resemblance in nature , characteristics , and properties , and to decide the manner in which they are to be grouped and added to the knowledge already possessed . The process by which comparisons and selections are made is termed judging , and the activity of the mind whirl makes them is called the judgment . The importance of the judgment in the learning process is apparent ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either mental or material , where it would not be available for use , or to merely accumulate it and never make use of it . Therefore another activity , the judgment , is required to take the material recorded by memory and classify and label it . Relation of apperception to the learning process . There is still another activity of the mind which performs an important part in the learning process . By it the mental material , including the products of the sensations , the memory , and the judgment are combined and assimilated by the mind in such a way that they become part of the mental structure . After the judgment has compared the new sensations with those which the memory produces , this other activity of the mind takes the product and puts it with the group of similar ideas , thus uniting all into a larger concept . For example , when an orange is brought into the realm of consciousness , all the sensations and ideas that result from the activity of the senses of sight , smell , taste , and touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this particular fruit to the person perceiving it . The activity of the mind by which these different ideas are grouped into one is called apperception . It should be noted that apperception does not choose the material , but that it merely takes that which is already collected and combines it into a larger or a fuller concept . It will be seen // from this , that apperception combines related elements into a harmonious group , or assembles all the attributes of an object into an enlarged concept of that object . This makes it possible for memory to reproduce or recall the object or the group as a whole , or to select certain elements of it when needed for comparison with new material received through the senses . Without apperception to group and correlate the knowledge acquired in different departments of learning , there would be no accumulation of related matter and consequently no personal mental growth . Apperceptive mass . The body or group of ideas or facts relating to a given subject which is held in the mind and to which the new related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the ideas relating to a single object , or it may be composed of those relating to several objects . In either case , the entire group or collection of ideas is the apperceptive mass to which new material may be related or added . For example , it may be the color red , which is in the consciousness , producing the idea , red . By means of memory other sensations or other ideas of red , previously recorded in the mind , will be recalled , and these all combined constitute the apperceptive mass for the color red . Or a child may for the first time see a particular kind of dog . He has seen other kinds of dogs and memory at once begins to recall the appearance and characteristics of these to be compared with the new specimen . The points of resemblance lead the child to decide that the new animal is a dog ; and his apperceptive mass is enlarged by the addition of his newly acquired idea of another kind of dog . It is evident that in the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more of these acts there are , the more mental growth there will be . Moreover , the apperceptive act performs such an important part in the acquisition of new ideas and of knowledge in general // that little advance can be made without due regard to the law that governs apperception and to the law of association , as well as to others that are based upon the law of apperception . In all learning , as in all teaching , progress should be made from the known to the unknown , in order that the new may be interpreted and classified through that which is already known . Hence the point of beginning must always be the pupil 's previous knowledge , and the new matter must be related to that already possessed in such a way that it will cohere or unite in forming an enlarged or a complete idea . Unless this is done , the learner will have nothing upon which to build ; for be will not see the connection or relation between new sensations and ideas , and those which have already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the larger the apperceptive mass , the greater the number of ideas that compose it ; and , hence , the more likely it will be that it will contain some idea with which the new ideas will the more readily unite . For this reason , the teacher , when presenting any subject , should endeavor to make an appeal to as many of the senses as possible , that the number of apperceptive acts may be increased and the apperceptive mass enlarged . The learning process compared to a building . The process by which knowledge is acquired may be roughly compared to the building of a structure , a house for example . By means of sensation and memory , the original raw material for the mental structure is gathered ; judgment , the architect , classifies the material according to its character ; and apperception , the builder , puts it into its proper place . Until it is thus examined and classified by the judgment and put into the proper place in the building being constructed in the mind , it is only material for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences , not yet classified and made a part of the structure to which they belong . // Before they are so classified , and made a part of the structure , they are valuable only in the sense that piles of lumber , brick , and other building materials are valuable . They are materials , which if properly classified and used , become a part of the mental structure ; but they can be of little value until they are so classified and used . Exercise of the judgment necessary . From the foregoing discussion , it is evident that without the exercise of the judgment a person can make little use in the building of his knowledge structure of the sensations and the experiences which he collects . He may gather and record them in his mind , he may even recall them through the exercise of the memory ; but , unless he employs judgment and apperception in the classification and use of them , they will form no real mental structure , will produce no real mental development . Thus a person who merely memorizes without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is accumulating masses of unclassified material , piles of lumber or brick ; but he builds nothing and no positive result is attained from his efforts . He is not becoming educated in the true sense of the word . Because of the danger that the instruction in the public schools will be too much concerned with the collection of materials , with the memorizing of facts , and not enough with the training and exercise of the judgment , teachers themselves should be real builders , not merely the collectors of building materials . Moreover they should make builders of their pupils instead of merely aiding them in the collection of building materials in the form of well-nigh useless collections of unrelated memorized matter . To accomplish this , teachers must help their pupils to develop , to train , and to use their judgment . The concept in the learning process . After the senses , memory , judgment , and apperception have all performed their various functions , a new element of the mind results // from their combined activity . This new element represents the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a class of objects or ideas and is called a concept . A concept is the mental image of an object or a class of objects when not present to the senses . An illustration may make more clear the manner in which a child 's ideas regarding any object with which he is familiar are enlarged until , from a simple notion of a definite object , he has gained a general idea or concept of the entire class to which this object belongs . Take , for example , the growth of the child 's ideas of the common and well-known animal , the horse . His first idea may have been obtained from a toy tin horse . To his infant mind , a horse is made of tin , can not move unless wound up by means of a mechanical contrivance , and is small in size . Later he sees a real horse of a color different from that of his toy animal . His simple idea of a toy horse is enlarged by the ideas of size , color , life , and activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , and again his idea of horse is enlarged and modified to include the new specimen , and so on with each new horse which he sees until he has gained a rather distinct idea of horse in general , as to form , various colors , sizes , manner of moving , and other characteristics . These ideas relating to the class make up his concept of the animal , horse ; not of any horse in particular , but of the class horse , as distinguished from other animals . The child may have a concept of a particular horse as well as a concept of horses in general . By concept of a horse is meant the mental image of a horse when it is not present . If the horse is present , the mental image would be a percept . A concept , like a simple sensation or an idea , may be retained to be reproduced by memory when desired . Whenever a new object is brought into a person 's consciousness , various sensations are produced by its properties and quali-N4 , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or process of the memory , the judgment , and the apperception to produce a concept . There are as many simple concepts as there are sensations . Some of these result from single sensations and some of them are the product of a combination of sensations ; and finally all unite to form a complete concept of the object or idea . Therefore , a general concept of anything is a composite one , made up of many individual or simple concepts . It will readily be understood that the character of the general concept must depend upon the number , nature , and character of the individual concepts of which it is composed . Teaching should produce real concepts . It is possible to have a number of concepts of a thing without having a vivid idea of what it is . On the other hand , it may be possible to form a fairly vivid and correct general concept when only a few individual concepts are known . A concept is said to be vivid when the mental idea which it embodies is in the main correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an object are united into the general concept , it is said to be full or complete . This fact is of the utmost importance to teachers in their work , for they should know what individual and what general concepts result from their teaching . They should also make sure that they carry their instruction to the point where real concepts are formed , instead of stopping with the mere act of memory in recalling sensations and experiences . The real test of good teaching is found in the number of useful concepts pupils acquire and not in their ability to memorize unrelated facts and ideas . The result of true teaching is shown in the power of pupils to think and reason , rather than in their power to reproduce the facts accumulated by memory . This statement applies to pupils in all grades . Interest in the learning process . In the various steps of // the learning process , there is present in the mind of the learner the instinct of curiosity or a simple desire to know something about the object or the idea under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine into composite concepts , the ego or self becomes conscious , alert , and active . The natural instinct of curiosity added to the new concepts together produce a new element , interest . Interest , then , is the outgrowth of curiosity coupled with information . It is a mental attitude of mind , a feeling which urges a person to seek more information upon a given subject . Additional effort to gain information , if it increases his knowledge , creates desire for still more , provided , of course , that the quest promises to yield some good to the learner . If , on the contrary , the increased information upon the subject in question produces harm to the person , then a feeling of aversion is produced . Desire and aversion are the products of interest combined with information . Desire will continue just as long as it is believed that the subject will yield some good , and aversion will continue as long as it is believed that the subject will produce harm . When desire or aversion cease , interest ceases also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When curiosity is combined with the new concept acquired , the resulting state of mind is one of interest . Naturally this interest in an object is accompanied with the feeling that it has additional concepts or desirable information which it may be made to yield ; for interest in anything ends when the self concludes that there is nothing more to be learned from it , or that there is no longer anything desirable to be gained from it . So long , however , as interest continues , the self is aroused to special activity to secure the desired end , or to realize a supposed good . When interest is accompanied by sufficient desire , there is called into use an activity within the // self that enables it to put forth effort to satisfy this desire . This effort will be more or less effective according to the intensity of desire . This activity is known as the will . Whenever there is present a desire toward an object that is strong enough to become determination , there is an effort of the will to attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is an effort of the will to draw away from it , or to avoid it . In the sense in which will is here used , it may be defined as the activity within the self which enables one to put forth effort to satisfy desire or to attain some real or imagined good or to protect the self from harm . When properly directed this activity is productive of the greatest good to an individual , and it is a very important factor in the learning process . Interest an important factor in the learning process . Interest in a subject is not an evidence of full information regarding it ; but in reality it indicates incomplete information . Indeed , interest is not an index of the quantity of knowledge already possessed upon a given subject , but rather of the feeling toward it . It shows a receptive condition of mind , with a seeking attitude and a feeling of desire which are fundamental conditions for mental development . Hence , interest on the part of the learner is of the utmost importance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity of mind and , therefore , no real growth . One noted educator has called interest the greatest word in education . It is evident that it is vital in the acquisition of knowledge , for it gives a stimulus to effort , and makes the most difficult task a pleasure . Thinking in the learning process . In the foregoing discussion it has been found that a general concept of a thing is made up of a number of individual concepts , and that these individual concepts are in turn due to sensations , and sensations are due to objects . The process by which // new sensations and concepts are compared with those which memory reproduces and their resemblance and differences noted is called thinking . When the human mind receives its first conscious sensation it can begin to think . It can compare this sensation with the next one , and this is thinking . Naturally , thinking at this stage of development will be of a very elementary and simple character ; for the comparison of simple sensations is the most elementary form of thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts . This is thinking of a higher order than the comparing of sensations , especially when general concepts are compared . A little later , the child calls the judgment into action in comparing his own experiences ; and a much higher form of thinking results than when he merely compared simple concepts . As an individual develops mentally , he increases the number and kind of comparisons that be can make ; and this indicates that his thinking is becoming more varied . As his education advances , he is continually adding important concepts to his store of information . Naturally many elements from the individual concepts enter into the general concepts which he acquires , making the latter so complex that the judgment is taxed to the utmost to make correct comparisons and to reach logical conclusions . This requires thinking and reasoning of a more varied and higher order . Thus it will be seen that the power to think is a development or growth from the simple comparison of simple sensations to the complex process of reasoning , by which the mind compares , judges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Power to think acquired through exercise . When a person says that he can not think , he either lacks concepts which the judgment may compare , or he is deficient in judgment and in the power to see relations between the ideas and // concepts to be compared . It is self-evident that there can be no thinking unless there are first ideas or percepts and concepts to be compared and acted upon by the judgment . On the other hand , one may have ideas and concepts and yet not make comparisons of them or reach any conclusions regarding them . Such persons profit little from direct teaching or experience ; and hence they fail to develop the power to increase the number of vital concepts which come from abstract thinking or from thinking based upon material furnished by memory . Since the power to think is acquired and increased through exercise , the importance of cultivating the habit of thinking , of making mental comparisons , is of the greatest value . By cultivating this habit teachers would make thinkers , not memorizers of their pupils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion upon education , Dr. Arnold Tompkins said , " There are four distinct steps in the acquisition of knowledge . The child perceives , he likes , he desires , he wills to have . " This is a clear and concise statement of the simple process by which the child acquires new ideas and concepts and increases his knowledge , and in the main it is correct . Later on , other motives than desire may cause action . The first step presupposes that some new thing which the child has not known or experienced before is brought into his consciousness ; and he must take these four steps in the learning process in order to add this new thing to his mental stock . This epigrammatic statement of Dr. Tompkins may not be strictly psychological , but it is a good working statement for those unacquainted with the mental processes through a study of psychology . It is also a good working statement for the teacher . It suggests definite things for him to do , and when these are done properly the child will complete the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . This selection of the material to be presented // places a great responsibility upon the teachers that can not safely be ignored . In addition to selecting the material for the child , the teacher 's duty is to present it in such a way that the child will like it . Then , the child , liking it , will desire it and will put forth effort to attain it . Steps in conscious learning . The steps which the child takes in the conscious act of learning are practically the same , although they may vary somewhat according to his previous knowledge , the conditions under which the new idea is presented to him , and the motive present for gaining information regarding it . If the new subject or lesson is properly presented , it should make an appeal to him through his curiosity and should create sufficient interest to make him desire to know more about it . This desire should give him the needed motive for making the necessary effort to attain the new and useful knowledge . Naturally , the child is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher should understand the process . He must understand it in order that he may present new matter in such a way as to make the necessary appeal to the pupils , so that their effort to gain knowledge will be the natural outcome of interest and desire , instead of being forced through fear of consequences or any other wrong motive . The teacher must be concerned about his subjectmatter , and the reaction that comes from its presentation . Influence of the physical nature upon learning process . As the various steps of the learning process take place , the mental and the physical natures act and react upon each other . These reactions are spoken of as feelings and emotions . They may be produced by sensations , by memory , by judgment , or by all of these combined . Because of this , the emotions may be as varied and as numerous as the mental processes or the physical conditions which cause them . This relation between the intellectual and the physical man // is expressed by the assertion , " Every mental act or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodies the most significant law of physiological psychology , for it gives the reason why the so-called mental states have , or tend to have , a corresponding physical state or condition . The interdependence of the intellectual and physical natures of man as expressed in this law , accounts for the many direct results of the influence of the one upon the other . It explains why the continual presence of certain feelings or emotions in the mind of an individual develops certain physical states and characteristics . It makes clear the reason for the mental state of a person showing itself in the expression of his face or in the posture of his body . This law explains the relation between work and fatigue and suggests the reason why continued mental exertion causes physical exhaustion , and why physical weariness makes mental effort difficult . In this law is to be found the reason for the different ways in which the learning process affects different persons . And finally , it makes plain the importance of giving attention to physical comfort as one of the necessary conditions for gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summary . It has been the aim in this chapter to make clear and simple the psychology of the learning process in the acquisition of elementary truth . In the attempt to make it simple , statements are made , no doubt , that psychologists may not accept ; but this book is written for the young teachers who desire simple , not technical phrases . Naturally , the discussion of this process makes it necessary to take up and consider each phase of mental activity separately , as though one followed another . In the real act of learning , in the acquisition of concepts , however , the various faculties employed are active at the same time and // the different activities are going on together . Curiosity , interest , perception , memory , comparison , judgment , apperception , feeling , will , thinking , all act harmoniously and simultaneously to acquire each new fact or idea which the learner adds to his store of knowledge . CHAPTER VIII CORRECT CONCEPTS NECESSARY FOR RIGHT THINKING Exercise of the reasoning powers necessary for subjective growth . The quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality and quantity of his concepts , and his mental growth depends upon his ability to think and reason . From this statement it is evident that to insure real growth a person must acquire a store of concepts upon which to base his thinking . Further , since the quality of his thinking is determined by the character of his concepts , it is important that he acquire correct and desirable concepts . Hence every person should endeavor to increase his quantity of ideas and knowledge by the continual addition of desirable concepts . Since children and young pupils do not understand the necessity for this , they must be guided in their acquisition of knowledge by older persons who do understand it ; for if they are not so guided , their concepts may not be of a character to make right and clear thinking possible . Cultivation of the thinking habit important . A person should , as early in life as possible , form the habit of thinking . For this reason those persons who are engaged in the instruction of the young should make it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject-matter that will enable the pupil to gain as large a number of valuable concepts as he can , and then should lead him to make use of them in real thinking . Since the true result of teaching , as shown in the subjective growth of the pupils , is dependent upon their gaining the ability to think , it follows that before a child can experience the desirable reaction and stimulus // of genuine thinking , he must have a store of vivid and complete concepts upon which to base his thinking . Herein lies the duty and the opportunity of the teacher to help his pupils in acquiring these concepts ; and it is a duty which he should be quick to recognize , if he expects to be a true teacher and instructor , a real guide of the young . Teachers ' failures often due to ignorance of true aim . The ignorance on the part of many teachers of the principle which governs the dependence of one 's thinking upon the concepts possessed , accounts for more of the failures of teachers to achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conscious or unconscious negligence in the recognition and observance of this principle is unfortunately more common than those who have not investigated the matter would suppose . Nor are failures from this cause confined only to young and inexperienced teachers . Such failures may be found in the work of teachers of long experience . Neither are they confined to teachers of the lower grades ; for failure to achieve the true aim of teaching may be found in all departments of the school , from the primary to the grammar grades and from the first year to the close of the high-school course , and even in the college . The immediate causes of this condition are to be found , first , in the limited number of clear concepts possessed by the teacher and in the unwise selection of concepts to be taught ; and , second , in the character of the tests that are given to measure the results of the teaching . Regarding the first of these causes , it is evident that when a teacher has few clear concepts himself , his selection of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second cause is the result of a mistaken idea of the purpose of teaching and consequently of the evidences and proofs of real growth . Therefore , the objective tests given to ascertain the results of the teaching are not such as measure true growth in the // acquisition of clear concepts nor in the ability to think and reason . The practice of giving such tests has become so universal that they often seem to be the main motive of the teaching and of the pupil 's study . Moreover , an objective rather than a subjective aim far too often governs the selection of lesson material and the manner of ascertaining results . Examples of teachers ' poverty of concepts . Recently , a somewhat extensive investigation was made into the character and quantity of the concepts of a number of teachers and a group of students who were preparing themselves to become teachers . This inquiry was made with particular reference to the concepts which these persons had of the terms used in the common branches . As a result of this examination , it was found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subjects under consideration and of the terms used in them , but also of the laws and principles governing these subjects . Not over twenty per cent of several hundred persons whose concepts were thus tested had correct or clear concepts of such terms and expressions as those indicated in the following lists : ? Examples taken from tests of concepts . Arithmetic ? Simple number , complex fraction , denominate number , reduction , cancellation , area , square , simple fraction . Geography ? River , bay , harbor , lake , watershed , plain , commerce , longitude , latitude , equator , glacier , moraine . Grammar ? Clause , phrase , subject , predicate , object , complement , part of speech , verb , participle , modifier . Common expressions and proverbs ? He is a wolf in sheep 's clothing . A rolling stone gathers no moss . // Honesty is the best policy . In unity there is strength . A faint heart never won a fair lady . To thine own self be true . He caught a tartar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answers that were given to these and similar questions relating to the terms used in the common branches and the principles underlying these subjects were incorrect or imperfect . Some of them would have been amusing but for the fact that they were given seriously by earnest young people who had acquired their concepts of these terms through the instruction of teachers in whom they had confidence . Many of the answers were interesting as an indication of the kind of instruction the teachers had received when they were pupils in school . This investigation showed further that the teachers questioned not only had imperfect and incomplete concepts of the subjects which they taught , but that they had equally imperfect ideas as to what should be taught in different grades under ordinary conditions . Their conceptions of the methods of teaching to be employed were also vague , and their ideas of the aim of teaching and of the results to be obtained were often altogether wrong . In the light of the result of such investigations , one does not wonder so much that the schools are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one is surprised that the schools are as good as they are , and the results of the instruction in them are no worse than they are . Related concepts necessary for logical thinking . Poor results in the mental growth of pupils is often due to the fact that teachers have not made a careful or wise selection of concept material to be taught . To insure natural and satisfactory growth , the subject-matter necessary to produce it // must be added in the proper places , the proper quantity , and the proper order . It is evident from the facts and conditions already cited that in many schools and in the case of many of the subjects taught , the elements of real growth were not thus acquired and added . Careful investigations have revealed the fact that concept material that is unrelated and miscellaneous in character is often given , even by well informed teachers . In many instances it was apparent that the concepts which the teacher wished to develop did not exist in her own mind as clear or complete concepts . Hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of such teaching , the child 's mind is furnished with imperfectly understood or unrelated concepts , and he is unable to think and reason logically and correctly . As a result , he can not experience the satisfaction and joy that comes from constructive thinking nor have the growth that results from it . Examination tests show a teacher 's aim . The character of examination tests given by a teacher usually reveals the aim which governs his teaching and also shows something of the character of the concepts which he acquired when he was himself a pupil . The nature of the tests given by many teachers , as well as their teaching , shows that their principal aim is for objective results ? for the mere memorizing of facts , rather than for subjective results , as shown in the acquisition of clear concepts and the right exercise of the reasoning powers . Thus the results have been mainly objective rather than subjective . By an objective result is meant the ability on the part of the child to report in answer to questions asked , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a good memory may give back in reply to questions much information relating to the subject studied and yet have made little or no advancement in the acquisition of right concepts and in the power to think . // Many personal observations in proof of this assertion might be related , but one will be sufficient to illustrate the point . The author , when a pupil in the high school , memorized Davies ' Legendre from beginning to end . When a given theorem was mentioned , he could give the number of the theorem , the theorem itself , and the book in which it was to be found . His teacher gave him 100 per cent on every examination throughout the year , including the final test , and regarded him an exceptional student in the subject of plane geometry . Notwithstanding this fact , he was not a good student of geometry ; for all his work had failed to give him geometrical concepts . He had neither the power to think in surface and space relations , nor the ability to do original work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a square divides it into two equal parts , he could not have done it , even after a year 's work in memorizing the theorems set down in the book . The teaching had been entirely objective , and the results were objective . This is not an exceptional or an unusual case of this kind of teaching nor of the results from it . Doubtless the reader can recall similar experiences and results from purely objective teaching in his own school days . Teachers often deluded regarding results of teaching . Teachers are sometimes greatly mistaken with regard to the results of their own teaching , and what they consider desirable results are often not real gains to the child , because they do not show vital mental growth . In fact , much of the supposed good teaching , when subjected to the tests that determine real subjective growth , is found to be very unsatisfactory and shows in its results many elements of positive loss instead of real gain . This is not always due to carelessness or lack of effort on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how real growth is attained and the results by which it is shown . // Often teachers who are earnest and conscientious are deluded regarding the true character of their teaching , due , not alone to their wrong conception of the true aim of teaching , but also to their lack of knowledge of psychology and its fundamental laws . This statement is not intended to convey the impression that a person can not be a good teacher unless he is a student of formal psychology . Some knowledge of psychology , and particularly of the principles which relate to teaching , is invaluable to the teacher ; but it not infrequently happens that a teacher 's own reasoning has shown him the true aim of education and the principles relating to it , and has led him to devise methods by which these principles may be applied and this aim may be attained . Many examples might be cited of such teachers , who are using true pedagogical principles and methods in their teaching , although they may be entirely ignorant of psychology as a science , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may never have heard a psychological conclusion as related to teaching . They have gained their knowledge of method through experience , perhaps of many years ; but it has invariably been obtained at the expense of the pupils upon whom they experimented . Apparent subjective results often misleading . Frequently teachers are deluded with regard to the results of their teaching , because of apparent evidences of subjective results which are shown by the seeming interest of pupils in a given subject . In consequence of this , incorrect estimates of the value of the teaching are formed . In many cases these seeming subjective results are the outgrowth of the emotional nature rather than of the activity of the reasoning powers . The apparent interest on the part of the pupils in the subject being presented is often caused by love for the teacher and desire to please him , which leads them to evince an interest // for his sake alone , rather than because of any appeal which the subject makes to them . It may also be caused by the teacher 's praise of the pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be prompted by teaching that has much of the entertaining element , and therefore delights the pupil and produces an emotional response that is mistaken for a proper subjective result . As an illustration of this last kind of response , a case is recalled of the result of the teaching of a woman who was a very poor teacher but a good entertainer and mistook entertaining for teaching . For a time she was very popular with both children and parents , who thought her an excellent teacher because she interested and entertained her pupils . It was not until the latter had passed into another grade and had come under the instruction of another teacher that the discovery was made that they had really learned little or nothing while under the teaching of the former , and that the year 's work had to be done over . This same emotional result may be caused by an interest in illustrations and experiments which the teacher employs to make certain points in the teaching clear . These illustrations or experiments may engage the attention and arouse the interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to gain any clear concepts of the thing illustrated . An example of this may be taken from a scientific experiment in which the pupil is often interested in the apparatus when he has no interest in the thing being illustrated or proved by the experiment . The seeming interest and understanding , however , mislead the teacher and cause him to draw wrong conclusions regarding the value and the results of the teaching . Pupils ' failure to think , due to teaching . Perhaps the most universal complaint of teachers is that their pupils do not think , do not make comparison of the new ideas with the // old , but receive the new ideas passively . This is a state of affairs that exists so generally that both teachers and parents frequently accept it as a condition that can not be remedied . A little investigation of the character of the work being done in many of our schools will reveal to any intelligent person the reason why children do not think . The universality of this condition clearly indicates that teachers in general do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties of their pupils sufficiently to insure the increased ability on the part of the latter to think . It must be evident to all who have given the matter any consideration , why those teachers who complain the most about the inability of their pupils to think are usually powerless in their efforts to remedy this condition . It is apparent that before this condition can be greatly improved , vital changes must be made in the plan and methods of instruction in our schools . Criticisms of schools make improved conditions necessary . The criticisms of the schools for their failure to fulfill the purpose for which they exist have become sufficiently general to cause those who are concerned with the problem of educating the young to take vigorous measures to discover and remedy this condition . While it is generally agreed that there is something radically wrong with existing conditions , there are differences of opinion regarding the specific causes of these unsatisfactory conditions and the means of remedying them . It is evident , however , that the failure of teachers to realize the true purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire a usable fund of desirable concepts , is more far-reaching in its consequences than might at first glance be supposed . In the first place , the pupil , through not having a store of valuable concepts by means of which he may train or cultivate his reasoning powers , fails to experience the wholesome reaction which arises from real thinking . In the second place , he fails to // cultivate for subsequent use those reasoning powers which can be produced only by constant exercise in real thinking . Moreover , the failure on the part of teachers to present new and vital concepts makes school work uninviting to pupils and the schoolroom a dull , uninteresting place . As a consequence even the objective results are lessened and pupils lose interest in school altogether , as is shown by the large number that leave it at the earliest possible moment that they can escape from it . As a result of an investigation of existing conditions in many schools and a careful examination into the reasons why the school as an institution often fails to fulfill adequately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are convinced that two important changes are necessary . In the first place , some radical changes must be made in the curriculum ; and , in the second place , there must be improvements in the character of the preparation of teachers for the work of instructing the young . Curriculum should include subjects rich in concepts . The curriculum must be changed so as to include a larger number of subjects that are rich in concept-making material , and these must form a part of the daily program in every school . Among the subjects which should be given a more important place may be mentioned : nature study , drawing , manual constructive work , and educational games . Each of these subjects , when properly taught , furnishes abundant material for the presentation of desirable concepts . To insure pupils acquiring these concepts , the subjects must be presented in such a way as to arouse the reasoning activities of the mind ; for , as instruction in these subjects is usually given , pupils receive but few concepts and are not encouraged to do much individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be so much excellence of production as an effort to gain as large a number of concepts of the material used as possible , of its source , of its // characteristics , of its value , and of the uses to which it may be applied . All of these concepts and many others should be acquired while a simple piece of constructive work is in progress . Similar aims should characterize the work in manual training . The argument for giving manual training a place in our school curriculum is not so much concerned with the skill to be acquired in constructing articles as is generally supposed . Manual training offers an opportunity for presenting a body of concepts as numerous and as practical as those of history , of geography , or of science ; and therefore it merits a place in the course of study of the public school . In fact there is no other reason that would justify its being given a place in the course of study of the public school . Concepts from manual training illustrated . A simple example will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yield many desirable concepts and provoke thought on the part of pupils . Suppose the article to be made is a wooden box . Excellence of workmanship should not be the primary aim for which the box is being made . There are a large number of ideas and concepts that are suggested in the making of the box , and the presentation of these should be made the main purpose of the exercise . The outline given below will suggest some of the things that should be taught in connection with making a box in the manual training exercise . Unless the teacher has the broad view in his manual instruction which this outline suggests , his results will not justify the salary paid him ; for , in the words of G. Stanley Hall , " the work in wood will produce only wooden results . " Outline of topics for information . 1 . Different kinds of wood suitable for making boxes . R. The use of the box to determine the kind of wood . 8 . Sources and values of wood . // 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 5 . Working drawings . 6 . Use , value , and care of tools . 7 . Other materials , ? sand paper , varnish , paint , etc. 8 . Finish , edges , joints , surface , etc. 9 . Value when completed , when cost of material and reasonable pay for time expended are considered . Thus it will be seen that these and many other useful ideas and concepts may be gained by the child while constructing this simple article , provided the teacher improves the opportunities for giving the instruction which the exercise affords . If useful concepts are not gained during the constructive work in manual training , the effort all going into acquiring skill in workmanship instead , then , this branch of instruction should be eliminated from our public schools as not having a rightful place there . The chief value of manual training in the education of the child lies in its capacity for yielding useful concepts , a fact of which the teacher should never lose sight , when giving instruction in this branch . Better preparation of teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a change in the character of the preparation of teachers , in order to insure improved conditions in our schools , as it is that there should be a change in the curriculum . No great improvements in our schools can be expected until this fact becomes more generally recognized . In order that teachers may make the proper preparation for the work of teaching , they must , first of all , have the correct idea of what the true aim of teaching really is . Naturally , teachers do their work according to their ideas of the purpose to be attained by it . If their ideas regarding the purpose of education are wrong , their teaching will of necessity be wrong also . Hence mistaken notions regarding the aim of teaching must first of all be corrected , and a clear and proper conception of the true purpose of teaching be given 11 // instead . When teachers do gain a clear and correct understanding of this purpose they can then intelligently make such preparation as will enable them to realize this aim in their own teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The observations of the thoughtful educator will show him that the teachers in the majority of the schools should give more attention to the quality and quantity of the thinking on the part of the pupils , as well as to the number and quality of the concepts formed . Before teachers can do this effectively , they must emancipate themselves from the almost slavish adherence to the mechanical and objective phase of education and become thoroughly imbued with the subjective phase of it . Moreover , the teacher should show in himself the results of proper training and thinking , in order that he may , by example as well as by precept , demonstrate the satisfaction and happiness that maybe gained by the right kind of education . The wise teacher will not fail to give his pupils such guidance in the use of the concepts which they acquire as will enable them to make use of these concepts to ascertain and discover relations in other ideas , in natural phenomena , and in the concrete objects about them . Unless a child learns to use the concepts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees and hears and reads , they will be of comparatively little value or use to him . When they are so used , however , they become a source of profit and pleasure , and they will greatly assist him in forming the habit of clear and logical thinking . Right habit of thinking should be formed . It is unfortunately true that , as a rule , the children in our schools have not formed the habit of real thinking . Indeed , most people of adult years do not have this habit developed to a marked degree , for the reason that they received no incentive for real thinking and were not taught how to think when they // were children . As a result , they did not learn how to use the concepts , which they acquired , in determining relations . Persons who have made extensive investigations in schools in all parts of the country find that there are but few teachers who make the cultivation of the reasoning powers of their pupils a definite aim of the recitation , or who regard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they should persistently strive . It seems unaccountable that this should be the case ; for every intelligent person recognizes the value of being able to think and knows the distinctive place which a person who is known as a clear thinker occupies in the community . The fact that so little attention is given to the cultivation of the reasoning powers may be accounted for , at least in part , on the ground that many persons believe that one is enabled to think through the acquisition of a great number of ideas and a large amount of information . Hence the pupil 's effort is directed toward memorizing facts , rather than toward the real exercise of the reasoning powers in discovering relations and in finding out the things he wishes to know . A large fund of knowledge is most desirable , and a good memory is a fortunate possession ; but a person who has a good memory is not necessarily a great thinker . In fact , he may be quite the opposite ; for he may consciously or unconsciously substitute memory for thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he may be guided by rules and judgments which have been borrowed from other persons . Such a person is the natural product of objective teaching wherein his best ability was expended in memorizing facts instead of in acquiring clear concepts . He has a large amount of objective information , but it has failed to affect him subjectively . Hence he has not developed his power to think ; for the quantity and quality of one 's thinking depends upon the quantity and // quality of his concepts , and he has not acquired clear and definite concepts . Cultivation of the habit of thinking . Since it is of paramount importance that the habit of thinking be cultivated during childhood and youth , it is clearly the concern of teachers to provide opportunities for guiding their pupils in the cultivation of this habit . No cut-and-tried directions can be set down for doing this , however . Each subject of study and the everyday experiences of the classroom will furnish opportunities which the resourceful teacher can make use of for this purpose . To this end the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause and effect relations in their common experiences , in the natural phenomena about them , and in the incidents of their everyday observations . The subjects of the curriculum should be so presented as to call for an exercise of the thinking and reasoning powers of the pupils for the making of comparisons and the discovering of relations , similarities , and differences in the world about them , rather than for a mere repetition of memorized facts . History , geography , and the sciences , as well as mathematics , are rich in thought-provoking matter ; and these subjects should be skillfully used by the teacher in helping pupils to develop the power to think and reason , and to find out things for themselves . By this means pupils will become gradually more and more independent of the teacher 's help in the acquisition of knowledge and in the solution of the questions that are continually confronting them . They will develop the habit of making use of their experiences and knowledge in meeting new situations and in their efforts to properly react to their environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which of the two subjects , Greek or manual training , would be the more valuable if each were equally well taught ? Give reason for your answer . 10 . Which do you think has given you the more correct concepts ? your life in school or your life outside of school ? Discuss this question . Show how each might have contributed more to your life . 11 . Consider whether the home or the school is responsible for your church faith ; for your politics , for your attitude toward people ; for your outlook upon life . Tell whether school life has changed your manners ; your companionship ; your reading . Tell some things school life has done for you . 18 . " Form the habit of observing , comparing , and deciding . Note similarities , note differences , ? think . " . Give some applications of this command . CHAPTER IX THE TEACHING PROCESS The term teaching explained . The problem of education in its relation to the school has been treated from the standpoint of the pupil . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his part in the process by which the pupil acquires knowledge should be understood by all those who are fitting themselves for the profession of teaching . The importance of this is the more apparent when one considers that the significance of the term " teaching , " as applied to the work of the teacher and the processes which it involves , is not always clearly understood even by those who occupy the position of teacher . There is so much involved in the process of teaching and learning that it is not possible fully to understand just what is meant by teaching , unless one knows something regarding the directed acts of the teacher that assist the pupil in learning something he has not known before . From this it is evident that it is difficult to formulate a concise and satisfactory definition of teaching . For this reason the majority of writers on education do not attempt to give a positive definition of what they mean by teaching . They prefer , rather , to explain and discuss the various acts involved in the process . Nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final definition of what he understands by teaching , as the purpose here is not so much to define terms as to explain processes . Therefore , without attempting to formulate a definition that will apply to all phases of teaching , it is sufficient in this connection to state , as a basis for further discussion , the sense in which the word is used . The term " teaching , " as used in this chapter , applies to all the // means by which one person assists another in learning something not previously known , and in making right use of it after it is known . In this last it has in mind learning and thinking on the part of the learner . The first law of teaching . In order that a teacher may assist his pupils in learning something not previously known , two important conditions are necessary : first , he must understand the process by which a child acquires new facts ; and second , he must know the manner in which new knowledge should be presented . It is evident that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the acquisition of knowledge from what is already known upon a given subject to what is to be learned , or he will not understand the importance of connecting or relating the new matter to that already possessed . He must also be informed regarding the pupil 's previous knowledge and experience as related to the subject to be taught , in order that he may be able to connect the new matter with the knowledge which the child already possesses . With adequate information regarding the contents of the child 's mind as a basis upon which to build , the teacher should be able to relate new matter to be taught to the knowledge which the child possesses , in such a way that the latter may interpret the new in terms of the old . To express the matter more briefly , it may be stated simply that all teaching must be related to the knowledge and experiences of the learner . This concise and oft-quoted statement is sometimes referred to as the first law of teaching . It is justly given this place ; for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be first in the order of sequence . The whole body of knowledge which the different children in the school have gained through personal experience from their environment may be interpreted or translated by the teaching process into universal experiences and race facts ; or , on the other hand , universal experiences may be // interpreted and understood by these personal experiences . This being true , the value of the child 's previous experiences and knowledge and the use of these by the teacher in the teaching process can not be overestimated . The more varied and extensive his experiences may have been , the more readily will he grasp the facts of world experiences in his acquisition of knowledge . Hence in all teaching the teacher should make the previous experiences and knowledge of the child the starting-point for presenting new facts and information . That all true teaching relates new matter to the experiences of the child is an educational maxim that should be understood and followed by all teachers . Law applies to teaching in all departments . The use of the expression " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teaching , is significant and comprehensive . It indicates that the law applies to teaching in all departments from the primary grades through the high school and the college . It applies to the teaching of all subjects ; to the teaching of history and literature as truly as to the teaching of science and mathematics . It is equally true in the case of individual instruction and of instruction in class . In short , it applies to every kind of deliberate effort on the part of one person to cause another to learn something not previously known . Every teacher or instructor , whether in the day or the Sunday school , in the home or in any institution , will find that the law applies to his teaching . The point at which instruction begins . Instruction or teaching , like learning , logically commences where the learner 's knowledge of the subject to be taught ends . The teacher should be conscious of this fact , in order that the effort to assist another in acquiring new knowledge may begin at the right place . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore deserves particular attention . It is evident that unless a right beginning is made , no satis160 THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING factory result can be expected . Unfortunately many teachers ignore this fact , either from carelessness or ignorance , and do not take the trouble to inform themselves as to the knowledge which the pupil already possesses . As a result they do not relate the new matter to the old by beginning instruction upon a new subject at the point where the child 's knowledge ends . Hence their teaching is a haphazard process , which has no definite starting-place and therefore leads to no particular goal . Without a definite understanding of the learner 's previous knowledge of the subject to be taught , the teacher is in danger of committing one or the other of two blunders . Either the matter presented may not be new to the child , and hence will not'cause him to learn something not already known , or it may be so remotely related to his previous knowledge that he can not interpret the new by means of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not teaching in the true sense of the term . It is not helping the pupil to learn something not already known . It does not lead either to the acquisition of related new knowledge or to mental development and growth . Misdirected effort in teaching illustrated . As an illustration of the failure of many teachers to begin instruction at the right point , the teaching of history furnishes many examples . The failure here is the result of the tiresome repetitions of old matter which the child already knows , instead of presenting to him that which is new . In far too many cases the effort is expended upon dull reviews and mechanical tests by means of questions asked many times before , and upon topics already worn threadbare by both teachers and pupils . Under the guidance of thoughtless teachers , Columbus discovers America over and over again every year during the six or seven years that the child reads the story of American history . During the same number of years in the // child 's school experience , the Pilgrims journey annually from England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts . Similarly other familiar topics from the history of our country are gone over many times during the early years of the child 's school attendance . The study of grammar is rendered dull and irksome by the monotonous repetitions of memorized definitions of the parts of speech and their modifications . The geography recitation is made lifeless by the mechanical drills upon the names and location of cities , about which no new or interesting information is given . Such methods of presentation of the branches being studied do not make the learner 's previous knowledge the starting-point for the acquisition of new matter . It is not teaching him something new , but is really testing the information which he already possesses . It is no wonder that children find such instruction dull and tiresome and the road to knowledge a very unattractive one to follow . Such attempts at giving instruction are not in the true sense teaching ; they are not causing the child to learn something which he did not know before . Many illustrations similar to these might be given to show the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pupils . If teachers in general would make a careful and thorough analysis of the character of the lessons which they assign and of the questions which they ask their pupils upon these lessons , they would often be surprised to find that much of what they supposed was teaching was not an intelligent and well-directed effort to aid their pupils in learning something not already known . In many cases they would discover that the nature of the lessons assigned shows that the purpose for which they are given is the memorizing of certain formal information contained in the textbook . They would discover that the questions and discussion upon the lesson in the recitation are i62 THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING directed less to the acquisition and understanding by the pupils of new knowledge than to the teacher 's finding out how much of this formal information the child has succeeded " in cramming into his brain . " A careful examination by the conscientious teacher of his work will reveal the fact that in a large number of cases there is not enough effort expended at the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing the pupil 's power to repeat facts which he has memorized . Testing has a place in the process of education , as will be shown in the chapter on the recitation , but it should not take the place of teaching , nor should it be mistaken for it . The pupil 's previous knowledge . The teacher must be informed regarding the pupil 's previous knowledge and experiences , as related to a new subject to be taught , before he can intelligently and effectively connect or relate the new matter to the old . The necessity for an instructor having this information is equally important for the teacher in the elementary school , in the high school , and in the college . Attention is called to this fact for the reason that the notion seems to prevail that it is necessary only for the teacher in the elementary grades to be acquainted with the amount and kind of information which the child may have acquired from experience and environment , from the school , and from various other sources . The too frequent practice , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring or neglecting the pupil 's previous knowledge indicates the prevalence of this mistaken idea . It should be corrected , for it is as necessary that instruction in the higher branches of learning should be related to the knowledge and experiences of the learner as it is in the case of instruction in the elementary branches , and with adult as well as with juvenile learners . For this reason it is evident that whenever the teacher fails to inform himself regarding the pupil 's previous knowledge , // his teaching must of necessity be faulty and lacking in efficiency . Teaching should correct wrong concepts . The teacher must be informed regarding the pupil 's previous knowledge , for the added reason that children often possess imperfect or incorrect concepts which must be corrected before they can properly interpret the new matter . Therefore the teacher , before presenting the new matter , should find out whether the child has the right ideas and concepts to which this new material may be related . The importance of this point is shown by the results of experiments that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this line . These experiments reveal the fact that children often have the most erroneous concepts of the commonest objects . G. Stanley Hall gives an instructive report regarding the results of a test of this kind which was given a group of city children upon their entrance to school . Their ignorance upon the best-known phenomena of nature was surprising . That oats grow on oak trees , that butter is made from buttercups , that flour is made from beans , that a cow says bow-bow and is no larger than a mouse ( seen only in the picture book ) , that potatoes grow on trees , that cheese is squeezed butter , were some of the answers given ; and others were equally absurd . Doubtless a group of country children would have been equally ignorant of the objects and the activities familiar to the city child . It is a self-evident fact that children are best acquainted with the things which they see and handle . It is therefore important that they be furnished with experiences necessary for becoming familiar with the objects which they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ideas in terms of those which they already have , it is important that they have correct and accurate concepts through which to interpret the new . Therefore the teacher // should test the correctness of the knowledge which the pupil already has upon a given subject before presenting the new , and should supply the needed concepts through concrete examples when possible . Means of teaching children useful concepts . The poverty of the average child 's concepts upon entering school shows the importance of parents providing their children with the opportunities for gaining experience with material things . Many of these come unsought in the regular round of daily tasks and amusements , and they should not be neglected . These natural opportunities may be added to by a variety of means . Among these may be mentioned : making a garden or caring for a window-box , mowing and raking a lawn , using carpenter 's tools in the building of a play-house or a shelter for some pet animal , assisting in the various kinds of housework , taking care of a domestic animal , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The transaction of small business matters , such as purchasing and making change , receiving and keeping an account of the expenditure of a small weekly allowance , and many other means which the resourceful parent may devise , will furnish abundant opportunities for gaining some experience of business processes . Whenever possible , the child 's experience should be extended beyond his immediate environment by trips to the park and zoological gardens , to museums , to the stores , to factories , and to other places where he can see various kinds of industrial work in progress . In fact he should be taken to all places within reach where he will have an opportunity to add to his experiences and to gain useful information first-hand . In the case of city children occasional trips to the country are valuable ; and in that of country children visits to the city are of equal interest and profit . It is not necessary to extend further the enumeration of the means by which parents and teachers may enlarge // the children 's opportunities for gaining first-hand experiences and knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration will discover innumerable ways for providing such opportunities . There is no home so barren and no locality so lacking in interesting activities as not to afford some opportunities for the child to gain direct experience with material things , that will serve as a basis for understanding fundamental race experiences and acquiring information regarding them . It is true that many homes can not provide as large a number of such opportunities as others can . Therefore the school must supplement the work of the home in this as in many other of its neglected duties . The work of the school is often so seriously handicapped because of children 's limited experiences with materials outside of the school that it is really necessary for the school to provide opportunities for pupils gaining the needed concepts and information . To satisfy this need , games , occupations , manual training , and various kinds of exercises with materials are used to give basal concepts that are necessary for an understanding of the subject-matter of the curriculum . Selection of subject-matter for presentation . An important element in the preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the selection of the subject-matter to be presented to the pupils . The fact that an instructor is required at all indicates that the learner has a need which he can not satisfy without help . The young learner does not , in any large measure , understand his own needs nor how to satisfy them . It is necessary , therefore , that the teacher should understand the real needs of his pupils and be able to select and present the material through which these needs may be fully satisfied . In order to do this effectively , the teacher must understand the educational needs of children and learners in general ; and he must know individual needs , capacity , and previous experiences . // It is apparent that the teacher must be properly fitted for his task and his preparation for it must be broad and thorough , in order that he may rightly estimate the individual needs of his pupils and be able to select intelligently the subject-matter through which these needs may be best satisfied . A mere knowledge of the common branches is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the young in the acquisition of knowledge and in gaining the intellectual equipment for life . It is evident that the teacher must have more knowledge of the subjects to be taught than he expects to impart to his pupils . He must be prepared to answer fully the questions that arise when these answers will help the pupils to gain a clearer understanding of the subject . He should have a fuller knowledge than that which the young learner is expected to gain , in order to be able to add such practical information as will increase the pupil 's interest and add to the knowledge he has gleaned from the text . Right estimate of values in selection of subject-matter . Many persons commit great blunders in making selection in various matters because of ignorance and lack of understanding of values and fitness . No one should presume to act as judge upon any matter of importance until he has correct and definite knowledge of the elements and characteristics by which values in that subject are determined . For example , a judge of engines must know engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines valuable . A judge of horses must understand all the points that a good horse possesses . Definite knowledge is necessary in order to make a correct decision or to give an expert judgment in any matter . Thus a teacher is expected to be an expert judge in matters relating to the teaching process . To him is delegated the task of selecting the material that is to be used by his pupils in the acquisition of knowledge , in the // formation of ideals , and in the building of character . In short , to the teacher is given the responsibility of selecting the educational material that is to be used in the making of an individual and a citizen . Moreover , the teacher must thus select , not for one child alone , but for a large number of children of different temperaments , of different capacities , of varied antecedents and environments , and of various dispositions . In order to meet this great responsibility , the teacher must have a clear understanding of those elements that determine values as well as a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the child . To no other human being , perhaps , is there delegated such varied and responsible duties . Sequence in material presented . The teacher must know the needs of his pupils in order that he may select from the fields of science , mathematics , literature , art , and nature the facts which his pupils require for immediate use and for their subsequent work . In making this selection of subject-material , the question with which the teacher is primarily concerned is not what will interest a particular child or group of children , but what is the next thing , and the next , in the proper advancement of the child in the field of knowledge , and what is necessary for the logical development of the subject under consideration according to the sequence of right growth . To be able to answer these questions satisfactorily , the teacher must understand the order of the child development ; he must know the probable degree of development at a given time and under given conditions ; and he must be able to determine the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher must have a broad knowledge of the subject to be presented , in order that , in selecting the material to be used , he may choose that which best suits the child 's mental growth at a given period . Hence the teacher must be , as Superintendent Soldan has // said , " an adapter , not an adopter . " He must know how to adapt the subject-matter and the teaching to the child . Use of subject-matter and the learning process . A brief consideration of the nature of the four steps in the learning process as stated by Arnold Tompkins will show how the teacher should select and use subject-matter with reference to these steps and to the order in which they are taken . The four steps named , in the terse and direct statement of this well-known educator as already quoted , are , " The child perceives , he likes , he desires , he will have . " Naturally , if the child , upon perceiving the new object , does not like it , he will not desire it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain or to have it . Hence it is of the utmost importance that the nature of the first step be such as to lead him to like the new thing . If he does not , he will not desire it , and there will be no acquisition of knowledge . For this reason , and because the teacher is largely responsible for the manner in which these steps are taken by the learner , he should make it his particular care to see that they are taken properly . In the first step the child perceives the thing which is brought into his consciousness . Therefore , at the very beginning of the teaching process , the teacher must present to the child from the great mass of world facts , the ones that are most desirable and most suitable in each particular case . These he must present in such a way that the child will take the second step as a necessary result of the first , when the remaining steps will be taken as a consequence of the second , and the learning process will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learning process makes it necessary for the teacher to present to the child the material , the fact , or the idea which he has chosen for the lesson exercise . This requires a peculiar skill and ability on the part of the teacher ; for unless he presents the selected material in such a manner that the children will be // pleased and attracted by it , they will not like it . In other words , they will not take the second step in the learning process . No matter how valuable may have been the material which the teacher has selected , unless it is presented in a way to interest the pupils in it , so that they will like it , the effort of the teacher will be practically lost . Hence the relation of teaching to the second step in the acquisition of knowledge is of vital importance and is the one that makes professional study and training desirable and necessary . This phase of teaching bears much the same relation to the pupils as the cooking of food does to those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best quality ; but if it is not properly prepared , it may not please those to whom it is offered , and may even prove distasteful to them . Similarly , the teacher may prepare and present the best and most useful subject-matter so poorly and so unattractively that his pupils may not be interested in it and may even dislike it . This matter is of great importance , and should receive more attention than is usually given to it by teachers . It is for the instruction of teachers in the best methods of preparing and presenting the subject-matter to the learner that training schools for teachers have been established . Wrong presentation results in waste . Since all teaching must be related to the previous experience and knowledge of the learner , it is obvious that the new material being presented must in all cases be made to relate to something which the learner already understands . Unless this is done , some part of the learning process may be omitted or be defective , and the learning will be faulty or incomplete in consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the experience and previous knowledge of the child results in great waste of time and effort in the teaching process . When this kind of teaching is continued day after day , it can not but result in superficial and unsatisfactory acquisition of // knowledge upon which to base future study and effort . Unfortunately , when this condition exists , both teacher and pupils are ignorant of the fact ; and hence assume that the desired purpose has been attained in the satisfactory and complete acquisition of the subject-matter presented . A concrete example will serve to illustrate how the failure of a teacher to make use of the experience of the child will result in waste of time and endeavor . A young woman who had spent her childhood and early womanhood upon a farm in the Middle West , became the teacher of a fifth-grade class in a lumbering town on the shore of Lake Michigan . Naturally the actual experiences and observations of her pupils were limited to the community in which they lived , where a large proportion of the inhabitants were engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of these children were in the woods during the winter months , either engaged themselves in the cutting and transporting of the logs to the nearest river or in directing the process . If the children did not actually see this phase of the lumbering , they had a fairly good understanding of it from the repeated accounts of the work which they heard from their fathers . In the spring , when the logs were brought down the river , the children saw the great rafts or the large quantity of loose logs with which the river was filled at this season . They saw also how the men with long pike-poles guided the logs down the current of the stream toward the sorting gap where other persons measured , marked , and recorded the number and size of the logs , together with the names of their various owners . The children also had the opportunity of watching the process of taking the logs from the water to the mills , of the sawing of the logs into lumber , and of the sorting and piling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished lumber of various kinds into the great boats by which it was be taken to the distant markets . // The teacher understood equally well the details of work upon the farm as she had seen it performed during her own childhood . She was an unusually industrious and conscientious teacher and tried to make her teaching concrete and effective . She was resourceful in illustration ; but her illustrations were not clearly understood by her pupils because they were all taken from her own life and experience in the country on a farm . She did not know that a concrete illustration that does not touch the experience and knowledge of those to whom it is given is in reality abstract and hence valueless . She should have taken illustrations from the activities and life with which her pupils were familiar , thus enabling them to understand the applications . Preparation . The term " preparation , " as here used , has to do with the preparation by the teacher of the child 's mind for the new lesson . Naturally this preparation presupposes the statement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child upon the topic and the subject that is to be presented . Moreover , it helps to recall any related facts and ideas which the pupils may possess concerning the subject and to arouse interest in the new topic . Preparation as the first step in teaching a lesson is concerned with the class , not as a whole , but as individuals . It is concerned mainly with getting the child 's mind ready for the reception of the new subject . To do this the teacher must ascertain what concepts and ideas bearing upon the subject to be presented the child already has . When the concepts are wrong or are imperfect , he must correct or supplement them as the case requires , so that through them the child may be able to understand and interpret the new , for the new must always be interpreted in terms of the old . The resourceful teacher , with a knowledge of what should be presented , will so modify and vary his methods in the preparation of the child 's mind as to suit each individual case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
