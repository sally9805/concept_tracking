txt Preparation for the mobilization of the first contingent of 625,000 troops of the new national army advanced another step  --  today , ' when ; President ' Wilson promulgated the regulations to govern exernplion from military service . Local  --  and appeal exemption boards already have been , appointed and the issunnee . Of the ' regulations will permit them to organize immediately-and prepare for ' the concluding phases of the task of getting the men under training fer duty in France , in the order in which they must come . In a statement accompanying the announcement of the regulations , the President called upon the boards to do their ? - work ? fearlessly and impartially and to remember that " our armies at the front will be strengthened and sustainea if they be composed of men free from any sense of injustice in their mode of selection . " There are three steps in the organization process of the national army as prescribed by Congress . They are registration , selection ; and exemption . The first step has been carried through and approximately 10,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The regulations issued today cover in detail the operation of the third step , exemption . Selection Method Not ' Fold . Information concerning the second step in the series is still lacking , and officials are guarding closely the method by which selection is to be applied . The exemption regulations announce that the boards will be advised of the selection process later , although none of the steps prescribed , except the organization of the boards , can be carried on until the selection machinery has furnished the navies of the men whose fitness and desirability for army service the boards are to adjudge . There is one hint as to how the selection machinery is to work . The local boards are directed upon organization to take over from the registration precincts the cards and lists of the men registered on June 5 , . and as their first duty to provide a serial number - for each registration card . This has given support to the belief that the selection is to be by numbers . Reports were current recently that . the selection drawing was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be announced only a short time before it is put in operation . When that will be is not known . Sept . Lhas been the tentative date set for calling the 625 , - 000 of the first contingent to the colors for training . Progress with construction of the sixteen divisional cantonments for the troops will govern that action . It is now believed there will be . no serious delay . The exemption process will not take a great deal of time . It is ? difficult to calculate the time the local boards will need . in passing on the cases that come before them . The regulations provide that decision in any individual case shall not be delayed more than three days  --  by the local board or an additional five days , where appeal is taken to the district boards . The whole process probably can be carried through in less than thirty days . No Class lilxemptIonn . The exemption regulations , as issued , add little to the terms of the draft law , the , question of. - whether a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemption because , of dependents , the nature Of his occupation , or physical un7 fitness being for the boards to decide after proper investigation . It is made " very clear , however , that there are to be no class . exemptions , and that ' each individual case must be decided on its merits . The local boards  --  one for each county of less than 45,000 population or city of 30,000 , with additional boards where necessary tor each additional 30,000 // EXEMPTION RULES FOR DRAFT ISSUED // population  --  will pass upon claims for exemption except those based upon industrial or agricultural occupation , spbject to appeal to the district boards . All cases involving agricultural or industrial exemptions will be passed upon by the district boards  --  one for each Federal judicial district  --  which also will decide appeals from decisions of the local boards .. Upon organizing the local boards will take over from the registration boards all registration cards , which they will number serially and list for posting to public view . Then , after having been advised of the method by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the quota to be drawn from its ' territory ( minus credits for enlistments in the National Guard or regular army ) each board will prepare a list of persons designated . for service in the order of their liability , post the list , give it to the press , and within three days send notice to each designated person by mail . As the men so notified appear , the boards* first will make a physical examination in ? accordance with special regulations to be provided , bearing in mind that all persons accepted by them will be re-examined by army surgeons . If the physical examination is passed successfully , then comes the question of exemption Those Who Are Exempt . Persons who must be exemptectsi or discharged by the local board include : ? Officers of the United States , of the States , territories , and the District of Columbia ; - ministers of religion , students of divinity , persons in the military or naval service of the United States , subjects of Germany , all other aliens who have not taken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks , workmen in Federal armories , arsenals and navy yards . persons in the Federal service designated by the President for exemption . pilots . merchant marine sailors , those with a status with respect to dependents which renders their exclusion desirable ( a married man with dependent wife or child , son of a dependent ' widow , son of a dependent aged or infirm parent , or broth- . . er of dependent ! orphan child less than 16 years old , ) those found morally deficient , and any member of any well recognized religious sect existing May 18 , 1917 , whose creed forbids participation in war and whose religious convictions accord with the creed . Claims for exemption because of dependents may be made by the man himself , his wife , or other dependents , or by a third party , who has personally investigated the case . A claim made by the husband must be accompanied by supporting affidavits signed by the wife and by the head of a family living in the same territory . A claim by the wife or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed by heads of families . Similar rules govern claims on the grounds of other dependents , the dependents or third parties being authorized to file claims with supporting affidavits . In each case the board must be satisfied before it grants exemption or discharge that the dependent or dependents actually are supported mainly by the fruits of the man 's mental or physical labor . The text of the regulations regarding ' an exemption claim by -a . married man with dependent wife or child illustrates the method prescribed for similar cases , as follows : " - ( h ) Those in a status with respect to persons dependent upon them for support which renders their exclusion or discharge desirable . " ( 1 ) Any married man whose wife or child is dependent upon his labor for support , upon presentation to such local board , at any time within ten days after the filing of a claim for his discharge by such married man , of an affidavit signed by him giving his name , age , and place of residence ; the name and place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and stating that he is a married man , the husband of said wife , the father of her child or children ; that such wife , child , or children - is ( are ) dependent upon his labor for support as the term labor ' is used in these rules and regulations ; that his income was mainly the fruit of his mental or physical labor , and was not mainly derived from property or other sources . independent of his mental or physical labor .
