It is with much regret that we have read the report of the majority of the Senate 's Committee on Privileges and Elections in the case of Senator Lorimer . It is , of course , true that Senator Lorimer was not personally connected with any acts of bribery , and , so far as is known now , not enough votes were bought really to elect him . But that Mr. Lorimer should remain in his seat in the Senate when it is known that there was proved bribery , does not argue in the Senate a delicate sense of what constitutes fitness among its members . Of course , if Mr. Lorimer were a high-minded man instead of the cheap machine product that he is , he would have resigned long ago and gone back to the Legislature for a vindication . The whole thing is enough to make any American hang his head , particularly when he remembers that the House of Commons last winter disqualified a man who it thought had , in the course of his canvass , utilized too many automobiles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boss Sullivan of Illinois is having greater success in his efforts to name the next Mayor of Chicago than he had in his attempt to designate the next Senator from New Jersey . Samples of his work are the expulsion from one of the ward organizations of four precinct committeemen , elected by the primary , because they were supporters of Carter H. Harrison for the Mayoralty nomination , and the ? conversion of another Harrison supporter , who explained his change of heart in these words : It is true I was for Carter Harrison for Mayor . I am now for Mr. Graham , I will tell you why . The credit man for a large business firm called on me and asked me to be for Mr. Graham . I do collecting for this firm . The credit man told me that Mr. Graham had a large interest in the firm , and that inasmuch as I was in its employ , I ought not to oppose Mr. Graham . At the meeting at which these faCts came out , a statement was read showing that patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of $26,621.84 , was due to the Third Ward . The expelled committeemen declare that the organization has no power to , drop members who were elected in the primary , ? but at the headquarters of the party such action will be accepted as final in the distribution of favors . A movement has been started among the Republicans to nominate Alderman and Prof. Charles E. Merriam for Mayor , on the ground that the New Jersey idea of " the schoolmaster in politics " might work well in Chicago . It is a pity that a journal devoted to such high aims as those that actuate the Survey should not exercise more care as to the admission of extravagant or misleading statements . Thus in the most prominent article in a recent issue , dealing with health conditions in Pittsburgh and entitled " Tomfoolery with Public Health , " Samuel Hopkins Adams says , with reference to tubercu-losis : Pittsburgh 's situation in respect to this most terrible of all scourges is desperate . I know of no other word by which adequately to characterize it . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , the whole problem of tuberculosis seems to ma to be growing constantly graver in a national sense . There follow certain statements calculated to arouse feeling , but having not so much as the slightest tendency , so far as we can see , to substantiate the above assertion . The reader , if he stops to think , must wonder on wnat basis Mr. Adams arrived at his discouraging conclusion that , after several years of unprecedented effort in combating tuberculosis , the situation is graver than ever . Our own suspicion is that he derived this conclusion entirely from the workings of his inner consciousness . The latest census report on mortality statistics , which is for the year 1908 , tells a very different story . For the entire registration area of the United States , the annual number of deaths per 100,000 fell from 201.6 in 1904 to 193.6 in 1905 , 184.2 in 1904 , 183.6 in 1907 , and 173.9 in 1908 . In Pittsburgh , the rate was 181.6 in 1904 , 185.1 in 1905 , 160.0 in 1906 , 139.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have better sources of information than those accessible to the Census Bureau , but no indication of the possession of such facilities is vouchsafed by him in connection with his alarmist statement . Mr. Rockefeller 's final gift of $10,000 , - 000 to the University of Chicago is accompanied by the resignation of his personal representatives from the board of trustees . In his statement , he refers to his " early and permanent conviction that this great institution , being the property of the people , should be controlled , conducted , and supported by the people , in whose generous efforts for its upbuilding " he has " been permitted simply to cooperate " ; and in the minute adopted by the board of trustees on the occasion , it is emphatically asserted that Mr. Rockefeller has never suggested the appointment or removal of any professor , and has never " interfered , directly or indirectly , with that freedom of opinion and expression which is the vital breath of a university . " It is gratifying to find these aspects of a university 's life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude of the series of gifts now brought to a close might have overshadowed other considerations . The total of $35,000,000 is beyond all precedent , but for that very reason the importance of guarding against the suspicion of domination by the power of the . purse has , from the beginning , been peculiarly great at Chicago . The announcement that Columbia University and the College of Physicians and Surgeons are to be brought into alliance with the Presbyterian Hospital means much for medical education in New York . The gift of $1,300,000 by a donor as yet unknown which makes this plan possible proves once more that our rich men are as far-sighted in cherishing projects of benevolence as they are in money-making schemes , and that they are ' anxious to make the city of their pride preOminent in education and philanthropy as well as in finance . The joining of forces now made feasible should do for Columbia much that the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore has done for the Johns Hopkins University . With the new facilities for coordinated study of medicine , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquests , New York ought soon be to be in a position to attract ambitious medical students from all over the world . Now that statistics have demonstrated the connection between ' high marks in college and success in life , one is prepared to meet with the further paradox that Greek is the best training in the world for a scientific career . Nothing short of this is the contention of a writer in the Classical Journal , who cites a Dartmouth professor 's statement- that the boys selected to assist in the science courses are almost uniformly those who offered Greek in preparation and no science ; and that of an Amherst biologist who has found the same type of boy best equipped for work in his department . This is interpreted . to mean that the Greek boy , before the end of his college days , has outstripped the science boy in his own field . All of this is in line with the privately expressed opinion of an eminent astronomer that Greek offers better training than science because it-is generally better taught ; scientists of first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , engaged in research or otherwise to en-ter the classroom , whereas the best - among the Hellenists devote themselves - to teaching because there is nothing else , for them to do with their talents . If there is here the suspicion of a fallacy , the argument itself is a sign of the times . An article in the Popular Science Monthly , attacking the classics , moreover , endeavors to reopen the battle of the books by asserting the intellectual and artistic superiority of the moderns over the ancients . The return of the debate to the realm of literature is almost refreshing ; civil strife among the books is even at its worst preferable to the more modern warfare between them on the one side and the allied frogs and mice of the science laboratories on the other . Indeed , the time seems almost ripe for some reactionary to startle the world with an argument that the study of the classics is good in itself . The death of Adams Sherman Hill takes away a man whose knowledge and ability had made him an influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher regard in which the teaching of English is now held over its former km estate is due to the quiet work of this one instructor , it is impos sible to estimate . But no one who knows anything of the extent to which his various rhetorics have long been used , not only by the ordinary teacher and his pupils , but by other text-book writers , can doubt that their author was the greatest single factor in bringing about the importance now everywhere attached to the study of English and the complete revision of the method of teaching the writing of English which came to pass at Harvard from 1880 on . He did a pioneer 's work , but he did it so well that those who were capable of making the necessary improvements and advances upon it found themselves going back to him for the fundamentals . He was , moreover , within the classroom one of the most . brilliant and stimulating of teachers . No one could sit under that keen , vigorous personality and not have his whole range of vision enlarged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to his teaching from the writing of newspaper English . In the statement made here before the , Legislative investigating committee by the president of a fire-insurance company , that he did not care anything about a $2,500,000 or $3,000,000 fire loss , that in fact he would rather have it , there is nothing surprising or shocking ? the statement being understood to be made in a purely business sense . The business of a fire-insurance company is to ' insure . Setting aside terrific disasters which upset all calculations , the bigger the fire risk the greater the scale of the insurance business ; and as for rates , they can be made high enough to cover the risk . But while all this is true from the standpoint of the insurance company , a very different aspect is presented from the standpoint of the insured , and of the community at large . Like other matters relating to fire insurance that have cropped up in the course of this inquiry , this brings up considerations of great importance that can not be properly looked into by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied and authoritatively reported on by a competent body of expert investigators . We refer to the matter of discrimination in rates of insurance granted to property according to the degree in which it is safeguarded against fire . To what extent these safeguards shall be adopted ? both as to construction and as to de fensive appliances  --  is dependent upon the policy adopted by the fire insurance companies ; and the remark above quoted is a reminder of the absence in their case of any vital interest in the promotion or sound methods . In the mutual associations , of course , in which the most standards are insisted upon , the insurance rate drops to a very small amount ; but apart from this it is doubtful whether anything even remotely approaching a proper discrimination is practised . " Free Trade Helping Our Island Traffic " is a newspaper headline over the encouraging report of the chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs . Of course , it helps traffic ; that is the purpose of free trade , precisely as it is the purpose of protection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous example of the benefit of freer commerce and incidentally convincing evidence of the damage done by false ideas as to nationalities . A few years ago , in Spanish days , any one who suggested the removal of tariff barriers against Philippine products would have been decried ad. an enemy of American labor . He would have been asked whether he wished Philippine , pauper-labor to take the bread out of the mouths of American workingmen , with their high standard of living . Now , with an approach to free trade , the only persons complaining are the Trusts that profited by the tariff . If we could conceive of the United States annexing France or Brazil , the tariffs against those countries would come off precisely as have those against Porto Rico and the Philippines , and as the duties upon Cuban products ought to disappear , ' as one contribution to a decreased cost of living . We have but to consider the world as a , group of federated States to see that the folly of tariffs between them is as great as the absurdity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of Gen. Edwards 's report is concerned , it is , if we may judge by the printed extracts , decidedly encouraging . He states that peace and order have reigned throughout the Philippine Islands , not a single call having been made upon United States troops , and this favorable report is hardly affected by the fact that since it was written United States cavalry has been called out in one of the southern islands . It is evident , too , that the arts of peace have progressed greatly during the last twelve months . Many miles of railways have been laid , the number of Filipino depositors in the postal savings banks has risen from 4,927 to 8,547 , and the Filipinos now constitute 65 per cent . of the depositors . There have been excellent crops . What Gen. Edwards calls the " Filipinization " of the civil service is also steadily progressing . Filipinos are put in more and more responsible positions and are found to be thoroughly reliable . So far as skilled workmen are concerned , there is no complaint that they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reading  --  if only there were anything to be found in it to make one believe that the Filipinos hated the Americans less . The cost of voluntary idleness is emphasized by a writer in the London Spectator . Calculations are often made regarding the waste caused by excessive drinking , or by bad housing , preventable disease , and premature death , says this writer , but probably the loss occasioned by sheer love of idleness , resulting in neglect , unemployment , and under-employment , outweighs them all . Especially does this seem to be true when it is considered how large a proportion of those other wastages could fairly be charged to it . " Men drink because they are dispirited , and are dispirited be- , cause they are idle . " This analysis brings out the desperate problem of the social reformer . It Is inc lifting of those who will do nothing to lift themselves . In a less closely-knit social order than ours , one might shut his heart even if he could not shut his eyes , and let the dregs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thought of in a modern community , with its intimate inter-relations . Pity and selfishness unite to urge the doing of whatever can be done to keep the lowest level of society as high as possible . The diplomatic tone of the French Government toward striking workmen is audible again in the measures announced for the purpose of preventing general strikes . Conciliation and arbitration are proposed as weapons " as powerful as the strike . " The latter , in the interest of the public , must be forbidden , so far as employees of the state are concerned . On the other side , it is pointed out that the state , in setting up public monopolies , does not waive its right to interfere in behalf of the workingmen . There is something amusing in the reference to the Declaration of the Rights of Man as the source of these concrete provisions for preserving order and determining wages and rates . That declaration obligingly lends itself to any borrower , and the real process of the Ministerial reasoning has doubtless been to arrive ' at conclusions by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tions , and then to hitch the results to a document the authority of which no party would dream of questioning . This , too , is diplomatic . But what framer of the Declaration would have believed that the progress of international arbitration would have been such as to make it seriously available as an example for industrial war ? Germany 's finances , as unfolded to the Reichstag by the Minister of Finance , Herr Wermuth , are in a better condition than for some years , but can hardly be said to be as yet on a satisfactOry footing . Resort to loans is still necessary , though the sum to be borrowed under the present estimates is but $25,000,000 , as compared with an average of at least $60,000,000 for the past ten years . The Finance Minister stated drily that " the market still showed considerable distaste for German loans . " In regard to the yield of the new taxes enacted a year ago , Herr Wermuth admitted that the expectations of the Government had not been met . The product of the new taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , they had yielded $72,000,000 . An increased revenue from them of from $7,500,000 to $8,500,000 was estimated for 1911 . While the Government had to confess that the new taxes had not turned out as well as was hoped , yet they evidently constitute a great and sure means of income . Let the Reichstag , appealed the Finance Minister , " devote all its efforts to rolling the rock of their finances up the hill . " A voice from the Left cried out , " an apt metaphor . " It is , indeed  --  for Germany and all other countries . In Spain , Prime Minister Canalejas has won a great victory in finally getting his so-called " padlock bill " ( ley de cadenas ) through the Cortes . It is really but a moderate measure in the struggle with the Vatican , providing only that no more religious orders shall be established in Spain , and that those in existence shall be brought under stricter Government control ; while the life of the law is limited to two years , in the obvious hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in modifying the Concordat so as to put the whole matter on a fair and permanent basis . Spain 's troubles are something other and deeper than Clericalism . Social and economic causes really produce more unrest than the religious question : Yet there can be little doubt that the triumph of the Ministry in its attempt to curb the regular clergy , will strengthen the liberal movement in general , and help bring about - blase political and industrial and educational reforms which reflective Spaniards believe to be the crying need of their country . A considerable stir in Italian universities has been caused by the decision of the Government that professors must take the oath required of all employees of the state . This oath , which in form dates back to the unification of Italy , runs as follows : " I swear to be faithful to the King and his royal successors , . . . and to discharge all of my official duties with an eye single to the inseparable well-being of King and country . " The point is that not a few university professors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this oath without mental reservations . It is something which has not been asked of them hitherto , as , indeed , the laws relating to education seem clearly to differentiate the occupants of university chairs from other public employees . To emphasize the absurdity of the requirement , it is pointed out that several professors in Italian universities are foreigners ; they certainly can not be compelled to swear allegiance to Victor Emmanuel and the royal family . Prof. Luigi Einaudi of the University of Turin has an article of vigorous protest in the Corriere della Sera , arguing with abundant citation of the statutes that the oath in question was never intended for teachers , and calling upon the authorities to recede from a position which would be a reproach to the nation and " disastrous to the liberty of learning .
