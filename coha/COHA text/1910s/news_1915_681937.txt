txt The Times indorses the proposal for " an immediate issue and sale to importers by the Treasury of gold dollar Treasury bills payable in September . 1920 , by British Government agents in New York . These would be taken readily by American bankers and exporters at a discount not exceeding 4M per cent. , and this method of raising a gold credit would obviate the njury to the 1-1 , iti.h war loan invplveci in the issuance of a tax free 5 per cent . loan in New York . ' The Post states emphatically that the Allied ? Governments have not yet reached an actual decision , and adds : " The whole developments of the past few days may be summed up in the fact that the British treasury and country are completely united regarding the course of action necessary , and it is this fact rather than agreement on the details of a plan which is responsible for the sharp improvement in the exchange rate . " A great part of the 150,000,000 to 1100,000.000 gold which will be sent to America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and RuSsla , as much of the purchasing from the United States has been on their behalf . " Bankers Here Diseuns Loan . As the result of another day 's conferences between leading bankers In New York and London , during which ideas were frequently exchanged by cable , it appeared last night that the completion of arrangements for a huge British credit in this market is a matter of only a few days . At the conclusion of meetings in the office of J. P. Morgan &; Co. it was stated by a banker who had been taking a prominent part m the overseas negotiations that , while no plans had crystalized , the financiers were approaching an agreement which should restore the parity of exchange between the two countries . The chief difference , it is understood , has to do with the size of the external loan which the English bankers would like to place here . It is recognized that in view of the great amount of bills which will mature in the next few months with the shipment of the munitions of war now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate to provide an offset to the rapidly growing balance against the Allies . In fact , it is held by some of the bankers handling the negotiations that to clean up the situation a credit of not less than $750.0()0,000 should be arranged , and it is not likely that an amount of less than $500.000,000 will be decided upon . One of the leading bankers concerned in the discussions is holding out for at least this sum on the ground that a smaller credit would only take care of Dressing bills . wall Street was not at all pleased with the recurrenee of reports that upward of $100,006,000 , and perhaps a still larger amount . in gold shortly Ivould be sent to this country from South Africa . Australia . and London . It is expected that at least $20,000,000 more will arrive from London , but it is hoped that this will be the last large shipment . No More Gold Wanted Here . Regarding Washington reports that more ' than $300,000,000 might be sent here , a man participating in the conferences said : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further shipments of gold . I should regard the receipt of a large sum as a national calamity . It would tend to induce inflation and a big advance in the cost of living here , and would do us no good . England needs her gold , and we do not . " From the same authority it was learned that from the present stage of the discussions , it appeared not unlikely that arrangements to provide credit here for the Allies might be made by a combination of three devices : first , the return of a large amount of American bonds now held in Europe , to be used as collateral for advances : second , a direct offering h1 thismarket of a new British external loan : and third , shipments of gold . The opinion is quite generally held in financial quarters that the obvious and most satisfactory solution of the problem now facing the two countries would be a more determined effort on the part of the British to mobilize American bonds To effect this it is suggested that a heavy tax be laid against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding . If the British Investor could be induced to turn his American securities into the Bank of England in return for the new war loan bonds , the arrangement of an advance here against such collateral could be effected over night . Lombard Street would prefer to keep foreign securities and expand Great Britain 's resources by the sale in this country of a large amount of external bonds , free from the British income tax . The- best opinion here holds that not more than $100,000,000 of short-term 5 per cent . bonds could be absorbed by American investors . Smaller offerings than that of New York City corporate stock have glutted the investment market for weeks , and there is a great deal of doubt as to the nature of the reception which war bonds would receive . Plan to Benefit America . Many banks which ordinarily participate in big security offerings would undoubtedly bold aloof from the proposed issue , owing to the presence on their Boards of Directors of German descent Or sympathies . The question of the attitude of Washington toward a British loan placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday 's negotiations . Bankers said that inasmuch as not a dollar of cash wouid go out of the country in payment for the securities , it could not be said that the United States was financing the Allies ' side of the war . The proceeds of any loan would all be used to pay obligations already contracted in this country . The matter has not been taken up with the Administration for the reason I that no definite proposition has yet been outlined by the British , hut it is not expected that the Government a filcials will interfere . The primary purpose of the loan under discussion is a selfish one , in that it is not for the assi.:4'a nee of England . lait for the maintenance of industry in the United States . The great accumulation of bills for supplies going to Europe must be paid , and if the terms are as onerous as the exchange market now makes them , it . s accepted as a foregone conclusion that new orders will be greatly reduced in size . The banks in ibis country are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to get their surplus reserves out on American securities as collateral . Realization Of the fact that some settlement of the existing difficulties can not be far off served to steady the exchange markets yesterday , Demand sterling opened 3/4 higher at $4.65 , and by midday had reached kt4.6114 it closed at $4.66% . Francs rose to - .97 . The redovery apparently was helped by short covering . FRANCE SELLS OUR BONDS . Lets Railroad Redeem $28,000,000 Deposited with Morgan Cc Co . Of the American bonds held by J. P. Morgan &; Co. as collateral for the credit of $43,000,000 extended to Faance , Pennsylvania Ranroad guaranteed bonds to the amount of 142,000,000 francs , or approximately $28,400,000 , will never return to Paris . Arrangements were concluded yesterday whereby these securities . which were purchased by the French Government and the Rothschilds from private investors to render them available for borrowing purposes here , will be taken back and canceled by the Pennsylvania Railroad . Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , acting for the railroad , have advanced the full value of the bonds to Morgan &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount loaned has been credited to the French Government . These bonds were part of an issue of 200,000,000 francs put out in Paris by Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. in oehalf of the Pennsylvania road in 19015 . They bear interest at " aaa per cent . and mature in The railroad company profits by the difference of nearly 16 per cent . in the exchange rates against Paris , and is relieved of the possibility of having to buy French exchange at high rates when the securities fall due . It is understood that the railroad company will make a new offering sf bonds in dollars in this country to provide funds to reI pay the bankers . I The arrangement was acceptable to the French as relieving in some measure the exchange situation . Cancellation of these notes provides only a small amount of additional credit here , as they were pledged for 90 per cent . of their market value , but it reduces by about $25 , - 000,000 the sum which the Rothschilds will have to provide to liquidate the loan when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts are making to buy other securities sold in Paris , particularly the 250,000 , M0 francs of 4 per cent . bonds placed there by the St. Paul Railroad five years ago . Trucks delivered to the Morgan vaults yesterday ' twenty-seven large packing cases lined with zinc to make them waterproof and filled with A merisan securities sent here from Paris . It is understood that the credit based on this collateral , under which about $43,000,000 has been advanced to date for the payment of France 's war bills here . Is an open transaction , and that as fast as American bonds can be collected In Paris they will be shipped here to serve as a basis for more advances .
