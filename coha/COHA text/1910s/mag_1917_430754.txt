 | I. THE ANNIVERSARY WHEN this magazine reaches the reader 's hands the third anniversary of the World War will have arrived . All over the world men and women will be asking again the tragic question , " How long ? " And if one looks only to the military situation it seems to me that there can be no satisfactory evidence discovered which will give promise of a termination in less than another year . It is not too much to say that the military history of the past year has demonstrated that a German military victory is no longer possible . But it is equally true that there is no evidence of such Allied progress , to date , as would warrant a prediction of speedy victory . Looking backward it is worth while to recall that the past year has seen no offensive attempted by Germany against her major foes . In the long history of military events Germany and her Allies have suffered many defeats . The Russian campaign of last year which began in June and ended in late August cost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of material . The Battle of the Somme cost Germany over 80,000 prisoners and above 500,000 additional casualties . Before Verdun two French attacks won back the positions stormed by the Germans at such great cost , retook Douaumont and Vaux , together with 18,000 prisoners . Since the present calendar year opened the Germans have been driven back on many points of the western front . As a consequence of the Battle of the Somme they were compelled to evacuate over a thousand square miles of French territory . Since that time they have been driven back from the lower Aisne and have lost to the French more than 30,000 prisoners . By the British they have been defeated before Arras and at Ypres , losing at least 35,000 prisoners , suffering great casualties and surrendering vast military stores and a hitherto unprecedented number of guns , both heavy and light . As against this showing we have just one successful German offensive , the attack upon Rumania , which ended in the occupation of more than half of the territory of this little kingdom and in military victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a new foe , which left Germany still in the same position with reference to her greater enemies . She had brilliantly avoided disaster , magnificently parried a new and deadly blow . But this is the military extent of her Rumanian victory . For the rest , wherever one looks there has been a manifest recession of German arms . Bagdad , Monastir , Gorizia , Stanislau , Czernowitz , Kolomea ? such is a partial rollcall of lost cities . Verdun , the Somme , Arras , Galicia , Ypres ? these are the major defeats and a new Russian offensive breaking out in Galicia has already brought nearly 50,000 prisoners and a new harvest of captured guns . Such is the story of 1916-17 , as it is written in the war news . Look back a year and see what the contrast is . In the opening months of the second year of the war German armies had advanced far into Russia and won victories hardly precedented in military history . They had destroyed Serbia and opened the road from Berlin to Bagdad . The Turk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British by May . The great offensive aimed at Verdun was still unfinished and Verdun , in July , 1916 , was almost at the point of reduction . The Somme battle had opened with only local successes purchased at terrific cost . Italy had barely escaped from the terrible Trentine drive which had brought the Austrians within sight of the Venetian Plain . Only Russia , in Volhynia and Galicia , had begun her great campaign which was to go forward to so many victories . At the beginning of the third year of the war Germany was still , in the eyes of the world at least , on the offensive , her attack upon Verdun still bulked large in the minds of all . But to-day we have come to  | the end of a period in which there have been no German offensives , save the Rumanian , in which there have been German recessions on all fronts and even German official statements speak of Germany as outmanned and outgunned on her western front , speak of Germany on the defensive , and save for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , no more of her " hacking through ! " This is , I think , the significant fact on the threshold of the fourth year . II . PROSPECTS In recent months there has been a great accession of German confidence based upon the submarine and the Russian Revolution ; there has been a new hope that Germany might win the war , after all . But these hopes have gone glimmering with the return of the Russians to the attack , the unsatisfactory harvest of the submarine , which discloses the fact that it can not win the war this year or next , at the present rate , and , finally , the entrance of the United States into the war and the arrival of American troops in France . The echo of all this we hear in the present crisis in Berlin . It is no part of the task of the military reviewer to discuss political events . We have not yet any satisfactory evidence as to the true meaning of the passing of Bethmann-Hollweg and the pending changes in the German Government or system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit of military disappointments and are manifestly consequences of a growing recognition in Germany of the fact that the war can not be won and may be lost . We shall have a real measure of the German spirit when there emerges from the fog some definite statement of German peace proposals . Unless these proposals accept unequivocally the Russian view of no annexations and no indemnities , it is safe to conclude that they will be thrust aside by the nations now fighting Germany . Even if they do make such proposals , the Allies will infallibly demand a German agreement to a settlement of the Alsace-Lorraine question in favor of France , of the Italian Irredenta in favor of Italy and the reconstitution of the Balkans in favor of Serbia , insuring that state a seaboard on the Adriatic and an increase of Serb lands at the expense of Austria . That an evidence on the part of Germany ? and of her Allies , of willingness to open these questions might lead to an agreement to settle colonial questions about the green table and to negotiate on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me quite likely . But this is mere speculation . Germany must first renounce conquest , second consent to sacrifices ; until these things happen there can be no peace conference this year , or before a campaign of 1918 . Yet recognizing all this it seems to me plain that we are entering the last year of the war . For my own part I am convinced that if the war lasts until the fourth anniversary , we shall then be within two steps of peace and my conviction is that peace will come before that anniversary . The temper in Austria , the change wrought in the Near East by Russian renunciation of annexations in Turkey , the growing clearness of perception in Germany that victory is impossible and that disaster lies in future prolongation of the struggle are for me clear indications that we are on the edge of a change in the whole situation , a change which will make military events from now on of less importance than political . In all this it seems to me the United States has a very clear mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies and munitions to Europe , because I believe that the arrival of American troops in France has already been an unmistakably powerful influence in bringing a change in Germany . The more troops we send to France the less chance there will be that we shall have heavy losses and long casualty lists . The fact that we mean to go on will , I believe , be a great force for peace , the first sign that we were slowing down might act as did the Russian Revolution to arouse a German hope that the war might be won . A few weeks ago , when Russian soldiers were quitting the front and there was still no suggestion of an American army in France , Germany believed she could win the war and adopted a policy of extreme rigor . Her statesmen and publicists proclaimed victory in sight and asserted that this victory would mean the real world domination of Germany . But the Russian soldiers returned to the battle and an American army arrived in Europe with results that are plain . There has been a profound change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable ways : The submarine , the separate peace with Russia , the impotence of America ? these  | have all proven illusions . But , on the other hand , if Russia again pauses , if the United States contents itself with sending only a first expedition to France , German hope may revive and German determination to fight on may return . Then we shall lose many lives , both of soldiers now in France and soldiers who will ultimately have to be sent from this country , if the war takes on a new and bitter phase . III . PEACE Once more I caution my readers against any belief in an immediate arrival of peace or any hasty acceptation of the German events as a proof that democracy has conquered Germany and the war has thus been won for liberty . Certainly events in Germany mean that there is a beginning . The end may come with great rapidity , once the first step is taken , but I do not believe the old order will pass without a struggle , nor do I believe it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field in this war without a more determined resistance than it has yet made . It is essential to realize that if Germany consents to the restoration of the conditions of 1914 , that in itself will mean a lost war and a diminished future . Above all else Germany went to war because she believed that only if there were a redistribution of the territories of the world would the German have an equal chance in the future with the Briton , the Russian , and the citizen of the United States . She perceived that as the world was divided , there was left for Germany no outlet for her excess population , and in her overseas colonies there was no opportunity to keep pace with Russia , with Britain , that even France would distance Germany in commercial possibilities when North Africa was opened to trade . This situation has not changed . If Germany emerges from the war as she entered it , the old limitations will be renewed . More than this , she has roused all over the world antipathies which will endure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in France , in Britain , in Belgium . A generation must pass before there will he even a tolerable reception for Germans in these countries . Unquestionably war costs will bring Britain to a new intra-imperial tariff , which will bear heavily upon German exports . And in three years of war and blockade German commercial organization has lost its place in the Americas and in the Far East . In time some of the ground may be regained but much has been lost forever and Germany , if the situation of 1914 is restored , will be , in fact , far worse off than she was in the year when she undertook a world war because her international position seemed intolerable . Peace without annexation will then be for Germany a defeat which can not be concealed from the German people . It will be a defeat the extent of which will be revealed in succeeding years . If to this there is added the burden incident to a renunciation of indemnity , if Germany is to have no price for evacuating France and Belgium , Serbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear a burden of taxation almost intolerable and calculated to stifle all industrial development . The burden will be far heavier than that of Britain or France , because Germany lacked the capital at the outset , which both her older foes possessed . We must be chary , then , of accepting German proposals until the nature of these proposals is revealed unmistakably . For any peace proposal that will command even a passing hearing in Allied capitals will be a confession on its face of a defeat such as no unconquered nation has known since Louis XIV agreed to a peace without annexation at the close of the War of the Spanish Succession , a peace that left France intact , but economically ruined . That Germany is being led by events toward such a peace proposal no one can mistake . That she will be compelled to make such terms within a brief span of weeks or months , I believe . But it seems to me likely that before this time arrives she will inevitably make many efforts to escape her hard fate , both by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manoeuvres . That is why , once one has recognized the enormous importance of the main fact of German internal upheaval , it is necessary to be on guard against too optimistic conclusions as to immediate developments . We are , in my view , arrived at a situation wherein peace is more nearly within reach than at any moment since the war began . More than this , German defeat is more clearly indicated than ever before . But the curtain is rising rather than falling on the last act , and much may yet take place in  | the field and in the internal affairs of the nations at war . IV . RUSSIA RE-ENLISTS Turning now to the actual military events of the past month , one fact alone is of first importance . Russia has struck again . She has made a great military effort and as the result of severe fighting has advanced south of the Dniester , taken Halicz and Kalusz , and renewed the threat at Lemberg of last autumn . She has in this operation captured nearly 40,000 prisoners and advanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a month ago the military opinion of the world was confident that Russia was out of the war for many months , for the campaign of 1917 , at the least , this is a very great change , a piece of good fortune for the Allies as unexpected as it is considerable . Oddly enough , the events this year recall those of last strikingly . Just before Brusiloff struck in June , 1916 , all the Allied representatives at Petrograd urged their governments to advise Russia not to attack , so bad did they think the Russian physical condition was . The answer came in the great victories about Lutsk , Dubno , and Czernowitz and in a summer of tremendous Russian successes . Once more the Russians have given the lie to the military men and once more there has come a great surprise . The effect is not measured by ground gained , it is not to be estimated primarily in military terms . Its effect is to be seen in what has taken place politically in Berlin , in Vienna ; its effect is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teutonic quarters . There is to be no separate peace with Russia , then . There is to be no quiescence on the Eastern front permitting concentrations on the west and the defeat of the western allies . A war on all fronts is to be resumed with new demands upon German manpower , and new confessions of weakness in Austrian collapses . Now I take it this is the real meaning for Berlin of the new Russian drive . It has not yet attained military importance of the first order , it is not yet a break in Austrian lines beyond repair or comparable with the Brusiloff performance in June , last year . It may expand to this , it may not . Conceivably the German General Staff already has the matter in hand , and the Russian drive will slow up from this day forth . But if it is to be checked it will take German reserves and German munitions and there will be a return to the old situation of stopping leaks in the dikes , which are the battle-lines , by fresh drafts upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculate to hold out until the submarine brought Britain to the point of peace discussion . But the submarine is doing its work far more slowly than Germans expected ? and Russia is back adding to the strain upon German reserves . It is clear now that Britain can last beyond this year , submarine or no submarine . It is probable that she can get on until the harvest of next year . Can German manpower go that long ? The Russian offensive raises another question . With Russia out it became plain that neither France nor Britain cared to risk the terrible costs of an offensive this year . They had patently adopted the policy of waiting until the United States arrived , making only local offensives and keeping their final reserves for the hour when the manpower of the United States would be available as a reservoir and as a last reserve . But with Russia back in the line is it not probable that we shall see a new British attack , a new Somme effort , and a sudden and enormous expansion of German casualties on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming a harvest of dead ? We shall do well not to exaggerate the Russian offensive . It is an unmistakable fact that the Russian army has been disorganized by revolution and the condition of its transport is notorious . A great and continued offensive , taking Lemberg and sweeping Galicia will only be possible if Austria turns out to be weaker than Russia and an Austrian collapse comes on the heels of a Russian offensive . This is far from unlikely , given the past history and our present knowledge of Austrian conditions , But it is not a safe factor to reckon on . We have all asked of Russia , since the war began , far too much ; and after great services we have suffered great disappointments at Russian hands . It is impossible to exaggerate the latest Russian service , but it is not a time to repeat the old errors based upon the conception of a Russian steam-roller moving irresistibly upon Berlin . Only an Austrian breakdown will make this possible . We have not yet any authentic sign of this , hopeful as Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the actual history of the Russian attack in Galicia it is necessary to recall certain facts familiar in 1916 and now forgotten . When in August Brusiloff 's great offensive came to an end the Austrian armies in Galicia were standing in a wide semi-circle about Lemberg and from forty to sixty miles east of that city . To the north , in Volhynia , the Russian advance had stopped along the line of the Stochod River , some twenty miles east of the vital railroad center of Kovel . Had the Russians reached Kovel a great Austro-German retreat from the Gulf of Riga to the Carpathians would have been inevitable . In Galicia the Austrians were standing behind the upper stream of the Styr , which flows north out of Galicia , their center was along the Zlota Lipa , which rises near the Styr but flows south into the Dniester , with their extreme right center bent back north of the Dniester to the point where the Gnila Lipa enters it . South of the Dniester their line ran behind the Bystritiza , just west of Stanislau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temporary position , were on the point of drawing back their center behind the Gnila Lipa when the Russian offensive stopped . After the pause the Austrian and German troops held on . The main mission of the Austro-German forces in Galicia was to cover Lemberg . Originally they had stood along the line of the Strypa , ' which parallels the Zlota Lipa to the eastward . They had fallen back to the Zlota Lipa , and the Russians had succeeded in passing the lower stretch of this river , thus turning the Zlota Lipa position . Actually , the Austrians had left to them the Gnila Lipa River position ; that is , the position behind this river which rises in the hills east of Lemberg and flows fairly straight down to the Dniester , which it enters opposite Halicz . This is the natural defensive position of an army defending Lemberg , which is an open town ; it is the position from which the Austrians had defended the town in August , 1914 , and when they were defeated here they evacuated Lemberg . The Bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of the Gnila Lipa and at one point coming within half a dozen miles of this stream , turns north and flows across eastern Galicia into Russia , it makes a natural extension to the northward of the Gnila Lipa position , and together the lines of the Bug and the Gnila Lipa constitute the last and best defensive position before Lemberg . South of Dniester the Bystritza , and behind it the Lomnica , serve as extensions of this Gnila Lipa-Bug line . In August , 1916 , the world believed that the Austro-Germans would be compelled to draw back to the Gnila Lipa position . But they stood , their center still advanced along the Zlota Lipa , and it was against this center and about the town of Brzezany that the first Russian attack of this year was delivered on a wide front from north of the Lemberg-Brody railroad to the ground south of Brzezany . This attack met with local successes . The town of Koniuchy , northeast of Brzezany , was taken ; Brzezany itself was threatened ; some 20,000 prisoners were captured , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French at the Aisne in April ,  | the local successes were all that resulted . The Austrian line was reinforced and held on . Fresh Russian attacks were met by stiff resistance and brought heavy losses . The attack had begun on July I. By July 4 it was beginning to flicker out and there was no longer immediate promise of any piercing of the enemy line or any renewal of the achievement of 1914 or of 1916 . The most that could be said for this first attack was that it had surprised the world by showing Russia was resolved to fight on , and it had revealed the Russian army as better prepared in artillery and other munitions than had been expected and disclosed the soldiers as having a fighting spirit once more . July 2 , the best day of the attack , may have great value in subsequent Russian history , and already battalions which fought in it have been christened by its name . Kerensky , who led the assault , earned imperishable glory as the real driving force of the reinvigorated Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian offensive would have had little real military value , measured by actual achievement . VI . HALICZ But as it turned out this was only a beginning . After a few days ' pause the Russians renewed the attack , this time south of the Dniester and along the Bystritza , west of Stanislau . Here their success was immediate and considerable . The Austrian lines were pierced and there began a drive quite like those of 1916 . On July 16 , when these lines are written , it is still going forward , and it remains to be seen whether it can be stemmed in time to avert the gravest peril to Lemberg of the last two years . Recall again what I said of the relation of the various rivers to Lemberg . The Austrians still hold a portion of the Zlota Lipa line . They can still retire to the line of the Gnila Lipa , as far as pressure north of the Dniester is concerned . But the Russians have passed both the Bystritza and the Lomnica , which are the natural extensions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they have crossed the Dniester from the south , opposite Halicz , which they have captured , and are thus west of the Gnila Lipa , north of the Dniester . Apart from the announcement of the passing of the Dniester at Halicz there has been no report of Russian progress . It is conceivable that their excursion here has been abruptly halted before the river hills . If it has , the Gnila Lipa line may still be made good by the Austrians , but if not the Russians are in a position to move north behind and on the communications of the whole Austrian center and this center will be compelled to withdraw , not merely to the Gnila Lipa line , but beyond it , because the Russians will hold a portion of this line and thus have turned the whole position . The situation south of the Dniester is perhaps more serious , for the Russians have passed both the Bystritza and the Lomnica , and having taken Kalusz are moving westward between the Dniester and the Carpathian foothills , driving a wedge between the Austrians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening to open a wide gap through which their troops will pour  | in north and west and threaten Lemberg . The real test of the Russian success is now their ability to reach the city of Stryj , thirtyodd miles northwest of Lemberg and an important railroad junction . If they get to Stryj , then I think the evacuation of Lemberg will be inevitable . It is possible that the passing of the river at Halicz may compel the abandonment of the Gnila Lipa River line by the Austrians and the eventual retirement west of Lemberg . It did in 1914 , but it is less likely that this success will be decisive than that the fall of Lemberg , if it comes , will be determined by operations to the south of the Dniester , where there are more evidences of Austrian collapse . Again I warn my readers against premature hopes . The fall of Lemberg would be for Germany the greatest disaster since Verdun . Its moral effect in Austria and in the world would be incalculable . It will not take place if the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear that they have already begun their work of salvage . That the Russians have the resources or the organization for a sustained drive is wholly improbable . The chances are against them . If they are able to achieve so great a success as an offensive carried to the city of Lemberg , we can fairly speak of the Russian " miracle . " Having said this it is equally necessary to recognize that the military movements to date foreshadow the fall of Lemberg . Unless the Russians are checked , and they have advanced more than twenty miles now , unless they are checked within a brief period of time , before this magazine reaches the reader , for example , Lemberg will be in deadly peril , and the whole complexion of the war in the East will have been changed . Had the Russians accomplished in September , 1916 , what they have now accomplished the fate of Lemberg would be regarded as sealed . When they did take Halicz in 1914 Lemberg fell without resistance and its defenders retired to the Grodek line , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the San , surrendering the larger half of Galicia to the invader . Meantime there are signs of a new Rumanian operation to the southward and hints of Russian attacks to the north , between Pinsk and the Dwina . Thus , even if Russia is stopped before Stryj falls and Lemberg is directly threatened , there is promise of continued pressure on the east front and new demands made upon German manpower and German resources . All this means one of the most dramatic and unexpected recoveries in military history and a complete change in the prospects of the campaign of 1917 , which has still nearly three months of fighting weather in sight , As I read these proofs Russian and German official statements announce that the Russians have evacuated Kalusz . This means that temporarily ? at least ? the Central Powers have restored the Lomnica line . If the success grows permanent , there will probably be no immediate change north of the Dniester and the Russian attack will end in a considerable but purely local success .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
