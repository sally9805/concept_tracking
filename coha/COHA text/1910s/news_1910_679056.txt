txt Scottish Blood of George V. You conclude your editorial article on the new Prince of Wales with tho words : " At present , however , he is only a reasonably bright , attractive English boy of German ancestry . " The last two words are sure to mislead many readers who have not the historical knowledge of your scribe . Neither the young Prince nor his father owes his position to his German ancestry , but to his Scottish forebears . It is the streak of blood derived from Elizabeth Stuart . daughter of James VI . of Scotland and I. of England , and not his descent from Farmer George of Hanover that places George V. on his throne to-day ; just as it was through his descent from another woman , Margaret Tailor , daughter of Henry VII. , that the same James Stuart crossed the Tweed in 1603 and flooded disgusted London with needy eouthron Scots .
