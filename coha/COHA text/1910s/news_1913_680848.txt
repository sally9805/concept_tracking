txt Friends of Parle . Commissioner Charles B. Stover were much alarmed last night when dispatches from Wilmington . , Del. , said that in a body found in the Christiana ' River , near the shipyard of the American Car and Foundry Company there , Coroner John T. Spring of Wilmington reported that he recognized striking ' resemblance to Mr ? Stever , whose whereabouts have not been known for some time . The Coroner said he would get into communication with Robbin Gilman of the University Settlement , 184 Eldridge Street , where Mr. Stover lived for more than twenty-five years , and that he would ask Mr. Gilman to come to Wilmington to see the body found near the shipyard . The Coroner was the more inclined to think that the body was Mr. Stover 's after seeing a photograph of themissing Commissioner in a New York newspaper yesterday . The body was found , the dispatches said , near the shore by Frank Ska , a Polish laborer , who was raking in - driftwood at 6 o'clock yesterday morning . According to Coroner Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , possibly overnight . There were no papers or other effects iri-the clothing of the dead man by which the authorities could identify it . The bel.ef .. f Coroner Spring that the dead man might be Commissioner Stover was strengthened by ' the fact that Mr : Stover wrote to Louie F. La Riiclie of this city only ' a week ago &Om-Philadelphia,; which is only about thirty.miles from Wilmington . ' Mr. Spring said Mr. Stover might have come down to Wil. : ' mington on any day since then on one of the steamboats that ply between the two cities daily . No one could be found In Wilmington who could . identify the body last night , and it was removed to the Morgue . Over the long-distance telephone last night Coroner Spring of Wilmington told THE IsInw YORK TIMES that he was firmly of the opinion that the body . found in the Christiana River was that of Park Commissioner Stover , after comparing the face of . the- dead- man with the picture of Mr. Stover published in the newspapers . He , described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 5 feet 2 inches in height , weighing about 160 pounds , with thin gray hair and the front - part of the head bald . The ' man had ; a stubby gray mustache and full tace and ? blue eyes . He wore a black sack , suit . white shirt , linen collm , and black four-in-hand tie , black shot and brown socks . ' In his pockets were found no papers " ) r money , but ' only a pair of nose glasses without any case , a pair of small scissors , an Ingersoll watch , and a box of vaseline salve . He wore no ring or other jewelry . Robbin Gilman of the University Settlement , where Mr. Stover had lived since its foundation twenty-seven:years ago , said last night that the description of the body . found in Wilmington , . as furnished ' 13Y- the ' might'ron-er ' ' , t iter , - might'Well ; fit Commissioner . Stover , although , he pointed out , it would fit many other persons as well . Mr. Gilman aeseribed Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 160 pounds , tam in the front part of his head , and with thin sandy hair on . the back of his head . In this respect . as well as in regard to the gray mustache of th$ man found in Wilmington , Mr. Gilman found ground for hope that the body was not that of Mr. Stover . Commissioner Stover 's hair and mustache were both sandy . Mr. Gilman said Mr. Stover always wore dark clothes , black or blue or dark gray , and usually a dark four-in-hand tie . He was fairly certain that Mr. Stover , unlike the man found in Wilmington , wore no glasses . Mr. Gilman could not say whether Commissioner Stover carried a watch or not , but was sure he never wore a chain . If he had a watch , said Mr. Gilman , it might have been an Ingersoll . Mr. Stover wore no rings or other jewelry . Concerning the odd discovery of a tooth-brush and a pair of manicure scissors in the pockets of the dead man at Wilmington , Mr. Gilman was unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his missing friend . He said that no one at the settlement knew ? whether Mr. Stover , when he went away , took with him a traveling bag or not . In case he did not , said Mr. Gilman , it would not be surprising if he had put his tooth-brush and scissors in his pocket . Mr. Stover was one of the original founders and workers of the University Settlement , and , being a bachelor , had made that his home for twenty-seven years . He came and . went quickly , as he pleased , and for this reason no one noticed his going away some three or four weeks ago . Indeed , said Mr. Gilman. he had been unable to find any one who could fix the day when the Commissioner was last seen at the Settlement . There had been nothing that seemed to worry him when last Mr. Gilman saw and spoke to him . and when Mr. Stover went away it was regarded as quite-.a matter of course by his friends . inasmuch as-he he 'd - had no vacation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilman received a note from him ' dated'at-Philadelphia . It was a personal note , said Mr. Gilman , ' which contained no explanation why he had gone away or where he was stopping , except this one sentence : " If any one asks where I am , just say I 'm visiting other cities . " Mr. Gilman added that the note contained an inclosure. the nature of which he did not reveal . other than to say it be.d-nothing to do with Mr. Stover 's going away and was not a personal trinket or ateepsake . ' Mr. Gilman was greatly alarmed last night on learning . of " the discovery at Wilmington . He sald.he would . get into communication with the Coroner there at once- and try to learn additional details . He himself , he.said.could. think Of nothing that would take . Mr. Stover to Wilmington , - although , he added , - he knew of nothing that-might hare taken - him to Philadelphia , either . ' Louis La Roche , ? W110 , has been Acting Commissioner of Parks in Mr. Stover 's absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on Wednesday . ' The letter merely contained instructions about routine matters and papers on Mr. Stover's-desk which , Mr. Stover said , should be filed and otherwise attended to When Ira H : Patehin , secretary to Park . Commissioner . Stover , . was . told last night of the finding of the body . he ' said he thought the Coroner was mistaken . " Commissioner Stover , " he ' said , " to my knowledge did not'carry an Ingersoll watch , but a small gold . watch . ' He did not wear eyeglasses , nor did he wear spectacles . The ' height of the body of the man does not agree - very-  well with that of Mr. Stover , and Mr. Stover was not as gray as ' this man . " ? Mr. Patchin said he had received no word from Mr. Stover.
