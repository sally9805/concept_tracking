txt in the golden sunset of the waning day . Columbia , with the lightest and youngest crew On the river , after nineteen Years of stubborn persistent trying , triumphed In the ' Varsity race of the intercollegiate regatta today , when the Blue and White oar blades , working in perfect rhythm , shot the Morning-side shell over the finish line a winner In the most heartbreaking sensational race that has been seen here In years . To win Columbia had to kill off the much-flaunted Cornell crew and the Pennsylvanians , the English coached crew which for most of the way threatened to sweep all before it . The race was between these three crews , and it was the brilliant watermanship of Jim Rice 's boys , backed with hearts of iron and a fighting spirit that refused to even falter , that gave Cornell and Pennsylvania a beating that they will never forget . The other crews were away back , and nobody saw them when they finished . Syracuse was fourth and Washington . plugging along gamely , was fifth , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could . Columbia finished a whole length in front , and the time was 19:374-5 ; Pennsylvania was second in 19:41 , while Cornell 's time was 19:44 . Cornell Crowd Stunned . The result came as a stunning , shocke to the big gathering of Cornell syinpafhiters , for the Ithacans had everything their own way in the junior eights alga. the freshman race . Cornell won the junior eights , with Columbia second . Pennsylvania third , and Syracuse fourth . Cornell 's time was 11:15 2-5 . Cornell made a procession of the freshman race , winning by ten lengths , while the other crews fought it out and had a race of their own in the ruck . Syracuse was second . Pennsylvania third , Wisconsin fourth , and Columbia a bad last . The winner 's time was 10:26 . A scene like today 's has never before been seen at any aquatic event in this country . More than 30,000 persons saw the race from hillside , river bank , excursion boats , and observation trains . Never has there been such a gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everybody suffered , but the race they saw after waiting in the hot sun all afternoon was worth it . The river was thi3k with pleasure craft . There were ten big excursion steamers from New York , scores of yachts ,  --  and hundreds of motor boats . The revenue cutters were Kept busy keeping the craft back from the course . This victory of Columbia seems too good to be true . Columbia has made a great race of it here many a time before , only to see Cornell or Syracuse lift their shells into the lead at the finish . This crew of Rice 's today was different . Fine generalship was shown all the way . Every time Coxswain Wood called upon his men he got a response . The oarsmanship of the Columbia men was well-nigh perfect ; they swung in harmony , pulled the stroke through steadily . sturdily , and finished with confident grace . The Columbia shell cut the water without a hitch . It never faltered or lagged . It glided along easily , responding to the perfectly applied driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia came here in greater droves than ever before . It was not because they were confident of winning , but they knew that it was one of the most perfectly drilled eights that ever wore the colors . What these partisans were afraid of was the lack of beef and stamina in the boat . Every ounce of it was used to the best advantage and when the gruelling back-breaking moment came with the goal to sight , they rose majestically to the situation and lifted the shell over the finish line . Columbines Go Wild . The enthusiasm was a riot . During the last half mile the Columbia crowd went crazy . Undergraduates hugged their fathers and kissed their sisters . The fact that Columbia was pulling one of the greatest races in her history suddenly struck them with force . The arrogant confidence of Cornell had kept their rooting at a high pitch throughout the race . They had that cocksureness that at the finish the red boat would shoot ahead . But when in the final desperate effort at the three-and-a-half-mile mark when the Cornell coxswain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the strOke , Columbia stuck to it and refused to be headed . It was a back-breaking test then . One let-up in the dogged pull meant defeat . Both Cornell and Pennsylvania for a while thought that by sending the stroke to thirty-six that they could shake Columbia . But they were wrong . Cornell and Pennsyh'inia sending the stroke to thirty-six failed to show a spurt that would matea- the smooth , steady advance of ColtlInhi.a 's shell . With the spurt over Cornell dropped- back , first even with Penney-Ittenlai and ithen behind her . Columbia kept right ? on and increased the lead to a length . Cornell was a length behind PenrisYlVanla . Cornell had n't finished as far back as third since 1908 . This is Columbia 's second victory on the Hudson . Way back in 1895 , when the first big regatta was held aver-the Poughkeepsie-Highland course , Columbia 's crew , coached by Dr. Walter Peet , won . Since then Columbia has been second , and third , and in fact in every position . Once or twice victory has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped at the last moment until - today . This crew , captained by Irving W. Hadsell , rose magnificently to the possibilities of a great victory . . - The Start Delayed . There was a long delay in starting the race . Penn was the first crew to put In an appearance at 6:25 . It was 11:50 When ' Columbia got to the stake boat . The start was a bad one , Cornell getting away poorly after bumping the stern of her shell into her stalteboat Pennsylvania had the inside lane . The southwest breeze which wafted lazily up the river made hardly a ripple on the water . Pennsylvania got away first , and in the first quarter of a mile the nose of the blue and red shell was out in front ; at half a mile Pennsylvania was half a length in front . eiornell was rowing along bunched with Wisconsin amt Syracuse . Columbia and Washington were a bit back . but not very far . Slowly , Cornell. rowing a steady 32. pulled up second to Penn . Syracuse was . third . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing the halfmile mark , Columbia began to come up . Before the mile was- reaclied the Morningside crew was in third place , the nose of the shell showing ahead of Syracuse . ' At the mile and a half the Cornell had drawn up on Penn and Columbia was almost on even terms with Cornell . There was little to choose between the three crews , all of them rowing a 32 stroke . Wisconsin was in the ruck , but Washington was only half a length behind Columbia , and Syracuse was challenging for Washington 's position . ? Cornell and Penn were then going along stroke for stroke with ; the noses of their shells on even terms . ' Columbia was- but a few feet behind . The crowds on the boats and observation train yelled above the din of the whistles . The Penn delegation cams on a special train after they heard about the Quakers ' time row last week . They were almost insane with delight at seeing Penn giving Cornell such a great battle . The Cornell crowd was yelliCg for open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beautiful manner in which their shell v.-as gliding through the water at such a low stroke . The unison of the Columbia crew was the most perfect on the river . Coming to the two-mile mark there was little to choose between Penn , Cornell , and Columbia . From the shore it looked as if they were about even . It was a great race , and the coxswains were watching each other sharply . One thing was certain by this time : Cornell was n't going to get the jump on the others like she had done so many times before . In the lane be tween Columbia . on the outer . course , and Penn , in the inner lane , Cornell had all she could do to hold he own . After two and one-half miles h been passed these crews seemed to see-saw for the lead . First it was one , . then the other . There never was more than a few feet advantage by any one of the eights . Pennsylvania then sent her stroke up to thirty-six and forged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind and was soon on even terms again . The race was becoming such a heart-breaker that it was expected that at any moment , any one of these three crews fighting for the lead would crack . but no ! they stuck to the job like soldiers every one of them . The crews were approaching the bridge . As the shells shot under the second arch it was a toss up between Pennsylvania , Columbia , arid Cornell . " Here is where Cornell will show something ! " yelled the crowd ; " wait until they reach the bridge and then they have orders from Courtney to go out and get the rare ! " But here was once that Courtney 's orders . were disobeyed . There was a call from the coxswain to hit up the stroke . hut Cornell failed to gain anything . Behind these three the other crews were coming along at no mean gait . Washington was hitting tip a thirty-six stroke and was gaining on Syracuse . while Wisconsin was falling back . The second three crews were out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing pace of the first trio . Columbia Passes Cornell . After . shooting under the bridge the  - -  - Cautabla .. coxswain could be heard encoupaging the men . He barked something sharply at McCarthy , the . Pik stroke oar . The Columbia shell took a jump . The stroke went up to 36 , and Columbia was plainly in front of Cornell and was fast overtaking Pennsylvania . " Come on Columbia ; stick to it ; you 've got them going now ; do n't let up , " yelled the Columbia coxswain . Then began the great race between Pennsylvania and Columbia . Pennsylvania hung on for dear life . They were not beaten out yet , and even if they were defeated in the final drive no one will ever forget that this English coached crew fought it out to the bitter end without a whimper . The roars for Columbia now came from the boats and the hillsides . It was " Come on Columbia ! " thundering across the river with such volume that it almost seemed as if the Columbia crew heard it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3i-. - mile mark the real test came . Inch by inch the Columbia crew began to creep ahead . As spontaneous as a clap of thunder a cheer exploded from every side when the bow of the Columbia shell nosed out in front . The Columbia crowd an observation trains were stilled , for Cornell was now slipping back into third place . Pennsylvania was fighting in desperation , but fighting so hard that it was tearing away that last bit of stamina which would be needed in a few seconds in the final spurt for the finish . Then came Columbia 's great finish . The advantage at this time was so slight that the least mishap would have I thrown the crew out of its beautiful stride . It was the moment ' when the men would have to pull together and pull . as they never had before down over the killing course . The coxwain measured his distance welt He yelled to his fighting crew that the finish was but a. , hundred yards away . Pennsylvania fought hard as the Columbia beat- forged ahead . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to jump ahead of Cornell . The Pennsylvania stroke went to 35 , and It was enough for Cnrnell 's 54 . In vain did the Cornell crew try to win second honors , lie Pennsylvania rowing , strongly flashed over the line two lengths behind Columbia , while Cornell was about the same distance behind Pennsylvania . Back of the first three boats a pretty race was going on . but no one paid any attention to it . Syracuse was having a hard time keeping ahead of Washington . The big brawny lads from the Pacific Coast had rowed an in and out race , hitting up the strokes several times to keep in front of Syracuse , but In the last quarter mile Syracuse , last year 's winner , managed to beat out Washington . Wisconsin was in a sad plight , and pulled home in last place . Cornell wins Early Races .

Pennsylvania got away firs : in this event , with Columbia second . Cornell third , and Syracuse fourth . At the ' half mile Cornell had pulled uP on even terms with Pennsylvania , and going past the mile there was a boat 's length between Cornell and Columbia . Pennsylvania was back in third place fighting.s.long with Syracuse . None of the ereivs , not even Cornell. showed good-form , and the rowing in all the boats was more or less jerky . Cornell held the lead , although Columbia sent the stroke up to 36 near the finish . COrnell showed a length ' of open water when.the shell crossed the line ahead of Colambia , while the Pennsylvania crew was a ' length and a Varier behind CeluMbia .

But in the meantime the other crews ? were having.a hard race of It . At one and a half miles Cornell was out in front by six lengths . Pennsylvania was second , having a close scrap with Syracuse , while Columbia was fighting it out with Wisconsin . It was nip and tuck from there to the finish between , these crews . At the bridge Columbia challenged and pulled up almost on even terms with Pennsylvania and , Syracuse , and then fell helplessly in the rear . This one spurt seemed to have taken all the reserve energy out of the crew . Soon after this Lorenz , the No. 2 oar in the Columbia boat , caught a crab , and this pat the whole crew out of gear and they lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily . Cornell finished in 10:26 , while Syracuse was second , Pennsylvania third , Wisconsin fourth , and Columbia last . The Syracuse , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin shells were lapped as they finished . Scramble to Get Into Ferry . The crowd was so great on the West Shore after the races that the transportation facilities were badly crippled . The people were so anxious to get back to Poughkeepsie after the races that there was nearly a riot at the ferry slip . Several women fainted and were trampled upon . The fence guarding the runway to the ferryboat was torn down by the crowd , and it was two hours before some of the people were finally transported to the other side of the river . All kinds of craft from rickety , leaky rowboat to lumbersome tugs were used to take the people across the river . Several women ruined beautiful gowns at the river edge trying to jump into the boats ' from the rocks , and several launches were grounded after getteig near the shore . .... The Columbia crowd is having a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turned loose and the city is In the hands of the joyous , care-free crowd , which is lauding Columbia 's great victory . All the musicians in town were turned out and placed-at the head of the parade . Firecrackers and Roman candles make the place seem like the Fourth of July . The extra force of policemen are having the time of their lives in keeping the sidewalks clear , so that the women can pass . Blank-cartridge pistols are much in evidence , and the favorite pastime of the victory-crazed students is shooting them off under horses ' feet . The streets are so crowded that a runaway is impossible . It is the first time in many years that the crowd has stayed over in Poughkeepsie to see the fun . The hotels were all crowded , and a good many of the visitors did not worry about whether they would sleep in a hotel or in the park . BANQUET FOR WINNING CREW .

The Columbia crew 's victory on the Hudson will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Columbia University Club on Thursday night , , at which Coach Jim Rice and the members of the victorious crew will be the guests of honor . Plans for the banquet were started immediately after the race and it is believed that there will be a record breaking number of ' old graduates who will want to attend the dinner . The only fear of ' those pushing the project 1.9 that . they will not be able to accommodate all the Columbia graduates who wish to attend . About 2,000 Columbia graduates and undergraduates arrived from Poughkeepsie shortly before .1 o'clock this morning on the Asbury Park , a chartered steamer . The college men had a hilarious time coming ' down the river and many old athletes- and oarsmen among the party were called upon for speeches . The House Committee of the Columbia University Club sent out for yards and yards of bunting and streamers and raked up the club 's entire collection of Columbia flags last night to.decorate tile clubhouse in honor , of the Vit.tuiy Of their crew in the intercollegiate regatta .
