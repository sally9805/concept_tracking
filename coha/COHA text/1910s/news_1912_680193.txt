He said : " I formerly ran a saloon at 410 East Tenth Street , between Avenues D and C , New York City . I was born in Erding , Bavaria , two hours out of Munich , the capital . I am 36 years old and came to this country when 9 years old , with my parents .

Then I began to think seriously of him as a menace to his country , when he cried ' Thief ' at that convention . I looked upon his plan to start a third party as a danger to the country . " My knowledge of history , gained through much reading , convinced me that Roosevelt was engaged in a dangerous undertaking . I was , convinced that if he was defeated at the Fall election he would again cry ' Thief , ' and that his action would plunge the country into a bloody civil war . Dream4l Came to Rim . " I deemed it my duty , after much consideration of the situation , to put him out of the way . I was living at my home address at the time , but soon after I had a dream in which former President MclainleY appeared to me . I was told by in this dream that it was not Czolgosz who murdered him , but Roosevelt . , in this dream , told me that his blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed him so that he might become President .

" On Sept. 21 I removed to the While Hotel at 156 Canal Street , near the Bowery . I did this as my first step in a plan to kill Roosevelt . I went soon afterward to a gun store on Broadway and purchased a revolver . " I then purchased a ticket to Charleston , S. C. , and went to that city by steamer . My first plan was to catch the Roosevelt party in New Orleans , but I found that to be impossible . Starts on Colonel 's Tall . " I accordingly went to Charleston . and upon my arrival there had $300 left .

That bag is there now , " Not being able to carry out my plan in Charlestown I proceeded to Atlanta , Ga. , thence to Chattanooga , Tenn. , and from there to Evansville and Indianapolis , Ind. , and to Chicago . ?

" I came to : Milwaukee Sunday morning.and went to the Argyle , a lodging house on Third Street . I then purchased newspapers to inform myself as to Roosevelt 's whereabouts and learned on Monday that he was to " arrive at 5 o'clock . I learned also that he was to be a guest et the Gilpatriek , and managed to gain a position near the entrance where , I could shoot to kill when Rcesevolt appeared . " I am sorry 1 have caused all this trouble for the good people of Milwaukee and Wisconsin . hut I am not sorry that I carried out my plan . " Rush to Lynch When Ire was hurried to the police station from the hotel hundreds of persons followed the patrol wagon as it was driven at breakneck speed down the streets and across the Oneida Street Bridge .

As1 the man was taken from the patrol the crowd pushed forward . " Lynch him ! " was the cry again . Sergt. Robert Flood had expected a demonstration and had several patrolmen stationed along the walk so that the crowd did not try to take the man from the officers . With an officer on each side of him the man was led Into the station and up to the desk . He was then hurried into the Sergeant 's office , where he was questioned , but he positively refused to talk . Every attempt was made to get something out of the man , but for a long time it was of no avail . " Any man looking for a third term ought to be shot , " was all that the roan had to say then , but it was enough to show that he was willing to confess .
