txt Before the fourth anniversary of the inauguration of B. F. Bush as president of the Missouri Pacific-Iron Mountain Railroad system ccmes around on May 1 next , it is believed that the company 's of stirs will be so far straightened out as to permit of a reasonable assurance concerning its future . Much depends upon the successful consummation of plans - under way for the annual meeting on March 9 next , and upon co-operation of all security holders in the company 's financial rehabilitation which will , it is believed , promise a sounder basis of credit and future prosperity if this can be amicably arranged without calling in the aid of the courts . Receiverships are admittedly a costly remedy , say some of those interested in the road 's future , and Missouri Pacific security holders will at this juncture scarcely want to lose by such a drastic proceeding all the advantages that have been gained by the developments of the Fast four years . In answer to the call for proxies to be voted at the annual meeting on March 9. sent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to step into the property 's financial affairs , the responses have been encouraging and there is expectation that this committee will be in position to vote a majority of the stock at the annual meeting . It therefore appears reasonably certain that the contemplated change in the board of directors will be made . Under this . plan s ? . : Ntin or the present directors will retire to be replaced by others representing the new interests . Those who will retire are George J. Gould , Howard Gould , James Speyer . Eingdon Gould , J. G. Metcalfe . E. T. Jeffery red S. F. Pryor . Those of the present directors who will continue on the board arc Edgar L. Marston , Edward D. Adams . Edwin G. Merrill , R. Lancaster William. , B. F. flush and Finley J. Shepard . Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. will not be directly represented on the new board under the proposed plan , but a director will be chosen from each of the present bondholders ' protective committees , the first and refunding 5% bond committee and the collateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two prominent business men of New York will also be asked to serve as directors and the same arrangement will prevail In selecting the , St. Louisiana to serve on the board . Two of the St. Louis new directors will be'preaidents of leading banking institutions . in that city and the other will be a prominent business man . The financial reconstruction of the company will be taken up after the annual meeting provided the contemplated plans for rearranging the personnel of the board are . raccessfully carried out . So far , therefore , no de invite plans for the readjustment of finances have been worked out , but a fairly definite idea of the procedure that will be followed can be gathered from the letter 's of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. of last May and of January this year in which they pointed out the desirability of extending the 525,000,000 notes for one year from June I , next , and for reducing the present fixed charges by reducing funded obligations and for creating a financial machinery capable of taking care of maturing obligations and providing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise an adequate amount of capital by an issue of securities involving no interest charge and to revise the restrictions in existing mortgages so as to permit of the extension of underlying bonds . Three methods are suggested for raising the new money ; one an assessment on the stock of sufficient proportion to provate for paying off the ** notes , and the others , selling new preferred stock or income bonds . These details have not yet been determined .
