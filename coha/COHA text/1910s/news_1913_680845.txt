txt ' The Board of Arbitration appointed to settle the differences between the Eastern railroads and their conductors and trainmen filed its award yesterday afternoon in the United States District Court . Wages were increased , approximately , 7 per cent , as against about 21 per cent . asked by the men . The pay rolls of the forty-one roads concerned Will be increased about e6,000,000 , as against $18,000,000 which the granting of their entire demands would have cost The board estimates that this will involve s. total increase in the payrolls of the forty-one roads of about eighttenths of 1 per cent on their total operating expenses . The $6,000,000 will be divided among nearly 100.000 employes , averaging $60 a year or $5 a month increase . The new scale is to take effect as of Oct. 1 , 1913 , involving considerable back pay to the men . The two representatives of the railroads on the board and the two representatives of the men filed opinions dissenting on the points that went against them , but the dissent of the union men was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad men . As a matter of fact , the labor representatives - who gathered at the Hotel Manhattan to learn of the award were highly pleased when its terms were announced . A. B. Garretson . President of the Order of Railway Conductors . who , with W. G. Lee , President of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen , conducted the I case for the men , came to town just inl time for the award , and when he heard what it was he came out with his face wreathed in smiles . He would not admit that he ' had gained more than he expected , but took no pains to conceal his gratification . Elisha Lee . who handled the case for the railroads , was not about , but the dissenting opinion of the two railroad representatives . expressed elnphaticallY the view taken in his quarters . As has come to be expected in these arbitrations , the award was a compromise , and in this case it was an avowed compromise . The very machinery by which it was effected was disclosed by the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved . Nearly all of them were decided by votes of 4 to 2 . This meant that when the two neutral arbitrators , Seth Low and J cam H. Finley , agreed with the labor contention the labor men voted - with them and the railroad men against them . When Messrs Low and Finley agreed with the railroad contention , the railroad men stipporet , them and the union men voted against them . In this way a majority was obtained for each point of the award , and it was signed by all the arbitrators. despite the dissents on particular points . The award was a compromise in a broader sense , too . The men had asked for wages in the East as high as those in the West Formerly wages . were lower in the South than in the East , but recently increases in the South have put that section above the East , though still below the West . The board pr comomised the demand by wages substantially the same asawardin thoseg in the South . Hint for Higher Freight Rates . The board also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last two years of from 5 to 10 per cent. , and may have had this In mind in fixing 7 per cent . as the rate . The 7 per cent . was also related to increased cost of ' livin " , since the last wage adjustment in 1910 , which the board found was about 1 per cent . As to the contention that wages thould be as high in the East as in the I West the board confessed itself puz- I zled . It could find no reason for such a differential , but took cognizance of the prospect that any increase in the 1 East would probably be followed by a movement by the same unions to restore the differential in the West , on the ground that it had always existed . This question was disposed of by proposing that a Government commission Make an investigation to decide whether rates should be higher West than East . that the unions commit themselves definitely upon the matter , or that the unions and railroads reach an agreement about it . The other chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their requests for overtime pay at the rate of time and a half , and for time and a half and double time for work on trains hauled by two or more engines . While denying any jurisdiction on the question of higher freight and passenger rates , the board hinted strongly that its opinion was favorable to such increases , especially because of the importance of putting the railroads in condition financially to complete the installation of safety devices and the use of steel cars . The actual advances in rates of pay under the principal classifications with those heretofore prevailing and those demanded are shown in the following table : RATES PER MILE , ( CENTS . ) PASSENGER SERVICE . Present Rate Rate Rate . Demondedailmeded . Conductor 2.68 2.00 2.001 Baegageman 1.58 1.87 1.63 Flagman 1.50 1.80 I-60 1.50 1.74 1.60 Brakeman THROUGH FREIGHT .

Conductors on runs of less tnan 155 miles are to get at least $4. e0 a day . assistant conductors , $3.57 ; bag- 1 gatemen , e2.75 ; flagmen . S2.61. and ' trakemen , $2.55 . This was all that was asked for in the case of conductors , but less in the other classifications.1 // $6,000,000 AWARD TO RAILROAD MEN // The monthly guarantees , exclusive of overtime or extra service is to be $135 for conductors , $82.50 for baggagemen , $T8 for flagmen , and $70.50 for brakemen . This again is all that was asked for conductors , but less for the others . It represents an increase of $10 in the conductors ' guarantee . For special and incidental service a series of increases is given on a percentage basis , running from 4.0 to 13.2 per cent . Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trains operated by electric as well as steam engines , but for multiple unit electric service , it is decreed that where standard rates are now in force , the new standard shall obtain and where special rates exist they shall he increased according to these last percentages , but in no case shall exceed the new standard . , The wages of yard conductors and trainmen are increased 1 cent an hour , but not to exceed the Western standard . No wages are to be reduced or working rules made ' , larder by the award , where better conditions prevail , the men thus gaining their contention that standardization should be up , but not down in any case . In reaching its conclusions the board had several general questions to settle . One was the contention of the railroads that a cycle of wage increases had been completed when the firemen 's award was made . They pointed to the Increase for trainmen in 1010 , followed by the engineers ' arbitration in 1912 and the firemen 's early this year . The board held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old cycle beginning with the engineers ' case , and not the beginning of a new one . Another was the argument of the railroads that a:1 the statistics furnished by the men as to increased traffic , labor . and cost of living from 1900 to 1011 , was aside ? from the point , inasmuch as wages had been adjusted in 1910 , taking most of these facts into consideration . On this point the board agreed with the road , and took the 1010 conditions as the starting point in considering the statistics . In suggesting a determination by others of the question of a differential be ' tween East and West , the board said : " Some public authority authorized by the Congress should make an independ , ent inquiry as to whether there is any ' longer any substantial reason for the maintenance of a wage differential between the West and the East based on territorial conditions , Such an inquiry ought also to result in a recommendation if it is found that a differential ought to exist , as to what such differential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body making each inquiry should attempt to . fix wages , but only that It should make a study of the proper basis for the fixing of wages . Possibly the Industrial Commission may see its way to organize a special force to make the inquiry . " Corning to Higher Freights . " This single arbitration , following though it does the arbitrations of the engineers and of the firemen within the same territory , can do no more than carry forward by a little space the principles upon which a completely just relationship between the railroads and their employes may one day be established . The prevailing opinion of the board is that it must take the adjustment of 1910 as its starting point , and that it can not be controlled In its findings by the argument for standardization , although it may be influenced by it . The prevailing opinion of the board is that standardization as to pay and rules , as between the Eastern territory and the Western territory , is at the present time impossible . Not only is the differential between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is net clear that the policy of standardization " It is the prevailing opinion of this board that the policy urged by the men in this regard is in the large interest of the railroads as well as of the publk , so that progress should be made in this direction as fast as circumstances will permit . " Interstate railroading is characterized as a national public utility and comparison is made with the railway Post Office service , where there is no territorial differential , and the opinion is expressed that " the railroads will in the end be obliged to conform their practice to the Government practice . " " The rates which railroads are permitted to charge both for passengers and freight , " the board continues , " must in the opinion of this board he adequate ultimately in all parts of the country to permit uniform rates of pay to be paid . So believing , as to standardization , this board has done what it properly can do to standardize rates of pay between the Eastern territory and the Southern territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern al d somewhat below the Western rates . " This board has no authority to determine the passenger and freight rates to be paid in the Eastern territory ; neither is it in a position to determine whether such an increase is justified , as a matter of fact , by all of the circumstances . This board , however , believes that it must make its finding as to what is a proper rate of pay to be awarded to the conductors and trainmen as a result of this arbitration , without any reference to the dilemma in which the railroads are evidently placed by the laws which make it impossible for them to increase passenger and freight rates without the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission or of the Railroad Commissions of the various States . " To take any other view of the question would be to decide that no increase of Pay , while the laws remain as they are , can ever be made except voluntarily by the railroads . Such a decision would render arbitrations like this valueless , and It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory must continue to be rendered at existing rates of pay , even though this were to condemn the employes of the railroad to work for rates of pay which have been determined by the Most careful inquiry to be inadequate . Cheapest Freights on Earth . " At the present time a ton of freight is moved in the Eastern territory more than three miles for the value of a two-cent postage stamp . This is the cheapest railroad service to the shipper to be found on the face of the globe . In the face of such a fact it would be unjust to say that railroad employes must continue to be satisfied only with What can be paid from freight rates as low as this . " The Interstate Commerce Commission and not this Arbitration Board has the duty of determining whether the railroads can earn in addition to their other charges , without ' an increase of freight rates , the rates of pay that this board believes to be due at the present Lime to the conductors and trainmen , which rates are embodied in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called vividly to the attention I of the interstate Commerce Commission . The connection between the decrease of hazard , the danger to life and limb , through the installation of safety appliances , by the substitution of steel for wooden cars , by double tracking , by increasing railroad facilities , as railroad business increases , appears to this board to be direct and not indfreet . ' The unquestionable fact remains , that the most hopeful method of reducing the vast number of railroad Casualties and the large number of deaths due to accidents en railroads in the United States is to enable the railroads as rapidly as possible to substitute steel cars for wooden cars , air brakes for hand brakes , improved signal systems for old-fashioned systems , and the like . I ' All of these things cost in the aggregate an immense sum of money . Any Policy that would make it Impossible for the railroads to command this money would be a profound misfortune to the whole nation . Such a policy would be , bad enough in its effect upon transportation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it would be criminal , in the sense that it would Make the great army of railroad employes , who are numbered by hundreds of thousands , follow their hazardous occupation under conditions more hazard- ; ous than are necessary , and , indeed , more lilts thustishan are justifiable in a " The increasing safety of passengers ; is equally involved . No American reads the records of railroad accidents in the United States without feeling a sense of reproach , This hoard wishes to call the attention of the country to its beI lief that railroad accidents can be re , duced almost precisely in proportion to . the modernizing of the railroads and the improvement in their equipment . " New Dangers Balanced . The Board finds that the elements of risk and labor growing out of increased I size of trains and cars are practically offset by the substitution ' of steel for wooden cars and the various safety ap- ' Pliances installed . It believes , however , that there has been a certain increase in responsibility , especially upon the conductor , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it holds , comes from the increased number of engines and not to any measurable extent from the labor of trainmen and conductors . The railroads asked that extra men made necessary by full crew laws get less wages , but the board says that it is " not its function to correct mistakes of the Legislature , if such mistakes have been made . " Higher pay for overtime is rejected , because , while In other trades the employer has the option of working men overtime , the railroad has no option and can not prevent delays . Objections of Railroads and Hen . The minority report of L. E. Sheppard and D. L. Cease , representing the unions , objects to the rulings against extra pay for overtime and for work on trains hauled by several engines and the failure to fix a uniform wage rate " for the greater part of the country . " The minority report of W. W. Atterbury and A. H. Smith , Vice Presilents of the Pennsylvania and New York Central , quotes from the majority report , and intimates that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It says : " The 7 per cent . additional wages granted by this award , which will cost the railroads $0,000,000 a year , Is in addition to the $4,010,000 recently added to railway expenses through ' extra crew laws passed in this territory at the behest of these labor organizations . Thus a total of $10,000,000 annually is added to the pay of trainmen without additional service being received by the railroads or the public . " The annual burden of $6,000.000 , which the award imposes , as well as the additional $4,009.000 , must necessarily precede all fixed charges . The sum of $e , 000,000 represents toe annual interest at 5 per cent . upon $120,000,000 capital , and this annual burden is thrust upon the railroad companies at car eatisme when the public should have in ed and improved facilities and when the difficulties of raising new capital are daily increasing .

" ft has been an endless chain process , one section of the country being exploited by means of another ' railway employes previously satisfied have been stirred into restlessness by other classes of labor receiving unjustified wage increases .

The railroads affected by yesterday 's wage award , which will increase their payrolls for conductors and trainmen alone $0.000.000 a year , following an increased cost in the same service of $4,000,000 through full crew laws , are the same roads whose application for an increase in freight rates of 5 per cent .
