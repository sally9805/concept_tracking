Many envelopes containing contractors ' campaign checks , letters , and receipts will be handed to the foreman , and by to-morrow evening it is expected that the net will be drawn tight around several men of prominence in Democratic State politics . Mr. Whitman in . past investigations has made a practice of piling up indictments before placing a single man on trial . It is expected that he will follow the same course in the present investigation . In the police graft investigation fifteen men were indicted . Most of them as witnesses were used to convict the four Police Inspectors . Thus far Everett P. Fowler and James K. are the only politicians against whom indictments have been found .

Aldrich , a 1Poughkeepsie contractor , as a consideration for the payment of $17,000 due Aldrich from the State Highway Department for the construction of some State roads . Aldrich testified that he received payment of the $17,000 a few days after he paid the $1,000 to Hassett .

Mr. Whitman already has Van Alstyne 's Post Office receipt for the registered letter which carried the $1 , - 000 to Treasurer . Mr. Clark , it was learned , will return in time to present all the documentary evidence in-the case before the Grano Jury .
