txt The Ambrose Channel . My attention has been called to an unintentionally misleading statement in an , editorial article entitled " River and Harbor Improvements " in a recent issue of THE TIMES . In speaking of " Ambrose Channel , the great entrance to New York Harbor , " you say , " This new channel was made nem ? essary by the size of the great Atlantic liners of to-day , such as the Lusitanla , Mauretania , and , largest of all , the new Imperator . " From this , one might suppose that it had been decided to dredge the channel after the building of these mammoth ships was accomplished . Such , however , was not the fact . It was in the River and Harbor bill of 1898-51 ) that . the appropriation was made for the new channel . Ono of the strongest arguments put forth by my father ( the late John W. Ambrose ) when pleading for the channel before the Congressional Committees , was that the steamship companies would be induced to build vastly larger ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our country , and the commercial prestige of the Port of New York . ** death followed so soon upon the completion of the great task of securing the appropriations that he never knew how well his judgment would be vindicated by the recent building of the ocean giants above mentioned .
