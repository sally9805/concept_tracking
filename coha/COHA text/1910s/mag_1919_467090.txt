CIVILIZATION is the net result of the efforts of the human race for several hundred thousand years to make life more comfortable , interesting , and satisfying . Many experiments in this di ? rection are fruitless , but occasionally one succeeds and we inherit the sum total of the successes . Up to 1914 this world ? wide and history-long effort had met with a fair degree of success . The race had learned how to raise ample amounts of many kinds of food , and how to dis ? tribute them . The fight against cold had measurably been won . We had learned how to make warm clothes and how to build houses and keep them warm . We had learned how to do these things and still have time left over . Diffused education was helping us to learn how to enjoy leisure . We knew what was going on in the world . Life was getting interesting and promised still better things . In the general opinion of mankind , it was good to live when the storm broke in the midsummer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied the validity of all toward which we had been striving . It set up new standards and declared that darkness , cold , hunger , poverty , disease , crippling , killing , hate , orphanage , widowhood , were proper conditions of life . It en ? forced these newer ideals , at first in limited areas and then in ever-broaden ? ing circles , until , in some degree , they had permeated the life of a continent . To-day the world is full of strikes . We need not look for subtle explanations . They are the direct legitimate successors of war . They are simply carrying a step farther the newer ideals of life . They are hunger , insufficiency , and bareness of life expressing themselves , along with animplied reliance upon force rather than persuasion and orderly procedure . The very first thing war did was to create homelessness on an unparalleled scale . Homes are good things . It is not by accident that we have come to live in family groups and in settled habitations . It is because , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living , the home plan works best . It is in the home that children acquire poise , serenity , and balance , and take over unconsciously such wisdom and grace as their elders have acquired . The world has seen many migrations , for there is always a restless element in human nature , but these have been vol ? untary and in search of better things . War migrations are compulsory and to worse conditions . The refugees did not wish to leave ; they had to . The story of their going has caught the world 's sympathetic attention . We have all been made to see the family groups ? grand ? parents , mothers , children , the sick and the crippled ? hastily put together a few necessary or treasured things and start down the road . We have seen them walking footsore , burden-bearing , fall ? ing by the wayside . We know of babies born on the way , and of mothers carry ? ing new-born babies for miles . We have seen the refugees packed by main force into stilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere into the interior , hungry , filthy , weary , depressed . This happened to a million and a quarter of people in Belgium , to two millions in France , to half a million . in Italy , to three hundred thousand in Greece , to , say , three hun ? dred thousand in Serbia , to two million Armenians , except that they walked out where . Rents went up and food prices went up , and , as the refugee had no home and no land , he had to buy every ? thing , and his scanty means would not hold out . He had to take the cheapest , dampest , darkest , most uncomfortable quarters there were -- places which peo ? ple had abandoned because they were so had . Here with poor food , with little heat , sometimes no light , underclad and underfed , he did not really live ; he simply existed . Homesickness is a real handicap , and the refugee was homesick all the time . He continually contrasted his former comfortable home , steady employment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not surprising that he was not enthusiastic about the warthat his " morale " was bad . All the other war distresses ? the longing for the men who were away so long at the front , the haunting fear that they would be wounded or killed , the knowl ? edge that they had been ? all this cut more deeply into the heart of the refugee because he was already homesick , cold , hungry , and discouraged . No wonder he looked forward always to the day of homecoming . Finally it came . The war was over . It had been won . People threw up their hats and cheered . The fear of domina ? tion by a brutal enemy was removed . All would be well ! Going home was very much easier than coming away had been . It was easy to choose which things to take be ? cause there were not many from which to ehoose , and most of them they were glad to leave , anyway . They were such poor excuses and substitutes for the real comforts of home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be taken care of . They knew that the disaster which had befallen them was in no sense due to any fault of theirs , but that it was somehow vaguely connected with a successful effort to prevent the control of the world by a ruthless and brutal people . The war had been won in behalf of justice , and , of course , justice would be done to them . Nothing could make up for the sufferings already endured , but the future would be different . They had heard of wrecked houses and of devastated cities , but they felt that probably it was not so bad as that where they came from . We all know , and the world knows , only too well to what they returned . Every Sunday illustrated sup ? plement for the past four years has brought us its new pictures of devas ? tated France , devastated Belgium , and devastated this , that , and the other country , until to us in our comfortable homes they have ceased to be terrible or even to be interesting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not from the outside , but from the inside . When they returned to their former homes , things were far more out of joint than when they had arrived in the interior . Not only was nobody expecting them ; there was nobody there . There was nothing there except tumble - down houses , broken buildings of every kind , trenches across the fields , rivers of barbed wire running in every direction , and fragments of wreck and ruin every ? where . But it was home . Here they owned a bit of land ; here they had been born and reared . The hillsides , the roads , the brooks ? all spoke to them of childhood and early years . So here they would remain ; in fact , they had no ? where else to go . It was hardly a matter of choice . But surely those Powers conferring at Versailles , who were to make Germany pay , would now rebuild their homes , perhaps better than before . So almost anything would do for the present .. They began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had buried when they left . Sometimes they found an opening to the cellar and saw that the heavy brick arches which had supported the building had also withstood its fall . The cellar could be cleaned out a little and would do for the moment . They could find a few pieces of furniture here and there and might even crowd up enough to take in another family who did not have even a cellar ; or , some pieces man life . All these wrecked houses , schools , hospitals , factories , city halls , churches , had been put up to serve hu ? man needs . They represented the thought , the sentiments , and the labor of many generations who had builded themselves into these structures . When you go into a patched-up build ? ing with the windows stuffed with cloth , the door turning awkwardly on impro ? vised hinges , and into a bare room with two or three bits of broken-down furni ? ture , and find that this is the city hall and that this man sitting here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole intangible structure of human life that has been destroyed , a thing which it will be harder to rebuild than buildings . An organized community , which , little by little , took shape through centuries , has been blown to bits . This man sitting here has everything to do and nothing to do it with . He is bare ? handed and empty-handed . He has no resources and no helpers . But the entire community , bereft of everything , looks to him to make the loss good . Scores of thousands of city fathers in Europe are trying to do this superhuman task . When the invading tides rolled into Belgium , France , Italy , Greece , Ru ? mania , and Russia , not all the civilians fled before them . In fact , the great ma ? jority remained . They went into the cellars while the war tornado crashed past . When the noise died down and they cautiously came to the surface , they found themselves in a changed world . Its physical aspect might be lit ? tle changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer their own masters ; they were under the rule of an enemy army . It is bad eramigh to be a subject people in peace , it is far worse to be the sub ? ject of an enemy army in war . They could no longer be sure of anything . They had to do as they were told . All ordinary business was at a standstill . They were behind the blockade . If they raised food , it would very likely be taken from them . If they labored , it was verylikely to result in benefit to those who were trying to destroy their country . They were in a sense slaves , for they had no freedom and no rights . On suspi ? cion , they were thrown into prison ; on little or no evidence , they might be shot . Their cities were called upon to pay large sums as fines or indemnities . They had to see their factories torn down and the materials shipped away . Anything they had which the enemy wanted he took ? especially food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they suffered even more than the enemy civilians , for many of their supplies were taken and shipped to the enemy countries to eke out their failing steals . Life was no joy-ride in the oc ? cupied territory . No wonder its tubercu ? losis and child death-rates shot up to one and a half or twice what they were before . It is not easy to realize that this kind of life was the lot of six million people in Belgium , three millions in France , a million in Italy , nearly five millions in Serbia , two hundred thousand in Greece , five millions in Rumania , and twenty-two millions in Russia . In all , some forty-two millions of people lived this life of exasperation , subjection , and deprivation . From among these many millions there were selected by the enemy , as lie grew short of man-power , some hundreds of thousands , no one knows how many , for a worse fate deportation into enemy country . They were to be real slaves , or worse . From Belgium , from France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these deportations sentenced men and women to wearying , brutal labor , exposure , and generally to hard ? ships like those of army prisons . When there was also involved , as in the Near East , a desire to change the dominant national sentiment of some locality , even the children were deported , to share all the hardships of a life pointing directly toward extermination . When the war was over , the survivors walked home . We met them everywhere in Serbia ? Greeks , Albanians , and Serbs ? footsore , ragged , famished , vermin- and disease-infected . The hardships of ten million refugees in their exile , their years of unwelcome sojourn , and their decades of makeshift living during reconstruction in the war zone , and of forty-two millions in occu ? pied areas , and of hundreds of thousands deported into slavery are facts which emphasize only a beginning of the real ? ization of the newer ideals of human life introduced by war . It has always been considered that the death of a husband and father is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion has been declared to he the visiting widows and fatherless in their afflic ? tion . Now , however , instead of being a rare exception , this was to become al ? most the rule in wide areas of the world . In France , for instance , we must reckon that about 1,750,000 men have been lost . This includes the deaths from wounds , 1,400,000 , those among the " missing , " among prisoners , and army deaths from disease . It is quite impossible to arrive at the slightest conception of what a loss of one and three-quarter million men means to a country the size of France , except by living there . Simply from the point of view of the emotional strain of sorrow and mourning , its volume is beyond our powers of understanding . A comparison may help . Shortly after my return from Europe I happened to meet a neighbor living a few doors away . We chatted a moment . I remarked , casually and thoughtlessly , " 1 suppose your boys are back from France . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he turned away , " all who are coming back . We lost one . " I re ? proached myself for not having remem ? bered that this might be the case . I knew another neighbor whose son was killed in the war , and had a third friend in the same town , a city of one hundred thousand , whose son was killed in France . My first impression was that this was a large number , since only fifty thousand Americans gave up their lives in France . May Cod forgive the " only . " When one is dealing with totals of mill ? ions , fifty thousand seems but few . Un ? der any other circumstances the loss of fifty thousand American men would have seemed an unprecedented calamity ; and so it would have been . I happened to pick up the Annual of the graduating-class of the high-school and found that of the class of 1919 no less than seven ? teen had died in the service . I began to sense the extent to which the shadow of war-sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two later I read in the evening paper , in the proceedings of a memorial meeting , a list of the boys from Yonkers who had died in France . It filled nearly a column . I was astounded at its length . I made a little calculation then for the first time , as to what would be , so to speak , Yonkers ' quota of a total of fifty thousand deaths , and realized that it would be forty-five . It was appalling to think that in these few square miles of territory , and in every other group of a hundred thousand population from . Florida to Washington and from southern California to Maine , there were on an average forty-five households which , however they might rejoice at the suc ? cessful outcome of the war , were feeling that the price to them had been terribly , terribly high . The loss of fifty thousand men has brought a shade of gloom to every community in America . Then I tried to think for a moment how we should feel if we had lost our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mourning , not fifty thousand , but four and three-quarter millions , Yonkers would have lost , not a quota of forty-five , but a quota of forty-three hundred . The average loss in every city , community , and town would be ninety-five times ai.large . The shade of gloom , so to speak , would be ninety-five times as thick , the cloud ninety-five times as black ; the question whether it had been worth while ninety-five times as frequent ; the missing places in the ranks of industry , educa ? tion , agriculture , and the professions , and all along the line , ninety-five times as numerous . France lost about one-fifth of all her men between eighteen and fifty . If there were no additional work to do , four men would have to do what was previously done by five , and from these four-fifths there is still to be deducted an army of cripples and the armies keeping the watch on the Rhine , on the Danube , and in Asia . And France not only has the work which she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reconstruction so big that nothing like an adequate survey has been made of it ; so big that it has been estimated that if all the men who were formerly in the building trades were still alive and if plenty of building ma ? terials were made available for them , and if we expected them to do no build ? ing except in the devastated area , they would be occupied somewhere from fif ? teen to thirty years in rebuilding that which has been destroyed . France is literally soaked , inundated , permeated through and through , by sorrow . Serbia is even more so . Eng ? land , Russia , Italy , Belgium , Greece , Rumania , and all the enemy countries , only a little less so . Our army authori ? ties estimate the battle deaths alone at 7,582,000 . Adding deaths among the missing , among prisoners , and excess of deaths from disease in the armies , it is clear that some nine million men laid down their lives on account of the war . Each of these came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of parents and of brothers and sisters in mourning , must be counted in scores of millions . But we are only well started with this war on homes . Ten million refugees , twenty-seven millions under enemy army rule , hundreds of thousands deported , and nine million dead soldiers to he mourned by God knows how many millions of widows and orphans ? all this is only a fair start . Millions of homes have been deprived of that for which homes primarily exist . Every home is built around a cradle . War has gone very far toward emptying the cradles of VoL . CXL. ? No. 555. - 10Europe . Looking backward some dec ? ades hence , this fact and its conse ? consequences may appear as among the most serious results of the war . The figures are clear . France , with its pre-war sta ? tionary population shows the following : The full facts are even worse . In the nine invaded departments there were 141,203 births in 1913 and the falling off was much greater than elsewhere . A. million and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ births arc included in theabove figuresfrozn August , 1914 , on . The remaining population was behind the lines and births were few . In Lille , the largest city of the occupied area , the population in 1918 was one-half that of 1913 , but the births were only one-eighth as many . The deficit continued through 1918 and , to a large degree , 1919 . The total estimated war deficit of births in France is about a million and a half . Italy , a country unlike France in that its birth-rate was high , also shows a war deficit in births of about the same number . Uninvaded Britain shows nearly a million ; Bel ? gium , 350,000 ; Serbia , whose men were in exile for four years , 760,000 ; and so on . A rough estimate of the Allied countries ' shortage in babies due to the war is six or seven millions , and , if we include the Central Empires , we have an estimate for Europe of some ten millions . The consequences of this wholesale race suicide project themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious but serious results of this hiatus in the orderly sequence of age groups in the great European family . The schools , the military classes , if they still exist eighteen or twenty years from now , the number of marriages , the number of adolescents available for employment ? all will show violent fluctuations as the age groups , born in the years 1015-1920 come upon the scene . In the background a more serious question arises . We know how France 's population remained rela ? tively stationary from 1860 onward , while Germany 's nearly doubled . Sup ? pose for the next fifty years instead of France we should have to say Europe , and instead of Germany Asia or Asia and Africa . The white race is certainly very much less strong , relatively , than it was in 1914 . There is much reason to fear that this European birth deficit is due not simply to the absence of the men by reason of mobilization , but also in part to the subnormal conditions of living , such as reduced food-supply , overcrowding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue for some years and to the extent that the fall in births is due to them it , too , will continue , and the white man will thus become increasingly unequal to his world-burden , so far as numbers go . This aspect of post-war results will bear a great deal of thought . We have seen in another number that war has given a new lease of life to many plagues and pests that were well on their way toward extinction . How many additional deaths have already been thus caused among civilians , no one can say . We must include typhus and typhoid epidemics , greatly increased tuberculosis and infant death-rates , a great increase in malaria , and other simi ? lar factors . We must include influenza as at least contributed to , if not caused by , war . The excess of deaths from such causes as these in Italy and in Serbia may be tentatively estimated at 900,000 and 400,000 , respectively . Elsewhere we can not make even a tentative estimate , except that the totals will run well into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have still other accounts to settle . Something like fifty or fifty-six million men , most of them we may be sure being fathers or big brothers , were for the time being almost as effectively sepa ? rated from their families as though theywere never to return . And for many of them it was a separation for four years , broken by only very brief occasional leaves . Europe was a continent of man-less homes . Its home life was thoroughly abnormal . Ordinarily the father is the steadying as well as the supporting fac ? tor . To the children he is the superman . His miraculous strength keeps the world in order . His companionship , when he has time for it , stands out as a series of marvelous events . He , on the other hand , hears compressed into the word " Daddy " such volumes of affection , such completeness of confidence , that life takes on new meanings which draw out his greatest powers and make long hours of toil seem a negligible part of the day . The games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now there remained only the tame ones in which all the parts could be taken by children . Life was quiet and monotonous . Mother seemed very still and not much interested in anything . There was nobody to do the hard work but the old men , the women , and the older children . No interesting things could be planned . It was a dull , gray , uneventful life for , say , a hundred million children , and an anxious , wear ? ing , emotionally overstrained existence for scores of millions of wives and mothers . In the middle of Serbia , in late Decem ? ber , 1918 , I saw a company of German prisoners in a village . They had use of a fairly comfortable building with a yard around it inclosed with barbed wire . I talked with them of the war . They did not seem at all interested in the Peace Conference ; they did not care where the Kaiser was or what he was doing , or who was in control in Germlany , or what America was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives and children . They did not complain of their food , or shelter , or work . They talked and thought of only one thing ? ' home . For four long years , scores of millions of homes in Europe , instead of being centers and creators of happiness and affection , of serenity and order , were abodes of loneliness , anxiety , nervous apprehension , and , in about ten million cases , of grief beyond expression . Who can foresee the future effects of such an environment for the children of a con ? tinent ? We have spoken thus far of those who were directly affected ? refugees , resi ? dents of occupied regions , those de ? ported , widows and the - fatherless , and the families of those mobilized . But this warfare against the home permeated every community in Europe . With the able-bodied men diverted to war for four years , it needed neither blockade nor submarines to make life bare and hard , to make food , clothing , shoes , coal , wood , shelter , medical care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The entire world went in sight of hunger and in whole nations its pinch was actually felt . This falling away from the slowly and hardly won con ? dition of having enough food imme ? diately registered itself in the death records everywhere in Europe , and en ? abled disease to take a new hold upon the human family . Nobody had time to devote to building homes or schools or churches or hospitals , or to making the world a safer and brighter place for chil ? dren . It was impossible even to carry on such of these things as existed . There arc those for whom the simplification of life ? doing without servants and auto ? mobiles and having fewer courses at din ? ner ? was desirable , but such are numer ? ically a negligible minority . The great masses of mankind have never gained so much that they can afford to lose ; they have never passed beyond the simple life . For them diminution means hard ? ship , and hardship means reduced vital ? ity and efficiency . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of Europe during the later stages of the war , and still continues . How long it will continue no one may say . It is easier to tear down than to construct . The complex economic life , growth of generations , must be slowlyrebuilt . The world has more work to do than before and fewer men to do it . There is a shortage in all manufactured articles , a shortage in raw materials , a shortage in every form of transportation , a shortage in housing , and there are enormous ruined areas to be rebuilt . The prospect for a speedy regaining of the standards of living of 1914 , of such measure of comfort , well-being , edu ? cation , and enjoyment as the peoples of Europe had attained to , is not good . All those cheerful head-lines , which one will read during the next two years , to the effect that this , that , or the other country has returned to normal conditions , may be disregarded as based on misinformation , lack of in ? formation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future payment a huge debt which for an indefinite period will claim all income except that required for the most urgent of current needs . The increasing amounts which were being devoted to education , health , and in general to the enrichment and betterment of life can only be had from now on in driblets . In a hundred million homes in Europe there will he hopeless drudgery , constant and fruit ? less struggle against heavy taxation and high prices . Europe will he in the tread ? mill for decades , slowly and painfully grinding out the liquidation of war 's enormous obligations , incurred for de structive purposes . She starts her post-war career with depleted difficult of measurement as this race deterioration may be , it may easily prove to have been the most disas ? trous of all the effects of the war . Vast political , economic , and social changes caused by the war can be seen only vaguely as in process , but with no clear outcome in sight . The world will be either more democratic or more imperial ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peoples have seen big things done and are demanding that other big things be done . One can feel the swell of the tides of sweeping changes , but not their direction . These matters are for the future . Our concern is that the world faces a sea of difficulties , with depleted and deteri ? orated men . Of the causes and forms of this deterioration we have caught glimpses . Ten million people driven hu7- riedly from their homes into exile , living a makeshift life for four years , and re ? turning to a still more primitive exist ? ence for an indefinite period among the runs of their former homes ; forty-two millions subject to the rule of enemy armies ; several hundreds of thousands deported into practical slavery in enemy countries , many of them into conditions of deliberate extermination ; ten million men selected as among the fittest killed in battle or dying in army prisons or from army hardships ; millions of widows and more millions of fatherless children left to do as best they can in a world preoccupied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be guarding the slumbers of those who should take up the world 's burden a few decades hence ; millions of deaths among civilians due to war hardships and scores of millions of illnesses past , present , and to come ; fifty million homes deprived for several years of the support of fathers or brothers and of their companionship , and inundated by loneliness , anxiety , and nervous appre ? hension ; all Europe on short . rations of food , coal , clothes , shoes , and all the essentials of healthful and efficient life . War is indeed the great disaster . Earthquakes , floods , tornadoes , explo ? sions , may harm the whole population of a locality ; alcohol or vice may injure apercentage of the people of whole coun ? tries . but war can be compared only to all these things combined and sown broadcast over a continent . We may select from all these other enemies of human life their worst features , combine them into one quintessence of horror . intensify this to the nth degree , scatter it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negation of all the race has striven for through all the centuries . It denies that life is worth while . It is the en ? thronement of unreason and coercion . It is the supreme skepticism , both of man and of God . What can America do about it ? Pain ? fully little at most , but that little exceed ? ingly important . At least we can look the facts in the face . Recognizing that civilization , of which we arc part , could hardly stand another such strain , we can make it plain that we mean to do our part in guaranteeing peace , even if we have to fight for it . We can be patient with peoples who have carried , and will have to carry for a long time , burdens far beyond anything that has fallen to our lot . We can lend credit under favorable terms and conditions . We can do some minor things if we like in physical reconstruction , enough to show continuing sympathy and solidar ? ity . We can send our physicians , nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . We can prove that we are neither slackers nor quitters in the world 's greatest crisis . The things we ca n't do are to pass by on the other side , to be passive onlookers , or to give credence to the suspicion that in the re ? construction of Europe we are content to play the role of profiteers.
