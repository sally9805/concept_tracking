" HELLO , is that you , Doctor ? ? Doctor , I have got a headache . What shall I take for it ? ? Yes , please send me over something , for it is very bad . " Thus is many a physician lured into complicity for the beginning of a drug habit.Under pressure of the patient 's demand he does what he ought never to do ? he gives a drug without knowing for what malady it is to be taken , nor how long its use may be continued . The incident just referred to is not imaginary ; it has happened to me many times and happens to every busy physician every week : It is typical of the way in which the blame for drug habits has to be divided between the patient , who quite innocently asks for relief , and is indignant if he is not given it at once , and the doctor , who knows in his own soul that he ought not to give that relief , but being human , gives in to the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut to Relief On the whole , the larger share of blame rests with the doctor , for it is not wholly humanity that makes him supply the demand of his patient ; it is in part because it is easier to stifle the pain than to find out and relieve its cause . The doctor is busy . It takes far less time to prescribe a dose of acetanilid or a morphia tablet than it does to puzzle out the deep-lying causes of the patient 's suffering . Now , when to this difficulty is added the fact that the patient much prefers not to be carefully studied , and vociferates that what he wants is relief and not questions , it is often too much for the doctor 's good judgment . Yet he is older in the knowledge of suffering than his patient is , and should be wiser and more firm against the temptation of labor-saving devices , such as narcotic drugs . We are wonderfully smart at labor-saving devices in this country , but we sometimes forget that among such devices there are some which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , are temptations chiefly because they save labor ? the labor of getting one 's object by honest means . So it is with drugs which deaden pain . In the great majority of cases they save the doctor 's labor as well as the patient 's suffering for the time being , but in the long run they increase both labor and suffering for someone . Giving a drug for pain generally represents a short cut , an attempt to get " just as good an article for less money . " Now I should be the last to assert that drugs have no place in the cure of disease . I hold , on the contrary , that they are of the greatest value , and I strongly believe that narcotic drugs , such as form , when abused , these terrible drug habits , are yet great blessings to humanity when confined to their proper field . What then is the proper field for the drugs that relieve pain ? When is it legitimate to take them ? When are they sure to do harm ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the group of drugs of which acetanilid and morphin are the types has great value for the immediate relief of some pain which is not apt to recur frequently , or of some painful disease which the doctor knows will be brief . In emergencies , in attacks of pain which , like gall-stone colic , may be relieved at once by the drug and then attacked more radically by surgical means , morphin is rightly given . But neither morphin nor any other drug should be given for any long period of time except in the very rarest instances . Drugs which are taken over long periods are either needless or harmful in the vast majority of cases . I have known people who took some one of the harmless and practically inert popular remedies for years and suffered no greater injury than a certain waste of money . This is stupid and extravagant , but nothing worse . On the other hand , when powerful drugs such as those already mentioned are taken over long periods , they do harm in 999 cases out of a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they often produce disease . Here is an example . A middle-aged married woman consulted me in 1904 for long-standing headaches which had been present , off and on , for five years . Her attending physician , in consultation with whom I saw her , was much troubled about a supposed disease of the heart which he could not understand or cure . But he was totally  | unaware of the fact that , during the whole of the five years of her suffering from headaches , she had been ordering " headache powders " from the apothecary just as she ordered baking powder from the grocer . Her husband brought home a box of " headache powders from the local druggist once or twice a week . She had never been given any prescription for these powders , but had stopped in at the apothecary 's and asked for something to cure a headache . The druggist , whom we will call Mr. Slick , had given her Slick 's Headache Powders , a concoction of his own , of which the essential ingredient was acetanilid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred grains a week of this drug for some months . As a result of it she had seriously impaired the quality of her blood , bringing about a chemical change in it which took months to cure ; she had also brought on a very troublesome , though curable , weakness of the heart . And most important of all , she had not cured her headaches . In fact , nothing cured those headaches until the drug was stopped . But , and here is my point , when the drug which was supposed to cure the headaches , and which had relieved them , was thrown away once for all , she gradually began to have less and less headaches and finally overcame them altogether . In other words , the original cause of the headache had long since died out , and but for the drug she would long since have been free from pain ; but the drug itself had produced bad conditions of the heart and blood which were enough to keep up the headache after its original cause had passed . Thus the drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wont to do . Turns Good to Evil This is a very essential point for every man and woman to know , namely , that the drugs which temporarily relieve pain also produce pain when they are taken continuously . The drugs which are such a blessing to us for temporary relief become a curse by producing the very pain which at first they relieved . Whenever the general public gets a little wiser in these matters , as it is sure to do as a result of all the magazine articles that are now appearing , people will realize that headache and most other pains have a very good side to them , and are not by any means pure evils . They are good because they are danger signals that tell us that there is something wrong , like the ' signal bombs which explode under a railway train and warn the engineer of approaching danger . Most pains are of great value if we will-take them as warnings . They are nature 's signal that we must stop and change something in our lives . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates , in the vast majority of cases , no local disease , but mistaken habits of life which must be reformed . The local pain is an indication that the system , which has long been racked , now shows its strain at the weakest point . Merely to smother the pain with a narcotic is like sitting on the safety valve . It may be right to take a drug to relieve the pain , but this must only be the first step in a searching examination of the patient and her way of life . Probably she does not get enough sleep , she skips her meals , or she overeats ; she has acquired the worrying habit or someone else has acquired the nagging habit . Somewhere within the machinery of life there is friction which must be relieved if we are to get at the root of the trouble . If it were not for these danger signals which we feel as pains , we might swiftly arrive at an incurably worn-out condition of one or many organs . Pains as Signals In most instances careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tempted to ask and the doctor to prescribe a drug , there is somewhere a blunder in life , ? a hygienic blunder , an industrial blunder , a domestic blunder but one resulting in any case in a general oversensitiveness whereby nerves cry out in pain instead of simply transmitting their messages as they should do . Normal nerves are like telegraph wires and silently do their work of carrying information from the world to the brain , and from the brain to the world . But if we have been through several sleepless nights or if we have been subject to the torture of worry or the strain of long-continued undernourishment or malnutrition , these same nerves record as pain what otherwise they would record as fact . For instance : The door slams ; your auditory nerve informs you of the fact which you may be glad to know , or may let pass unnoticed . But now suppose you are keyed up and oversensitive by reason of some one of the hygienic mistakes just referred to . Then  | the slam of the door gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The effort of standing and walking , of listening , talking ; buying and selling , always involves the passing of many painless and useful messages along our nerve fibers , but if we are overstrained , these same acts involve pain each time such a message passes . The lesson of all this is that in the vast majority of cases we must amend our lives and change our habits , straightening out our blundering ways of living so as to get rid of this oversensitive condition of our nerves before we shall get rid of most of our pains . The worst thing we can do is to stifle the cries of nature which tell us that we are living wrongly . Narcotic drugs taken continuously are just such an effort to stifle the stern but kindly voice of nature . We should listen , learn its bidding and obey . Alcohol No Stimulant The acetanilid habit which I have just exemplified in the story told above , is rather rare . Of all narcotic drugs , that which is most frequently taken and which most frequently leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulant , though it will be a long time before people get over considering it so . It never stimulates anything or anybody . It always puts to sleep one or more of our faculties . It may put to sleep our sense of decency and our power of restraint so that we become abnormally lively and vivacious . It may put to sleep our power of muscular control , so that we reel in walking , and mumble our words when we try to talk . Finally , it may produce an actual stupor when the individual , as we say , is " dead drunk . " All of these familiar changes are stages in one and the same process of stupefying ourselves , and many a poor sufferer has found out for himself that a drink of whiskey will stifle pain , physical as well as mental . It drowns stomach-aches as well as heartaches , and I have known a number of alcoholics who acquired the habit through the effort to subdue pain sufficiently to let them work unhampered . Doubtless alcohol is the commonest of narcotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partly because it is so commonly used on the table , and rarely thought of as a drug at all ; but still more , I think , because its use is often a part of sociability and kindly human intercourse . Its use is bound up with some of the best impulses and feelings in our nature . Morphin , on the other hand , is less easily obtained , is never taken as a help to sociability , and nourishes a secret and furtive habit , not a generous and sociable one . The effects of opium on character are even more destructive than those of its twin narcotic , alcohol . Many an alcoholic remains truthful throughout his life , but practically every morphin fiend is a liar . We have all known alcoholics who were full of generous and kindly feelings , but most morphinists become selfish and mean . Both alcohol and morphin make people unreliable . Even though they may be able to conceal the habit , it becomes known of any person who takes alcohol or opium that he can not be relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has undertaken . Alcoholics get fat and morphinists thin , and on the whole the sufferings of the morphinists are far the greater . Morphin is taken not because it procures any ecstatic delight , or , indeed , any positive pleasure at all , but merely because all life is hellish torture without it . The cocaine habit is rarer . The drug is the main ingredient of many throat sprays , cough lozenges , snuffs and pastilles used for asthma , catarrh , and similar troubles . The remedy may be originally prescribed by a physician and then continued by the patient without the physician 's orders and without his knowledge , or it may be bought direct from the druggist without a prescription . In some states the use of this drug has been considerably limited by legislation , even in places where attempts to curtail the liquor traffic by similar methods have been total failures . In a Dilemma What , then , shall we do about it ? How shall we avoid , so far as we can , the evils which I have sketched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never take any drug without a doctor 's orders . The habit of going to an apothecary and asking for something to cure a pain or a cough or some other symptom is a very harmful one . In the great majority of cases , if the apothecary is honest he knows that it is not safe for him to give any powerful drug because he does not know what disease he is dealing with ; he knows only the symptom which the customer tells him of . He wishes to be on the safe side , and therefore prescribes some harmless and usually quite useless drug . This is a waste of the customer 's money and per- haps nothing worse , but it gets people into the habit of thinking that they need a drug for every symptom ? a most unfortunate and pernicious habit . If , on the contrary , the apothecary gives a drug which might do good , he is taking a serious risk , for , as he does not know what really ails you , he is quite as likely to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real benefit . Any drug which is powerful enough to help the patient is also strong enough to hurt him . Most common ailments get well without any treatment , without any drugs , but many people never give themselves the opportunity to find this out . They always insist on swallowing some drug , and when the disease goes off in spite of the drug , they attribute their recovery to the medicine . Or , perhaps , they go on taking the medicine indefinitely supposing that they depend upon it and can not get along without it ; whereas it may be some perfectly inert substance , that is , a bread pill or its equivalent . If , on the other hand , the drug is taken to relieve pain and has any real power in that direction , it is almost certain to be abused , and very likely to lead us toward one of the fearful drug habits referred to above . But suppose one has a pain and can not get a doctor ; what is he to do ? Is he to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , but the only remedies that should be used without a doctor 's supervision are the local remedies such as heat , cold , a poultice , or mustard . It is always safe to use an ice bag or a hot-water bag for headache or any other pain , and in many cases one gets relief in this way . If these are not convenient or not obtainable , a mustard leaf , such as is to be had from any apothecary , often gives similar help . A package of mustard leaves should be a part of every housewife 's store . A flaxseed poultice , changed as often as it cools , will render pain bearable in many cases for hours at a time . Remedies of this kind never do any harm and may often render the visit to the doctor unnecessary . Use Caution and Common Sense No prescription given by a doctor should ever be refilled and its use continued without his advice . To continue a drug without medical advice is just ' as imprudent as to take it without medical advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , it is worth while to be sensible in following the spirit as well as the letter of his directions If a stock broker tells you to buy Atchison now , you do not conclude , if you are sensible , , that he means you to go on buying it in definitely . His advice is given to hit a par-V ticular situation which he sizes up at thine moment to be such that buying is good policy . He is expert just because he canrecognize the right moment and advise accordingly . So it is with the doctor if he is , worth consulting at all . In the rare instances where a physician= prescribes morphin , cocaine or alcohol , andorders it continued over any period longer than a few days , he ought to be strictly catechized by his patient as to possible dangers of the drug which he is advising . The patient should make the doctor say why , in this very special instance , the drug is not dangerous ; why it does not threaten to produce a habit if taken as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one 's doctor in a matter of this kind . If he is worth his salt he will be glad to explain . Any doctor who is chary about explaining this or any other matter should not deserve our confidence . I can not honestly say that I expect that the advice I have given in this paper will prevent many people from acquiring drug habits , for it is not the advice of any physician that withholds people from such tendencies in the vast majority of cases . The thing that keeps people straight in this respect , as in other respects , is either an interest in life and work ( which I can not pump into anyone , nor give effectively in a magazine article ) , or the contagion of personality . If one has not a strong interest in life , nothing keeps him on the straight path except accident or the grace of God , which acts most often through the free gift of the friendship of someone great enough to make our life worth living despite discouragement , discontent with our lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as drives people to drink or its equivalent . From the educational point of view this means that the best prevention of drug habits is the cultivation in and after school of some genuine interest in one 's work or outside one 's work . The modern movements for vocational education in school , and vocational guidance . at the end of school , ought to be a genuine help in this direction . Better still is the cultivation of those lifegivers and life-savers , friends .  |
