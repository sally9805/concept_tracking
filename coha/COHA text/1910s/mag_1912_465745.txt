WE want to ask many people to dinner ? at least I do ? and do ask a good many , first and last , in spite of restricted space and our other restrictions . About four besides ourselves is our limit , and that 's a dinner party . More often I bring home a man , or a married pair of our generation come in and bring new topics and points of view , and sometimes news , into our discourse . People seem willing enough to come to dinner if you have something to eat in the house and something to say . I sometimes wish we had more dinner-parties , but the doctrine of compensation comes in on that , for , I suppose , if we were rich enough to have people to dinner whenever we wanted , we would have to dine out the rest of the time , and the upshot of it would be that we would never have time to read up anything really good to say . But we do dine out considerably as it is , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers ( and also when it does n't ) with meat , drink , and affection , but also with our friends , both those who live somewhat near our economic plane , and those who move and have beings in planes much more exalted and profuse . For example , we dine sometimes with Major and Mrs. Brace , indulgent elders of whom I have so often spoken , and who , I think , are disposed to assume some restricted but affectionate responsibility for our successful progress through this vale of dues . We are on such terms with that family that Mrs. Brace has a habit of telephoning to Cordelia please to come and fill in at a dinner-party when a. pair of guests give out at the last moment , which we do , when we can , with cheerfulness of spirit . Then the Major bestows little jobs of law business on me from time to time , and is apt to say " Come to dinner , and talk it over , and fetch Cordelia . " And then we talk other things over also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one of Mrs. Brace 's dinners we filled in at was unusually well-stocked with persons apt at discussion , and the talk took a turn toward the education of women , and more particularly the education of daughters of well-to-do parents in New York . On the general subject I do n't see that there is much to discuss . The prevailing practice is to teach girls up to eighteen or nineteen years of age anything that they will consent to learn , the same as boys . The girls do n't go to college yet as generally as the boys do , but they go a good deal , and more and more , I should say , all the time . The girls ' colleges prosper and increase in number and in size , but the authorities seem to feel that they have not yet fully struck their gait ; not yet established themselves as the best places for girls in general between eighteen and twenty-two , and not yet demonstrated to the satisfaction of all the observant and considerate that the training they give fulfils its aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire it or might acquire it than some other things that some of them are or might be doing in those four years if they were not doing that . You may say that the same reluctance of unrestricted approval attaches to the boys ' colleges . There was Mrs. Poteat who felt so strongly that Yale was one of the more popular gates of hell , and the late Mr. Crane , of Chicago , who maintained that our whole system of college education was pernicious and a shocking waste of time , and Dr. Wilson , late of Princeton , who felt so strongly that the college side-shows , athletic and social , had diverted to themselves the stronger currents of young life , to the great detriment of the academic performance in the main tent , and who did what he could to bring them back . Certainly the boyg ' colleges arc imperfect enough , and are conceded both by their friends and their detractors to be so , but at a park official 's perilous and successful vendetta against the forces of graft . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curving , tree-Iined miles , varied by a jolting section , or by the faint odor of the Stockyards , or by a halt to allow the longest freight-train in the world to cross your path . You have sighted in the distance universities , institutions , even factories ; you have passed through many inhabited portions of the endless boulevard , but you have not actually touched hands with the city since you left it at the beginning of the ride . Then at last , as darkness falls , you feel that you are coming to the city again , but from another point of the compass . You have rounded the circle of its millions . You need only think of the unkempt , shabby , and tangled outskirts of New York , or of any other capital city , to realize the miracle that Chicago has put among her assets . . . . You descry lanes of water in the twilight , and learn that in order to prevent her drainage from going into the lake Chicago turned a river back in its course and compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story . You feel that it is exactly what Chicago , alone among cities , would have the imagination and the courage to do . Some man must have risen from his bed one morning with the idea , " Why not make the water flow the other way ? " And then gone , perhaps diffidently , to his fellows in charge of the city with the suggestive query , " Why not make the water flow the other way ? " And been laughed at ! Only the thing was done in the end ! I seem to have heard that there was an epilogue to this story , relating how certain other great cities showed a narrow objection to Chicago draining herself in the direction of the Mississippi , and how Chicago , after all , succeeded in persuading those whom it was necessary to persuade that , whereas her drainage was unsuited to Lake Michigan , it would consort well with the current of the Mississippi . And then , in the night and in the rain , you swerve round some corner into the straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most dazzling spectacles that Chicago or any other city can offer ? Michigan Avenue on a wet evening . Each of the thousands of electric standards in Michigan Avenue is a cluster of six huge globes ( and yet they will tell you in Paris that the Rue de in Paix is the best-lit street in the world ) , and here and there is a red globe of warning . The two lines of light pour down their flame into the pool which is the roadway , and you travel continually toward an incandescent floor without ever quite reaching it , beneath mysterious words of fire hanging in the invisible sky I . . . The automobile stops . You get out , stiff , and murmur something inadequate about the length and splendor of those boulevards . " Oh , " you are told , carelessly , " those are only the interior boulevards . . . Nothing ! You should see our exterior boulevards ? not quite finished yet ! " will reveal to me the blindness , the distortions , and the wrong-headedness of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle differences between New York and Chicago . As one who was brought up in a bleak and uncanny climate , where soft-coal is in universal use , I at once felt more at home in Chicago than I could ever do in New York . The old instinct to wash the hands and change the collar every couple of hours instantly returned to me in Chicago , together with the old comforting conviction that a harsh climate is a climate healthy for body and spirit . And because it is laden with soot , the air of Chicago is a great mystifier and beautifier . Atmospheric effects may be seen there that are unobtainable without the combustion of soft coal . Talk , for example , as much as you please about the electric sky-signs of Broadway ? not all of them together will write as much poetry on the sky as the single word " Illinois " that hangs without a clue to its suspension in the murky dusk over Michigan Avenue . The visionary aspects of Chicago are incomparable . Another difference , of quite another order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York is not no metropolis ever is . You are aware of the self-consciousness of Chicago as soon as you are aware of its bitumen . The quality demands sympathy , and wins it by its wistfulness . Chicago is openly anxious about its soul . I liked that . I wish I could see a livelier anxiety concerning the municipal soul in certain cities of Europe . Perhaps the least subtle difference between New York and Chicago springs from the fact that the handsomest part of New York is the center of New York , whereas the center of Chicago is disappointing . It does not impress . I was shown , in the center of Chicago , the first sky-scraper that the world had ever seen . I visited with admiration what was said to be the largest department store in the world . I visited with a natural rapture the largest book-store in the world . I was informed ( but respectfully doubt ) that Chicago is the greatest port in the world . I could easily credit , from the evidence of my own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . But still my imagto a European , is the most disconcerting factor in the social evolution of your States . I have sat and listened to tales from journalists and other learned connoisseurs till ? But enough ! When I left New York and went to Washington , I was congratulated on haying quitted the false America for the real . When I came to Boston , I received the sympathies of everybody in Boston on having been put off for so long with spurious imitations of America , and a sigh of happy relief went up that I had at length got into touch with a genuine American city . When , after a long pilgrimage , I attained Chicago . I was positively informed that Chicago alone was the gate of the United States , and that everything east of Chicago was negligible and even misleading . And when I entered Indianapolis , I discovered that Chicago was a mushroom and a suburb of Warsaw , and that its pretension to represent the United States was grotesque , the authentic center of the United States being obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affront one another , and their demeanor in the game resembles the gamboling ofyoung tigers -- it is half playful and half ferocious . For myself , I have to say that my heart was large enough to hold all I saw . While I admit that Indianapolis struck me as very characteristically American , I assert that the unreality of New York escaped me . It appeared to me that New York was quite a real city , and European geographies ( apt to err , of course , in matters of detail ) usually locate it in America . Having regard to the healthy mutual jealousy of the great towns , I feel that I am carrying audacity to the point of foolhardiness when I state that the streets of every American city I saw reminded me on the whole rather strongly of the streets of all the others . What inhabitant of what city could forgive this ? Yet I must state it . Much of what I have said of the streets of New York applies , in my superficial opinion , for instance , to the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Westerners look alike . No tourist on his first visit to a country so astonishing as the United States is very different from a Chinaman ; the tourist should reconcile himself to that deep truth . It is desolating to think that a second visit
