txt A man who usually A Defense shows a clear appreciaof the tion of the difference Indefensible . between right and wrong was talking yesterday about the practice of hiring newsdealers to place In the papers they distribute circulars advertising the wares of merchants who do not care to pay the regular advertising rates . To the mingled grief and astonishment of one of his hearers , this man not only defended the Practice , but admitted , without any signs of compunction , that he had himself resorted to it as an economical method of increasing the sales of a big store in which he is himself interested . As justification of what he had done the man said that , as his store is in the Bronx Borough , and as all his patronage comes from the inhabitants of that region , he could get no possible advantage from the greater part of a New York paper 's circulation , and therefore could not afford to pay for space a price based on the size of that paper 's whole issue . This statement may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent , but the man 's deduction from it ? that " therefore " he had a right to get fol ' the few cents he paid the newsdealer what it would have cost him more than as many dollars to get from the papers he thus used ? is evidently pure sophistry , as dishonest as it is illogical . The facts as he stated them may or may not make it injudicious for him to buy space in the papers he mentioned ; that is for him to decide , and , whatever his decision , nobody could or would criticise him . He has , too , complete warrant for obtaining the publicity he wants In any one of half a dozen other ways through which he can reach his customers . But those facts obviously give him no right or excuse for getting at least a part of the various advantages that come from advertising in the big papers , and not paying those papers anything at all for what costs them so much  --  for what anybody is free to take or leave , acCord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the price demanded . He argued that the papers in which his circulars were placed were not injured , because they lost nothing they had or could get . That , also , is sophistical , for the reason , among others , that it is of importance to the reputation as well as to the profits of a newspaper that it should control its advertising , and be able to refuse that of which it disapproves . In short , the man ' was blinded by self-interest to the wrong he has been committing . Of course he Is not the only one upon whom that misfortune has fallen , and probably he will not be the last . Bar Harbor , af ter " Insular " having for years nourMinds ished a violent . antagonEnlightened , the automobile , E and barred from its little kingdom every kind of engine-moved vehicles , has at last decided that it can not afford longer to deprive ' its own people , and the highly profitable Summer folk out of whom the natives live , of a means of locomotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessity for everybody , at least a near-necessity for a considerable part of the general population . Of course Bar Harbor could n't maintain forever its absurd proscription of motor cars . The only reason for its struggling against the inevitable seems to be that Bar Harbor is an island . Life on an island has a mysterious effect on the human mind , producing a constitutional dislike or fear of anything new , of changes from old ways . It is on islands , therefore , that the automobile has had to overcome the greatest amount of prejudice , and the smaller the island , the fiercer and more persistent the prejudice . Bar Harbor , being nowadays so dependent upon " transients " as to be largely ruled by them , has naturally yielded sooner that Prince Edward Island , where there is seemingly no present prospect of raising the silly ban , but in Bermuda , where conditions are apparently much the same as in Bar Harbor , the prohibition still stands . In defending their course , the islanders usually talk much about the narrowness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of quietude which , for this purpose alone , they claim to have . Where roads are narrow , there is , indeed , a special need for the strict regulation of automobiles , but with that they are no more dangerous than elsewhere . As for the alleged love of quiet , that , of course , is all nonsense . Islanders are as noisy as anybody else . In Prince Edward Island the people seem never to have recovered from the shock they suffered , years ago , when the first-automobile that was taken there scared a horse , one Sunday morning , and caused a runaway that landed an eminent resident and his family in the - ditch instead of on the church steps . The Bar Harborers , now that , they are reconciled to the presence of the automobile , find themselves under the necessity of getting the Legislature to repeal certain , exelmtinn .. , laws which they themeelses Alta . trouble to get passed for 5v44. -1,4ftuukOatut-ta b pair .

For even this much of approval a correaPliindent very justly criticises us , and he cat:vela repentance and retraction by reminding us that long before the Navy Department made its venture into constructive linguistics the doctors had invented and used these same words in their work with radium . That is a conclusive argument , and the sailor scientists will have to try again .
