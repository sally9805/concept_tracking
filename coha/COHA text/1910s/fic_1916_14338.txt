During the action of the play not a word is uttered aloud . All of the speeches of the characters are supposed to be unspoken meditations only . A large , gloomy hall , with many rows of uncushioned , uncomfortable seats , designed , it would seem , by someone misinformed as to the average width of the normal human pelvis . A number of busts of celebrated composers , once white , but now a dirty gray , stand in niches along the walls . At one end of the hall there is a bare , uncarpeted stage , with nothing on it save a grand piano and a chair . It is raining outside , and , as hundreds of people come crowding in , the air is laden with the mingled scents of umbrellas , raincoats , goloshes , cosmetics , perfumery and wet hair . At eight minutes past four , THE JANITOR , after smoothing his hair with his hands and putting on a pair of detachable cuffs , emerges from the wings and crosses the stage , his shoes squeaking hideously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens it with solemn slowness . The job seems so absurdly trivial , even to so mean an understanding , that he ca n't refrain from glorifying it with a bit of hocus-pocus . This takes the form of a careful adjustment of a mysterious something within the instrument . He reaches in , pauses a moment as if in doubt , reaches in again , and then permits a faint smile of conscious sapience and efficiency to illuminate his face . All of this accomplished , he tiptoes back to the wings , his shoes again squeaking . A JANITOR Now all of them people think I 'm the professor 's tuner . The thought gives him such delight that , for the moment , his brain is numbed . Then he proceeds . I guess them tuners make pretty good money . I wish I could get the hang of the trick . It looks easy . By this time he has disappeared in the wings and the stage is again a desert . Two or three women , far back in the hall , start a half-hearted hand-clapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustling programs and shuffling feet succeeds it. p. 3 FOUR HUNDRED OF THE WOMEN Oh , I do certainly hope he plays that lovely Valse Poupe as an encore ! They say he does it better than Bloomfield-Zeisler . ONE OF THE CRITICS I hope the animal does n't pull any encore numbers that I do n't recognize . All of these people will buy the paper to-morrow morning just to find out what they have heard . It 's infernally embarrassing to have to ask the manager . The public expects a music critic to be a sort of walking thematic catalogue . The public is an ass . THE SIX OTHER MEN Oh , Lord ! What a way to spend an afternoon ! A HUNDRED OF THE WOMEN I wonder if he 's as handsome as Paderewski . ANOTHER HUNDRED OF THE WOMEN I wonder if he 's as gentlemanly as Josef Hofmann . STILL ANOTHER HUNDRED WOMEN I wonder if he 's as fascinating as De Pachmann . YET OTHER HUNDREDS I wonder if he has dark eyes . You never can tell by those awful photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he can really play the piano . ONE OF THE CRITICS What a hell of a wait ! These rotten piano-thumping immigrants deserve a hard call-down the piano manufacturers are not afraid to advertise . If you knock them too hard you have a nasty business-office row on your hands . p. 4 ONE OF THE MEN If they allowed smoking , it would n't be so bad . ONE OF THE MEN I wonder if that woman across the aisle  --  THE GREAT PIANIST bounces upon the stage so suddenly that he is bowing in the center before anyone thinks to applaud . He makes three stiff bows . At the second the applause begins , swelling at once to a roar . He steps up to the piano , bows three times more , and then sits down . He hunches his shoulders , reaches for the pedals with his feet , spreads out his hands and waits for the clapper-clawing to cease . He is an undersized , paunchy East German , with hair the color of wet hay , and an extremely pallid complexion . Talcum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat pink . His eyebrows are carefully penciled and there are artificial shadows under his eyes . His face is absolutely expressionless . THE VIRGIN Oh ! THE MARRIED WOMAN Oh ! THE OTHER WOMEN Oh ! How dreadfully handsome ! THE VIRGIN Oh , such eyes , such depth ! How he must have suffered ! I 'd like to hear him play the Prlude in D flat major . It would drive you crazy ! A HUNDRED OTHER WOMEN I certainly do hope he plays some Schumann . p. 5 OTHER WOMEN What beautiful hands ! I could kiss them ! THE GREAT PIANIST , throwing back his head , strikes the massive opening chords of a Beethoven sonata . There is a sudden hush and each note is heard clearly . The tempo of the first movement , which begins after a grand pause , is allegro con brio , and the first subject is given out in a sparkling cascade of sound . But , despite the buoyancy of the music , there is an unmistakable undercurrent of melancholy in the playing . The audience does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I could love him ! Paderewski played it like a fox trot . What poetry he puts into it ! I can see a soldier lover marching off to war . ONE OF THE CRITICS The ass is dragging it . Does n't con brio mean  --  well , what the devil does it mean ? I forget . I must look it up before I write the notice . Somehow , brio suggests cheese . Anyhow , Pachmann plays it a damn sight faster . It 's safe to say that , at all events . THE MARRIED WOMAN Oh , I could listen to that sonata all day ! The poetry he puts into it  --  even into the allegro ! Just think what the andante will be ! I like music to be sad . THE MARRIED WOMAN What a sob he gets into it ! p. 6 MANY OTHER WOMEN How exquisite ! THE GREAT PIANIST Gathering himself together for the difficult development section . That American near-beer will be the death of me ! I wonder what they put in it to give it its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over here  --  du heiliger Herr Jesu ! Even Bremen would be ashamed of it . In Mnchen the police would take a hand . Aiming for the first and second C 's above the staff , he accidentally strikes the C sharps instead and has to transpose three measures to get back into the key . The effect is harrowing , and he gives his audience a swift glance of apprehension . TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY WOMEN What new beauties he gets out of it ! ONE OF THE MEN He can tickle the ivories , all right , all right ! ONE OF THE CRITICS Well , at any rate , he does n't try to imitate Paderewski . THE GREAT PIANIST Relieved by the non-appearance of the hisses he expected . Well , it 's lucky for me that I 'm not in Leipzig to-day ! But in Leipzig an artist runs no risks : the beer is pure . The authorities see to that . The worse enemy of technic is biliousness , and biliousness is sure to follow bad beer . He gets to the coda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 7 THE VIRGIN How I envy the woman he loves ! How it would thrill me to feel his arms about me  --  to be drawn closer , closer , closer ! I would give up the whole world ! What are conventions , prejudices , legal forms , morality , after all ? Vanities ! Love is beyond and above them all  --  and art is love ! I think I must be a pagan . THE GREAT PIANIST And the herring ! Good God , what herring ! These barbarous Americans  --  THE VIRGIN Really , I am quite indecent ! I should blush , I suppose . But love is never ashamed .  --  How people misunderstand me ! THE MARRIED WOMAN I wonder if he 's faithful . The chances are against it . I never heard of a man who was . An agreeable melancholy overcomes her and she gives herself up to the mood without thought . THE GREAT PIANIST I wonder whatever became of that girl in Dresden . Every time I think of her , she suggests pleasant thoughts  --  good beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in love with her  --  not much , of course , but just enough to make things pleasant . And not a single letter from her ! I suppose she thinks I 'm starving to death over here  --  or tuning pianos . Well , when I get back with the money there 'll be a shock for her . A shock  --  but not a Pfenning ! p. 8 THE MARRIED WOMAN Her emotional coma ended . Still , you can hardly blame him . There must be a good deal of temptation for a great artist . All of these frumps here would  --  THE VIRGIN Ah , how dolorous , how exquisite is love ! How small the world would seem if  --  THE MARRIED WOMAN Of course , you could hardly call such old scarecrows temptations . But still  --  THE GREAT PIANIST comes to the last measure of the coda  --  a passage of almost Haydnesque clarity and spirit . As he strikes the broad chord of the tonic there comes a roar of applause . He arises , moves a step or two down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his hands to his heart . THE GREAT PIANIST Bowing . I wonder why the American women always wear raincoats to piano recitals . Even when the sun is shining brightly , one sees hundreds of them . What a disagreeable smell they give to the hall . More applause and more bows . An American audience always smells of rubber and lilies-of-the-valley . How different in London ! There an audience always smells of soap . In Paris it reminds you of sachet bags  --  and lingerie . The applause ceases and he returns to the piano . And now comes that verfluchte adagio . As he begins to play , a deathlike silence falls upon the hall. p. 9 ONE OF THE CRITICS What rotten pedaling ! ANOTHER CRITIC A touch like a xylophone player , but he knows how to use his feet . That suggests a good line for the notice  --  " he plays better with his feet than with his hands , " or something like that . I 'll have to think it over and polish it up . ONE OF THE MEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE VIRGIN Suppose he ca n't speak English ? But that would n't matter . Nothing matters . Love is beyond and above  --  SIX HUNDRED WOMEN Oh , how beautiful ! THE MARRIED WOMAN Perfect ! ONE OF THE CRITICS Sinking quickly into the slumber which always overtakes him during the adagio . **35;1885;TOOLONG ! ANOTHER CRITIC There is that old fraud asleep again . And to-morrow he 'll print half a column of vapid reminiscence and call it criticism . It 's a wonder his paper stands for him . Because he once heard Liszt , he THE GREAT PIANIST That plump girl over there on the left is not so bad . As for the rest , I beg to be excused . The American women have no more shape than so many matches . They are too tall and too thin . I like a nice rubbery armful  --  like that Dresden girl . Or that harpist in Moscow  --  the girl with the Pilsner hair . Let me see , what was her name ? Oh , Fritzi , to be sure  --  but her last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to try to think of it , and send her a post-card . p. 10 THE MARRIED WOMAN What delicious flutelike tones ! THE MARRIED WOMAN If Beethoven could only be here to hear it ! He would cry for very joy ! Maybe he does hear it . Who knows ? I believe he does . I am sure he does . THE GREAT PIANIST reaches the end of the adagio , and there is another burst of applause , which awakens THE DEAN OF THE CRITICS . ONE OF THE CRITICS Oh , Piffle ! Compared to Gottschalk , the man is an amateur . Let him go back to the conservatory for a couple of years . ONE OF THE MEN Looking at his program . Next comes the shirt-so . I hope it has some tune in it . THE VIRGIN The adagio is love 's agony , but the scherzo is love triumphant . What beautiful eyes he has ! And how pale he is ! THE GREAT PIANIST Resuming his grim toil . Well , there 's half of it over . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  will I ever forget it ? Those hisses  --  and the papers next day ! ONE OF THE MEN Go it , professor ! That 's the best you 've done yet ! ONE OF THE CRITICS Too fast ! p. 11 ANOTHER CRITIC Too slow ! A YOUNG GIRL My , but ai n't the professor just full of talent ! THE GREAT PIANIST Well , so far no accident . He negotiates a difficult passage , and plays it triumphantly , but at some expenditure of cold perspiration . What a way for a man to make a living ! THE VIRGIN What passion he puts into it ! His soul is in his finger-tips . ONE OF THE CRITICS A human pianola ! THE GREAT PIANIST This scherzo always fetches the women . I can hear them draw long breaths . That plump girl is getting pale . Well , why should n't she ? I suppose I 'm about the best pianist she has ever heard  --  or ever will hear . What people can see in that Hofmann fellow I never could imagine . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's pretty good . But it takes an artist to play Beethoven . He rattles on to the end of the sherzo and there is more applause . Then he dashes into the finale . ONE OF THE CRITICS Too loud ! Too loud ! It sounds like an ash-cart going down an alley . But what can you expect ? Piano-playing is a lost art . Paderewski ruined it . THE GREAT PIANIST I ought to clear 200,000 gold-marks by this tournee . If it were n't for those thieving agents and hotel-keepers , I 'd make 300,000 . Just think of it  --  twenty-four marks a day for a room ! That 's the way these Americans treat a visiting artist ! The country is worse than Bulgaria . I was treated better at Bucharest . Well , it wo n't last forever . As soon as I get enough of their money they 'll see me no more . Vienna is the place to settle down . A nice studio at fifty marks a month  --  and the life of a gentleman . What was the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franzjosefstrasse  --  that girl with the gold tooth and the green stockings ? I 'll have to look her up . p. 12 THE VIRGIN What an artist ! What a master ! What a  --  THE MARRIED WOMAN Has he really suffered , or is it just intuition ? THE GREAT PIANIST No , marriage is a waste of money . Let the other fellow marry her . He approaches the closing measures of the finale . And now for a breathing spell and a swallow of beer . American beer ! Bah ! But it 's better than nothing . The Americans drink water . Cattle ! Animals ! Ach , Mnchen , wie bist du so schn ! As he concludes there is a whirlwind of applause and he is forced to bow again and again . Finally , he is permitted to retire , and the audience prepares to spend the short intermission in whispering , grunting , wriggling , scraping its feet , rustling its programs and gaping at hats . THE SIX MUSIC CRITICS and SIX OTHER MEN , their lips parched and their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIANIST comes from the stage , THE JANITOR meets him with a large seidel of needle-beer . He seizes it eagerly and downs it at a gulp.
