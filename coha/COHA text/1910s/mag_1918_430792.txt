When I want poetry in its most delightful and playful mood I take up the verses of that remarkable girl of the sixties and seventies , Emily Dickinson ? she who was writing her little worthless poetic nothings ( or so she was wont to think of them ) at a time when the now classical New England group was flourishing near Concord , when Hawthorne was burrowing into the soul of things , when Thoreau was refusing to make more pencils and was sounding lake bottoms and holding converse with all kinds of fish and other water life , and when Emerson , standing high upon his pedestal , was preaching of compensations , of friendship , of society , and of the oversoul . Emily Dickinson has by no means lost her freshness for us ; she wears as would an old-fashioned pearl set in gold and dark enamels . One feels as if one were sunning in the discal radiance of a bright , vivid , and really new type of poet . For with her cheery impertinence she offsets the smugness of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresistible charm of this girl who gave so charming a portrait of herself to the stranger friend who inquired for a photograph : " I have no portrait now , but am small like the wren , and my hair is bold like the chestnut bur , and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves ! " She had undeniable originality of personality , grace , and special beauty of mind . It was a charm unique in itself , not like any other genius then or now , or in the time before her , having perhaps a little of relationship to the crystal clearness of Crashawlike Vaughan and Donne maybe in respect to their lyrical fervor and moral earnestness , nevertheless appearing to us freshly with as separate a spirit in her poetry as she herself was separated from the world around her by the amplitude of garden which was her universe . Emily Dickinson confronts you at once with an instinct for poetry to be envied by the more ordinary and perhaps more finished poets . Ordinary she never was ; common she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and last aristocratic in sensibility , rare and untouchable , often vague and mystical , sometimes distinctly aloof . Those with a fondness for intimacy will find her , like all recluses , forbidding and difficult . Here was New England at its sharpest , wittiest , most fantastic , most wilful , most devout . Saint and imp sported in her , toying with the tricks of the Deity , taking them now with extreme profundity , then tossing them about like irresistible toys with an incomparable triviality . She has traced upon the page with celestial indelibility that fine line from her soul , which is like a fine prismatic light separating one bright sphere from another , one planet from another planet ; and the edge of separation is but faintly perceptible . She has left us this bright folio of her " lightning and fragrance in one , " scintillant with star dust as perhaps no other before her , certainly none in this country . Who has had her celestial attachednessor must we call it detachedness ? ? and her sublime impertinent playfulness , which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round sun , as zealously she fools with the universes at her feet and , with loftiness of spirit and exquisite trivialness , with those just beyond her eye ? Whoever has not read these flippant renderings , holding always some touch of austerity and gravity of mood , or the still more perfect " letters " to her friends , has , I think , missed a new kind of poetic diversion ? a new loveliness , evasive , alert , pronounced in every interval and serious , modestly so , and at a bound leaping as it were like some sky child pranking with the clouds and the hills and the valleys beneath them . Child she surely was always , playing in some celestial garden space in her mind , where every species of tether was unendurable , where freedom for this childish sport was the one thing necessary to her ever young and incessantly capering mind . It must be said , then , that " fascination was her element " ; everything to her was wondrous , sublimely magical , awsomely inspiring and thrilling . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked say so much as " good morning " to her in human tongue ; it was the event of every instant to have the flowers and birds call her by name , and hear the clouds exult at her approach . She was the brightest young sister of fancy , as she was the gifted young daughter of the ancient imagination . One feels everywhere in her verse and in her letters an unexcelled freshness , a brightness of metaphor and of imagery , a peculiar gift that could have come only from this part of our country , this part of the world , this very spot which has bred so many intellectual and spiritual entities , wrapped in the garments of isolation , robed with questioning . Her genius is in this sense essentially local , as much the voice of the spirit of New England as it is possible for one to be . If ever wanderer hitched vehicle to the comet 's tail , it was this poetic sprite woman ; no one ever rode the sky and the earth as she did in this radiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because all things were in one way or another bright for her , and of a blinding brightness from which she often had to hide her face . She embroidered all her thoughts with starry intricacies , and gave them the splendor of frosty traceries upon the windowpane , and of the raindrop in the sun , and summered them with the fragrancing of the many early and late flowers of her own fanciful conjuring . They are glittering garlands of her clear , cool fancies , these poems , fraught in. some instances , as are certain finely cut stones , with an exceptional mingling of lights coursing swiftly through them . She was avid of starlight and of sunlight alike , and of that light by which all things are illumined with a splendor not their own merely , but lent them by shafts from that radiant sphere which she leaned from , that high place in her mind . To think of this poet is to think of crystal , for she lived in a radianced world of innumerable facets , and the common instances were chariots upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is alive for us now in those rare fancies of hers . You will find in her all that is winsome , strange , fanciful , fantastic , and irresistible in the Eastern character . She is first and best in lightsomeness of temper , for the Eastern is known as an essentially tragic genius . She is in modern times perhaps the single exponent of the  | quality of true celestial frivolity . She was like dew and the soft summer rain , and the light upon the lips of flowers of which she loved to sing . Her mind and her spirit were one , soul and sense inseparable . She was the little sister of Shelley , and the more playful relative of Francis Thompson . She had about her the imperishable quality that hovers about all things young and strong and beautiful ; she conveyed the sense . of beauty ungovernable . What she has of religious and moral tendencies in nowise disturbs those who love and appreciate true poetic essences . For Emily Dickinson had in her eyes the climbing lances of the sun ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immeasurable , innumerable , pitiful , and pitiable things . She was a quenchless mother in her gift for solace . Like all aristocrats , she hated mediocrity ; and like all first-rate jewels , she had no rift to hide . She was not a maker of poetry ; she was a thinker of poetry . She was not a conjuror of words so much as a magician in sensibility . She had only to see and feel and hear to be in touch with all things with a name or with things that must be forever nameless . If she loved people , she loved them for what they were ; if she despised them , she despised them for what they did , or for lack of power to feel they could not do . Silence under a tree was a far more talkative experience with her than converse with one or a thousand dull minds . Her throng was the air , and her wings were the multitude of flying movements in her brain . She had only to think and she was amid numberless minarets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain cleft its shadow in her heart . Emily Dickinson is in no sense toil for the mind unaccustomed to the labors of reading : she is too fanciful and delicious ever to make heavy the head ; she sets you . to laughter and draws a smile across your face for pity and lets you loose again amid the measureless pleasing little humanities . I shall always want to read Emily Dickinson , for she points her finger at all tiresome scholasticism , and takes a chance with the universe about her and the first poetry it offers at every hand , within the eye 's easy glancing . She has made poetry memorable as a pastime for the mind , and sent the heavier ministerial tendencies flying to a speedy oblivion . What a child she was , child impertinent , with a heavenly rippling in her brain ! These random passages from her writings will show at once the rarity of her tastes and the originality of her phrasing : February passed like a kate , and I know March . . . Here is the light the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could arrest it , but will not chagrin him . The wind blows gay today , and the jays bark like blue terriers . Friday I tasted life , it was a vast morsel . . . A circus passed the house ? still I feel the red in my mind though the drums are out . If I read a book , and it makes my whole body so cold no fire will ever warm e , I know that is poetry . If I feel physically as if the fop of my head were taken off , I know that is poetry . Is there no other way ? None but a Yankee mind could concoct such humors and fascinatingly pert phrases as are found here . They are like the chatterings of the interrupted squirrel in the tree-bole . There is so much of high gossip in these poetic turns of hers that throughout her books one finds a multitude of playful tricks for the pleased mind to run with . She was an intoxicated being , drunken with the little tipsy joys of the simplest form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into thinking that nothing she could think or feel but was extraordinary and remarkable . " Your letter gave no drunkenness because I tasted rum before ? Domingo comes but once , " she wrote to Colonel Higginson , a pretty conceit surely to offer a loved friend . These passages will give the unfamiliar reader a taste of the sparkle of the poet 's hurrying fancy . She will always delight those who love her type of elfish , evasive genius . And those who care for the vivid and living element in words will find her , to say the least , among the masters in her feeling for their strange shapes and for the fresh significances contained in them . A born thinker of poetry , and in a great measure a gifted writer of it , refreshing many a heavy moment made dull with the weightiness of books or of burdensome thinking , this poet-sprite sets scurrying all weariness of the brain ; and they shall have an hour of sheer delight who invite poetic converse with Emily Dickinson . She will repay with funds of rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
