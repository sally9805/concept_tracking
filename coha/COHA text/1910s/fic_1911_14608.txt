THE curtain discloses the abode of quiet unimportance . Some plaster casts upon the old-fashioned mantel above the fireplace , at the right , and a few dark-framed engravings on the walls reveal the native refinement of the occupant . The furnishings are subdued in tone ; dull curtains cozily drape the window at the left and the door near this which leads into another room . At the back , in the center , large doors open in from the hallway . Above the sofa , crept in from another period of life , is suspended a shaded lamp , which , when lighted , softly floods part of the room . MRS . HARRINGTON is discovered sitting beside the sofa where her son JASPER is lying asleep . He is a young man full of latent strength , with a sincere and persuasive charm . MRS . HARRINGTON is in the late forties ; her slightly grayed hair fringing a face sweetened and chastened by a life of obvious resignation . Her manner is calm and full of understanding , with its strange suggestion of unattained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a long pause . The daylight is fading from the gray winter sky . The clock strikes five slowly . JASPER turns in his sleep and laughs ironically , then sighs deeply . MRS . HARRINGTON rises , pulls his dressing-gown about him , lights the lamp , looking at JASPER , and shaking her head sympathetically . She shades the light from his pale , drawn face which shows pronounced traces of recent and persistent dissipation . She pulls down the window curtains , completely shutting out the daylight . The room is full of shades , shadows , and silences . A soft knock is heard . RUTH HARRINGTON Come in . Sh ! ( The door in back opens , and THE MAID , in conventional black dress , enters with a letter . ) At last . ( Disappointed ) He has sent an answer ! ( She takes the letter eagerly to lamp , sits , looks tenderly as though having seen the handwriting for the first time in a long while . THE MAID fixes the fire , and the dancing flames soon add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRINGTON opens letter , reads , sighs in relief at contents , looks at JASPER , and drops her head in silent recollection. ) p. 3 MAID Is Mr. Jasper  --  ? RUTH HARRINGTON Oh , he 's better . Only a headache . ( MAID starts to leave . ) I am expecting Mr. Mason King . Let me know at once . ( MAID goes out , leaving door in back open . MRS . HARRINGTON rises , connects letter in her mind with her boy , and goes back to close door . JASPER tosses about , sits up , and , believing he is alone , speaks from a genuine grief , unheard by MRS . HARRINGTON . ) JASPER She 's not worth it . To lead me on . And then toss me over for  --  . Damn her !  --  Oh ! ( He puts hand on head , turns , and sees MRS . HARRINGTON , thinking she has just entered . ) Hello , mother . Just come in to see me ? What time is it ? My eyes feel  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've slept all afternoon . You were very tired . It 's after five . JASPER I 've an engagement at six . Some new friends . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Concealing her objection ) Then you 've hardly time to dress , dear . JASPER See here , mother  --  Well , well , do n't wait up for me . I may be late again . Please do n't . ( He sits down . MRS . HARRINGTON takes key from the mantel. ) p. 4 RUTH HARRINGTON You left this in the door last night . ( JASPER pockets it , rather ashamed . MRS . HARRINGTON embraces him . ) My boy ! my boy ! ( He gently turns his lips from her attempted kiss . ) JASPER Do n't , mother . I 'm not worth  --  oh !  --  why are you so good to me ? Why do n't you tell me what I am ? I know . I 'm a cad . I 've lost hold of myself completely . RUTH HARRINGTON We all do at times , Jasper . JASPER You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made mistakes ! JASPER I ca n't stop it . Something drives me on  --  on . Every time I think of  --  oh !  --  you do n't know  --  ; you would n't understand . RUTH HARRINGTON Perhaps not . But I see my son is not himself : his eyes are not so clear , his face is drawn , his hands cold . Besides , he has lost all his ambition , his  --  JASPER ( Uncomfortably ) I must be getting ready . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Eying him tenderly ) Yes ,  --  yes ,  --  dear . ( MAID re-enters with card which she gives to MRS . HARRINGTON . ) So soon ? Take his things : do n't keep him waiting . ( MAID exits , leaving door open . JASPER reads card as MRS . HARRINGTON hands it to him. ) p. 5 JASPER Mason King ? Have n't the papers been full of his pictures lately and  --  RUTH HARRINGTON Yes . I 'd like you to meet him . JASPER It 's a great privilege , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was not so famous when I first knew him . He was about your age . JASPER ( Absently referring to many dog-eared magazines about ) Do you still keep all his articles and speeches ? RUTH HARRINGTON I have always been deeply interested ; though it 's been many years since  --  JASPER ( Impulsively ) I do n't want memories . I could n't live if I looked back . ( Changing in mood as she gently watches him ) Oh ! mother , I did n't mean to be disagreeable . ( Starting to leave ) I do n't know when I 'll be back to-night . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Tenderly while detaining him ) Jasper , you 're troubled deeply  --  very deeply . I see that . I have n't asked a word . Boys ca n't tell their mothers everything , just because they are mothers , can they ? But you would feel better , dear , if you could talk over whatever it is with some one . ( Still detaining him ) Could n't you go to Ethel ? p. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( He slams door as he goes out . MRS . HARRINGTON , deeply moved , realizes the cause of his mood . ) RUTH HARRINGTON Oh , forgive me ! So that 's why ! Poor boy : no wonder . ( Pause . She turns . MASON KING enters . They stand alone a long while , looking at each other without shaking hands . The scene is quiet and suggestive of hidden emotion . MASON KING is an imposing , authoritative man past fifty ; his face tells of one deeply versed in the struggle with realities , yet possesses a kindliness which colors all he says . There is a deep reverence in his attitude towards MRS . HARRINGTON which , at times , embarrasses his apparent social ease . ) MASON KING It seems like yesterday . RUTH HARRINGTON Since you left me ? MASON KING With your answer . RUTH HARRINGTON You recall that first  --  after the absence ? MASON KING Your answer made the absence . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Cautiously ) I am sure we can talk calmly now  --  without pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain in my heart then  --  only emptiness RUTH HARRINGTON Yet , after I married  --  MASON KING My letter told how glad I was you had found happiness . RUTH HARRINGTON Happiness ? ( She smiles vaguely . ) And you said then , as before , if ever I needed you  --  MASON KING That is why I am here now . RUTH HARRINGTON Come closer . ( He comes within light , as she looks at him . ) Your jaw has squared a bit ; that 's because you determined to do things . Your eyes are steadier ; that 's how you did things . MASON KING Do you see anything to tell why I 've done things ? RUTH HARRINGTON Yes . But I ca n't quite make it out . Some great resolve hidden from everybody . ( Less seriously ) You must tell me some day . MASON KING ( Slightly surprised ) You are still interested ? RUTH HARRINGTON I have followed your career upwards . ( She falters under his intense gaze , then continues less seriously ) Oh , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? You can read little there : a marriage , a mother , a widow  --  and some dreams unrealized . Voil tout ! p. 8 MASON KING But a mother ! RUTH HARRINGTON ( With great joy ) Yes . That ! ( Looks toward door . ) It is about my son . He must n't know I sent for you . Wo n't you sit down ? ( She sits : he looks about room . ) Does it seem like me ? MASON KING Yes . As I 've sometimes thought you might be . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Pleased and surprised ) You 've really thought of unimportant me ? ( He bows . She looks about , too , with a touch of concealed bitterness . ) They are souvenirs of my married life . ( She motions him to sit . He does , watching her . Pause . ) Confess . You 've been silently measuring me . Do you remember , with sufficient vividness , the original  --  now that you see the faded negative ? She was a girl with hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's a woman with  --  MASON KING Pleasant memories , I trust . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Starts to deny : hesitates ) But there 's no occasion to be too serious  --  eh ? ( More casually ) You see , I 'm talking just as we did in the old days . It 's strange : I 've always felt , when I thought of you  --  and it 's been often  --  that somehow you did understand me , that no matter what happened , I could still turn to  --  ( She shrugs her shoulders . ) Much has happened , but I did n't bother you , because  --  well  --  I 've been away so long ,  --  and  --  ( Tenderly ) in the early years I was vain enough to think perhaps it might open a wound . ( He bows . ) But now  --  well , I turn to you to help me with my son . p. 9 MASON KING ( Coming out of his reminiscent mood ) Forgive an unsociable guest . With gray hairs , I fear I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , I 'll help the boy  --  if I can . What 's the trouble ? RUTH HARRINGTON ( Clearly ) The remedy lies in a long trip with a dominating interest sufficient to gather his scattered energies into one definite channel . MASON KING ( Smiling ) You 've thought it out . RUTH HARRINGTON He 's been very unhappy . MASON KING Cynics would scent a woman . RUTH HARRINGTON I do n't want to be disloyal to him . MASON KING Has he told you anything ? ( She shakes her head . ) Then your intuitions alone have discovered  --  ? RUTH HARRINGTON What and who it is ? Yes . MASON KING Is it roses or just wild oats ? RUTH HARRINGTON ( With conviction ) The best . They 've been pals . It must have been something else with Jasper . ( KING understands . ) I imagine she 's going to marry . I 've known her myself for years . She would have been worthy of my boy . p. 10 MASON KING ( Sincerely ) Then he 's a lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Puzzled ) You are enigmatical ? MASON KING ( Acknowledging it and smiling ) And so , the disappointment has  --  ? RUTH HARRINGTON Yes . He 's been trying to forget in the only way most men think forgetfulness lies . MASON KING Yes , yes . Most men . RUTH HARRINGTON It 's hurt me , of course . I have n't reproached him because I blame myself for his weakness . ( He halts inquiringly . ) Oh , never mind , why . I thought perhaps a little of this might  --  it does sometimes  --  that he might find himself unaided ; but he has n't . It 's going deeper than I thought . He has given up all his work , and he was so ambitious . It 's not a light young man 's affair ; it 's  --  ( She sighs deeply ) and I was getting afraid of where it would end . I knew , every one knew , you were sailing , in a few days , on the Peace Commission . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fairly intelligent ? p. 11 RUTH HARRINGTON ( Smiling ) He is a college graduate . MASON KING That 's the sort I want . He 'll be open to facts . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Eagerly ) Then you will ? MASON KING ( Agreeing ) If he  --  RUTH HARRINGTON You must make him go . ( Gratefully ) How shall I ever  --  ? ( KING hushes her . ) You know , we older people are very careless sometimes with this love . A wrong word may separate us from the children we parents foolishly grow to feel we own  --  may wreck a life . MASON KING Or make one . ( They look at each other . ) RUTH HARRINGTON Sh ! He 's coming . MASON KING To think it should be your boy who  --  RUTH HARRINGTON There 's something in his better self which reminds me of you , as I knew you . ( JASPER enters in Tuxedo . Overcoat on . He stops . ) This is Mr. King . My boy , Jasper . JASPER ( With great respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( KING shakes hands , holds it fondly , indicates immediately he is pleased with JASPER . JASPER looks at mother : his eyes sink under KING 'S close scrutiny . Pause . ) I am sorry I must be going out , sir . I have an  --  p. 12 MASON KING ( Cordially ) Sorry , too . Should have liked a chat . ( Managing him subtly throughout ) Heard you were very clever . JASPER Who told you ? Mother ? RUTH HARRINGTON ( Smiling ) Mr. King knows all things . MASON KING You 're promising . JASPER You 're mistaken there , sir . MASON KING Why , it 's written all over you . ( Looking him over ) Good clear eyes . ( They lower ) **27;3257;TOOLONG . ( JASPER faces him steadily ) Strong face . Right kind of lines coming . ( Feeling hands ) Plenty of good , healthy blood . Of course , you 're promising . ( Eying him keenly as JASPER turns away ) Sorry , though , you 've got to go out . JASPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Delighted ) Let me take your coat , dear . ( She helps him off and looks at KING significantly . JASPER tries to appear at ease . ) Is it too late for tea ? p. 13 JASPER Tea  --  huh ! MASON KING ( Seeing decanter ) Rather this , eh ? JASPER ( With a touch of abandon ) Yes . RUTH HARRINGTON Let me . ( She brings it down . KING pours out some ; uses siphon , offers it to JASPER , who eyes mother and declines . ) JASPER Oh , I 'm not thirsty yet . RUTH HARRINGTON Now you have met , is n't it too bad , Jasper , that Mr. King wo n't have time to really know you ? MASON KING Oh , strange things happen . I like your son . I want to know him . I shall . JASPER Thanks , Mr. King , but  --  MASON KING I am leaving the country , you mean ? True . ( Abruptly ) How would you like to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . MASON KING It is a bit sudden , eh ? The cares of statesmen these days are not public calamities but private secretaries . One of mine , for instance , has too persistently worshiped King Alcohol  --  ( JASPER starts ) and so he does not sail . It 's personality I want ; you 've got that . I 'll gamble on your ability . Will you take his place ? p. 14 RUTH HARRINGTON ( Joyed ) Jasper , it 's what you 've said would be the first step to  --  JASPER ( Eagerly ) Do you think I could do it ? MASON KING I seldom make mistakes in people . Besides , it will be a great favor to me . JASPER Thanks . Thanks . I want to advance ,  --  to be something  --  ; ( Recalling ) at least , I did. , But I ca n't do it . I ca n't now . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Persuasively ) But , Jasper , one never knows what one can do till  --  MASON KING I 'm willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what it would be : taking a chance . ( Poignantly ) No . I could n't do it . I could n't get my mind down to it . I 'd always be thinking of something else . MASON KING And then ? JASPER ( With bitter conviction ) Then I 'd do like the Secretary you 've dismissed ! ( He sinks into chair abashed . MRS . HARRINGTON controls herself and pats him . KING watches . There is a long pause. ) p. 15 RUTH HARRINGTON Dear , dear , I 'm sure you would n't . ( Defending him to KING ) Jasper has had a hard winter . And I 've not been very well , until now , and he 's been taking care of me , have n't you , boy ? He 's just a bit unstrung and excitable . The trip across will do you good , dear , and once you get interested , it will be easier . ( JASPER laughs softly . ) MASON KING Work 's the answer . Your mother was ( Correcting slip ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and controlling anger ) Was ? That 's it . Why you 've come . Mother wrote you . You 've talked it over . So it was all arranged to get me away to save me from going to the devil ! ! RUTH HARRINGTON ( Hurt ) Jasper ! JASPER You 've been trying to " handle " me . Is n't that it ? Mother ? RUTH HARRINGTON ( Resigned ) It was for your sake , my boy . JASPER ( With quiet , yet sincere , indignation ) You 've made a mistake , I know what I 'm doing . I could stop it . I do n't want to . I 'm " happier " this way . ( He starts to pick up his coat. ) p. 16 RUTH HARRINGTON My boy ! JASPER ( With quiet dignity ) I do n't need outside help , mother . I wo n't have interference from strangers . RUTH HARRINGTON You must n't say such things . MASON KING ( Taking JASPER firmly between shoulders ) Jasper ! You 're no stranger to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have followed you for years  --  no matter how nor why . ( JASPER surprised . MRS . HARRINGTON turns and crosses in growing wonder and realization . ) I understand . You are feeling just as I did some twenty odd years ago . ( Movement by MRS . HARRINGTON . ) Like throwing all the best of you in the mud , with so many consoling companions . ( With great sincerity ) But you mus n't . God , boy ! you mus n't ! JASPER My mother has asked you  --  RUTH HARRINGTON ( Quickly ) Not to blame you ; only to help you help yourself . JASPER She could have said these things . MASON KING ( Detaining him ) But you have n't quite considered her , have you ? ( JASPER 'S eyes sink guiltily . ) So you must keep away from the mud for your own sake . ( JASPER smiles . ) And for one other . p. 17 JASPER ( Halted ) Another ? Who ? MASON KING ( Simply ) For the sake of the girl you love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret is known . He turns to mother , but realizes that he has not told her ) The girl I  --  who told ? Nobody knew . ( Putting on front ) You 're mistaken ; there is nobody . Tell him , mother . ( She puts her hand on his shoulder . He sees she knows . He hesitates , and becomes genuinely and not peevishly ironical . ) Well ! what if there is ? ( Sarcastically to KING ) You know all things , ha , ha ! ( With deep feeling ) What 's she to me now ? Do you know she led me on  --  tossed me over ? I tell you , she 's nothing to me . So why should I do anything for her sake when she does n't care for me the way I want  --  not a bit  --  not a bit . ( He sinks into the chair , overcome by his emotions . MRS . HARRINGTON suffers with him but tries to console . Pause . ) MASON KING What has that got to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love her , do n't you ? ( Silence . ) Has she changed any ? Is she any different now , any the less worthy herself , just because she did n't happen to care for you ? Was it her fault she did n't ? Can one help those things ? ( Pause . ) Did she really " lead you on " ? ( Quickly ) Now be fair to her ! Did n't you just mistake her frank open companionship , her sympathy , her interest ? You are not the first . ( MRS . HARRINGTON understands. ) p. 18 JASPER ( Quietly ) You 're laughing at me . RUTH HARRINGTON No  --  no . JASPER ( Seriously ) You think I 'll get over it soon ! RUTH HARRINGTON He has always cared . MASON KING It matters little how it is to be : it 's real now , eh ? Very real , and I ca n't laugh with others at an honest love  --  if the girl is worth while . ( Measuring effect ) But I do n't think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JASPER ( Rising ominously ) What do you mean ? MASON KING ( With intention ) You make me believe it 's only your vanity that 's hurt . That she 's some frivolous , flirting coquette  --  JASPER ( Firmly , as KING has desired ) Mother , he ca n't insult  --  ( Turning , firmly ) Please do n't say anything against her , Mr. King . MASON KING ( Bluntly ) Have I said anything worse than you have been doing against her ? ( JASPER halts . After a pause KING continues with great tenderness and persuasion . MRS . HARRINGTON held . ) Listen , Jasper , have n't you been trying to forget when it might be more worthy to remember her ? You 've been denying her worth to yourself when you should be glorying that you 've seen it , eh ? You 've been trying to make the best of her a derision , have n't you ? When to you it should be an inspiration and an aspiration . Now , should n't it ? Think . Have n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with you through the soiled hours ,  --  when you should be keeping it your emblem of purity and goodness . Ca n't you see you 've begun to wallow in the mud instead of bending your knees and thanking God a worth-while woman has come into your life ! ( Pause . ) And you say I 'm insulting her . What have you begun to do ? What have you been doing ? ( JASPER turns , realizes , and looks before him , silent . MRS . HARRINGTON gazes long at KING . They stand on either side of JASPER . KING continues more lightly . ) Come , come  --  you 're not a wreck , are you ? But do n't you see a preachy old man of the world is trying to help you work this out to your own profit ? Ca n't you understand if you 've found a woman who is worth your love , you are richer ? You may not be able to be faithful to your ideal through the hot years of youth , but it is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if some men keep decent it is because they wish to be what the best women think them . p. 19 JASPER And where is the reward ? MASON KING If one seeks rewards they only lie within one 's self . JASPER ( Not convinced ) That 's one of those life-theories that sound well but ca n't be lived . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Hurt ) Jasper ! MASON KING ( Smiling ) That 's right ; you 're in the mood to doubt as I am to convince . ( Pause . ) Jasper , what I have told you has not been a theory . ( Sacredly ) It 's been a  --  a practice ! ( JASPER bows . MRS . HARRINGTON glances quickly at KING , and throughout the following shows clearly her growing realization of how much she has meant to him during the years . ) RUTH HARRINGTON You mus n't  --  MASON KING ( Simply and slowly ) It 's not too tragic to tell you now . It 's been the most beautiful thing in life . I was about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the woman you care for is to you . She did n't love me either . ( Finally without bitterness ) That was all . But she 'd always been fair to me throughout . You see our stories are alike somewhat , eh ? With me , there was no one before and no one since . ( MRS . HARRINGTON conceals her tears . ) She was no mere illusion , either . ( With great conviction ) No : she was what men call an ideal . I measured all by her . Others came . Oh ! the flesh was not always true , perhaps because the world forgives the humanity in us men ; but the best in me was : always reaching to what I knew she would ask of me , if she had cared . So all the empty years , the thought of her has been leading me on . I declined this easy offer and accepted that difficult task , because , when in doubt , I went to a few letters , a stolen , faded picture in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly before me ; they told me somehow the right thing to do . I owe all to her . It 's been hard at times , but I am grateful that I could even love her purely without hope . ( Half looking toward MRS . HARRINGTON ) That was the great resolve hidden from everybody : to be worthy of my own love for her ! p. 20 JASPER ( Murmuring reverently ) Mr. King ! MASON KING It 's not the way of the world , Jasper . Most people wince and forget . True . But I want you to know this . You . To start right and to see it can be done if one loves enough and only once . ( Pause . JASPER very silent , his head bowed . KING looks at MRS . HARRINGTON , the longing of years there . She is spellbound . A curious new light breaks through her tear-stained eyes . She is bewildered , confused with her own emotions , hesitates , turns , crosses softly , and sits by the fire , hiding her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . HARRINGTON absently pokes the dying embers into a new blaze . The clock strikes the half hour . The door softly opens , and MAID stands there . ) MAID Excuse me , Mr. Jasper , the ' phone . JASPER ( Uninterested ) Who is it ? MAID He said you 'd know who ? He 's been waiting at  --  JASPER ( Helplessly ) Mother  --  RUTH HARRINGTON Tell him Mr. Jasper will not come to-night . JASPER Nor to-morrow . ( MAID bows and exits , closing door . JASPER rises . ) Mr. King , there 's one thing I 'd like to ask you . Did she ever know ? p. 21 RUTH HARRINGTON ( Quickly ) You mus n't ask that , Jasper . MASON KING She learned too late . JASPER ( With vigorous determination ) Mother , I 'll write Ethel , and tell her now , that I  --  RUTH HARRINGTON ( For KING ) Yes , do . A woman ought to know that she means something to a man . For then , perhaps in her own little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . JASPER I 'll do it now . You 'll wait here for me , Mr. King ? MASON KING ( Businesslike ) You will sail with me ? JASPER When do you leave ? MASON KING Wednesday . Ten . Campania . JASPER ( Turning ) But , mother  --  ? RUTH HARRINGTON I 'll help you get ready , my boy . JASPER I should n't go , mother . We 've been so much together , you and I ,  --  RUTH HARRINGTON ( Kisses him tenderly ) I 've had you longer than most mothers . I 've always been waiting for this time of parting . I am ready . p. 22 JASPER ( Hesitating ) But ought n't I  --  RUTH HARRINGTON ( With deep feeling ) You should not be held by false obligations . You owe nothing to me . I have your love . What you will make of yourself , by yourself , will be my reward for the care . Go , my boy : I shall miss you : but I shall not regret . You have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will always have my faith , my understanding , and my love . ( KING has controlled himself with difficulty . ) JASPER Mr. King , it must have been hard for you to tell me about  --  Believe me , I appreciate it , and I 'll try to be worthy of your confidence , mother 's faith , and  --  the other one . ( Good-naturedly ) I do n't know so very much about you , sir  --  but mother does . I 'll get her to tell me . Besides , she 's got hundreds of clippings and things about your career and speeches . I 'll run through them with her . I never could see why she kept them . ( He exits , leaving door open . The two are alone , and step nearer each other , with suppressed emotion . They speak quietly so that JASPER will not hear through open door ; thus , still keeping him in scene . ) RUTH HARRINGTON What can I say ? p. 23 MASON KING Nothing . You should never have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us together  --  again . MASON KING Just to say good-by ? ( Silence . ) Is it too late ? ( She looks at him in doubt . ) I forgot : you never loved me ! RUTH HARRINGTON ( Half dreamingly ) Seeing you again , hearing you speak this way , recalls something I believe I felt for some one , some dream  --  long ago . ( She is puzzled , looks into his eyes , and shakes her head kindly . ) But you 've worshiped a false ideal of me all these years . MASON KING I have seen you again  --  as a mother . I know . RUTH HARRINGTON You do n't know . I have done the unpardonable in your eyes . I am not the woman you think me  --  nor mother . ( With an effort ) I told you I could n't reproach Jasper in all this , because I knew I was to blame for his weakness . Oh , I love him so ; but I was n't fair to him  --  to his character at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loveless marriage . ( Pause : Looking into his eyes . ) You never thought your ideal woman would  --  ? p. 24 MASON KING No . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Helplessly ) You see . ( Pause . She loses control of her surging emotion , and becomes unnaturally agitated . ) I do n't understand myself to-night  --  here ( Hand on heart )  --  but I 'm wondering what feeling makes me call for you , Mason , to help him I love most ! ! ( He starts , comes closer , as though suppressing a new hope . ) MASON KING You 've shown me we grow by the way we accept consequences . In some strange , different way than I thought , you have become even more perfect than I knew you were . Listen , Ruth . ( He moves still closer . JASPER re-enters with a new energy . They look at one another . JASPER halts , and finishes tearing up a letter . MRS . HARRINGTON makes a motion of fear and uncertainty that perhaps he may not be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't tell you how she 'd written me  --  that she 'd heard what I was doing  --  that she was hurt and sorry ' cause I had n't been strong . Well , I 've just been thinking I 'm pretty much of a coward to be writing . I 'm not writing : I 'm going to see her , to tell her what I 'm going to do . It wo n't be easy , but I sha n't let her suffer on my account . p. 25 RUTH HARRINGTON ( Joyed ) Jasper ! MASON KING Good . I 'll give you a lift on the way . JASPER ( Has crossed and thrown up the shade . Moonlight streams in ) Your cab is there ! I 'll be back soon , mother . ( He takes up coat , and exits , leaving door open . ) RUTH HARRINGTON ( Greatly joyed ) Now I am sure of him  --  as I have always been of you . ( He offers his hand in parting : she slowly takes it . They show in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time their hands have touched in years . ) MASON KING Good-by . RUTH HARRINGTON ( Quietly ) For a time ? MASON KING ( Significantly ) We 'll put it that way . ( They look into each other 's eyes . Then he stiffens up ; controlling himself , and exits , closing door between them . MRS . HARRINGTON leans back against it . The moonlight from the window floods the door and shows upon her face a look of mingled hope and joy , indefinitely touched with a sense of mystery. ) p. 26 RUTH HARRINGTON I wonder  --  if I  --  ( Her hand steals to her heart )  --  I wonder . ( She stands there silent . The outer door closes . Then she smiles. )
