WHAT with the war and the Psychical Research society , heaven is getting wonderfully humanized . Secular people , like Conan Doyle discuss it as though it were geography of travel ravel . Dr. Doyle ' practised talent for the solution of mysteries may have led him to aspire to unravel the great mystery of all . He has not done that yet , but every month or two there is something from him in the newspapers about the unseen world , and he always speaks confidently and reports improved visibility of the celestial quarter . It has always been from the newly dead that investigators have had the best hopes of information , and of course in Europe , now , that source of news has been immensely augmented . Sir Oliver Lodge reports word from his son Raymond , killed at Hooge Hill in September , 1915 , giving very interesting details of t h e celestial country . The son likes it there ; says he has many attentive friends and a body much like the one he occupied on earth . He speaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , and he dells how his friends who had lost limbs on  | earth recover them their celestial bodies . He even reports that they eat and drink and smoke in that part of the hereafter which he has reached , but none of these exercises , he proceeds to inform us , is so important as it was here , nor seems to matter much except to newcomers . These are interesting stories , and reported by a very eminent and respected man of science , whose mind in its leisure for twenty years has dwelt on this matter of the continuance of life and individuality after the death of the body and has followed and weighed the attempts made to break through the barrier which holds off the living here from those who live beyond . Sir Oliver has long been persuaded on the strength of accumulating evidence that he barrier can be passed , and communication , much easier and fuller than now , be established . Much the same conclusion was reached by Sir ' William Crookes , Camille Flammarion , Frederic W. H. Myers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Doyle , our familiar friend and entertainer , seems frankly hospitable to this theory , not to speak of Airs . Frances Hodgson Burnet , whose latest bit of fiction ( in Harper 's ) follows this same subject of the dead who live , and gives the impression of a story contrived to record a conviction . Kipling has written several remarkable stories of this same sort , giving evidence that his mind , too , entertains the idea that the departed have not gone far away and are far more with us than we tin appreciate . " Alediums " are apt to be misleaders , and their " controls , " when they have any , are liable to he scalawags , and this is not to recommend commerce with them to any inexperienced inquirer ; nevertheless , the suggestions of the Lodges and the Doyles are acceptable . This is a particularly good time to live in two worlds at once . Our world and the human life , we know , never more needed to be supplemented by the life invisible . Our poor world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying painful deaths or being nursed back to crippled existences . The whole of life has become precarious and impossi ble to forecast . On something more secure than what we see ? something bomb-proof , soldier-proof , starvation-proof ? we need to rest as never before . With millions facing death by violence , and behind them tens of millions under shadow of death by starvation and disease , our world needs all the fortitude that can be brought to it by convinced assurance that death does not end all . In all times lives geared to that belief have usually been the better for it . It is the very mainspring of religion , the great warrant for resistance to materialism and the notion that to get all you can and enjoy it while you lay is the end of human life . The profound spiritual changes that shape individual character come usually out of deep distress . Out of the present deep distress of the world may come , on an unprecedented scale , such spiritual changes as will affect the aims and dispositions , not merely of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eliot once wound up an address in Philadelphia on the needs of education , with the remark , almost despairing , " But there is no goal ; there is no goal ! " He meant , apparently , that whatever may be done to improve men 's abilities and the conditions of life , perfection and a social mechanism that will take care of itself and of mankind can never be attained . Whether he meant that or not , it is true . Life is endeavor , with more or less attainment , but nothing final . The finality is death , and to that , and beyond it , we must look for the crown of life and the key to its mystery . Governments , ecclesiastical organizations , school systems , political alliances , leagues for peace , are mechanisms that will do their work while they can be kept in working order , but no mechanism will save the world and solve the problem of life , or even keep the peace for more than a limited time . The great regenerato , of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of earthly origin nor limited by earthly duration &; All that one can make of earth is that it is a training-ground for souls , and it is a good place or a had one according as the souls achieve their training or miss it . Obviously enough , the training of souls is complicated by the care , nourishment . and reproduction of bodies and the con tinuous enrolment of the souls that keep crowding in . The needs of the body are so importunate that people get the idea that to look after it is the main purpose of human life , and spend all their strength to that end . But that is a mistake . If souls are in good order , bodies will usually thrive . But the converse does not follow . Bodies may be kept in excellent order and soul= do very ill , and finally perish and bring clown their bodies with them . NA habrought the war on , as much as anything . was an immense overprovision for bodies and of bodies , in the development of which the cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of keeping souls in health and the urgent obligation to look after bodies , and the tendency of these two duties to conflict , life is a complicated matter . If the only end of it was to make this world work right , and to live in it . we might well despair . But happily , that is only one end of existence . The more important one is so to acquit ourselves in this world that when we are called to leave it we shall be fit to go . And if we are fit to go , then the world will be the better for our stay in it . We can not help ourselves without helping mankind , and helping to the solution of man 's stay on earth . AS for this world , it is a sad topic . A great many people in it are getting into the mood of the writers of the comminatory psalms ? those psalms in which the Lord is told in what a bad , had way everything is , and is invited to bestow his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked . Since the war began , the news papers have been more than ever the main reading of most readers . There was never such news in them before , and morning and night and between times we have turned to them with hungry eyes . But oh what news ! Two years and a half of it , until now our capacity for sensations is dulled , and nothing that we read has much effect on us . Newspapers , as they have come to be in this country , are strange things that would have seemed incredible a century ago . Their readers no  | longer pay more than a minor part of the cost of them , and they are in the main supported by merchants who pay for the privilege of attracting the readers ' attention . We are warned that the shortage of paper , if it gets much worse , will make many newspapers suspend publication and make it impossible for the rest to continue to be issued in their present volume . This is really a more portentous threat than the rumored imminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already so far emancipated from the alcoholic drink habit that we could bear the loss of alcohol with equanimity , but the newspaper habit is almost universal in this country , and has the people in its grip . If it were seriously curbed by a scarcity of newspapers , it would jolt our civilization like a collapse of government . Indeed it would involve in great measure that very thing , since newspapers are about the most important agency of government that we employ . We derive from them most of the knowledge , true or false , on which we base our political opinions and action . We read their views and conclusions and adopt them if we like them . Without them we should lose as a nation much of our power of self-government , and would probably have to be governed by persons who still had means of learning what was going on . But it will not come to that . We shall not run entirely out of paper , and we shall continue to get the news , such as it is , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper than at present , it wo n't hurt us . We shall have more time to think , and possibly may learn by practise to think to better purpose .  |
