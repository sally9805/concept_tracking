txt QUARTERMASTER RECRUITS . John Kendrick Bangs Defends Them With the assistance of that distin7 guished humorist , J. G. Cannon of Illinois , certain newspapers in this land are endeavoring to make the insignia of the Quartermaster 's Department a reproach to those who wear it . It is my privilege to know many of the young men who have been assigned to that branch of the service , and there is not one of them who is in it as a matter of choice . They are there because they have been put there , and the majority of them are cursing their luck , since they would infinitely have preferred to serve in some capacity that would insure their going into the trenches along with those whom they consider more fortunate . Many of them are young men with families to support , who have given up gainful occupations , and are now doing a hard day 's job , day after day , inconspicuously , at a stipend that is inadequate to provide the barest necessities of life . I know a dozen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard preparatory training of the camps , hoping to make themselves fit to " go over the top " ; who have made themselves fit to go " over the top , " but have received orders to take up the duties they are now performing , and , though resentful It their very souls of the nature of their duties , yet , like the good soldiers they are , performing them with unquestioning obedience . It is a poor return to slur their bravery and to sneer at them as slickers or slackers . If there are any slickers or slackers among them it is ' a safe guess that they are the very ones that . easy-going Congressmen have aided in securing what they would consider the safe and easy berths . Tho work of the Quartermaster 's Department is important . It is at the very foundation of the fighting man 's efficiency . It has got to be done , and it is being done by thousands of splendid young men who if they had their way would be in the fighting line ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the value of their service should be minimized , their courage questioned , and their motives aspersed . As for the Congressional humorist . J. G. Cannon , who has done not a little with his so-called wit to aid in this assault , I have taken the trouble to look up his war record . and . I find in Who 's Who that at the beginning of the civil war in 1801 Mr. Cannon was 27 ) years old  --  a very Hotspur of an age  --  and that from 1802 to 180S he practiced law in Illinois , with his name on the public Payroll ? as uoual ! IN. valiant service during the nation 's peril , but alas , I can not find that although admitted to the bar at that early age Mr. Cannon . wore any either upon his shoulders or upon his sleeve . and it , is a sad fact that if his heels were guilty of spurs their guilt has faded away into such airy nothingness as to leave behind them no record either of their existence or of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Criticism !
