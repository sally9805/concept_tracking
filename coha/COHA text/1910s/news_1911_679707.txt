txt If the process of fooling the people about tariffs and protection were not one made altogether familiar to us by practice and repetition , we should be astounded at the extraordinary manner in which the Canadians have permitted themselves to be fooled and bamboozled against their own interests in regard to the Reciprocity Agreement . Measured by any test of its relation to the prosperity of Canada and its people , the agreement was so advantageous to them that its rejection was regarded as well-nigh incredible . We did not think they would be so foolish . But they have overthrown the Laurier Government , not so much because they dislike reciprocity , as because of their desire to reaffirm in this grotesquely extravagant and costly way their loyalty to the empire . It is evident that they actually believed the stuff dinned into their ears by the Conservatives about reciprocity as the " thin edge " - of annexation , and that they believed , too , the preposterous falsehoods about our designs upon their independence , about our purpose to get hold of Canada by hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cunning and subtle beginning . In many ways Canadians are much more British than the British themselves . They are exceedingly proud of the empire and of their attachment to it , and they are sensitive on the point . Their unconquerable loyalty to the mother country is a quality altogether creditable to them , that no one in the United States would deny . Nor would any sensible person this side the border be disposed to " make fun " of that loyal attachment . It is only its extravagant and silly manifestations that provoke our mirth . Certainly the vote against reciprocity is the most extravagant price the Canadians have ever paid for their reputation of being loyal Britons . It was because the annexation talk , the slanders about President TAFT and his motives , and the falsehoods as to the Intentions of the United States ran in the actual course of Canadian Inclinations that these campaign tactics were so astonishingly successful . The Canadian voters believed the tales because their prepossessions inclined them to the belief . The period of sober second thought will come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can retrace their false step . They have voted to cut themselves off from the privilege of freer trade with their nearest and greatest market  --  and all because they were afraid somebody would think there had - been an abatement in their British loyalty . Of their total foreign trade 50 per cent . Is with us . Taking exports and imports together , their trade with the United States is $327,000,000 , against $234,000,000 with Great Britain . They imported ' from us in their fiscal year 1910 goods to the value of $223,000,000 , against $95,000,000 from Great Britain ; and they sold to us $104,000,000 , against ** to the mother country . We are ninety millions , just across their border , the greatest market the world can supply for their products . We want what they produce , and we have offered to remove altogether our customs duties on a great part- of them , and to lower the duties on others . Reciprocally , their Government had assented to similar tariff reductions that would have given them freer access as purchasers to our markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Canadian farmer that the agreement should be ratified . It was not less evident that the Canadian manufacturer would be benefited by securing free raw materials from the United States , and those benefits would have accrued in large measure , also , to the consumers of Canadian manufactures . The home market of the Canadian ? manufacturer was not menaced by the agreement . it was ' tether assured to him . It did not make so very great a difference to us , whether I reciprocity was approved or rejected . With Canada it made a material difference . Yet these promised benefits the Canadians have rejected by a vote which , apparent'y , represents nothing so much tui their fear lest the question of their loyalty to the - empire would be raised by a vote sustaining tAunran . It was a silly thing to do , it vim ptting away the real substance ' of lnati al advanfi tage because of a foolish and overstrained sentiment . The wiser man on both sides of the border will regret this decision , because , inevitably , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling the reverse of favorable to closer trade relations . No one regrets the Canadian refusal more than President TAFT , we suppose . In one sense it is a ' serious reverse for him politically . The negotiation of the Reciprocity Agreement was the conspicuous success of his Administration . ' That failing , his critics will be inclined to say that not much remains . Perhaps he will now wish that he had signed the Wool bill . That , at least , would have accomplished something . But if the failure of reciprocity is a political disaster to the President , there may be some compensations . The farmers of the United States , particularly those near the border , were , many of them , bitterly hostile to reciprocity . Had it succeeded , their resentment against Mr. TAFT would have continued . Now that it has failed through the act of Canada , their displeasure will diminish and they will the more easily forget Mr. TaFT 's part in making the agreement              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
