txt The Ramsperger-Manley bill providing for the construction of barge canal terminals is nothing if not stiff in its requirements . The Hon. ' EDWARD J. , Assistant Corporation Counsel of this city , is right when he says it lacks prope ' elasticity in attempting to settle arbitrarily by . " statute the depth of an excavation , - the length and width of piers , and - the angle - at ' which they shall be , built ; ? tho kind , quality , and size of storehouses to be constructed , and details of equipment for use for all time . These are matters for engineers to pass upon , according to present and future necessities of development . Yet the sponsors of this bill want the State to squander nineteen millions for canal terminals and facilities ' according to rigid terms in sixteen cities along the line of the barge canal system from Buffalo to Albany , and at thirteen points scattered from Dyckman Street along the river front . of Manhattan to Jamaica Bay . How can the Legislature know , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be submitted at the general election next Fall , that , at Pier 6 on the East River canal basin , " a concrete steel shed , at least 400 feet long and 80 feet wide , and a power-operated traveling crane , " should be installed ? The bill is invasive . It calmly appropriates docks belonging to this city , ignoring the fact that the city is represented by a fiscal body , called the Board of Estimate and Apportionment , and by , the Board of Commissioners of the Sinking Fund , the members of which , with the Commissioner of Docks ; control its water froilt . True , its up-State sponsors are willing to make it clear that the final decision of the Canal Board shall depend upon an agreement with its authorities for the selection of canal terminals in this city . But more than this iS necessary . The bill would have to repeal Section 71 of the Charter , which says something about the inalienable rights of the city to its properties . Here it is : The rights of the city in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , land under water , public landings , wharves. docks , streets , avenues , parks , and all other public places , are hereby declared to be inalienable . There is yet another trifling difficulty . These piers , which the bill would give to the State with their rentals " forever , " yield a revenue to this city . The State 's appropriation of a single pier , No. 29 , at the foot of Vestry Street , would mean a loss to the city on a capital investment of one million dollars . The money could not be better invested elsewhere . Besides , Section 211 of the Charter declares that a contract exists between this city and the holders of Its securities , pledging that the funds and revenues for the Sinking Fund shall not be diverted . Section 212 enacts that the Sinking Fund shall not be alienated or impaired and the " bonds and ' stocks so secured by law are hereby declared to constitute a preferred charge on the said Sinking Fund . " Moreover , , by the Debt-Limit law of 1910 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this city , and , if they are impaired , the improvement of waterfront facilities is by so much retarded . The State must have ample terminal facilities for traffic on ' its barge canal system . They will hardly be secured by the provisions of the RamspergerManley bill .
