txt THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IN NEW YORK CITY . Of the qualities and capacities of JOHN F. HYLAN , Mayor-elect of New York City , it is unnecessary now to speak . His standing in his profession of the law , his record upon the Bench as County Judge , his associates , the interests and the influences that brought to him the nomination for Mayor  --  all these were made known , perfectly well known , to the voters and to the people during the campaign . Knowing what there was to know about Judge HYLAN , some ** of the qualified voters of the city expressed yesterday their will to make him Mayor . By a very unusual pluralAy , by a vote substantially double that cast for . the Fusion candidate , they made known their preference for him over Mayor MITCHEL . The chief concern now is to consider what the new Mayor can do . That is in truth a matter of very grave concern , for he was the candidate of ; Tammany  --  the solid , irreducible minimum of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desires and purposes of that organization . In respect to ' some matters of high importance the people of the city may enjoy a sense of security , for irrevocable decisions already made and the laws of the State protect them against the worst consequences of Tammany audacity . The dual subway contracts are beyond the reach of the Mayor and his associates upon the Board of Estimate . The work under those contracts is nearing completion . The pay-as-you-go policy is secure , the debt limit shelters the city against the extravagant issuing of obligations . and the new administration would be bold indeed should it venture upon any large increase in the budget , since the present budget was one of the chief points of the attack made by its supporters upon the present city government . The great transformation , the worst consequences of the decision of the voters to discard a Fusion administration devoted to the public interest for a Tammany administration certain to be largely affected by Tammany interests , will appear in the new Mayor 's appointments of heads of departments . First of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner WOODS remains in office he will be the city 's shield of defense against some of the most serious of the possible evils that may result from the decision made yesterday . As the guardian ofipublic order and of public safety , Commissioner WOODS should resist all persuasions that he resign office . He may be removed , there will be a general fear that Mayor HYLAN will not be able to resist Tammany persuasions , Tammany demands , for his removal . But Commissioner Wows has the opportunity to increase his already great reputation by sticking to his post until he is forced out of it . ' The incoming Mayor will have the appointment of the seven members of the new Board of Education . It is disquieting to look forward to that consequence of the choice made yesterday , but there is no help for it . Mayor HYLAN will also have the appointment of the heads of all the departments , Docks , Parks , and the others . The electorate has so willed it , and if any of those who gave the successful candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ns hope that the next municipal election will bring forth the fruits of their repentance . We are to have a Tammany Government for the next four years , including the Board of Estimate ; Tammany throughout , the Mayor , Controller , the President of the Board of Aldermen , and the Presidents of all the Boroughs . The causes of this Surprising change la the temper of , the voters will be diligently sought for and variously identified . Mr. BizrozErr did not defeat Mayor MITCHEL , Mr. litizaurr did not defeat him . It , would appear that of the great vote that carried Mr. MITCHEL to triumph four years ago , some part was lost to each of his competitors . Mr. Bmerrr 's en%e support , we may suppose , was abstracted from . Mr. MITCHEL 'S vote of 1913 . A very large part of what he lost went to Mr. HILLQuIT . He lost also directly to Mr. HYLAN , and that chiefly , we take it , for two reasons . In the first place , every effort was made to secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that controlled that vote were exercised in his behalf . There have been many indications , too , that resentments growing out of the State Board of Charities ' investigation of city aid to institutions worked against Mayor MITCHEL , and Mr. HYLAN reaped the benefit of that . While it would be wide of the mark to assume that Mr. MrrcHEL 's defeat is evidence that the majority of the people ' of New York are not loyal to the Government of the United States or are opposed to its policy in the prosecution of the war against Germany , it would be a still greater mistake to ignore the evidence that causes related to the prosecution of the war did materially influence the vote . We have been engaged in the war long enough for large numbers of people to become conscious of the burdens and the sacrifices , not long enough to bring their hearts and minds to a noble realization of the objects for which we are fighting , of the disaster that would befall us should we be defeated . In thousands of families where sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps no m. " " er as yet feels the pride of service ' patriotically given , or realizes what would have- befallen us had it not been given . A year later , with time to understand what the war means , with rejoicing over victories or the firmer resolve that comes of defeat , the temper of this part of our population will be changed . Germany will greatly rejoice over the result , and misinterpret it , as usual . We know that ; and the pacifists , all opponents of the war , will say that New York has voted against war . The loyal people of the city will har to bear with what patience they may those flings . Against them they will be strengthened by the knowledge that New York City 's great contributions to the support of the Government in carrying on the war , contributions of money , of counsel , of service given without thought of personal reward , through pure patriotism , will be continued in unstinted measure .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
