These letters tell their own story . They were written to several intimate Dutch friends by a girl of the Orient who , in spite of her longing for Western freedom , remained always a true daughter of the East . Her great desire to educate her people was not to make of them pseudo-Europeans , but better Javanese . ? THE EDITOns . JAPARA , Java . I HAVE longed to make the acquaintance of a ' modern girl , ' that proud , independent girl who has all my symTranslated from the original Dutch by Amass Loosen SYMIERS. pathy ! She who , happy and self-reliant , lightly and alertly steps on her way through life , full of enthusiasm and warm feeling ; working not only for her own well-being and happiness , but for thegreater good of humanity as a whole . I glow with enthusiasm toward the new time which has come , and can truly-say that in my thoughts and sympathies I do not belong to the Indian world , but to that of my pale sisters who are struggling forward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted it . there is nothing I had rather do than give myself wholly to the working and striving of the new woman in Europe ; but age-long traditions which can not be broken hold us fast cloistered in their unyielding arms . Some day those arms will loosen and let us go , but that time lies as yet far from us , infinitely far . It will come , that I know ; it may be three , four generations after us . Oh , you do not know what it is to love this young , this new age with heart and soul , and yet be bound hand and foot , chained by all the laws , customs , and conventions of one 's land . All our institutions are directly opposed to the progress for which I so long , for the sake of our people . Day and night I wonder by what means our ancient traditions could be overcome . For myself , I could had a way to shake them off , to break them , were it not that another bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to my world ; and that is the love which I bear for those to whom I owe my life , and whom I must thank for everything . Have I the right to break the hearts of those who have given me nothing but love and kindness my whole life long , and who have surrounded me with the tenderest care ? But it was not the voices alone which reached me from that distant , that bright , that new-born Europe , which made me long for a change in existing conditions . Even in my childhood , the word ' emancipation ' enchanted my ears : it had a significance that nothing else had , a meaning that was far beyond my comprehension , and awakened in me an evergrowing longing for freedom and independence ? a longing to stand alone . Conditions both in my own surroundings and in those of others around me broke my heart , and made me long with a nameless sorrow for the awakening of my country . Then the - voices which penetrated from distant lands grew clearer and clearer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some who loved me , but to the deep grief of others , brought seed which entered my heart , took root , and grew strong and vigorous . And now I shall tell you something of myself , so that you can make my acquaintance . I am the eldest of the three unmarried daughters of the Regent of Japara , and have seven brothers and sisters . What a world , eh ? My grandfather , Pangerin Ario Tjondronegoro of Damak , was a great leader in the progressive movement of his day , and the first regent of middle Java to unlatch his door to that guest from over the sea ? Western civilization . All of his children had European educations ; all of them have , or had ( several of them are now dead ) , a love of progress inherited from their father ; and these gave to their children the same upbringing which they themselves had received . Many of my cousins and all my older brothers have gone through the Hooge-Burge Schole ? the highest institution of learning that we have here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers has been studying for three years in the Netherlands , and two others are in the service of that country . We girls , so far as education goes , fettered by our ancient traditions and conventions , have profited but little by these advantages . It was a great crime against the customs of our land that we should be taught at all , and especially that we should leave the house every day to go to school . For the custom of our country forbade girls in the strongest manner ever to go outside of the house . We were never allowed to go anywhere , however , save to the school , and the only place of instruction of which our city could boast , which was open to us , was a free grammar school for Europeans . When I reached the age of twelve , I was kept at home ? I must go into the ' box . ' I was locked up , and cut off from all communication with the outside world , toward which I might never turn again save at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown man whom my parents would choose for me , and to whom I should be betrothed without my own knowledge . European friends ? this I heard later ? had tried in every possible way to dissuade my parents from this cruel course toward me , a young and life-loving child ; but they were able to do nothing . My parents were inexorable ; I went into my prison . Four long years I spent between thick walls , without once seeing the outside world . How I passed through that time , I do not know . I only know that it was terrible . But there was one great happiness left me : the reading of Dutch books and correspondence with Dutch friends were not forbidden . This ? the only gleam of light in that empty , sombre time ? was my all , without which I should have fallen , perhaps , into a still more pitiable state . My life , my soul even , would have been starved . But then came my friend and my deliverer ? the Spirit of the Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient structures tottered to their foundation at his approach . At last in my sixteenth year , I saw the outside world again . Thank God ! Thank God ! I could leave my prison as a free human being and not chained to an unwelcome bridegroom . Then events followed quickly that gave back to us girls more and more of our lost freedom . In the following year , our parents presented , us officially ' with our free-dom . For the first time in our lives we were allowed to leave our native town , and to go to the city . What a great and priceless victory it was ! That young girls of our position should show themselves in public was an unheard-of occurrence . The ' world ' stoo d aghast ; VOL 124 - ? VO 6 ? tongues were set wagging at the unprecedented crime . Our European friends rejoiced , and as for ourselves , no queen was so rich as we . But I am far from satisfied . I would go still further , always further . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusements . That has never been the cause of my longing for freedom . I long to be free , to be able to stand alone , to study , not to be subject to anyone , and , above all , never , never to be obliged to marry . But we must marry , must , must . Not to marry is the greatest sin that the Mohammedan woman can commit ; it is the greatest disgrace that a native girl can bring upon her family . And marriage among us ? miserable is too feeble an expression for it . How can it be otherwise , when the laws have made everything for the man and nothing for the woman ? When law and convention both are for the man ; when everything is allowed to him ! Love ! what do we know here of love ? How can we love a man whom we have never known ? And how could he love us ? That in itself would not be possible . Young girls and men must be kept rigidly apart , and are never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the labors , the struggles , the sentiments , of the woman of to-day in the Netherlands ? We take deep interest in all that concerns the Woman 's Movement . I do not know the modem languages , alas ! We girls are not allowed by our law to learn languages ; it was a great innovation for us to learn Dutch . I long to know languages , not so much to be able to speak them , as for the far greater joy of being able to read the many beautiful works of foreign authors in their own tongue . Is it not true that never mind how good a translation may be , it is never so fine as the original ? That is always stronger ? more charming . We have much time for reading , and reading is our greatest pleasure ? we , that is the younger sisters and I. We three have had the same bringing up , and are much with one another . We differ in age , each from the other , but one year . Among us three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid ; I find them so : I love the reconciliations which follow . It is the greatest of all lies ? do you not think so , too ? ? that any two human beings can think alike in everything . That can not be ; people who say that must be hypocrites . I have not yet told you how old I am . I was just twenty last month . Strange , that when I was sixteen I felt so frightfully old , and had so many melancholy moods ! Now that I can put two crosses behind me , I feel young and full of the joy of life , and the struggle of life , too . Call me simply Kartini ; that is my name . We Javanese have no family names . Kartini is my given name and my family name , both at the same time . As far as Raden Ad jeng ' is concerned , those two words are the title . You are well informed about the Javanese titles . Before you mentioned it , I had never given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ' highly born . ' Am I a princess ? No more than you yourself are one . The last prince of our house , from whom I am directly descended in the male line , was , I believe , twenty-five generations back ; but Mamma is closely related to the princely house of Mcdeira ; her great-grandfather was a reigning prince , and her grandmother a princess . But we do not give twopence for all that . To my mind there are only two kinds of aristocracy , the aristocracy of the mind , and the aristocracy of the soul ? of those who are noble in spirit . I think there is nothing more commonplace than those who allow themselves to depend upon their so called ' high birth . ' I have always been an enemy of formality . I tare nothing for form . I am happy only when I can throw the burden of Javanese etiquette from my shoulders . The ceremonies , the little rules , that are instilled into our people . are an abomination to me . Among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony and speak our own sentiments freely . ILi order to give you a faint idea of the oppressiveness of our etiquette , I shall mention a few examples . A younger brother or sister of mine may not pass me without bowing down to the ground and creeping upon hands and knees . If a little sister is sitting on a chair , she must instantly slip to the ground and remain with head bowed until I have passed from her sight . If a younger brother or sister wishes to speak to me , it must only be in high Javanese ; t and after each sentence that comes from their lips , they must make a sembalt ; that is , to put both hands together , and bring the thumbs under the nose . If my brothers and sisters speak to other people about me , they must always use high Javanese in every sentence concerning me ? my clothes , my seat at the table , my hands and my feet , and everything that is mine . They are forbidden to touch my honorable head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even then without first making a senzbah . If food stands upon the table , they Javanese is not one language , but several ; there is one language far the aristocracy and another for the vulgar . A nobleman addresses an inferior in the language of the common people , Ngoko ; but he is always answered in High Javanese , known as Krbnia or court speech . Between the two there is a middle speech , Madja , used in familiar intercourse between friends and equals . ? Ton TRANBLATOR. must not touch the tiniest morsel till it has pleased me to partake of that which I would ( as much as I desire ) . Should you speak against your superiors , do it softly , so that only those who are near may hear . Oh , yes ; one even trembles by rule in a noble Javanese household . When a young lady laughs , she must not open her mouth . If a girl runs , she must do it decorously , with little mincing steps and oh , so slowly , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a hoyden . Toward my older brothers and sisters I show every respect , and observe all forms scrupulously . I do not wish to deny the good right of anyone , but the younger ones , beginning with me , are doing away with all ceremony . Freedom , equality , and fraternity ! For my little brother and sisters , toward me and toward each other , are like free , equal comrades . Between us there is no stiffness ? there is only friendship and hearty affection . The sisters say thee ' and thou ' to me , and we speak the same language . JAPAILA . Certainly , Stella , I can not thank my parents enough for the free bringing up which they have given me . I had rather have my whole life one of strife and sorrow than be without the knowledge which I owe to my European education . I know that many , many difficulties await me , but I am not afraid of the future . I can not remain content in my old condition ; yet to further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong chains bind me fast to my world . What will be the outcome ? All my European friends ask themselves this question . All can see that the situation is critical for us ; and then they say that it was a mistake for my father to give me the little education which I have had . No ! No ! Not on my dearest father lies the blame . No , and again no ! Father could not foresee that the same bringing up which he gave to all of his children would have had such an effect upon one of them . There is no help for it . Some day or other it will come to pass , must come to pass , that I shall have to follow an unknown bridegroom . Love is a will-o ' - the- wisp in our Javanese world ! How can a man and woman love each other when they see each other for the first time in their lives after they are already fast bound in the chains of wedlock ? I shall never , never fall in love . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thinking ; and I can have no respect for the Javanese young man . How can I respect one who is married and a father , and who , when he has had enough of the mother of his children , brings another woman into his house , and is , according to the Mohammedan law , legally married to her ? And who does not do this ? And why not ? It is no sin , and still less a scandal . The Mohammedan law allows a man to have four wives at the same time . If I could learn the Dutch language thoroughly , my future would be assured . A rich field of labor would then lie open to me , and I should be a true child of humanity . For , you see , I , as a born Javanese , know all about the Indian world . A European , no matter how long he may have lived in Java and studied existing conditions , can still know nothing of the inner native life . To understand that , one has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a riddle to Europeans , I could make clear with a few words . I can not tell you anything of the Mohammedan law , Stella . Its followers are forbidden to speak of it with those of another faith . And , in truth , I am a Mohammedan only because my ancestors were . How can I love a doctrine which I do not know ? may never know ? The Koran is too holy to be translated into any language whatever . Here no one speaks Arabic . It is customary to read from the Koran ; but what is read no one understands ! To me it is a silly thing to be obliged to read something without being able to understand it . Religion is intended as a blessing to mankind ? a bond between all the creatures of God . They should be as brothers and sisters , not because they have the same human parents , but because they are all children of one Father , of Him who is enthroned in the heavens above . Brothers and sisters must love one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! sometimes I wish that there had never been a religion , because that which should unite mankind into one common brotherhood has been through all the ages a muse of strife , of discord , and of bloodshed . What do we speak at home ? What a question , Stella , dear ! Naturally , our language is Javanese . We speak Malayish with strange people who are Easterners , either Malays , Moors , Arabs , or Chinese , and Dutch with Europeans . 0 Stella , how I Laughed when I read your question : ' Would your parents disapprove if you should embrace them heartily ? ' Why , I have yet to give my parents or my brothers and sisters , the first kiss ! Kissing is not customary among the Javanese. , Only children of from one to three , four , five , or six are kissed . We never kiss one another . You are astonished at that ! But it is true . Only our young Holland friends kiss us , and we kiss them back ; that has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss us , but never kissed them in return . Havelock Ellis says that the kiss is unknown throughout Eastern Asia . In Japan , as in Java , mothers kiss their babies ; but Chinese mothers sometimes frighten their children by threatening to give them the white man 's kiss . ? Tan TRANSLATOR . We have only learned to kiss since we have been such friends with Mevrouw Ovink . When she would embrace us , she would ask us to kiss her . At first we found it queer , and acquitted ourselves awkwardly . Does this seem strange to you ? No matter how much I should love one of my Dutch friends , it would never come into my head to kiss her without being asked . You ask why ? Because I do not know whether she would like it . It is pleasant for us to press a soft white cheek with our lips , but whether the possessor of that pretty cheek also finds it pleasant to feel a dark face against hers , is another question . We had rather let people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never embrace . Let me tell you a story that is neither amusing nor interesting , but dull and monotonous and long-drawn-out , and will demand much patience . It is the history of three brown girls , children of the sunny East ; born blind , but whose eyes have been opened so that they can see the beautiful , noble things in life . Already in her earliest youth , when emancipation was for her an unknown word , and when books and other writings which spoke of it were far beyond her reach , in one of the three sisters was born the desire to open the door of life . It was recreation hour at the European school at Japara . Under the yellow blossoming waroe trees in the school-yard , big and little girls were grouped in happy disorder . It was so warm that no one cared to play . Shut your book , Letsy , I have something to tell you , ' pleaded a brown girl , whose costume and head-dress betrayed the Javanese . A big blonde girl , who leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , turned round and said , ' No , I have to study my French lesson . ' ' You can do that at home , for it is not school work . ' Yes , but if I do not learn my French lessons well , I shall not be allowed to go to Holland year after next ; and I am so anxious to go there to study at the Normal School . When I come back later as a teacher , perhaps I shall be placed here , and then I shall sit on the - platform before the class as our teacher does now . But tell me , Ni , you have never yet said what you were going to be when you grew up ? ' Two large eyes were turned toward the speaker in astonishment . ' Only tell me . ' The little Javanese shook her head and said laconically , ' I do not know . ' The first thing that she did when she got home was to run to her father and lay the problem before him . ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He said nothing , but smiled and pinched her cheek . But she would not allow herself to be put off , and waited , teasing him for an answer . At last an older brother came in , and answered the question . Her greedy listening ears heard these words : ' What should a girl become I Why a Raden Adjoe a Javanese married woman of high rank , naturally . ' The little girl was satisfied with the answer , and went quickly and happily away . ' A Haden Adjoe , ' she repeated several times to herself . ' What is a Haden Adjoe ? ' The idea was with her always ; she thought constantly of the two words ' Haden Adjoe . ' She must later become such an one . She looked around her , saw and came in contact with many Roden Adjoes , regarded them attentively , studied them , and what she learned ( as much as a child could understand ) of the lives of these women , caused the spirit of opposition to awake in her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , that girls must marry , must belong to a man , without being asked when , who , or how . This little girl reached the age of twelve and a half , and it was time that she should say farewell to her merry , childish life , and take leave of the school-benches on which she had been so glad to sit , and of the little European companions among whom she had studied so willingly . She was old enough to coins home according to the custom of her country . It demands that a young girl remain in the house , and be rigidly secluded from the outside world until that time when the man for whom God has created her shall come and take her to his dwelling . She knew all too well that with the school door much that was unutterably dear would be closed to her forever . The parting from the dear teacher , who bade her farewell with such sympathetic , cordial words , counseling resignation , and from little companions , who with tears in their eyes pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nothing in comparison with the giving up of her lessons , the ending of her studies . She was so bent upon learning , and she knew that there was much more yet to be studied before one can even go through the lower school . She was ambitious , and she did not wish to stand below her little white friends , most of whom were going to Europe later , or her brothers who went to the High School . She implored her father to allow her to go to the High School at Samarang with the boys : she would do her best ; her parents would never have to complain of her . Caressingly he stroked the dark little head , his fingers pushed back tenderly the rebellious locks from her forehead , and softly and yet firmly , the word ' No ' came from his lips . She sprang up , she knew what ' No ' from him meant . She went away and crept under the bed to hide herself ; she wished to be alone with her grief . Once her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland to study with Letsy , his daughter , who was her friend . She listened eagerly and with shining eyes . Would you not like to go ? ' Do not ask me if I would like to go ; ask me if I may , ' came hoarsely from her trembling lips . Gone , gone was her merry childhood ; gone everything that made her young life happy . She still felt herself such a child , and she was that in fact , too , but the law placed her inexorably among the full grown . Ni sinned every second . She watched her younger sisters with hungry longing every time that they went out of the door , armed with their school-books , to go to the temple of wisdom where knowledge was to be found . For a time she tried to study her lessons by herself ; but it seemed useless ? a pupil alone without a master soon grows discouraged . With a deep sigh she hid her books away . " Ni found it hard , but not so hard as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She too closed her heart to her , because her child 's ideas were diametrically opposed to her own . Still her life was not so wholly colorless and dull . There were two who held to her , who loved her just as she was ; she felt their love warming her inmost being , and clung to them with all the tenderness of her thirsting heart . They were her father and her third brother ? the youngest of her older brothers . It is true that they could not satisfy her most intimate and dearest wish to be free ; could never gratify her longing to study . But her dear father was always so good to his little daughter , his ownsilly girl ; she knew that he loved her , she felt it . He would look at her tenderly , his gentle hands would stroke her cheeks , her hair , and his strong arms would go protectingly round her . And she knew that brother loved her , too ; although he had never told her so , had never spoken a loving word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand little delicate attentions of which only a loving heart could think spoke constantly of his warm affection for her . He never laughed at her when she told him her thoughts , never made her shiver with a cold ' Go your own way ; as for me , I am a Javanese . ' Ni felt so rich with the love of her two dear ones , and with the sympathy of her brother . But her father was not always with her ; he had his work to do , and where he worked she might not go . She must never go out of the fast-closed place which was her dwelling . And her brother was at home only once in the year , for he went to school in Semarang . Her oldest brother came home . He had obtained an appointment in the neighborhood and lived with his parents . If Ni had suffered before his coining , from the coolness of nearly all those who lived in the house with her , from their indifference to all that interested her , from her imprisonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirls added a thousand times to her distress . Ni was wild ; she could not dance - to the piping of her brother . Young people should be submissive and obey their elders , ' was constantly preached to her ; and above all , ' Girls must be submissive to their older brothers . ' But headstrong Ni could not see why this should be . She could not help it , that she should have been born later than her brother ; that was no reason why she should be submissive to him . She was not answerable to anyone , only to her own conscience and her own heart . She would never give in to her brother except when she was convinced that he was right . At first he was astonished , and later he grew angry , when he saw that a little girl who was half a dozen years younger than he dared to defy his will . She must be forcibly suppressed . Everything was wrong that Ni did . She was severely reprimanded for each little fault . No day passed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger ? he with a dark countenance and stem words that made her heart bleed , and she with quivering lips tremblingly defending her good right to do something which he wished to forbid . She was entirely alone in her fight against the despotism of her brother ? her future protector , whenever she should have the misfortune to lose her parents , until she should leave his roof under the protection of the man for whom God had created her ! He took very good care not to torment her when her fatherwas there ; father would never have allowed it , and he knew very well that she was too proud to tell . But the others who lived in the house were silent too , although they knew that she was within her rights . ? A girl had no right to do anything that would even partially detract from the importance of a man . It was not right for this girl to oppose her ideas to those of her self-willed brother . In later years , when Ni recalled all this , she could understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by everyone in the house , he was taught as a child to be selfish , by his mother most of all . From childhood he was taught to regard the girl , the woman , as a creature of a lower order than himself . Had she not often heard his mother , his aunts , and all the women of his acquaintance say to him in scornful , disdainful tones , ' A girl is only a girl ' ? It is through woman herself that man first learns to scorn woman . Ni 's blood boiled whenever she heard deprecating words about girls spoken by a woman . She had always been fond of reading , but now her love for reading became a passion ; as soon as she had time , when all her little duties were done , she would seize a book or paper . She read everything that came into her hands ; she greedily devoured both the green and the ripe . Once she threw away a book which was full of horrors . She did not have to look into books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : real life was full of them ; it was to escape from them that she buried her soul in realms which the genius of man has fashioned out of the spirit of fantasy . Her father took a great pleasure in her love of reading and showered her with presents of books . She did not understand everything that she read , but she did not allow herself to be discouraged by that . What she could not understand in the first reading became in the second less obscure , and at the third or fourth , it would be quite clear . Every unknown word that she found she noted down ; and later , when her dearest brother came home , she would ask him its meaning . And he helped his little sister so willingly and lovingly . A little brother was born , and this helpless baby held Ni back from misfortune ; be brought her again into the good path from which she had begun to wander . She was fast becoming a bad child toward her mother . She had closed her heart more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors of that heart spring wide open again . Little brother taught her what a mother is , and what a child owes to its mother . Four years went by , calm and quiet on the surface , but to those who could see below it , full of strife for Ni . She deleted material when she suggested some time ago that , without waiting for further arbitraments of capricious fate , we three go ahead and study here at home . We have had a governess for two months ; in her we have found a charming and affectionate friend . She is still very young , a girl of strong character who has left her family in the fatherland and come here to earn her daily bread . Dutch has always been my favorite study , and many people say that I am thoroughly at home in it . But , heavens ! fondness for a language is a very long way from knowledge of it . It is fortunate that I like Dutch so much , for I can understand easily how hard it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet are obliged to study it . Next to languages I like geology . I also enjoy mathematics , but I am still struggling with the groundwork of history . Not that I do not like history ; I think it is interesting and very instructive ; but the manner in which it is set down in schoolbooks has little charm for me . I should like to have a teacher who knew how to make the dry parts interesting . What I do think delightful is ancient history ; it is a pity that so little of it has come my way . I should love to study the history of the Egyptians , and of the old Greeks and Romans . I read in the paper that some Chinese girls had asked permission to take the teacher 's examinations . Hurrah for progress ! I feel like shouting aloud in my joy . Of what good is the preservation of a few old traditions ?

I have often wondered about the inner life of such a girl . It must certainly be full of poetry . During the last year I often heard something about myself which distresses me . I am a coquette . Do not spare me , but answer outright . Am I a coquette ? and if so , in what way ? I am seriously troubled , for I dislike anything that is inconstant . Someone , no slanderer , said that I speak with my eyes . Is that true ? I have asked my sister to watch me well , and to tell me what they see in me that is strange ; what there is in the play of my eyes . And my truth-loving little sister says ? she is always conscientious ? that my eyes dance as if they were saying much when I talk long ? never mind with whom . Believe me when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no thought of pleasing ; and that , if what she says is true , it is unconscious and in spite of myself .

I am told that I must modestly ( hypocritically ) cast down my eyes . I will not do that : I will look men , as well as women , straight in the eyes , not cast down my own before them . I know very well that we shall be made to promise , perhaps under oath , when we go from here , that we will not bring to our families the terrible disgrace of sharing our love and sorrow with a European ; on that point they can be at peace .

Then a Chinese convict , ' who had been friendly with us children , begged to be allowed to help me . My parents consented , and I was healed . What the medicines of learned men could not accomplish was done by ' quackery . ' He healed me simply by giving me ashes to drink of the burnt-offerings dedicated to a Chinese idol . By drinking that potion , I became the child of that Chinese divinity , Santik-Kong of Welahao . Our land is full of mysticism , of fairy tales , and of legends .

The atheist , Luke Rae-burn , is a great figure , and Erica Rae-burn too is a noble character , who from a zealous atheist becomes a sincere and believing Christian . They were a father and daughter who loved each other devotedly , and depended each upon the other . We read too the Soul of a People ; that is about Buddhism and is a beautiful book . We are anxious now to read something about Judaism ( do you not say that ? ) . Perhaps Zangwill 's Dreams of the Ghetto will be what we seek .
