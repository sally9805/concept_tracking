txt ? " Lefty Louie " finished a last appeal to Gov . Glynn at midnight . The letter was mailed immediately by Warden Clancy . Here it is : " Ossining . N. Y. , April 10 , 1914 . " Hon. Martin H. Glynn , Governor or the State of New York , " Your Excellency : I write this in behalf of Harry Horowitz , Jacob Seidenshner , Frank Cirofici and myself . I wish your Excellency would to beg your pardon for taking the liberty in making our last appeal to you who is the only human one , who has the power now , on God 's earth , to still listen to our last plea which we beg and pray that you will still grant . " It is 10:30 P. M. now , and we just got through saying our prayers to Almighty God . I feel it is the inspiration of Almighty God that caused us boys to make our last appeal just as we got through . " We read of your excellency 's statement stating that nothing could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could in any way change the result in this case . We know at that trial that it will be proven that Vallon and Webber fired the shots that killed Herman Rosenthal , and not us boys . " We realize deeply , your Honor , that there has been enough time to go before the judiciary , Put we never for a moIment thought that It would ever go as far as this , as we felt in our hearts that our innocence would be proven " Your Excellency , are you going to I send us boys to our death this Monday Imorning on such evidence as follows ? It is stated that the Becker case is an entirely different issue from ours . " In the opening address Assistant District Attorney Moss connects us immediately with Becker , and your Honor I can see we were convicted as soon as Decker was convicted . We went into ( that courtroom convicted men , con ' victed by the whole world at that time . " In your letters that the Hon. Judge Goff wrote to your Excellency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . " In his Honor 's charge to the Jury he said this is a conspiracy . The boys , the prosecution states , did this through fear , conspired with Becker through Rose . The same also was said by the District Attorney in his opening address to the jury . Rose swore on the stand he never wanted Rosenthal killed , the same thing Vallon , Webber , and Schepps swore to . " Now then , who did want this man killed , whom we never knew or saw in our lives ? Now there are four other witnesses they state either saw us at the scene of the crime or shoot . " No , 1 . Luban says he was at the scene of the crime . He identified Harry , Frank and myself . The Court of Appeals states in the . Becker opinion he is unworthy of belief and had a motive ; " Was n't it the same in our ease ? The same Luban at the Becker trial said he knew us well by our names , and he was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Dago Frank , " ' " Gip the Blood , " and " Lefty Loule . " Then we were called in " and Hued in - front or him ; and he was brought from a Jersey prison I which gave him his freedom . when he was asked to mention our names he answered , as to the names I get mixed up . Yet he said he knew us well by our names for a year and a half . " Two of his neices and brother testified for the defense that at the time he said he was on Forty-third Street he was at their home 10 miles . " No. 2 , William Shapiro , who was indicted with us boys and in the City Prison with us for a long while , could not identify any one of us as the men who rode in his can In the month of August , 1012 , in a room adjoining the Coroner 's Court , Shapiro was brought in there to identify Jacob Seidenshner and Frank Cirofici in the presence of ex-Police Commander Dougherty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own lawyer , A. Levy , and his partner , L. Libby . Dougherty ordered Shapiro to go and identify them , and Shapiro said no them are not the men . Then Dougherty said speak to them see if you can recognize their voices , and Jacob Seidenshner spoke to him and said to him , young man , did you ever see me in your life , and he answered , no . " This same Shapiro near the time of our trial was sent to Fifty-fourth Street Jail , where Rose , Schepps , Webber , and Vallon were , and given the same opportunity to dove-tail with their story . " No. 3 , Stanish , at the Becker trial , identified Seidenshner , and said he was in doubt about H. Horowitz , and said he had seen Seidenshner with an automatic Pistol forty-five feet away . " At our trial he said he was in doubt of Frank and testified different at our trial . His own landlady testified that she saw him run out of the house after the shots . were fired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath ' in the Coroner 's Court he said he saw B. Webber running away and Jack Sullivan bending over the body . Then he was asked could be identify anybody else and he answered , no not in their faces . " Your excellency would you send us to our death on such evidence ? If you do n't want to spare our innocent lives , then do it for the sake of our dear parents , wives and all who are dear to us . Your Excellency , we beg and pray that you will still grant this plea in the name of Almighty God and Justice.1 Your humble servants : " Louis Rosenberg , Harry Horowitz , Jacob Seidenshner , and Frank Cirofici . The letter is in Rosenberg 's handwriting , but each of the men signed for himself . WHITMAN IS PREPARED . Has Affidavits Ready to Upset the Gunmen 's New Ones . When District Attorney Whitman returns from Chicago this morning he is expected to take from his safe a bundle of affidavits which have not , yet been made public . These affidavits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearing on the order to show cause why a new trial should not be granted to the gunmen . Mr. Whitman 's affidavits , it is expected , will be matched with the gunmen 's . Anticipation of eleventh-hour attempts to upset the convictions in the gunmen 's cases led Mr. Whitman and his assistants months ago to investigate every story which was used in the gunmen 's behalf . As the result of these investigations the affidavits began to collect . It seems certain that the fight to free the gunmen will be waged mainly through ' " Dago Frank " Cirofici , the Italian . The District Attorney , it is understood , has two affidavits bearing on the alleged Frank alibi . One of these is said to be from a professional bondsman who was approached first when Frank 's sweetheart was arrested on the morning of the murder . The other is said to be from a woman who lived in the apartment house at 2529 Seventh Avenue , where " Dago Frank " lived . According to information which reached THE TIMES last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swear that he was asked by agents of the gunmen to make affidavit that Dago Frank approached him for bail at 2 A. M. The bondsman , according to this information , refused to swear that It was 2 A. M. , the hour that Rosenthal was murdered . Instead , he went to the District Attorney 's office and made affidavit that he was approached for bail at 4 A. M. The affidavit , it is said , exposes a plot whereby he was to have sworn falsely . In the affidavit of the woman , it is understood , it is set forth that a special messenger . came to " Dago Frank 's " house shortly after 2 A. M. on the morning of the murder with an imlortant message ; that he did not find " Dago Frank " in and that it was after I A. M. before Frank appeared . When Frank did come in , . the affidavit is said to allege , he was with the three rther gunmen who are now in the Death House at Sing Sing with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affidavit from a chauffeur who swore ? that he took Harry Vallon away from the scene or the murder in a taxicab . This taxicab. the chauffeur will show , was not the murder car . This chauffeur 's affidavit will probably be used to offset the two affidavits of the Connecticut man and the waiter .
