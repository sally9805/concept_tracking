 | For some years I have lived in a college town and have been much interested in student life , especially in fraternity life because that has been most conspicuous ; and while I have recognized the advantages which fraternities have had to offer to some students , I have heartily disapproved of many of their artificial standards of value and conduct . Most particularly have I been imprest with certain phases of development among the so-called " society " young women , who during their college course appear to acquire an exaggerated and superficial sense of their rights and privileges , while losing all sense of their duties to society . Others appear to swallow a whole college course and go back into the world with so little assimilated , with no fixity of purpose , and rooted only in the surface soil of life . Indeed , so often have I been imprest with these facts that I have felt there must be something radically wrong with a system of education which permits such development . Some time ago my friend , the Dean of Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college women . . She invited me to assist her at one of the gatherings and to give a " talk " to the sorority freshmen . The afternoon of the gathering to which I was invited was warm , and most of the sorority freshmen were out in their prettiest gowns , and in the best of spirits . There was a short musical program , after which I wandered about among the girls trying to get acquainted . Every one appeared to be having a good time until my " talk " was announced . Then suddenly they all looked as tho they had been trapt . When I announced further that I was going to talk to them about their faults , and smiled as tho I was perhaps only perpetrating a joke , they did not smile in turn . On the contrary , the pursed lips , the stiffened backs and the grim stares clearly indicated that they did not wish to be talked to , and , least of all , about their faults . I think I knew just how they felt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not blame them , and I was quaking before their manifest hostility . Yet withal , I persevered , nevertheless , and gave them my text . It was taken from an article by William James : " The best claim that a college education can possibly make on your respect , the best thing it can aspire to accomplish for you is this : that it should help you to know a good man when you see him . " But even the announcement of my text produced no relaxation in the hostile looks . After a few general comments , I said that I believed I could best make my point of view clear by telling a few of the many stories I had heard , which illustrated some of the customs and attitudes of fraternity students , and after I had finished I hoped they would be frank with me . If the stories were not typical and misrepresented them , they should freely say so . On the other hand , if they were typical and representative I trusted that they would be candid enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such standards of conduct . I then spoke of the fact that there is a common belief that many fraternity men can tell when a new-comer gets off the train , by the cut of his coat or general " get-up , " whether he would make a desirable fraternity man or not . To be sure , the cut of a coat or a man 's general " get-up " does not cover the requirements for eligibility to a fraternity , but mere material possessions are doubtless a tremendously important and impressive factor to many of these young men . To illustrate this same attitude among the women I then told the story of a young girl who had recently come to college recommended to one of the leading women 's societies . The girl 's mother and aunts had been members of the organization to which she had been recommended ; her own record as a student was excellent , and she personally had much charm , yet after having been several times elaborately entertained by the sorority in question she was finally rejected . Several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were much  | piqued at this and ventured to question some of the older girls as to the reason for their action . But they found it difficult to elicit any response . At last , however , one girl , who evidently felt strongly on the matter , blurted out : " Well , they say her people are quite poor now , and if you 'd seen the dowdy coat she wore to our evening party I guess you 'd have been for turning her down , too . " Following this story I repeated the comments of a young man who in deprecating the commercial standards among the sorority women , said : " For example , Miss S and I came here from a little backwoods town . We played together when we were children , and until a few years ago we always ran about barefooted in summer time . I dare say until she came here she 'd hardly even seen a cab , but now when we go to a dance , if it 's only two blocks away , she expects to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ' like that I do n't see how the fellows can help getting into debt . " I then read part of a freshman theme , written by a young girl on " First Impressions of Fraternity Life . " It appears that on the first Sunday evening , she was asked what she had been talking about so long and so seriously with the young man from her home town . When her sorority sisters learned that she had been seriously discussing serious matters , they informed her that this would not do ; that it was her duty to try to make her sorority popular with the fraternity men , who did not like girls who talked seriously . To this the young woman retorted with meek irony that she had always liked a little serious talk sometimes , but henceforth she would do her utmost always to talk frivolously to fraternity men . The story I wished to tell next was one , as I explained to the young women , which I had never quite credited , nevertheless I would give it as I had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom one of the young women was engaged ? at least she was wearing his fraternity pin , which is supposed to be equivalent to an engagement ? was absent . When questioned about his absence she laughingly replied , " Oh , he went to the city a few days ago on a little sporting spree . I suppose , and has n't got back yet . " " You seem to take it very cheerfully , " was the bantering retort of a young man who heard the remark . " Certainly I do , " she replied , smiling indulgently ; " you know I 've never had much use for a young man who is n't a bit of a sport . " After this I turned to one young woman who had previously attended another college which has gained the reputation of teaching students , before all else , to help themselves , and asked her to say what she had found was the most striking point of difference between the standards of the two colleges . The young woman rose reluctantly , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference she had observed between the two places was that at V ? ( a college where nearly every student does something toward supporting himself ) the most respected student was the one who was economically most independent , i. e. , the one who came the nearest to earning his own expenses , and at the same time did excellent college work , while at the college she was now attending , the one who appeared to be the most respected was the one who was most dependent , i. e. , who had the most given him or her by parents or friends , and who could excel in social or athletic lines rather than in scholarship . Calling upon one of the most popular girls in college , I asked her if she thought the stories I had been telling were typical of the general tone among fraternity students . To my surprize she replied that she thought the stories were , on the whole , comparatively mild and quite representative of the standards common among fraternities . For instance , she had often listened to the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her more than once that it would be pitiable if the character of the majority of students were no better than the character of their remarks at social functions . Furthermore , she believed that many of the ideas fostered among fraternity students were not of the sort to make them broad-minded , or to give them the right measures of value . After calling upon several others for comments , one young woman said she herself condemned the girls most for  | their attitude toward loose morals in young men ; that as long as girls winked at such habits , one need hardly expect anything better from young men ; and that she believed that very often women lived to repent bitterly for having taken so lax an attitude . I had been hoping for comments along this line and at this point I read first a little clipping taken from a talk by Jane Addams to some of the club women of Chicago , wherein she said , in effect , that it is time for the foolish , artificial barriers between mothers and daughters to be broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the world ignorant of the wiles and traps which beset them . Following this I read a few sentences from a paper read some time ago by President Emeritus Eliot , of Harvard University , before the American School Hygiene Association : The only alternative for education in sex hygiene is the prolongation of the present awful wrongs and woes in the very vitals of civilization . the policy of silence has failed everywhere . If any one protests that this educational process will abolish innocence and make matter of common talk the tenderest and most intimate concerns in human life , let him consider that virtue and not innocence is manifestly God 's object and end for humanity . This prompted various comments and questions mostly vigorous and to the point . I was amazed at the frankness and seriousness of some of these freshman girls , for I had heard that at the series of lectures given each spring to the college women by a prominent woman physician , some of the young women are greatly shocked , and even faint at the bare recital of plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it soon became obvious from the puerile questions and comments that some were ignorant of the simplest , most fundamental facts of sex relations . So mawkish , sentimental and unthinking were some of the comments as to make one feel that young women who were no better equipt to cope with the actualities of American democratic life , were fitted only for the high walls of the convent , and not for the unrestricted social intercourse of a co-educational college , where definite knowledge and convictions are imperative for right relationships . But presently these rambling comments developt into a live , serious discussion , and at last the definite point of discerning the symptoms of immorality was brought up . Here again some of the crudest , most sentimental opinions were exprest , tho it was interesting to note the readiness with which some of the saner young women exploded these foolish dream castles . Meanwhile , as the discussion waxed warmer , I became particularly interested in a little girl in a remote corner who appeared very young and shy , tho her face beamed intelligence and interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . After hesitating for a few moments she said : " It seems to me that one can have no definite formula for reading character or pronouncing upon conduct . Every young woman , during the years her character is being formed , if she thinks at all , realizes that certain influences appeal to the very lowest impulses of her nature , and others to the better impulses ; and if the conduct of a young man is such as appeals to those impulses which she is trying to suppress , she had better let him alone . " It was now growing dusk , and while on all sides there were others eager to make comments , I resolved that after this comment nothing more should be said ? for nothing better could be said . As for myself , I was no longer quaking before this body of censorious young women . I knew a few of them disapproved of the frank discussion we had had . I knew there would be outsiders ? members of the community and of the faculty ? who , should they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild terms . In fact , only a few days earlier , in discussing my plans for this " talk " with one of the prominent women of the community , she strongly deprecated such a move , maintaining that such discussion should be limited exclusively to mothers and daughters . To this I should have acceded gladly were it not that I knew , as every one knows , that the great majority of mothers still adhere to the old " conspiracy of silence " on these fundamental matters , which is unquestionably so often responsible for the undoing of their daughters .
