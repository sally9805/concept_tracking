txt After fifty-two minutes of deliberation the jury in the case of Patrolman Thomas F. Robinson , charged with bribery and extortion in Harlem , reterned a V erdiet of guilty 011 the count of extortion yesterday afternoon before Justice Seabury in the Criminal Branch of the Supreme Court . Robinson is the first of the alleged graft collectors for ex-Police Inspector Sweeney to be convicted by a jury . Members of the District Attorney 's staff , admitting that they had seen hundreds of defendants cases hopelessly fought in the criminal courts , said after the conviction that they had never seen a man who took his conviction with less emotion . Robinson , six feet tall and looking every inch a policeman , stood at the bar and faced the Jury with composure . Awn George S. Snyder , the foreman of the jury , spoke the words " Guilty as charged in the indict-. ment " there was not even as much as a gulp in the defendant 's throat . There was no cynical smile , either . Robinson appeared just as if his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied . Usually in criminal trials in which a defendant is found guilty a reaction front the bravado and recalcitrant attitude expressed during the trial is noticeable when the court clerk asks for the convicted man 's pedigree . There was no reaction in Robinson 's case , however . The policeman responded to the ten or twelve questions asked him in a clear , loud voice . The court attendant who tried to assist him by repeating the answers for him was not needed . Robinson 's behavior was so unusual , in fact , that Justice Seabury and members of the jury leaned toward him to observe him carefully . Robiumon Not It Witness . Robinson 's voice , in fact , had not been heard during the short trial . It had been expected that the prisoner would go on the stand in his own defense , and there was general disappointment when his lawyers rested their ease after calling only three witnesses . Why should we place Robinson on the stand ? " said - one of his lawyers during one of the intermissions. ' 4 Ito knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all it must be won on appeal , away from all prejudices and anti-police atmosphere . " The real reason why Robinson was not put on the stand , however , and why he took his conviction so stoically is probably deeper seated . An explanation gained free circulation throughout the Criminal Court Building yesterday and was concurred in by members of the District Attorney 's staff . it is believed that Robinson , because of his loyalty to the " boss " whom be represented when he extorted $40 from Luigi Tintf-restaurateur , on Sept. : 1 , last , has been assured of a life annuity by agents of the police graft system . One of Robinson 's own lawyers , It became known , practically admitted as much before the trial was half over . In vain did District Attorney Whitman try to get a plea of guilty from the patrolman after the trial had proceeded . Robinson chose to stand pat , for it was only by doing this , it was thought , that he could carry out his part of the contract and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the fact that the atmosphere of the ease spelled guilt and conviction for Robinson from the very beginning of the trial , it was learned later that two men in the jury were not at all in favor of voting for conviction when the case was first put into their hands . The point at stake concerned the testimony of Taneredi 's Italian waiter , known as " Spaghetti " Nigro . The State had shown , through Taneredi , that the S40 had passed to Robinson on Sept . Tancredi was able to fix this date by referring to the stubs in his check book , explaining that he had paid Robinson the same day when he had drawn the money out of Ills bank . That proof could not be counteracted . Then Nigro , the waiter , who admitted that he could neither read nor write , and who was not conversant with English , testified through an interpreter that he had seen the money passed on the evening of Sept. 3 , thus corroborating Tancredi . The defense showed that Nigro was unable to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the 2ury 's hands at 1:03 o'clock , after Justice Seabury had charged that the verdict be based only on the count in the indictment charging extortion . The jury first of all voted to go out for luncheon and it was 2:45 o'clock before the jury returned to the I Criminal Court building . It was between 2:45 and 3:37 o'clock that the deliberations took place . Not one of the jurors , it was said , expressed - the least doubt about the prisoner 's guilty connections with graft collection , and an oral ballot showed that only two were in doubt as to his guilt on the specific transaction of which Ile was accused . Get Court 's Ruling Again . A second oral ballot showed that one man refused to vote unless he could hear the Court 's ruling involving some parts ' of the Italian waiter 's testimony . This necessitated a return to the jury box for instructions , and Justice Seabury ' analyzed the waiter 's testimony briefly .

It was for cenviction . All the arguments in the summing up of both sides were deduced from the ' testimony ' taken on Thursday . Testerday 's .. - testimony , in fact , consisted merely of the statements of a character witness , a neighbor of Robinsoa , , . In. , . Brooklyn , that the prisoner had a good . reputation his neighborhood- ? assist= ? ant , District Attorney Moss , whe , ter , Int-4 ' Out:Seined this witneaa  --  brMight ; , Out4 tiv ; ** uothing : .

The elimination of other Character witnesses and the fact that the defense did not place the prisoner himself on the stand probably shortened tile trial by half a day . " If any money was paid to Robinson . " Said Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence of his sumlining up to the jury , " it was paid for protection and that would not constitute extortion ? ' Mr. ICopp drew a close distinction between " protection " money and money extorted for other purposes . The point Was purely technical , of course , and did riot indicate that the lawyer himself was much impressed with Robinson 's amnesty . District Attorney Whitman was not in , court , and Mr. Moss - replied to Mr. Kopp 's argument . He carried ' the jury over the whole case and made a dramatic appeal for a verdict of guilty . He , denounced ex-Inspector Sweeney and referred to the graft situation as a " malignant tumor on the body politic. " - Neither Sweeney nor any of the other - former Harlem Inspectors was in court . Sentence was deferred , on application of counsel , until next Friday morning , and Robinson , after a brief stay in the Sheriff 's room , where he bade farewell to some friends , was taken to his cell In the Tombs .

Floyd B. Pitts of the - Eldridge Street Station . who was in Immediate charge of four patrolmen found off post by Chief Inspector Schmittberger . The Chief Inspector had testified on Pitts 's trial that " if an officer is strict with his men and vigilant he can enforce good patrol duty , so that the men will not take as great chances as they would under a man who would visit them only once and would not return for a long time . " In fining Pitts the Trial Commissioner observed that " it was not for failing to patrol or for failing to do anything except to exert a proper discipline over these men and keep them on their posts .

Such a rule as is here attempted to be invoked would require a Sergeant to be upon every portion of every post in an extended precinct at every moment during his tour of duty . " . Pitts . it appears . had failed to report amy of the four patrolman found off post . by Inspector Schmittberger.
