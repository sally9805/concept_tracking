SIR : May a chronic grumbler presume to criticise your use of the English language ? A fortnight ago you published an editorial headed " The Social Evil . " Concerning the substance of the editorial , I need only say that it has my hearty approval . The action of the Post Office in excluding from the mails the admirable report of the Chicago Vice Commission seems to be , briefly , asinine . No ; my objection is aimed merely at the heading , " The Social Evil . " Why should any one call the evil in question " social " ? Emphatically , this evil is anything but social . ? Let me illustrate by means of examples of evils which are genuinely social . The order , you will note , is crescendo ! First , there is the tiresome five o'clock tea . One can not make an afternoon call without being asked by the gracious lady of the house , young , old , or middle-aged : " Sha' n't I give you a cup of tea ? " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous prostratiqn , neuritis , or other ailment of the sort . If you decline , you are set down as a boor or an ignoramus . Next , there is bridge . Think of the thousands of rational beings , especially in smart gowns , now wasting daylight  --  and money  --  over luck at cards . Then , there is drinking . True , the Glasgow factory hand is capable of finding delight in solitary " booze . " But mankind in general drinks in company . Conviviality nearly always includes drinking . What I have in mind more especially is the practice of men to get together in the evening , in clubs or similar places , theoretically to talk over the events of the day . Practically , of these sessions one may say : No drink , no talk . Last , but not least , there is the automobile . By tens of thousands men and women are now chasing over Europe , Asia , America , even Africa , for the mere fun of the chase . Like Rosalind 's traveller , they waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And all in company . No one rides solitary in an auto , except on strict business . All these abuses , and many more , are genuinely social . They spring from one 's desire to associate with one 's fellow beings . But the vice which you discuss shuns society , shuns the light of day ; indeed , shuns all light . Why , then , should the Nation , of all papers , indulge in mere euphemism ? Why not call the- evil in question by a name which fits ? Name it the sex evil , or the sexual evil , or , in one word , prostitution ? Perhaps , even sex or sexual is not precise enough ; for dancing might be defined as an entertainment of the two sexes . At any rate , " social " will never do ; it completely obfuscates the problem . H. October 16 . THE PENNSYLVANIA LYNCHING . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In an article on the Coatesville lynching ( Nation , October 12 ) , you conclude with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania say to it all ? " As a life-long resident of Chester County , and a descendant of Quaker ancestors , I feel free to state unqualifiedly that the " sound citizenship " of Pennsylvania has the same feeling about the affair that all the rest of the civilized world has or should have , if American civilization is anything but a very thin veneer on primeval savagery . For above twenty years my occupation has required me to travel extensively in the South and West , and it has frequently happened that I have been in or near places where lynchings by burning have been committed shortly after the crime has taken place . I have always felt it my duty to speak strongly on the subject , and have done so in many cases , in the face . of an inflamed public opinion . I have had this experience in West Virginia , Kentucky , Georgia , Texas , Kansas , Oklahoma , and Missouri , and have known of cases of this crime in Illinois , Ohio , and Delaware , the Coatesville case being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last . It is written that " faithful are the wounds of a friend , " and it is well to state the facts fully , which your article does not do . In its presentment , submitted on September 20 , 1911 , the grand jury says : " Throughout the whole course of our inquiry we have been hampered and obstructed by the attitude of the citizens of Coatesville and vicinity having knowledge of the commission of the crime and the identity of the criminals , " and again , " the testimony we have taken clearly demonstrates that immediately after the commission of the crime a conspiracy of silence ? was formed and the citizens of Coatesville who have knowledge which would assist in the administration of the law have deliberately concealed that knowledge and have refused to aid the officers of the law and this grand inquest in its administration . " This position on the part of the citizens of Coatesville , taken , as is well known , by leading citizens who were called by the grand jury with the idea that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conviction of the criminals , can only be ? explained by the coarse materialism of an industrial town  --  indeed , it was openly stated that a complete exposure of all the facts would " hurt the town . " So far , it is bad enough , but when it is remembered that , in the Swartz case , the defendant had made a confession that he had taken an active part in the crime , said confession having been legally admitted as evidence by the trial judge and having been corroborated by other testimony , and that he was forthwith acquitted by the jury , one of whom , after being discharged , offering to bet that the State would not obtain a conviction in any of the other cases  --  what can be said of a public sentiment that makes such a verdict possible ? A study of the conditions under which this crime of lynching by burning has taken place will show conclusively that it 1.3 a distinctly American crime , committed by men who have been through the public . schools , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with the Coatesville crime bears Cr , unmistakably American name , and the crime was planned in the house of the local fire company , which was presumably a body of trained men I am free to say that , in arguing this question of lynching , I have heretofore taken the position that , while violence of this nature might crop out anywhere under great provocation , in the older States it would surely be punished , and I must admit that I was mistaken . So far as I know , the old State of Virginia has the best record in the respect , probably because its citizens are not altogether " up to date " and have not cut loose from all the duties and responsibilities of civilization in the mad race after wealth If we are to be a law-abiding people , our public schools and higher educational institutions can not begin too soon to instil into the minds of the young men the importance of the fundamental principle of Anglo-Saxon civilization  --  the supremacy of the law . GEORGE ASHBRIDGE Whitford , Pa. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EDITOR OP THE NATION : SIR ? The writer must ask pardon for recurring again to the well-known and much-tortured line from Keats 's " Eve of St Agnes " ( see Nation May 11 and June 22 , 1911 ) : Clasp 'd like a missal where swart Paynims pray He does so only in the hope of offering for the second half of the line a more reasonable interpretation than has yet been given " Shut , " the rejected variant for " clasp 'd , " is a sufficient gloss on the first half . But why " shut " if the missal is employed by pagans in prayer ; or , if the sense of the line is merely that it is closed and unused " in Heathenesse , " why the misleading phrase , " where . . . Paynims pray , " for the last word suggests at once the use of the missal ? This , I believe , is indeed the poet 's intention . But , while the literal meaning is that the devotion of the pagans is in some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as stirred rather by the loveliness of the sleeping Madeline , of which the clasped missal is one among other beautiful images . This rapid transference of a quality from the object to the image has an exact parallel in two lines from " The Rape of the Lock " : On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore , Which Jews might kiss and infidels adore . Here we are by no means to infer that the adoration of Jews and infidels was attracted chiefly by the ornament . The " silver cross " " on Madeline 's fair breast " might even suggest that Keats had this very passage in mind . An earlier parallel , and one in which the notion of heathen worship of Christian beauty rises naturally from the situation , occurs in Thomas Hudson 's translation of the " Histoire de Judith " of Du Bartas. included in the 1608 and later editions of Sylvester . The passage is in book iv , lines 357 ff. , and describes the sensation created by Judith as she is led captive through the Syrian camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Made heathen men of her more Idolastre . The phrasing is not felicitous , but the story is always attractive , and the passage a small oasis in the wastes of Hudson 's translation . The travels of either Keats or Pope in " realms of gold " might easily have led him to one of the old folios in which the poem occurs . Aside from the possibility that the line in Keats is reminiscent of his reading , the interpretation offered seems , if not obvious , at least more pleasing than one which would involve the poet in an obscure reference to some missal , ornamented with kneeling converts , and known only to himself and his friends , or , still worse , one - which would substitute prey for pray and convict him of misspelling and of an inevitable pun ALLAN T. : WESTCOTT Columbia University , October 18 AN OLD SPELLING REFORMER . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The subject of spelling reform is still sufficiently alive , I hope , to make an early attempt toward it interesting . In 1765 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y , alias Y , " the posthumous work of Thomas Edwards Edwards is known to the few who know him at all as the keen critic of Warburton 's Shakespeare , as one of the revivers of the sonnet , and , perhaps , to some as a friend and correspondent of the novelist Richardson It was with the seventh edition of his " Canons of Criticism , " the exposure of Warburton 's critical methods , that the " Account " appeared . Edwards was not an . innovator , but a reactionary in orthography , his objects , as he tells us in the preface , being " Uniformity . . and , Preserving . . . the marks of our Etymology . " It is interesting to note that some of the spellings which the Simplified Spelling Board is to-day trying to introduce , Edwards urged in 1765 as etymologically correct , while others were then generally used . " Once on a time , " the " Account " begins , " the English Commonwealth of Letters , generally called the Alphabet , was very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the letter Y into such words as Wide , Lyfe , Knyght . Apollo , being appealed to , gave " i " about the position it occupies to-day , and then asked if the letters had any other grievances . D and TH each seized this chance to complain of the position of the other in Murder or Murther . The matter was referred to a committee of Anglo-Saxons ? Apollo apparently not feeling at home in the language of our forefathers ? " and in-the meantime the Poets had liberty given them to use either , as would best suit their rhime . " OUGH then petitioned " to be restored to the end of the words Tho ' and Thro ' . " The request was granted , with an emphatic censure on the " new-fan-gled way of leaving out such letters as are not pronounced . " After S had got back his place in Defence , Pretence , etc , a complaint was presented " of 0 against U for intruding into the words Honour , Labour , Superiour , and the like . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all words derived from the Latines ending in OR " The next matter was not so easy . It was the petition of N " that G might be excluded from the words Foreign and Sovereign , " seconded by A , who begged that he might have the place of E and I on the same words . Apollo , who seems to have been attending a German seminar since leaving Parnassus , decided to " take time to consider the case " He granted , however , the request of E ' that those words which are now absurdly writen Claim , Prevail , &c.,; may hereafter be spelled Clame , Prevale . &c; ' Then followed " A Complaint of ED against T , for justling him out of the ends of Verbs of the preterperfect Tense , and of Participles " But here Apollo , with a shrewdness for which he has not always been given credit , concluded that " The Court had sat late , and therefore referred this petition to another Day ; and adjourned " RAYMOND D HAVENS The University of Rochester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE NATION : SIR ? Though we naturally differ from the estimate you place upon our biography of Robert Ingersoll , yet the facts contained in the review ( Nation , October 5 ) are in the main correct . One glaring error . however , is your statement that " the writings of Ingersoll are already dead " For a number of years we have publishedtheDresden edition of Ingersoll 's works in conjunction with Mr C P. Farrell , representing the Ingersoll estate , and in that time have sold above 70,000 volumes at prices ranging from $2 50 per volume up During the same period , Mr. Farrell has sold hundreds of thousands of the lectures in pamphlet form . These are facts , not estimates , and prove conclusively that Ingersoll 's writings are very much alive . DRESDEN PUBLISHING CO . New York , October 17 . We admit that we had no notion of the continued and extensive sale of Ingersoll 's works . Such a sale manifestly represents a certain kind of vitality . The almost complete absence of reference to Ingersoll in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has quite lost such significance as , in his lifetime , could provoke the controversial ire of Gladstone . His particular method of attacking Christianity is a dead thing of the past. ? En . THE NATION.
