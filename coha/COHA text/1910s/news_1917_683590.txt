txt PATRIOTISM AND PROFITS . A Country Publisher Refuses to Mix Them in This Time of Crisis . THE MALTA CALL , P. R. Flint , Publisher . Malta , Mon. , Nov. 27 , 1917 . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have been a reader both of THE New YORK Times and also The American Press , published by Courtland Smith and contributed to by Arthur Brisbane . I am a country publisher , which , I presume , your readers would think ? coming from the country  --  would mean that I have hayseeds in my hair , bluebibbed overalls , and such other garb befitting a rural inhabitant But , feeling that the time has come to call a halt to the propaganda being spread by The American Press , I write you information which you may use as you see fit . In the recent second Liberty Loan campaign , The American Press clamored for paid advertising from the Government for the " poor " countrY newspaper man . They spent a lot of space in a Washington paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to advertise in the rural papers . The American Press has a contract with me , or rather I with them , to qecure for me foreign advertising , for which I shall pay them 15 per cent . In all such matter I have given them their commission , or rather it has been deducted from my price , ( as they pay the bills and collect , ) and I have been satisfied with their service . But  --  there are just two things that The American Press contract does not call for . One is , they can not intercede between my Maker and myself , and the other , I handle my own business with my Government . Just as long , as I run a country newspaper , the Government is free to use any part of it for publicity to help the cause along and use it free of charge . I feel that I can afford that , besides buying a few bonds too . If it were not for the Government I could n't run a newspaper , and I feel I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country newspaper men feel the same as I do . As far as " foreign " advertising is concerned , I do not consider this grand Government of the free people of the United States of America as " foreign , " and therefore any business dealings with the Government do not come under the terms of the contract . And then , no small item would be the 15 per cent , which The American Press would receive should they be successful in selling the Government three millions of country advertising , Figure it out and you would find they could afford several two-page ads in the Washington paper which , I understand , Mr. Brisbane himself owns . They are no doubt sincere and patriotic , but if the country papers should be so lightly led as to demand pay , and in handling the matter make a failure of a loan* aimpaign , The Americsm Press would then be very near guilty of throwing a big wrench into the Government machinery ; but they never could do that , for the Press boys are too loyal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sound good to me , and in so far as my publications are concerned the world may know that The ameri.mn Press can not hand me advertising from the Government and make any 13 per cent . from it . I believe in a little sacrifice . Transformation Through Drill . It was with great gratification and interest that I greeted the news last Spring that the Military Training in High Schools bill had been passed by the Legislature . My expectations and prophecies that the result would prove a success were realized when I met a so-called " victim " of this training whom I had not seen for quite some time ? or , to be exact , since last June , ( the bill became effective in September . ) Wbat a transformation ! This fellow , whom I had previously regarded as a " tenderfoot " and whose conversation and ideals were none too patriotic , after a lapse of half a year appeared as stalwart and muscular as Samson and a genuine T. R. when it came to patriotism . He surely looked the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wondering if such training could be supplied for the working boys from 18 to 21 years of age , 250,000 strong , the majority of whom are executing clerical duties which offer little or no physical exercise . This training is more advantageous to them than to the schoolboy , whose school day consists of five hours . Then , again , these same young men , or a great majority of them , atilt be , called in the next draft , and if they have had military training and experience it will certainly be beneficial to them as well as Uncle SOM , and a blow to the Kaiser . Liberty Loan Installments . Frank E. Sprague , who writes about its stailment payments of Liberty Bonds and the inaonvonience that may be mot by some subscribers in meeting installments , does not semi to be aware of the fact that under a special section of , the banking law savings and loan associations in this State can buy and sell United States Government war bonds without profit , and preferred . Several millions of dollars of bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The associations are found in every neighborhood , they generally meet at night , and they do not insist on a dollar a week , merely requesting the subscriber to pay up his bond within a year . There is no need whatever for any red tape , everything should be plain : the " man on the street " in this countrY knows nothing whatever about bonds and needs to be educated . An war bond selling should have the patriotic note predominant . Without making any invidious comparisons . I beg to inforan hir . Sprague that the savings and loan associations selling bonds on the installment plan are losing money , so far a that is , ? oncerried , but on the other hand they are intensely patriotic , their motto being " The American home , the safeguard of American liberties . " A Record in Good Faith . The papers have been saying a good deal lately about one man 's failure to account for noney he obtained by the sale of Liberty 3onds . That is news . But no paper has =lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bends and between 1,000,000 and 3,000,000 persons engaged in selling them , and that no other charge of ' allure to account for money collected bag *en made . People bought bonds of strangers ni the street and in booths , and from those ? ? ? orn they would net see again , and yet here was almost no dishonesty . The record for honesty is marvelous and deserves some The School Loyalty Pledge . In your issue of Nov. so you published the sledge of loyalty of the District Superintendalts of the public schools with the , caption hat the pledge was signed by all except two If the Superintendents . This was an unintenlonal error which I treat you will correct . at present , owing to death and retirement , there are two vacancies in the corps of Diarict Superintendents . The pledge wee signed ry every person holding that position in the athlio schools of this city . JOSEPH H. WADE , chairman Loyalty Committee Association of District Superintendents . SHIP TRANSPORTATION AND THE SUBMARINE . Perfect Record of the American Navy Thus Far Recalls that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Almost Negligible . In a leading article in yesterday 's New YORK TIMES , some very interesting  --  and quite proper  --  comments were offered on the triumph achieved by the American Navy in sending so many troops to France without a single soldier being lost by submarine attack . In the course of this article it was pointed out that Great Britain in three years had sent 2,000,000 men to France , a prodigious achievement , but simplified because " the Channel course had been protected by an intricate system of steel netting that was impervious to torpedo attack . " Moreover , the battle of Jutland had put an end to any German attempt to dispute the general British command of the seas , so that , in spite of this frictionless movement of troops being an achievement that commanded admiration , the actual ferrying did not present a delicate problem . This argument was used to enhance the American performance , by showing that the success achieved lair Great Britain was one in tar easier conditions . I do not think the writer has got all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the very high credit which the United States Navy deserves is in the least diminished when the true scale and character of the British achieve -- ment is understood . To realize what this is we must bear certain elementary facts in mind . First , no part of the British Channel is impervious either to torpedo attack or , for that matter , to submarine passage . The immunity of our transport service is not to be explained by any absolute physical bar , but by active and mobile efforts of offense and defense which make the risk of submarine attack so great as simply not to be worth while . So much for the main routes of military supplies between England and France , which in the aggregate represent about 200 sea miles in length . But secondly , while the bulk of our men have been sent over to France , and almost as many brought back as have been sent , and these have gone over this route , protected not by impenetrable walls , but by exactly the same means as are employed for the protection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vastly greater numbers  --  yet very large forces have also been dispatched to the Mediterranean for Egypt , for Gallipoli , for East Africa , and for other fields of war ; and the wounded and war-worn men brought back to England , and every one of these has been almost continuously within the zone of submarine attack not for a few hours together , as happens in the journey to and from France , but for days and weeks . This being the case , the following figures are surely significant : The total number of fighting men carried on the seas and passing through the submarine zone in the course of the war exceeds 13,000,000 , and less than 3,500 have been lost , which makes a loss of about .025 per cent . If we regard , as of course scientifically we must , sea transport subject to submarine attack as a part of our lines of communication between British ports and the French and other fronts on which our men have to fight , we must include these casualties with all the other mishaps that reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement actively against the enemy . Once landed in the French , Egyptian , Turkish , African , or Greek port , troops are liable to have their numbers diminished by sickness , overwork , privation , occasionally unavoidable accidents to railways and other means of transport , and , finally , by hostile actions behind the lines by airplanes and long-distance gunfire . I have no idea at all of what actual statistics showthe percentage of diminution by such means of fighting forces to be , but it must be considerable , and at times must run at least to 4 or 5 per cent . If it doee , it would seem as if the submarine attack can not be responsible for more than one-two hun dredths of the total deduction from till fighting force  --  which Is trivial . It is very largely because this has been , the first object of our naval forces that the protection afforded to merchant shipping has been relatively so unsuccessful . If we have lost twentyfive-thousandths of 1 per cent . of our soldiers in transport in three and a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our merchant shipping in nine months  --  a rate of loss almost 600 times higher . Had there been destroyers and patrol vessels enough , guns enough , and trained officers and men enough also , exactly the same protection could have been extended to merchant shipping as was given to the military transport . And exactly the same results would ? have followed . Failing a sufficiency of men and materials to give this protection to each ship individually , the only thing to do was to concentrate merchant shipping into convoys so as to make the defensive element go around , and then to start upon a general independent offensive against the submarines . It is to the first part of this program that the defeat of the submarine , ae a sure engine of German victory , is due . The second part of the rrogram has so far only been realized on a comparatively small scale . The larger and more sweeping attack on the submarine is still to be made . But the omens are now favorable for its rapid development , and it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually determined altogether within very few weeks of the anniversary of the attempt to employ it on a ruthless but decisive scale . What seems to be extraordinarily fine in the American performance is the fact that , with very short experience of antual war conditions , the very best theory was evolved and promptly embodied in the most admirable practice . The naval forces of the United States , that is to say , took to war as to the manner born , and when the submarine actually was at its highest and most menacing Point equaled in the most dangerous part of the field , and with a personnel largely extemporized and with craft suddenly seized or recently requisioned. the achievement of the British Navy , Whose introduction to this sort of ordeal had been gradual and whose mastery of the conditions had been progressively acquired . It is a success on which America and the Allies can , it seems to me. be congratulated , not only for its own sake , but for the high promise which the co-operation of men of such proved resources and resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an elementary condition of war that each side is always striving to create novel conditions for the other . Unless those engaged in war cultivate a constant willingness , or , better , a driving anxiety to learn , a more ingenious opponent must get the better of it . One of the reasons why the French and British are so greatly the military superiors of the Germans on the western front is that each allied army is not only taking daily lessons from the enemy , but hourly lessons from each other as well . I can not help hoping for a state of things in which the British and American Navies will each do for its ally what the comrade armies in France have done . Nothing can exceed the cordiality that marks the relations of the seamen of the two countries . But I should like to see cordiality developed into co-ordination , and mutual respect into joint responsibility . This is why I attach a value to the success in getting the troops to France in this country greater than the immediate military value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It proves the war fitness of the American fleet and shows that at the service of that fleet there must be directing minds whose help will be as effective at the council board as are the active forces of that fleet in tile stricken field of war . SPIRIT OF THE ALLIANCE . Victory Through h Higher Loyalty Than Merely National Interests . I have been spending two months in America upon a mission of friendship , and am now about to leave , desiring to spend Christmas at my home in London . During my stay here a thought has been much present in my mind , to which I would ask permission to give utterance . What an immense potentiality  --  both for victory in the war and for the reconstruction of international society after the war  --  the great ' , alliance against Germany can become if only the temper and demeanor of each ally to the other be worthy of the sacred cause that unites them and to the task which it has been given them all to achieve : It is notoriously difficult to achieve unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of an alliance separated by distance , by relative size and strength , by language , by national habits and temper , and perhaps by the memory of old antagonisms . Some have borne or are bearing the burdens and sacrifices of the war more than others . For these , it is hard to be reminded by powerful and sanguine newcomers of the mistakes they have made and the failures with which they have met . Upon others ( as , for instance , Russia ) the paralysis of an internal revolution has fallen , and it is hard for them to bear the daily lectures of faithful friends 89 to their incapacity , poorness of spirit , and feebleness of will . The desire and effort of the common enemy will be , we may be sure , to foment by every means discord and jealousy among the Allies ; to give currency to disparaging comparisons of their relative efforts for the common cause ; to circulate heedless and shallow judgments of one against another ; to recall old national jealousies and antipathies ; and thus to weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can , if it be truly united in spirit , put through this war to a decisive and victorious conclusion and achieve a just and lasting peace for the bleeding and sor rowing world . In a discourse in New York a week ago Dr. J. H. Jowett used these significant words , which I will take leave to apply to the mutual relations of the Allies in the present war : Jealousies breed in loyalties which have lost their enthusiaam . Mean jealousies can not possibly live in a clean and pas . slonate devotion . In these great regions of the soul a big fire is an invincible defense . Let each of us who are Allies cease to impugn the motives with which the other entered the war ; cease to excite jealousies by vainglorious boastinea or anger by light-minded criticism ; cease to patronize , cease to complain , cease to up- braid , cease to underestimate each others ' service to the common cause . Can not we strive to be as magnanimous as our causa is pure and great , and as generously appreciative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed the case ) they were our brothers ? The cause of the Allies is not yet won . Difficult days are before us . But the one chance of ultimate victory for the enemy lies in a lack of spiritual union , of loyal and generous-minded comradeship , among those who now confront Germany and are pledged to achieve her defeat Abraham Lincoln gave a mighty slogan to the men who won American unity ? " With malice toward none , with charity to all . " The soldiers in the ranks will play their part today , we may be sure . If the newspapers and civilians at home can attain to something of the Lincoln spirit in  --  this present conflict , and " rise to the height of this great argument , " the victory of the grand alliance need never be in doubt . If the war can create in us something greater and finer than the mere nationalist spirit , namely , the international mind and temper , it will not have been ; aught in vain , and there will be the best auguries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
