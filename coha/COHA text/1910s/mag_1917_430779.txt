 | In many aspects the bearing of this war upon religion has been notable . Hardened men have sought soul-purging in the face of a sabering crisis ; chaplains , braving death and far transcending merely official ' duties , have eagerly promoted the welfare and comfort of the men ; Catholics have joined hands with Congregationalists , Jews with Greek Orthodox Christians , in a work of human uplift ; hymns have risen in many choruses to the accompaniment of bursting shrapnel ; hundreds at the voice of one priest have received absolution on the eve of battle ; by common agreement the people of a nation have united in daily prayer " as the hands of the clock point heavenward at noon . " Such inspiring manifestations as these have produced the feeling that a heightened spiritual sense accompanies war . As a result , one of the leading general . effects of war and of warlike preparation may , perhaps , have been obscured : the very tendency to associate religion with war causes a reversion to a primitive type of religion , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In war you have religion for the ends of the state rather than for the regeneration of the individual , and such a political tincturing must needs alter the character of any faith . As the task of the following pages is to weigh the values underlying the religious utterances of the present German ruler , we may turn at once to a consideration of the Kaiser 's attitude toward God . A brilliant French writer , Henri de Noussanne , who probably overestimates his own objectivity in calling his book " Le Veritable Guillaume II , " has given us a suggestive  | chapter dealing with Emperor William 's reactions toward deity . " William , " he says , " delights to pose as the inspired of God , and no name , perhaps , occurs so often in his speeches as that of the All-powerful . Faith in God , ' he declared , and in God alone , is the foundation of this Empire . " l am your Emperor by God 's unfathomable decree . ' You , 0 Germans , are the chosen people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you men , and fight against the Amalekites . ' There must be one Empire , one people , and one God . ' " He further points out that this old God of Germany is a national God ? maser Gott ? who constitutes the Kaiser his spokesman and whose particular mission seems to be to intervene in his favor . It is the God of Arminius , of Alaric , of Charlemagne , of Frederick the Great , the God who was appealed to again in the patriotic songs of 1814 and 1870 . This All-powerful , and rather special , God brought terror to the legions of Varus , smote guilty Rome , inspired the great Charles and William the First , and caused to spring from the German soil such geniuses as Luther , Kant , Goethe , Moltke ; it is He again who suggests to Germans today the thought of the mundane mission which it is theirs to fulfill . A perusal of the Emperor 's speeches reveals an unconscious tendency to associate religion with national and dynastic glory and with war . Whether attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking from a pulpit , or conducting prayers on a warship , the same characteristic refrain runs through his addresses . On one occasion a celebration in commemoration of Luther calls forth a glorification of the Hohenzollern house and the Prussian army . Again his guards are urged to become good Christians that they may be good soldiers and in the same breath they are reminded of the uniform of their King by which they are specially honored . On the tenth anniversary of his accession he attributes his success to reliance upon the army and trust in God , declaring that the army is his country 's main tower of strength , the main pillar supporting the Prussian throne to which God " in His wisdom " had called him . In a military divine service while addressing a group of officers he glories in his army " grouped around their banners , bending the knee to the Lord of Hosts . "  | At a time when the German chastisement of China is the foremost national policy he preaches a characteristic sermon on his yacht , the Hohenzollern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text . ( Exodus xvii , 11 . ) " Again , " he declares , " the pagan spirit of Amalek has stirred in far Asia . . . And again God has ordered : Choose men , go forth and fight against Amalek . ' A grim terrible struggle has begun . " In the same discourse he thus elucidates the " sacred power of prayer " : " The fervent prayers of Moses made the swords of the enemy dull . . . and pinned victory to the flying banners of Israel . And if the prayers of Moses accomplished this , is it to be thought that our prayers will prove of no avail ? God has not taken back a single syllable from his promises . Faithful prayer can throw even today the dragon banner into the dust and plant the cross upon the walls . . . . Yet the Lord liveth . Our great Ally still reigneth . God Almighty , who can seize upon the strongest walls as if they were cobwebs and who can scatter the mightiest armies like heaps of sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be against us ? " After the sermon dealing with " prayer , " the Kaiser prays : " Almighty God , dear Heavenly Father . Thou Lord of Hosts and Leader of battles , we lift up our hearts to Thee in prayer . . . . Lead Thou our men to glorious victory . . . . Lead us in battle . We praise Thee because Thou aidest us , and our flag is hoisted in Thy name . Lord , we will not cease to importune Thee unless Thou blessest us first . Amen ! 1 It is always the God of Battles , the wrathful Jehovah , the Lord of Hosts with whom the Kaiser deals : the lowly forgiving Christ of the Gospels hardly appears in the imperial invocations and addresses . His appeal is to God , the source of his own divine power to rule , to the mighty God who can steel the German power of attack and confound Germany 's enemies . It is a tribal deity that he invokes , ? God , the Ally of the Teutons . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform .  | II There are many considerations which complicate the rather ungracious task of evaluating a ruler 's piety . When a sovereign repeats the name of Deity and confidently appropriates the grace and support that flow from religion , we would know whether genuinely spiritual motives actuate him , or whether he is primarily concerned with preserving his religious status in the eyes of the uncritical multitude of his subjects . An anti-religious attitude is unacceptable in any ruler : even tolerant Americans would never raise to the presidency an atheistic or anti-Christian candidate . But just as in private life the superficial advantages of a Christian profession may be appropriated without the price of discipleship being paid , so in the field of royal experience the credit for being sufficiently religious may , perhaps , be cheaply bought . If there is a ring of religious earnestness to catch the ear , the common run of men will pay as little heed to what lies back of the uttered syllables as an audience gives to the actual content of meaning in the oral cadences of a spell-binder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his Majestic Self . It is valued because it identifies him with the mysterious , incomprehensible forces above nature which create a feeling of awe and strike terror to the heart . Such a monarch tends to think of himself not as obedient to divinity , but as associated with divinity . It is not merely God that works wonders for the nation : it is " God and my crown , " or " God and my army . " Whether the crown and the army are working in line with the divine will seems not to be questioned . The imperial will that is accustomed to think of itself as law on earth tends also to feel that the forces of omnipotence are at its back . The exhortation to religion becomes , as it were , a clause in national field service regulations , just as the morale of troops is known to have a distinct military value . Suppose one were to take away the obvious advantage of this sort of royal religion . Suppose we eliminate the awe of the multitude , the impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people and the army in an invincible , divinely-appointed monarch , the sanction of the supernatural and the solemn effect of the mysterious , ? is it to  | be supposed that we would still hear such frequent repetition of the Almighty 's name in the imperial speeches ? There is , it must be admitted , something captivating about the medieval theory of divine right monarchy . If a man is monarch by divine right , then the morality of his commands is not to be questioned . It is an easy corollary of this theory that when the monarch uses force the stars in their courses are fighting with him , that when he and his army step out from the national frontiers to confound the heathen ( other nations are likely to be so regarded under this theory ) they have a right to expect supernatural intervention , that where foes appear within the nation , as for instance Socialists with troublesome questionings about the infallibility of rulers and with eccentric notions about brotherhood and democracy and internationalism , they are to be branded with the stigma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , under this theory , and all men whose thought is too free and independent , are to be suppressed , and in the aid of such confounding of foes within , the same divine assistance is vouchsafed as against foes without . A theory such as this tends to accentuate national egotism , to pervert patriotism into clannishness , to cover aggression with a mantle of sacredness , and to stultify those human elements for which we thought the world had come to have a rather better appreciation than formerly . As to Emperor William himself , it is no part of the present writer 's purpose to argue any grossness in his point of view , or any intentional perversion on his part of the principles of religion . On the other hand , there is every reason to believe that his pious utterances are sincere , as he is said to be an intensely religious man . The question of his point of view becomes a matter not for censure , but for disinterested study as a psychological phenomenon . In its main outlines , his personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ruler of a great state taking himself seriously as a divine right monarch in the twentieth century . His self-assertiveness , one of his leading characteristics , may not be combative in any sense that is personally offensive , but  | all the circumstances of his birth and environment have been such as to engender an exaggerated sense of the value of military glory , and a faith in the invincibleness of the Hohenzollern dynasty that amounts to an obsession . It is probably the vigor of his personality that has caused him to turn with such earnestness to religion , and as a serious-minded man in high position can not treat lightly his own mission , there is doubtless in his heart a genuine craving for divine help to enable him to bear his heavy responsibilities . It is not to be even hinted that religion is with him a mask to hide deliberate perfidy and tyranny . In a paternalistic way he desires that individually his subjects shall be happy and prosperous . Such happiness and prosperity would , indeed , reflect glory upon his crown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of rulers who for long centuries have followed the gospel of the main chance ; he belongs to a state whose history has seemed a singularly convincing proof of the theory that national greatness is to be promoted by force : his Prussia has , within a period that we call modern , raised itself by prodigious military exertion from the position of an inferior German mark to that of the leading power , perhaps , of Europe . No wonder his heart should thrill with pride at the achievements of his ancestors and the exploits of his house , and no wonder he tends to think of all advance and progress in the terms of military achievement . He is not to be blamed for the circumstances which have inevitably created in him this point of view . It is even to be forgiven him that Hohenzollern characteristics have tended to become accentuated in his character . Living in the greatest age of the Hohenzollerns , it is not a matter for censure that he should take most pride in Hohenzollern virtues and Hohenzollern glory . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dynasty should actuate him . It is an established tradition of the house that each ruler should add further territory to the patrimony . If it were not for the predatory policy involved , and if the matter were to be viewed merely from William 's own standpoint , we could pardon his emulation of his sires in this respect , too . For , in this tolerant  | age , there is a tendency to forgive an act if we can understand it . Now taking into consideration all these elements of the Emperor 's ancestry , personality and environment , is it not a fairly simple matter to account psychologically for his religion ? In a state which has staked everything on military strength and which is now ambitious for expansion , it is natural that the ruler should find it hard to dissociate religion from war , and that his instinctive assumption of the superiority of his own people should pass over easily into the thought that they are a race chosen of heaven to go forth and possess the earth . It is by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , the religious emotion and the desire for military glory ? should become fused , and that he should tend more and more to lose sight of the true bearings of Christianity upon international morality . But though we may understand and so withhold censure , our regret should be none the less keen that autocratic authority and power of infinite mischief should belong to a ruler with such a creed . It should be admitted that a world of related connotations crowd in to ' do injury to the Emperor 's declarations on religion . It may well be that the Kaiser himself is unsympathetic toward many of the elements of modern German philosophy which one tends to associate with his speeches . M. de Noussanne , for instance , probably strains the point when he attributes Nietschean tendencies of thought to Emperor William . He writes : " In the German Emperor 's eyes , Christianity , and its two successors , Catholicism and Lutheranism , are softened forms of the true faith . It would be dangerous for Germans to confine themselves to this theology , born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong and regenerated race . . . In his Majesty 's thought the thing that has enfeebled the Latin and Slav races is their fidelity to a religion of good will born in the dreams of the Orient . It is primarily from this source that there arise this humanitarianism , these clamors of internationalism , these altogether ideal conceptions  | of universal peace , contradictory to the development and triumph of brutal force . The Emperor holds as his most dangerous enemy this new spirit ' of which people have become enamored , and his keenest fear is to see it spread over Germany . " In this passage , the author 's foreign bias has probably led him beyond the path of sound interpretation . The safer explanation would perhaps be that the Kaiser dislikes the " new spirit " because it is associated with socialism , and therefore with disloyalty , rather than because it is identified with Christianity . A close study of his speeches reveals not so much a philosophic antagonism to New Testament principles as a primitive type of thought which fails to grasp essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emperor 's utterances since the beginning of the present war have suffered from their inevitable connotations . In a proclamation issued during the first week of August , 1914 , at a time when Germany was " resisting " by battering down the Belgian forts , the Kaiser declared : " We shall resist to the last breath of man and horse , and we shall fight out the struggle even against a world of enemies . Forward with God who will be with us as he was with our ancestors . " This speech is touched by the same sort of heroics that one finds in the Emperor 's earlier utterances , yet the unfavorable judgment which it awakened in outsiders was due in greater degree to an abhorrence of Prussia 's part in the war than to anything implicit in the speech itself . The following prayer was directed by the Kaiser , in an order to the supreme council of the evangelical church , to be included in the Liturgy throughout the war : " Almighty and merciful God ! God of the armies ! We beseech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fatherland . Bless the entire German war force , lead us to victory , and give us grace that we may show ourselves to be Christians toward our enemies as well . Let us soon arrive at the peace which will safeguard our free and independent Germany . " If this prayer aroused an unsympathetic response outside Germany , the reason is to be found not in the prayer itself , but in the conviction that the very policy of the nation belied the words . The word " Christians " must have created in the minds of many  | readers a strange sense of incongruity , and it was not a question as to whether Germany should be " free and independent . " As the Germans were pressing on toward Paris during the first weeks of the war , the Kaiser exulted : " For our victory we are thankful , in the first place , to unserem alten Gott . He will not desert us since we stand for a holy cause . . . We shall not lose our faith and trust in unserem guten alten Gott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must win . " Here one finds , perhaps , more inherent cause for an unfavorable impression , for those sentiments of national humility and that searching of heart that are appropriate to a nation in time of crisis are lacking here . In their place one finds a clamoring for triumph to an invading army , and an impatient eagerness to win national and dynastic laurels . A purely objective point of view , a thing almost impossible in the present war of course , would perhaps disentangle the Kaiser 's own views from that aggregate of national aims designated loosely as " Prussianism , " but even then the fact would remain that a primitive and belligerent element dominates the Emperor 's religion . V The attitude of a famous Hohenzollern of an earlier day on matters of religion and conscience may well claim our consideration here . Frederick the Great , the most illustrious of the house ? a man as prominent in Prussian history as Washington in our own ? declared in his remarkable Confessions that while religion is absolutely necessary to the state it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " There is nothing , " he says , " that tyrannizes more over the head and heart than religion , because it neither agrees with our passions nor with those great political views by which a monarch ought to be guided . The true religion of a prince is his interest and his glory . He ought , by his royal station , to be dispensed from having any other . " Nor should a monarch , in Frederick 's view , be bothered with a conscience , for in reading further these same Confessions we learn that the monarch who in making a treaty remembers that he is a Christian is undone , that war is a trade  | in which even the least scruple would spoil everything , and that a ruler ( this is regarded as axiomatic ) would not make war without being assured of the right to make rules that authorize plunder , fire and carnage . Even allowing for some exaggeration , the following presents an interesting point of view as to the religion of rulers . Frederick wrote : " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of complaisance to the Emperors ; in the fifteenth , Lutherans , in order to seize the possessions of the church ; and Calvinists in the sixteenth , to please the Dutch upon the account of the succession of Cleves ; I do not see why we should not make ourselves indifferent to all these religions for the sake of maintaining tranquility in our dominions . " Since a people must worship in some form , Frederick declared his intention to produce at the right time an eloquent preacher with a new doctrine . After a show of persecution , the Majesty of Prussia would ultimately embrace his system , and , awaiting the day , that faith had already been devised in the royal mind . In all of these confidential declarations of Frederick to his nephew , it is a question how much allowance to make for regal gusto and a sort of staginess which requires overstatement , and yet , in his career of barefaced robbery and treachery and in his subordination of every interest to national and dynastic aggrandizement , we have perhaps the best possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genius which enabled him to succeed in the use of such methods , his life tended to glorify the philosophy of force , to raise it to a creed , and thus he left a fateful legacy to succeeding generations of Prussians . We should not , in this age , be too complacent about the security of Christianity , for there are tremendous sinister forces at work in our world today which know not the Christian God . In the Nietschean view Christianity is an Oriental dream , and its standards are to be regarded as not only impossible , but contemptible . This philosopher of might as against right declared :  | " A good war will justify any cause . . . . Active sympathy for the weak is more dangerous for the human race than any other crime . . . . At the bottom of all distinguished races the beast of prey is not to be mistaken . To demand of strength that it should not assert itself as strength , that it should not be a will to oppression , a will to destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be athirst for foes and opposition and triumph , is precisely as senseless as to demand of weakness that it assert itself as strength . " One need not stop , perhaps , to denounce such teaching , but where in all topsy-turvydom could you find a more accurately stated negation of the principles of Christianity ? And when we reflect that the aggregate will of powerful peoples may actually be enlisted in the championship of such anti-Christian views , the conviction grows that the simple faith of the Nazarene is , alas ! very far from having the acceptance in our modern world which many of us had hoped . We needed not to be told that the world is full of indifferent Christians , but what we sometimes fail to appreciate , because the thought is too shocking for our comprehension , is that men dare frankly to repudiate the very heart of Christian teaching , to exalt brutality and ruthless force as virtues , and to throw contempt even upon those graces of Christian conduct which are common to all worthy religions . Not unlike this tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Christianity is itself combative , and calls for a forcible assertion of power . To prop this argument it is customary to quote Christ 's declaration , " Think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I come not to send peace , but a sword " ( Matt. x , 34 ) . Some of Christ 's utterances were " hard sayings , " but to argue from this isolated passage that Christ preached war would be as reasonable as to assert that He deliberately counseled filial disloyalty and hatred because , to drive home a stern truth , He once said : " I am come to set a man at variance against his father . . . and a man 's foes shall be they of his own household " ( Matt. x , 35 , 36 ) . Even the passages that can , by being snatched from their context , be distorted into a justification of war are exceedingly  | few , and to derive such a conclusion one must deliberately ignore all the essential points in the Master 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicarious love . But perhaps the worst of it is that all this is ordinarily done in a labored attempt to be scientific and present only the truth based on facts . From the standpoint of scientific or logical validity , this idea of the warlike nature of Christianity deserves to rank with the wise assertion that war is biologically necessary in order that the fittest may survive , an assertion which ignores the fact that the biological war of survival never takes place between members of the same species , and that the most warlike qualities , if predatory , are often the ones that soonest lead to extinction . This theory , which has unfortunately captured many learned men , is close kin to the claim that we must have war in order to preserve the manly virtues , or the crushing retort that human nature never changes and that therefore war will always be inevitable . VII The religion that we have been observing in the foregoing pages is not recognizable as Christianity . It does not inhale the air of sacrifice : it does not breathe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , when its plain implications are followed up , a challenge to Christianity and an appeal to the Rule of Force . Where the ideal of Christianity calls for a searching of heart , this tribal religion thinks only of selfrighteousness ; where the New Testament speaks for a love which embraces all races , this negation of Christianity strengthens frontiers ; where the cross would inspire a mission of social service , the tiara of imperial religion would accentuate national hatreds ; where a purification of heart and life is required to precede the profession of the Christian life , the mark of birth among a favored people alone initiates a man into the exclusive privileges of this national cult . Where the power of Christianity works silently and by mere contact , as salt or leaven , this new paganism loses its effect without a  | conspicuous parading of itself . Where Christianity would counsel devoted sacrifice , humility of mind , vicarious effacement of self , this eagle-like religion would prey upon the weak , exploit the inferior , and measure its own exaltation by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called by its true name , would appear to be but a deification of force . It looks to its " good old God up there " as one might fondle a trusty , tried-and-true sword . Such a belief is of a piece with the glorification of Hindenburg , whose stout form and mastiff-like head , mostly jaw , have been lifted to view in an enormous wooden statue in Berlin ? a not inappropriate symbol of the sort of thing that this war , with its destruction of cathedrals , has substituted for Christian art . To pervert Christianity is more dangerous than to oppose it . Where opposition would produce a healthful reaction and rally forces to the support of the faith , perversion slyly appropriates the sanctions of Christianity for the most questionable ends . Would it not be in the interest of clearness if the terminology of Christianity were dropped altogether and the appeal made to those unshaven deities who were so appropriately in favor in the days when barbarism sought no disguise ? The old kings of the North proudly claimed to be of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pardoned for comparing this claim with the unconscious tendency of some twentieth century rulers to associate themselves with divinity . We have interesting evidence , in the case of Emperor William , of a decided fondness for the heroes and gods of the old northern myths . A touch of the Kaiser 's delight in the traditions of Wodenism was shown when he officiated at Bergen in June , 1892 , at the launching of a small iron-clad of the German navy . " Oh , ship , " he cried , " I christen you the Heimdall . You take your name from the prehistoric period of our sires of the North . You are to bear the name of a God to whom belonged the high mission of defending the golden portals of Walhalla. . . . 0 thou that art to carry the great name of Heimdall , I desire that the rumor of your advance may sow trouble and dismay in the ranks of your enemies . " 3  | The Kaiser has the naming of warships . More recently the names selected for the navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the imperial dynasty and of other royal families in Germany , or of states in the German Confederation , but as M. de Noussanne points out , many of the names formerly selected hark back to the old Scandinavian mythology , as Aegir , Frithjof , Odin , Beowulf , and Velleda . It would indeed be amiss to criticize the appropriateness of these names , for they are very appropriate , but the point to be noted is that they suggest , quite possibly , a wistful lingering on the exploits and characters of a by-gone paganism . In all this we would avoid implying any particular disparagement of Wodenism . In the Edda and the old Teutonic hero tales , we find a quality of heathen frankness which lifts them into the field of literature . In those primitive days when the wild , sinister forces of nature were still unsubdued , there was a quality of real grandeur in a Thor whose hammer could confound the giants . The battle-maidens , or Walkyries , were appropriate to that twilight of human development in which fighting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the barbarian senses , the appeal of Walhalla , with its revelry and gore , was the most attractive way of sweetening death . We would not withhold respect from Wodenism , but if , in our modern time , religion is to be appealed to so often in connection with war 's carnage , we would ask whether it would not be more appropriate to revert to a mythology which is so rich in the imagery of battle , and in which glorious fighting is the normal occupation of gods , heroes , kings , and men ? Wodenism itself is more attractive than a Wodenized Christianity .
