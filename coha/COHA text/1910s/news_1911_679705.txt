Dr. himself was not present , and it was explained that he could not bring himself to take any part in the ceremonies which marked the severance of his relations to the church , which had been sustained unbrokenly for nearly half a century . The Rev. Dr. Donald Maclntyre , assistant pastor , stated that Dr. would not trust himself to read his letter of resignation . Dr. read it for him . The congregation , many present remarked , was notable for the number of elderly men and women in it . While there was a sprinkling of young men and young women , with here and there a child , most of the heads were frosted .

Immediately following the reading of the resignation , resolutions framed in an-. ticipation of it by the deacons of the Clurch were adopted , expressing deep regret at Dr. s determination , . but releasing him from the active pastorate and electing him pastor-emeritus , an office created , it was explained , - in order that the long and affectionate relations between Dr. and his congregation . should not be wholly broken . While nothing was said about the salary Dr. is to receive in his honorary office , it is understood that it will be a substantial fraction of his present remuneration from the church . The Rev. Dr. Maclntyre read two letters from Dr. . One was dated Sept. 6 , 1910 , the other and briefer one was dated a week ago . The first letter was Dr. 's special message to his church .

He had seen . practically every stone , every brick , and every timber , ' he said , laid in its place in the present church , one of the largest religious auditoriums in the city . He had helped to design it , and had actually designed the pulpit and given it to the church . Since he came there he had . baptized into the church more than 5,000 persons , and in his ministry $2,000,000 had been given to the cause of Christianity- . With these evidences of hiS labors , he said , he wished to retire while he was still mentally and physically strong .

He was resigning , he said , simply because he thought forty years long enough for any pastorate . He had fully intended leaving the church in May of last year , when the forty years had ended , but was persuaded by his deacons not to do so , as the church was then celebrating the anniversary , and they thought his leaving would throw a damper over it . He , therefore , waited until last Fall to write his letter of resignation , but was again persuaded to withhold it a little longer . In his second letter Dr. stated that he ' really regarded his pastorate a terminated since last Fall , and had refried in the Winter months to receive more than half of his regular salary and had returned to the church all his salary for the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quitting the church as a member nor the Baptist ministry .

He expressed the desire that the present ritual end forms of worship , which he regarded as beautiful , should be continued . As for himself , Dr. said , he expected to preach and to lecture .

It was said by members of the congregation that Dr. expects to establish a Baptist college in Russia . After the resignation had been accepted , the Rev. Mr. Maclntyre announced that Dr. would preach mornin and evening to-morrow , and asked that large congregations be present ? to hear him , thereby testifying to their affection for him . The Rev.
