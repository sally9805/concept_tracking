 | WE dropped the canoe in at Lancaster , north of the White Mountains . It came over from Canada two days late , and we had dropped the White Mountains into the two days left vacant , which they filled to the brim with memories of long trails in the climbing forest , miles of gray frost-shattered rubble and rock , frail crosses marking the spots where men had died of late in a June ice storm , the Summit House chained to its place against the snatching of piratical winds , peak after melancholy peak of the Presidential Range hidden or half seen through driving mists , ? finally , a night in a stone hut , built for mountain climbers on the shoulder of Quincy Adams , in company with two casual strangers , elderly gentlemen who were good cooks . Memories enough to fill a cupboard of days . It is very well to travel on the current of rivers , carrying with one the memories of mountains . After the hostile heights , when one comes to slide down a dimpling river in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlook is limited and social , nature seems the more compliant , and singularly gracious ; she agrees at last with all one 's opinions . There was some mistake about this theory . The Upper Connecticut was not that kind of river . We fell into an argument with it , and then a quarrel . It is not a placid river with populated shores . It is solitary and headlong . The farmhouses and villages lie mainly on the roads back from the river , which is only navigated by logs and lumbermen . It runs along the high banks of meadows , the edges of woods and steep hills , and over innumerable stony rapids . Canoeing there is a strenuous life of forecasts , accidents , sudden remedies , and escapes .  | We camped at evening on a high bank , and turned on the Connecticut with a sense of injury . A farmer came driving his mowing machine down the meadow , and drew near . Might we spend the night there on the corner of his land ? " Why , I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , and rolled away cheerfully on his clicking machine . It was pleasant to be in this country of varied humors . Man had not talked so in Canada . " The strenuous life " is a current term of late . It is a more attractive term than " hustling , " but it seems to be used only in the meaning of " strenuous doing , " as if " life " were synonymous with action , and action to be set forth as a moral ideal in the conduct of life . It is not so much a new gospel as the expression of a national characteristic . It is an attempt to make a gospel out of a characteristic , always a pleasant enterprise ; but it would seem that " strenuous thinking " would be a gospel more to our needs , if it should appear that we are a people whose energy in action already verges on the gigantic , but whose energy in thought is not noticeable ; whose literature is more multitudinous than virile , somewhat lax and wordy , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blade , somewhat given to congratulating itself on its energy in growing stalks and blades , and to setting forth its energy in that respect as a moral ideal in the conduct of corn . In fact , unkind statements of this sort have been made ; and if it is true that our energy already runs mainly into action and little into ideas , that men take hold of the day 's affairs with a nervous grip , and read books that are nerveless and gripless , and still suppose that all things are well , then strenuous doing is a poor thing to preach among us . Instead of being told to be up and doing , it may happen a man needs more to be told to sit down and think himself a fool till he knows better . Neither the fervid and prolonged industry of the man on the haycutter , nor the efficiency of his clicking machine ,  | would ever seem to me worth as much as his breezy tolerance , his angular character , his knack of pregnantly stating his mind . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called " The Eighteen Mile Race . " It has its advantages , and is better canoeing , with better speed and fewer obstructions , when the water is fairly high ; but it has this disadvantage , that at the end one has no knowledge whether or not there were any gods along the way . It is too insistent on itself . " Thou shalt have no other gods but me , " is a burly announcement for a new acquaintance ; " Attend to me or I 'll smash your boat , " but a brusque beginning of conversations . There was a strenuousness about the men and rivers of this country . The Connecticut was a salient character , like the farmer on the haycutter , keen in its own pursuits , surprising and decisive in answer . Even if one at last travelled over it victoriously , it seemed possible that he would surrender so much of himself to the process as to leave the balance of trade with the river . For a victory is never anything but a purchase . A triumph is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast his bargain . Whatever he strives for he pays for . Knowledge is power , and its power is greatest over the holder of it . Wealth is a power which controls the possessor . Whatever a man owns , owns him . His pursuits pursue him . He never ploughs a field without being ploughed himself , or plants it himself unplanted , or goes into business without its going into him , or travels intimately with a river without its current flowing through him . He " believes that he is becoming master of nature , " says Philip Gilbert Hamerton , " but nature is becoming mistress of him . " The power of the inanimate universe over him was increasing on account of his increasing interest in it . " The long brown road leading wherever I choose , " says Whitman , vaguely exulting , although it is evident enough that the road would not lead him wherever he chose unless he  | chose to go wherever it led . Whitman felt assured of the benignity of things , and held his own good will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mahomet once ordered a mountain to come to him , and his disciples looked to see it lift its granite feet and sway clumsily across the plain , but nothing happened . " Very well , I will go to the mountain , " said Mahomet , whose assurance was more daring still . He was not master of the mountain , but he was master of the relations between himself and it . He controlled his own end of the relations . Mountains and roads are not compliant , but the soul of man is ingenious . By his ingenuity he makes the road of necessity friendly . The countenance of fate wears a smile , which is the reflection of his own . He finds a welcome in the dead mountain at his coming , for he brings his welcome with him . It will meet him halfway , for his spirit has shortened the way by half . He will have his gods whether or no , and run the " Eighteen Mile Race " in their company . He will make a shrewd bargain with nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with . He is not " master of his fate , " but he is " captain of his soul , " as the captain of a ship is captain , who by hook and crook , by trimming sails to the weather , by trusting the established wisdom of the chart and the instinct of the compass , on the whole maintains his purpose . Another disadvantage of the Connecticut is the morning fog . One closes the eyes in sleep on a brilliant night . There was a ceremonial procession from sunset to sleep , a festival of the silver and blue magnificence of water and sky , and the duskier purple of the fields . One opens them on a gray repentant dawn . The world has gone into a nunnery . She has fallen to remembering her sins and her mortality . She is cold , veiled , and still , except for muttering prayers with the voice of the shrouded river . The fog drips from the edges of the tent . Everything beyond the tent flap is ghostly or hidden , blank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would not choose to have missed the contrast of the night and morning , the lying down in wonder to wake surprised . It was pointed out in the " Dolly Dialogues , " that unchequered love is rather a dull story . When Troilus walked the streets of Troy , that were bereft of Cressida , he fancied everyone he met was sad for him , and . . . fancied that they said , I am right sorry Troilus will die . Every night he Stood the bright moon to behold , And all his sorrows to the moon he told , And said , " I wis when thou art horned anew I shall be glad if all the world be true . " Chaucer 's psychology was good , Troilus 's forebodings correct , Cressida already false . She . . . loveth the son of Tydeus , And Troilus mot weep in cares cold . Such is this world , whoso can it behold ! In each estate is little heartes rest ! God leave us for to take it for the best ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Il faut cultiver notre jardin . " Troilus himself felt better after breakfast . Most depression comes from misthinking a certain estate peculiar enough to justify the neglect of breakfast . " Whoso can it behold " knows that there is not much heart 's rest anywhere , but everywhere some , and more than ordinary after breakfast . Everyone was not sad for Troilus ; they had their own troubles ; nor thought he would die of love , or be eaten by worms for any such reason ; but were primed to advise him , with God 's leave , having " geliebt and gelebet , " to make the best of it and have breakfast . The Connecticut river was " a mad wag , " strenuous but never dull , with gods enough beside it ? seeing that they are always wherever you put them ? and noble hills and forests beside it , and brambles of berry vines beside it , laden with blackberries for breakfast . Let us be canny and consider- ate ; so when the rain is sent , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls equally on the just and t lie unjust , but not equally on the prudent and the imprudent ; when the dark hour comes our lamps shall be lit ; in the rapids we will set a shod pole to their rocks and glide by ; the memory of neither our sins nor our virtues shall deprive us of cakes and ale ; every morning we will petition that this day be given us our daily courage and our average luck ; if the world falls to weeping in hodden gray , we will only the more heartily have breakfast . We camped twice and woke in the fog , and then fled to farmhouses on the hills at Barnet and Wells River , to a hotel at Fairlee ; we travelled three days a headlong river , and came with shattered pole and paddle to milder waters , the long green reaches by Hanover . There was another recompense for the fog . It led to a better respect for New England homes than for New England country inns . The house at Barnet was small , white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tired householder came in late from his labor , and rocked silently through the evening with a little maid in his arms . Neither spoke a word to interrupt their perfect understanding but something passed from one to the other which rested the man and comforted the child . At Wells River was a calm and elderly household , a woman with a gentle , winning face that bore the lines of a hardworking life , a man with the face that belongs to statesmen , scholars , or old-fashioned New England deacons . In the morning he prayed for " the strangers within his gates . " The strangers exchanged a blessing with them both , and left his gates with the sense of having been looking at the sources of the nation . The inn at Fairlee furnished us with a bed in a hot upstairs hallway . Restless people , searching for bedrooms , or more likely to escape from bedrooms , wandered through like ' perturbed spirits , unhouseled , unaneled ; Roman ghosts ? or was it by reason of falling over an unexpected bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they squeaked and gibbered ? We left the unhallowed establishment , exchanged no blessings with it , and breakfasted by the river side . But for the old New England farms and households such as the Connecticut river flows strenuously among , ? my opinion of them is not reasoned or dated . It is an argumentum ex homine . An argumentum ex homine , as Joubert once pointed out , is the reverse current of an argumentum ad hominem . An ex homine argument is one that comes out of the character of the arguer . It is the expression of his nature . As for your mental opinion , it is a light thing , a thing of accident , born of interest , of yielding , of contradiction . It is a marrowless skeleton , clinging drearily to some unclothed and shivering fact . But an ex homine reason runs parallel with the direction of one 's being . It was born before he was born . Whatever force there is in the holder of it , it has that force . A certain Greek philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inscribed in a circle , and a hecatomb of bulls on discovering that the square on the hypotenuse of such a triangle was equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides . That was very pleasant and enthusiastic . But when these truths were first thrust upon me , I did not feel like a philosopher but like a sacrificial bull , a person unaccountably assaulted . I held the same mental opinion with the philosopher , but our ex homine opinions were opposed . A Hindoo algebraist once stated this problem : " The square root of half the number of a swarm of bees is gone to a clump of jasmine , and so are eight ninths of the whole swarm ; a female bee is buzzing to the one remaining male that is humming within a lotus in which he is confined . Say , lovely woman , the number of bees . " This statement leads to the mental opinion that there were seventy-two bees , but there is with it an argumentum ail feminam leading to the ex femina opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the others were only fraction , or square roots of bees , and no bee is properly a bee in an  | such condition , whereas the drone and the queen bee were acting in a manner to carry the utmost conviction . This is the ex homine reasoning . Something of the old South that disappeared in the war , and something of the old New England , passing or passed away , sapped by the cities and the West , are softly remembered now and the memory harvested in books . The newspaper discusses the decadence of New England . An old man , and a boy of sixteen or more , large limbed and clear eyed , were gathering hay in a little stony field above Barnet , with a knock-kneed horse and a sag-wheeled cart . We bought a lumberman 's paddle of them . The large limbed youth hoped we would camp in their field . It was lonely , he said . People seldom came along there , either by road or river . The elder said little or nothing , except that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too early in the day to camp . We left the old man driving his hay cart and knock-kneed horse at a slow shamble out of his little field , the boy standing on the bank to watch us go down the river . One of R. L. Stevenson 's fine pieces is a story called " Will o ' the Mill . " It has a singular flow , like a steady river , full of shadows and melodies . This Will o ' the Mill began in childhood to notice that everything seemed in haste to get away from that high mountain notch of his . Waters and winds and autumn leaves , travellers and tramping soldiery , so it happened , all went one way , down the valley to the plain , and hardly anything came back . The plain itself lay in sight , though far below , dim and glorified in the distance , dotted with cities and fringed by the sea . It became the longing of his life to go down with the rest and to have his experience there also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strange transformation that came over him , are somewhat shadowy . There was a fat young traveller with a bald spot on his head , who pointed out to him the moral of the unattainable stars , and the  | situation of humanity as in a squirrel cage , wherein one sometimes sees a squirrel running in the wheel very strenuously with vast ambition , another squirrel sitting philosophically over his nuts in the same cage but cutting the more seemly figure on the whole . The parable no doubt sank into Will o ' the Mill , but I take it the seeds of the outcome were already planted . Putting things off is a pleasant habit to contract . Browning 's duke and lady in " The Statue and the Bust " grew only to a pale , placid acquiescence in their frustrate lives ; but Will o ' the Mill went further and became enamored of his own longings , so far as to think them best as they stood and to fear the touch of realization ; even so far as to put aside the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be agreed that he made a mistake , that he may have been right to linger safely at his mountain mill and inn , but he ought to have taken his Marjory . He was logical , consistent , but he seems to have thought himself that something was wrong . There was a second transformation . He confessed as much to a brusque and determined person named Death , who came at last to take him travelling , ? he confessed to him that his desire now , his one longing this many a year since Marjory 's time , the final phase of his old dream , was to set out on only this journey with no other than this dark travelling companion , stern and kind . As to whether or not he did well on the whole , no sharp decision is reached in the story . It is useless to deny that there is testimony from the poets in favor of unvisited Yarrows , to the effect that to be always testing one 's ideals is a practically sure method of getting rid of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saints and sages is in favor of the philosophical squirrel as against the ambitious one . " The world " is denounced by the saints in intimate connection with " the flesh and the devil . " The sages are apt to remark that happiness is a plant one seeks far , hurriedly , and in vain , and finds it at last a dooryard  | flower in his native village . But this is not the massed and general opinion of men . Nor was it Stevenson 's personal opinion , nor Browning 's , who were not generalized men nor conformers in opinion . They were in all things for contending to the uttermost , throwing your stakes freely . " Sursum corda ! " they say . " Heave ahead ! Wherever you see a promising possibility , jump into it . Dare all things and let God sift you out . " For that wishful , pathetic figure whom we left watching us from the bank of the Connecticut river , ? if he had asked , " Tell me before you go , which shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other answer could we have called back to him than , " We do n't know " ? The reasons pro and con are ex homine reasons . There is not much heart 's rest anywhere , but everywhere some . There is everywhere a feeling that heart 's rest is somewhere else , and this feeling is called an ideal , till it is hunted to cover and called an illusion ? a quibbling matter of names . Will o ' the Mill lived out his days cannily with great composure , and was weary of them long before they were done . So has many a man on the other hand , who has had his feet on the highway , his face against the tempest and his hand in the fight , grown weary of them all before his time , and cried : " Enough ! " Ich babe genossen das irdische Gliick Ich babe geliebt and gelebet . Cities and mountains are distantly as magical to each other 's eyes as young men and maidens . The cities turn out to be dusty , importunate places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is possible for a man to love either of them , the more passionately the more he knows of either , with a love that endures all things . At the last camp on the Connecticut we sat late over the camp fire , listening to the whip-poor-wills , calling in the woods , and to the thunder of a dam some distance up the river ; noting how the river ran down glittering and mutter- ing in the starlight , noting the habit of the night of setting out its lamps along all the highways and byways of heaven , as fast as it darkened its earthly paths . At the beginning of the next day we rose , and looked from the misty bank . But the river was not there . It was all but empty , vanished in the night . Shallow trickles only dribbled apart on its rocky bottom . Towards the end of the day , and hard above Windsor , the Connecticut drew canoe and contents up the side of a scooping wave , and dropped it from the crest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a jocose intention about this . There was a certain vulgar humor , but we thought it in bad taste . You take any dignified object , anything large and established in the respect of men , like the Connecticut , let it become facetious and flippant , and this is a distressing thing . It is nothing to point out that if the sluiceways of a dam are closed , the river below becomes temporarily dry ; or , that if you strike the back wave of a waterfall side-wise instead of head-on , it is likely to tip you over . These are but rationalizings , mental opinions , light things , not parallel with the direction of one 's being . The ex homine argument was that the whole thing was in bad taste , that dry rivers and wet clothes were incongruous , absurd , a mere Gothic barbarism . So much the worse for " homo . " Does he expect to meet with nothing but the expected ? Does he travel to no better purpose than to criticise and pass ermined judgment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances for not circumstanding in a circle ? Is he such a lacquered and enamelled classicist that he has no taste for things incongruous ? Must a river always flow blank verse , and not a water god or " blue-haired deity " crack a joke in ungirdled prose ? Out on your forty proprieties , forty oily thieves ! of whom , by the shade of Ali Baba , thirty-nine were the better for boiling ! Out on your habits of behavior that " cream and mantle like a stand- ing pond " ! If a man finds himself conforming to his silk hat , let him incontinently stand on his head . The better for him and the worse for his hat were a shrewd bargain . Let his dignity be persuaded of absurdity one day a month in precaution of being absurd the remaining twenty-nine . No accident blocks the sequence of events . They still go tumbling on . A. river goes dry and then goes wet . If you fall into it , in the sequence of events you swim ashore . Incongruity is a rift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluid humors bubble up that lie fattening the soil below . Rather should this world be likened to a pot or caldron , where things welter and cook together with some confusion , but , according to our faith , with some significance and purpose . And wherever there gathers a scum or consistent surface , you have forms , dignities , doctrines , rules , grammars , and other extensions , purporting to be founded on the bottom of the pot , but ever and again skimmed off by an iron , implacable skimmer . Your humorist is one who is pleased to have his nose over the centre of the boiling , where the steam is thickest . Nay , your true humorist does not care for consistent similes . He declares there is nothing so comfortable as to be himself in the mix-up and middle of incongruity , a cause of laughter to himself and other men , a Falstaff , a natural democrat . Forthwith he gets into the pot and joins its simmering democracy . The Connecticut is a faithful river to the principles and conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " free nights and fighting days . It preaches no artificial equality , but a certain general and racy humor which is the essence of natural equality . It is a restless river , a maker of quick bargains with obstacles , pouring over and around them , deepening and broadening as it goes , affording at last , now and then , an unexpected and thoughtful vista . It tends to some extremes , to boisterous spirits and early morning penitences . It met us with a surprise and parted from us with a jest .
