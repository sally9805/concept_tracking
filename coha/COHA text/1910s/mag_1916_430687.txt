SOME parts of the world are renowned for their beauty . We visit them to satisfy our inherent love for the picturesque . Some , again , are famous as the scenes of great and stirring events which have made history ; them we visit to stand enthralled in the presence of the great spirits of old . Still other parts attract us strongly because of the vivid kaleidoscope of their modern life and customs . But what shall we say of Italy , at once exquisitely beautiful , glowing with life and contemporaneous interest ; and , above all , quick with the memory of her glorious past ? One writes of her in despair of giving more than a bald sketch of the character and attributes that endear her to all mankind . Richly ? lavishly ! ? she returns love for love , and they who most tax her find her the most inexhaustible , ever giving , ever repaying , with boundless interest , the affection of her children of the entire world . WE ARE ALL HER CHILDREN The compulsion of Italy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares with no other in degree and with but few in kind . That humanity , with its essential heights and depths of spirituality and grossness , glows in the grandest art the world has ever seen and been inspired by ; it pulsates lustily in literature that to this day is the envy and despair of mankind ; it dominates us who still live in the closing era of the Renaissance that only the splendid individualism and genius of the lustrous Florentines could make possible . Italy is not of the Italians ; she is of the world . We are all her children , and some of the most sublime lessons life has to teach us have been learned of her wisclom and accumulated experience . THE GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF ITALY Indeed , in considering the great epochs of civilization , we often overlook the fact that more than half of them developed in Italy . Classifying history , we find five periods : the Culture of the Ancient East ; Hellenic Civilization ; the vast Roman Organism ; the Domination of the Roman Catholic Church ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval influences " in what we usually speak of as the Renaissance . In a word , therefore , we owe to Italy three of the five periods ? the three which have exercised the world most potently in both practical things and the things of the spirit . Geographical position is not sufficiently recognized , except by the special student , in its influence upon the character and achievements of a nation . This is peculiarly true in the case of Italy . A single glance at the map ( see page 36o ) discloses its position as one of the chief sources of the country 's individuality . From the beginning Nature set Italy apart . Every boundary is perfectly clear .  | The historic seas enfold it to south , east , and west . On the north the terrific Alps sweep around in a great semicircle from Mediterranean to Adriatic , closing the circuit . To be sure , from the time of Augustus the boundary of each side of northern Italy has been juggled , now to the east , now to the west , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So thoroughly did the ancient chroniclers recognize these natural limits that long before the name Italy had any political significance or entity the writers applied it to the country thus inclosed . The peninsula , with its tremendous Apennine backbone , makes a huge boot which thrusts out practically into the center of the great Midland Sea . Necessarily , then , Italy was exposed to attack and invasion from three sides . Indeed , it vv as the invading , or rather colonizing , Greek who combined with the aborigine to form the population that stocked the peninsula . Taken in a smaller way , geographical site or position exercised no less distinct an effect upon some of the foremost Italian cities ; and in shaping their affairs and men it also influenced the entire world . NATURAL , DIVISIONS OF THE COUNTRY Italy is generally regarded as lying in three parts ? northern , central , and southern . Nature has set no boundary between central and southern Italy ; but from the southernmost point of the Alps , at the French frontier , the Apennines swing across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge U-shaped basin , drained by the river Po and its tributaries , open to the Adriatic . After forming this basin ? northern Italy ? the Apennines sweep southward in a rugged backbone which determines the whole internal geography of the country as definitely as the Alps do its outline northward . The Apennines are not , however , merely a backbone , but a broad mass with several minor ranges and  | groups of peaks , generally separated by high upland valleys , one of whose plateaux , the Piano di Cinque Miglia , at a height of 4,298 feet above the sea , is the intriest and bleakest spot in all Italy . This upland region is bordered everywhere by lowlands of luxuriantly fertile character , prolific in fruit and verdure and of a genially warm and sunny climate . In central Italy , west of the mountains , the valleys of the Arno and Tiber ? the only streams of importance ? give the keynote to any geographical study of the region . Over on the eastern coast no rivers of importance can exist , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the tortuous , mostly dry beds of the torrenii scar evert height . In this connection it is interesting to note that nowhere is the peninsula more than 15o miles wide , and generally not more than too , while down in Calabria the width dwindles in two places to 35 and 20 miles respectively . One of the most inspiring views in the whole length of the country also displays this narrowness strikingly when , on a clear day , from the Gran Sasso , the highest point in the bleak Abruzzi Range , central Italy , at nearly 10,000 feet , one may look not only eastward over the Adriatic to far Dalmatia 's rocky shores , but also westward over mountain and moor , city and sandy coast , to the dim and misty blue of the Tyrrhenian Sea . In volcanic southern Italy , likewise barren of any great waterways . the Apennines break up into groups of hills and peaks , not usually so lofty as farther northward . THE RIVERS AND LAKES Italy is fairly provided with deep-water seaports ? Naples , Genoa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western coast , and Venice , Ancona , and Brindisi , on the east . The rivers except the Po as may have been inferred already , are of little or no importance for navigation ? a fact the Romans cleverly disposed of by building those beautiful and enduring military roads which to this day vein the whole length and breadth of the country ? though the rapidity of their currents and the flashing , dashing cascades and torrc'nti that come swirling into them make them highly picturesque and delightful as features of the landscape . What human being with a single spark of soul could fail to expand under the magic of that wonderful chain of lakes along her northern border ? Garda , Idro . Iseo , Como , Lugano , Maggiore , Orta ? These remarkable and exquisite sheets of water , formed 1w the tributaries of one single stream ? the Po ? sprawl about in tremendously deep valleys among towering hills of solid rock , while scattered among them are shallow little lakes , entirely different in both character and aspect . Adjectives and imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beholder of any power of expression . And what of Trasimeno and Chiusi ? What of those littler lakes which smile up at us from ashen , volcanic cups throughout central and southern Italy ? What of -A fatese , Fusino , Lucrino , h Brno ? all those many that dimple the pages of history and brighten or glower through the yet more ancient myth and song of bard ? THE ISLES OF THE WEST Beside defining the limits of the country so clearly , Nature also bulwarked the long and tortuous Italian peninsula on the west with a host of rocky defenses in the sapphire waters of the storied Tyrrhehian Sea ? Gorgona , of the suggestive name : rocky Capraia ; Elba , of Napoleonic fame ; the stony fleet of the little Ponzas ; bold and rugged Ischia , with its castle on a big boulder ; Procida likewise ; humpbacked Capri , where " that hairy old goat , ' ' as Suetonius called the Emperor Tiberius , held his revels ; the : Eolian or Lipari Isles , black monsters that spout fire and sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its little sister Corsica clinging to its coat-tails a step behind . Both belong to Italy by every right of Nature ? as a bright lad in a Sicilian school told me : " Sardegna , si ! But Corsica ? no ! She belongs to Italy geographically , but politically to France , " And the greatest of all these outworks is Sicily .  | SICILY , THE GARDEN OF EDEN Geographical location was the deciding factor of the life of this loveliest of all Mediterranean islands . Here we have neither time nor place for Sicily beyond the merest hint of a long series of vivid pictures , which begin with the misty traditions of the Garden of Eden and carry us through the evolution of civilization right to the present . Every State of ancient Europe falls into a place in the enduring pageant . Greek and Roman , Carthaginian and swart Moor , Spaniard and French and Italian fight and retreat , build and demolish , create and undermine . Nature itself , now in the guise of the misunderstood gods of old , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain to us , weaves its mysterious shuttle through and through the highly colored fabric . And men ? such men ! ? tower above their fellows in the story like Titans : Pindar , r schylus , Theocritus , Thucydides , Archimedes , the two great Hierons , Cicero , Verres , Diodorus , Hamilcar and Hannibal , Roger the Count and Roger the King , Belisarius , the great Crusaders ? Richard of the Lion Heart and Louis the Saint of France ? Charles of Anjou , Frederick II , the " Wonder of the World , " and Garibaldi . Even this partial list reads like a compendium of ancient and medieval romance and chivalry . Sicily 's history is as vivid and picturesque , as ferocious and creative and destructive , as mythical and intensely practical , as the stories of all the rest of the world put together . And in beauty of nature , of climate , of man , and of beast , the island is a paradise today , whether or  | not it was ever the workless , painless , passionless elysium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life without having to toil . All this , alas , must wait a more opportune moment for description . CLIMATE AND VEGETATION As in the case of Japan , the surrounding sea makes a vast difference in the Italian climate . Judged by its position alone , the peninsula should be about the hottest part of Europe ? it is only 90 miles from the southern shore of Sicily to Africa . But the twin seas and the ever snow-capped mountains temper the heat and the regional peculiarities are such that we find Turin , for instance , colder ir winter than Copenhagen , and Milan as warm in summer as Naples . These same striking differences characterize the vegetation also . North of the Apennines nothing will grow that can not withstand sharp frosts , yet in virtually the same latitude the strip of coast called the Riviera di Genova sports luxuriant palms and cactus and olives , while oranges and lemons are the most important of crops . A large part of the beauty of the verdure and forest that attracts the visitor 's attention was unknown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but imported . The favored groves of orange and lemon , with their golden fruit glinting among the rich and sappy foliage , breathe of the Levant and the dark- skinned Saracenic invaders from the East . The cactus , with its prickly pear fruit , called the " Indian fig , " and the aloe came straight from Mexico on the heels of the Spanish adventurings into the unknown in the sixteenth century . So did the American corn or maize . Even the eucalyptus is an importation ? a modern one ? and the great groves of chestnuts that clothe the shaggy mountain sides so verdantly , and give occupation to so many vendors of the hot and pasty boiled nut , are believed not to be native . Evergreens still form a large proportion of the foliage and make a great difference in the appearance of the winter landscape , which conspicuously lacks the nakedness of regions clothed only with deciduous growths . The brown slopes of the mountains , the milky roads that wind and wind through rolling upland and flat campagna , or around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream or lake or inlet , give the Italian country side a vivacity and charm lacking in both its Latin neighbors ? a special quality of brightness and life . THE PEOPLE AND THEIR CONDITION Province by province the country manifests a varying charm , and the people differ as widely as their surroundings . The hot-blooded southerner observes a different standard of morals and hygiene , fires to anger or interest more quickly , and is generally less dependable and industrious than his northern brother . Both are gifted with the black eyes and hair and the swarthy complexion , as a race , that is a general characteristic of the Latin peoples . But the Italian is , broadly speaking , like his country , endowed with a physical beauty and charm beyond that of most of his fellows . In the north , however , there are exceptions fair-haired and reddish men and women , who seem strangely out of place  | among their dark neighbors . Cool , temperate exotics they are among the higher colored growths that somehow seem so tropical , with their sultry smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of the purple mountains that always and everywhere dominate all Italy , even to the delightful Carabinieri , or Rural Guards , those Napoleonic-looking officials who parade always solemnly in pairs , hangers at their sides , cockades on their black beavers , the majesty of the law in every line and footstep . A TALE OF REMARKABLE PROGRESS Suggestive of comic opera though the Carabinieri seem , they are nevertheless most devoted fellows and absolutely essential to the maintenance of order . The condition of the mass of the Italian people is still far from happy and disorders are frequent , though rarely fatal when the paired guards are within range . Italy , it must not be forgotten , is largely an agricultural country , with the farm hands making up a third of the total population . Their lot is hard because of the agricultural conditions and the ignorance of the masses . Nevertheless , since the Italians became a nation , half a century ago , there has been amazing progress in every direction . Agricultural methods have vastly improved , agricultural production doubled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of importation . In fact , Italy is now among the exporting nations , and the rapid growth of her industrial enterprises bids fair to make her , as an English writer points out , as highly organized and efficient , in a manufacturing sense , as was Belgium prior to 1914 . Italian emigration is due largely to overpopulation , and the consequent oversupply of labor at very low rates , rather than to the agricultural conditions , while the progress made in public education has been so wonderful as to give sound basis for the hope that within a reasonable time illiteracy will be as negligible in Italy as it is in the United States . Public schools maintained by the communes , with State help where necessary , have already diminished illiteracy from 73 per cent in 1871 to about 44 per cent in 1911 ( the last official census ) . Despite the brilliant progress achieved in only forty years , this figure is appalling . Notwithstanding , the poorest Italian has the sun in his eyes and the geniality of the gods in his smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something never to be forgotten . I remember , after the Vesuvian eruption of 1906 , seeing a man whose home had been destroyed and the work of a lifetime obliterated calmly cooking a meal of potatoes and chestnuts over a hot spot in the lava stream that had overwhelmed his place . " Gia ! I have a fine stove now ! " was his dry comment . THE BEGINNINGS OF ITALY So far as general world interest is concerned , the story of Italy begins its importance with the period made historic by the advent of the Greeks in the vicinage of what is now Naples . This was a neighborhood doomed at the very beginning to be fatal to every race that spread about the shores of its exquisite bay . The beauty of the scenery , with the vast black and green Vesuvius gemming it ominously ; the mild and sunny climate of dolce far niente ; the soft and perfumed airs , all strongly predisposed the sternest men to languor and voluptuousness . Not a single one of the nations who have left us memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences , or became sufficiently acclimated in all the long centuries to leave us one great and enduring monument . To find " the glory that was Greece , " one must go southward for 6o miles along the scalloped green and silver strand that borders the azure sea to Pstum , the Poseidonia of Greek days . The same dazzling sunshine the worshipers of Poseidon , or Neptune , knew pours down its glorious flood upon temple ruins so majestic and sublime , so quick with the austere loftiness of soul that marked their builders , we wonder that anything ever could have happened to obliterate the city which Herodotus tells us flourished five centuries and a half before our era began ; a garden city , a city still , in the time of the great Latin poets , wreathed and  | garlanded with the " twice-blooming roses of Pxstum . " But brooding silence has fallen over these magnificent Doric remains and their flattened city . We may study undisturbed the subtle refinements the architects adopted to give grace and elegance to structures of so heavy a type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the curving line of foundation and entablature , the perfect coherence and simplicity that has made the Greek form the only one perfect in appearance without regard to size . Even the hardy Roman who met and imbibed the softer culture of the polished Greek in southern Italy here went to pieces mentally and gave history only Lucullian feasts and sybaritic indulgence of every sort . The most lavish and profligate of all the watering places of imperial ( lays grew up at Baia , named for T'lysses ' helmsman , to the west of Naples , along the Gulf of Pozzuoli . No beauty , convenience , or luxury the Roman world could produce to give the region added charm was lacking . The foundations of many of the magnificent villas and baths were thrown far out into the warm , inviting bay . THE CRUMBLED GLORIES OF EAIAE But with the decline of Rome , Bake and its district crumbled ; and all we have today as means for the interpretation of that gay and splendid era are shattered remains of masonry , colonnades , passageways , mosaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water huge blocks of concrete vaguely tracing the lines of those baths where the gilded youth and corrupt old age of Rome idled away the sunny hours and occupied their minds with the devising of new sorts of indulgence . One of the ancient Roman towns near by is still very much alive ? Pozzuoli . Founded by the Greeks , it was captured by the Romans , and at one time was the most important commercial city in the Empire . Its harbor was a focus of traffic with Egypt and the East . Spices and perfumes from the Nile , copper and gold from Tarshish ( Spain ) , slaves and weapons and other commodities in popular demand landed here . And St. Paul , in those comfortable , letter-like chapters of the Acts , that describe his adventures on the way up to Rome and martyrdom , says : " And we came the next day to Puteoli , where eye found brethren and were desired to tarry with them seven days . " The modern town is an attractive manufacturing community , much of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or volcanic earth , named after it . " NAPOLI LA BELLA ! " Naples , aside from its amazing local beauty , is a dirty south Italian seaport , full of fleas and beggars , noisy as pandemonium day and night , without a really distinguished edifice , and peopled by a conglomerate mass as strikingly beautiful physically as they are notoriously untrustworthy . From the storied heights that sweep in a magnificent amphitheater around the brilliant bay the old city straggles downward in a picturesque huddle of densely packed houses and other buildings , tortuous streets full of color and bubbling with the nervous activity of the south , black canyons of stone stairs , slippery with damp and dirt , across which the teeming houses gossip and quarrel in neighborly wise . Nowhere are fisherfolk more picturesque in habit and costume ; nowhere is there so salty a dialect , spiced with such myriad quaint and startling phrases and exclamations . Bare and brown of leg , dressed in ragged , parti-colored motley , a stout canvas band about each sinewy body for hauling in the net without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shimmering silver quarry right along the widest , finest promenade in the city ? the handsome Via Caracciolo . Across that broad street the charming Villa Nazionale , not a house , but a public park , wholly conventional in design , contains an aquarium which may fairly be considered the most remarkable in the world for both the variety and interest of its finny and monstrous exhibits and the thoroughness of its scientific work . To it many of the great universities of the world contribute annually for the privilege of sending special investigators in zoology.  | During the afternoon drive , which is an institution throughout all Italy , ar endless procession flashes past the park to the pistoling of whips , the running obligato of chatter and exclamation , shout of encouragement , and execration for careless driving . Everybody drives . The lofty drag of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Aosta rolls solemnly along behind magnificent bays in stately silence ; tourists " rubber " by ir hired hacks ; a motley array of shabby . genteel carriages contains a nobility toe proud to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supperiess , and snappy little gigs and carts , brilliant with paint ane varnish , dance along behind fiery miniature barbs decked out in all the toggery of feathers and bells and fancy leather that Italian ingenuity can suggest . Nowhere are there such experts at extracting frightful explosions from a whiplash m in this happy-go-lucky Naples ; nowhere such a tumult of sound and color ; nowhere such light-hearted irresponsibility The commercial activity of this largest city and second seaport of Italy clings close about the skirts of the enormous royal palace ? Soo feet long on the bay side and 95 feet high ? and the naval basin and dockyard . Every smell and sound of a thriving seaport may be smelt and heard , multiplied generously ; every flag seen on the ships that ride at anchor near the stone wharves . BABEL LESS CONFUSED On the streets men of every race mingle tongues and costumes and manners ; Babel itself was only mildly confused compared with this jumble of Naples ; and throughout all the throng play the beggar , the street musician , the macaronieater ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently ? the piratic cabman , the guide , and the baggage-smasher ? all seeking whom they may plunder with a gracious twinkle of humid black eyes and a smile that makes the being robbed a pleasure .  | Street singing is an especially Neapolitan institution , and when for the first time one hears beneath his windows the more often than not off-key versions of the snappy , lilting , inexpressibly infectious Neapolitan songs , he is enchanted , and throws pennies freely . After a week or so of it as a steady diet , day and night , he inclines much more toward heavy crockery ! VOLCANOES BIG AND LITTLE The entire Neapolitan littoral is volcanic , from Vesuvius on the east to the storied tufa heights of Cone on the west . Between Cumne 's ruins and Naples lie those famed and mystic Phlegrican fields of our school days , which nobody remembers anything about . They have always been a theater of tremendous volcanic activity , but the disturbances here have no connection , curiously enough , with Vesuvius ; also , the two areas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the rock of the Phlegr can fields allowed the internal steam and gases to escape with relatively little resistance at numerous points ; so , instead of one tremendous peak being formed , as in the case of Vesuvius , many little craters wart the ground . Thirteen still exist , among them Solfatara , bellowing out a vaporous combination of sulphur , hydrogen , and steam , and producing startling little special eruptions when teased with a lighted stick ; dried-up Lake Agnano , with its famous , or infamous ! " Dog Grotto , " where about 1S inches of warm , bluish , fmtid carbonic acid gas snuffs out torches even more quickly than it used to the poor dogs kept there for ; how purposes ; and somber Lake Avernus , in ancient times surrounded by dense forests and dark traditions , one of which declared no bird could fly across it because of its poisonous exhalations . VESUVIUS : DESTROYER AND RENOVATOR The Cunvean Sybil was supposed to inhabit a gloomy cavern in the south bank . Her room and others in the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emperor Augustus . In this same region is the Monte Nuovo , 435 feet high , thrown up in three days in 1538 . On the east Vesuvius dominates the whole splendid region . He is the Cyclops standing , blind and massive and treacherous , in the midst of his rich vineyards , olive groves , and vegetable gardens ; for , though he spreads destruction in his blind rages , the fact is that this entire photo is the marvelously fertile soil that disintegrated lava and volcanic ashes make . It bears huge crops , far greater and finer than ordinary good soil can produce . Nmong other things , it yields the grapes whose spicy juices are so precious their vvine is termed Lacrima Cristi ? Tears of Christ . Is it any wonder that the native returns again and again to repair the damage and risk his life to produce such wine and olives and fruit ? BURIED HERCULARNEUM AND POMPEII After the great eruption of A. D. i9 there were occasional eruptions which varied in intensity , until 1300 , when the volcano became quiescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrub , while cattle and wild boars roamed the grassy plain inside ? all but an ominous lower level of ashes and pools of hot , gaseous water . Then , in December of 1631 , the whole interior was blown violently out , and 18,0oa people are said to have perished . Since then Vesuvius has never been entirely quiet . During the eruption of 1906 the column of smoke and ashes rose to a height of about two miles , and some of the ashes were carried as far as observatories in prance and Switzerland . It was horrible hot mud that overwhelmed fashionable Herculaneum in i9 , belched from the crater as torrents of steam , boiling water , and scoriie . It raised the level of the entire countryside 65 feet , filled tip the harbor , and wiped out practically all the townsfolk . The elder Pliny , who commanded the Roman squadron in the roadstead , went to his death near Stabix , like gallant sailor he was , trying to assist some hapless refugees . Herculaneum is more a misty memory than anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made excavations almost impossible . The town is a rich and tempting bait to the archeeologists , however , for from a single one of the ruins came most of those exquisite bronzes in the Naples . Museum , and 3,000 rolls of papyrus , part of the owner 's private library . What a contrast is Pompeii , destroyed at the same time , but by ashes ! Though these gradually hardened into something like cement , they are much more easily removed than the stone at I lerculaneum , and most of what we know of the details of ancient Latin life we have learned from the stark , scarred , roofless lower stories spread out before us in deathly panorama within the old city walls . Sixteen years before the eruption Pompeii was badly damaged by an earthquake and practically rebuilt in the new Roman style , the town laid out four-square , with streets crossing at right angles Architecturally , therefore , Pompeii represents one definite epoch of antiquity . It had the usual Roman forum , with its temples , baths , colonnades , etc. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops because of the intimate knowledge they give us of the domestic life of an ancient people . UNCHANGING COMMERCE We see their bakeries , in whose ovens quantities of bread were discovered ; their wine shops , with casks labeled as holding different qualities ? all connected by one pipe ; a bank , with its waxen records of loans , receipts , and the like : shops of dyers , jewelers , sporting-goods dealers , potters , and so on indefinitely . Spirited frescoes decorate stuccoed walls , intricate mosaics make handsome pavements , and houses and courts yield up statuettes , images , jewelry , and all the impedimenta of a rich and varied culture . And in the little museum , inside the old Sea Gate , we see even casts of the bodies of the luckless inhabitants as they were found , after eighteen centuries of ashen interment . Where the pretty little modern watering place of Castellammare di Stabia , with its cooling sea baths and strong mineral waters , lies snugly in a little bight on the neck of the Sorrentine peninsula , Stabiae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of Italy , a region of tumbled hills clothed with luxuriant groves of orange and lemon , whose golden fruit adds luster to the gleaming foliage . Enticing-roads of milky white wind and wind , now between high-walled grove and vineyard ; now along open , skyey heights , with the blue sea as a background hundreds of feet below , and the beetling cliff rising straight behind ; now beside villa gardens , where every brilliant color on Nature 's palette seems to have been poured out with prodigal fullness . The air is perfumed , the skies are soft and balmy , the roads superb . BEAUTIFUL CAPRI Capri , a great , twin-humped camel of an island , kneels in the blue just off the tip of the peninsula . From the swaybacked huddle of white , pink , blue , cream , and drab houses along the large harbor , up the breakneck road to the fascinating town nestling among the hills , whiteroofed and Moorish , and on , still higher , by the winding road or up the nearly perpendicular flights of rock stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zigzag outlines , to Anacapri , 500 feet or so above , every step of the way breathes the pride and splendor and degradation of the island 's greater days . Isere a cyclopean mass of shattered masonry in the warns emerald water tells of a Roman emperor 's bath ; yonder on a chimney-like cliff the sinister ruins of a stout castle keep whispers of ancient garrisons and pirates , not armed with automatic rifles or high-powered artillery ; and here , overlooking the sea , the vast ruins of a villa recall " that hairy old goat " Tiberius and his wastrel voluptuousness that turned fair Capri into satyrdom . Capri today is richly dowered for sightseer , artist , historian , antiquary , and geologist . On every hand are shaded walks and sequestered bowers in the thick groves of orange and lemon , laurel and myrtle ; wild backgrounds of tumbled rock ; titanic rifts in the coast , into which the sea has thrust long , insidious blue fingers  | From high in air to below the waterline the island is scarred and pitted with myriad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some through which the never-quiet sea moans and sobs with the agonized wail of an hurt monster ; one white , with little pools of pure , sweet water on its floor , only a few inches above the sea ; one greener than emerald one blue as heaven , with row upon row of delicate pink corals and tiny scarlet jelly-fish studding the waterline like jewels , while the refraction of the sunlight tints everything with the most marvelously diaphanous color , through which the silvery ripples of the bottom sand , about 40 feet below , seem within arm 's length . Driving up over the crest of the Sorrentine peninsula , the Siren ' Islands loom in the distance , too far away for even the echo of the charmers ' song to be heard . At Positano the road divides into two white ribbons , binding the town to the ; Teen hillside .

Now it skirts the shoulder of a cliff , with only an 18-inch wall between the wheels and the boulders hundreds of feet below . Furore flashes up at one like a rainbow as he dashes , blinking , out of an inky little tunnel upon a soaring viaduct in the blinding sunshine . A little group of fishermen 's houses , clinging to the bare  | hind ? a tiny strip of gleaming beach , and gaily painted fishing boats beside the dazzling emerald sea ? that is Furore !

In a low cleft of the hills the houses fairly pile upon one another , as though there were not room for them all on the hillside . Back on the mist-veiled crags loom other towns , and all day long , down the road that winds dizzily among the peaks , come old women and young girls , staggering trlder heavy loads of fagots gathered in the woods above the clouds . And when they are not carrying fagots they are always knitting ? even when there is no war ! ? on the streets , in shops , gardens , fishing boats on the beach , gossiping by the fountain before the long stair that leads to the stater- black and white and mosaic Cathedral of St. Andrew . DESERTED 13ARDOR OF MIGHTIER DAYS On the road goes , through Atrani of the gloomy arches over the sea beach , past Minore ( the Little ) , where barelegged fishwives in bright , tucked-up skirts help their men to haul home the nets ; around the brilliant lemon gardens of Maiore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Raito and Vietri , before reaching Salerno , where , clinging stubbornly to the hillsides like limpets , the houses rise from the rock between sea and sky , some of them standing half upon the hill and half upon tall buttresses that reach ' down to the harbor sands .

Later these gentlemen adventurers came back , simply for the love of the beautiful country , and with naught but their keen two-handed swords and their manhood hewed out a brilliant kingdom for themselves .

In some definite and lasting way practically every phase of the life of central Italy has influenced the world for progress ? religious , political . scientific , intellectual , humanitarian . The most vital forces that actuate our twen- tieth century thoughts and activities are developments of the purpose , ideals , and philosophy of the central Italians , from the clays when Roman school - boys scratched caricatures of Christians on the walls of public buildings upon the Palatine to the beginning of the decadence that followed hard upon the Renaissance in Florence and her compeer cities . First of all the Italian cities to shake the world was Rome , imperial center of civilization , culture , politics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and bear forever her stamp and sign . Her first period gave to the world lessons in discipline , centralized government , colonial policy and control , civil law , military science , hygiene , and water supply . The very persecutions of that age stimulated the primitive Christians throughout the ) empire into banding together until the early Church took definite shape . The succeeding Rosman Catholic Church was the tireless conservator of all learning and culture during the perilous Dark Ages ? the inspirer , the civilizer , the sustainer . And after that black night had passed , and men began out of the wreck of the old to build the new , it was still the Church which was able to remodel civilization . Geography 's part in Roman History Though the situation of aples , with its enervating charm , worked nothing but evil to that city , the location and physical character of Rome ? hills for defense , a river for navigation , broad surrounding fields for grazing ? proved the greatest asset of her people . It had so nianv natural advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly became Roman , thus making the city always the strongest in the peninsula . because it was the home and fortress of the strongest people .  | And from being the strongest city of her district , and then of her whole country , Rome naturally expanded until she dominated all the world of her time . One of her mightiest weapons was her malleability , her willingness to learn of others , even though her inferiors . So she progressed swiftly , irresistibly , originating here , improving there , experimenting yonder , with the result that the ichor Flowed from her sturdy veins throughout the whole world in inspiration and example . The charming legend of the beginnings of Rome is quaintly illustrated by the famous bronze figure known as the Capitoline Wolf . For the benefit of visitors to the museum , let me say that the wolf is a very ancient beast , but the twins so naively attached to her are modern additions . The archxologists , alas , no longer permit us to believe the legend , or that the town took its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an unruly and turbulent stream ; but the sophisticated descendants of the early Romans who sought to appease his anger by sacrifices and rich gifts ? have restrained him within massive walls . From a height the river looks a huge walled fosse , as if onehalf the city were protecting itself against the other . The bridges that leap the tawny flood in noble arches of gleaming limestone and ruddy brick and dark metal ? throbbing by day with pedestrians and vehicles and sparkling of an evening with their golden lights ? give a curiously different effect : that of stitches binding together the edges of the great gash . At first Roman genius concerned itself only with useful works , such as sewers , bridges , viaducts . The Cloaca Maxima , the great sewer that still drains the Forum into the Tiber , is probably the oldest true arch in Europe , and testifies both to the Romans ' study of Etruscan models and to their skill as architectural engineers . And what aqueducts they built simple , grand , splendid ! Witness the towering Acqua Claudia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , flat Campagna like a giant on stilts ? a hundred feet high in places . Water was something every Roman community enjoyed by right of citizenship . Ancient Rome is said to have consumed no less than 340,000,000 gallons of water a day ; and one of the most noticeable features of the modern town is the prodigal effervescence of its water , gushing from fountains of every conceivable size and design . The Trevi is the most magnificent in the city , its water ? called Acqua Vergine ; Virgin Water , because of its purity ? the finest . The old Roman baths took a lot of water . The splendid Thernw built by the degenerate Emperor Caracalla had accommodations for sixteen hundred bathers . Beside the baths proper , the establishment included within its area , of about a quarter of a mile square , a gymnasium , athletic field , library , and even a race track . Its ruins tower above the plain today like some mountain blasted by Nature . " ALL , ROADS LEAD TO ROME " The time , the skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the most remarkable of all their engineering works ? are almost incredible . No less than eleven of these great arteries radiated from the city ? " all roads lead to Rome , " runs the ancient proverb . The most famous , the Via Appia , was built in 312 B. C. It was kept in constant repair until the Middle Ages , and still connects Rome and Brindisi , a distance of 366 miles ( see page 306 ) . Though no burials were permitted in Roman cities , it comes as a surprise to find the finest roads lined with the ruins of all sorts of tombs ; stranger yet to find that in medieval times the most magnificent of the tombs were turned into strongholds and crowned with battlements . The oldest and handsomest of the tombs on the Appian Way is the enormous circular mausoleum of the Lady Ciecilia Metellamore than 90 feet in diameter ? with a frieze of flowers and skulls of oxen . Equally impressive , though not a stronghold , is the slender , graceful , pyramidal tomb of Sir Caius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ostian Gate , whence St. Paul emerged on his way to martyrdom . We probably never should have heard of Sir Caius but for this pyramid ; the egotism of men sometimes lives after them .  | Rome 's greatest historic and traditional interest centers in the Forum Romanum , once a deep and marshy little valley between the Capitoline and Palatine Hills . In the beginning it probably looked something like one of the present-day open-air markets . But it did not look like a market long , for temples and imposing public buildings were added more and more to the shops and stalls until the whole Forum was a blaze of gilded bronze and d marble , a magnificent show place worthy of the center of civilization ( page 30j ) . And today ? Ghosts and ruin ! Here in a somber file are the stumps of the columns of the Colonnade of the Twelve Gods . That heavy basement of brick and d mortar , with bits of cracked marble still bravely shining on it , was the Orators ' Platform , where Antonv came " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Across the Holy Way- all there is left of murdered Cresar 's Basilica Julia is its brick foundation ; beyond , the crumbling fragments of the palace of the Vestal Virgins , where a few melancholy , shattered statues of the high priestesses of this pure and lovely cult stand tranquilly amid the desolation . STIRRING TILE POETS ' IRE Every foot of ground in the Forum has interest , much of it tragic ? like the barren spot where , tradition says , Virginias snatched a knife from a butcher 's block and slew his beautiful ( laughter Virginia , while Appius Claudius raged in impotent fury ; or the Vials Tuscus ( Tuscan street ) , where the shopkeepers stirred the poets to ire by using their precious manuscripts as wrapping-paper ! And hither and von , from Palatine to Capitoline , from Tabularium to Colosseum , only ruin brick , mortar , marble , columns , arches , statuary ? all desolate and forlorn and broken . And the lamentable part of it all is that it was not the northern barbarian who accomplished the greatest ruin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Roman who wished to build church or palace simply came here , tore down and carried away whatsoever he would . Worse yet , contractors actually demolished whole structures ? to burn their marble for lime ? and eventually peasants turned the buried waste into a vegetable garden and a cow- pasture . It was not until 1870 that the Italian Government began systematic excavation and unearthed the present panorama of destruction . ARCHITECTURE THE KEYNOTE OE ROMAN CHARACTER The Romans were late in developing artistic genius , for first of all they were men of action : fighters , strategists , politicians ? imperialists . Their work reflects them ? their vast strength , their love of lavish adornment , their lack of true refinement , and their carelessness of subordinate detail . Simpson points out iii his llistory of Architectural Development that had they possessed the artistic sense of their Greek neighbors their architecture would have been the grandest the world has ever seen . The greatest significance of the Roman gift to art lies in its universal distribution , for while the Romans laid their heavy yoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their laws and art ? perhaps I had better say the art of Greece , adapted and generalized , made fit for cosmopolitan acceptance . For all the destruction and modernizing that has transformed the Eternal City , its ancient magnificence crops out in unexpected places : in the blank wall of the Stock Exchange , eleven columns of Neptune 's temple ; in a narrow street , twelve arches of the Theater of Marcellus , filled with workshops ; again , a few forlorn survivors of the once splendid Porticus of Octavia , and so on . At the end of one . of the massive stitches that span the Tiber the gleaming solid marble of the exquisite little round temple of Mater Matuta ? or whatever it may have been called ? gems the bank like a great pearl . A. few paces farther along , thrusting indomitably up from the level of older days , all the beauty of pure Ionic ideals is crystallized in the so-called Temple of the Fortune of Men , soft-hued tufa and weathered travertine . The two stand almost intact , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it their practical sense ? ? seized upon and preserved them as churches when the old gods ceased to call .  | The largest and most wonderful of all Roman temples was Hadrian 's Pantheon , with its carelessly attached but splendid portico from a century-older temple of Agrippa . What walls ? 2o feet thick , and highest on the outside , to weight down the haunches of the concrete dome that covers the building like a huge shell ! One hundred and forty-two feet six inches the rotunda stands , and 142 feet 6 inches the structure measures in diameter , so subtly designed that although the walls are halfdomed and half-vertical inside it looks as if the dome began right at the floor . The beautiful and subtle effect of the lighting , from the single eye in the top of the dome , has never been excelled ( see page 3o8 ) . the PANTHEON 'S DFSI'OILIATION Though the Pantheon has been a Christian church since the seventh century , it has suffered most at the hands of Christians : the dome stripped of its gilded bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifled the bronze en route , and it never saw the Byzantine city ? and the portico robbed of its ceiling and bronze girders to make cannon for the Castello Sant ' Angelo , Iadrian 's transformed tomb . Not much remains of the exterior grandeur of this once most magnificent mausoleum in the world . But nowhere else can the history of ancient and medieval Rome be read more vividly than in its battered remains . Within and about it Roman and barbarian , Pope and Emperor , struggled and fought for i , 5oo years . On top of the castle still lie piles of cannon-balls made , in time of stress , from the beautiful marbles with which Hadrian adorned his lavish memorial . THE MILITARY MONUMENTS Magnificent columns and arches to commemorate their military exploits appealed strongly to the pomp-loving Emperors . Trajan obliterated a hill 142 feet high to build a private forum , the most splendid architectural achievement of the Golden Age of Rome . The sole majestic survivor of all that lavish display is his superb column , on which every phase of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is depicted with brilliant realism in the broad band of dashing , vigorous reliefs that wind from top to bottom . The most perfect example of the colossal type of triumphal arch is that of Titus , destroyer of Jerusalem . Erected in 81 A. D. , it stands near the end of the Sacra Via , beautifully simple , tremendously impressive ? one lofty arch between two terrific masses of masonry decorated with pilasters . Superb highrelief panels ? a specific creation of imperial Rome ? depict the sack of the Jewish capital , the Emperor 's triumph , and such historic loot as the great sevenbranched Hebrew candlestick . The Arch of Septimius Severus , though much larger , is not so good , while as for the very finest arch in the Empire , built by Constantine the Great in 312 , it is neither the construction nor decoration that most impresses us . It is the fact that close to the Colosseum , that bloodiest and most depraved institution in the Eternal City , Constantine , the first Christian Emperor , defying old gods and degenerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his victory over the tyrant Maxentius to the Divine power . THE HOUSE OF DEATH The most imposing theater ever erected by mortal hands , a grim house of death , consecrated by blood and tears , the Colosseum stands today a stupendous monument to Roman pride and degradation . Almost a third of a mile in circumference , it towers 157 feet tip into the air , the original and monumental " play to the gallery " of popular approval . In 8o A. D. Emperor Titus opened its history with a tremendous inaugural of an hundred drays of " games , " in which men fought with other men and with wild animals , and no one knows the exact tale of the lives snuffed out on its bloodied sands " to make a Roman holiday " ( see page 311 ) . In the construction of the Colosseum its builders adhered to their new note of superimposing the three Orders ? Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian ? an idea that has exerted a greater influence upon the design of monumental works than any other  | Roman innovation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today with the golden Italian sunshine glorifying every scar , and conjuring back from the dead past vivid spectacles of Roman holidays full of noise and color , laughter and bloody agonies : or when liquid moonlight transfigures the classic ruin into a magic fabric where stalk the thin ghosts of saint and vestal , slave and Emperor ? THE UNDERGROUND CITIES OF THIE DEAD Nature has been kind to the Palatine , that hill where dwelt the shepherd kings and where later rose the tremendous palaces of Emperor after Emperor , by clothing its scanty ruins with lavish verdure . The silence of oblivion broods over the fragments of the halls where Domitian played with his fleas and Caligula bathed in shimmering seas of minted coins . The most compelling thing upon the whole bosky hill is the little stone altar chiseled : Sei Deo , Sei , Deiz 're ? to the Unknown God . This was really the shrine of the protecting deity of the city , the patron god of Rome , and only the priests knew the dread spirit 's name . It was never written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , if the common people knew whom they worshiped , any traitor could reveal the sacred name to an enemy , who might bribe the deity to forget Rome . What a contrast ! ? the home of the Unknown God on the pleasant hillside , in the sun-sweetened air , and far underground , pent in the damp chill of the Catacombs , the altars often the sarcophagi of martyrs of the stout-hearted who worshiped the Known God . Originally cemeteries . perfectly well known to the pagan authorities , these remarkable vaults and galleries and chapels . 20 to 50 feet below the surface , became hiding places for the faithful in time of persecution . More than forty of these cities of the dead , which extend around Rome in a great subterranean circle , have been explored , and it has been estimated by an Italian investigator that between six and eight million bodies were interred in them . Not only are the tombs hewn in tiers along the walls of the galleries , but the galleries themselves are in stories , one above another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from mere daubs of red paint , telling the name of the deceased in a given tomb , to elaborate frescoes . Above ground there seems a great gap between the temples of the pagan city and the existing churches of Christian Rome , since all the oldest churches have been destroyed . This gap , however , is at least partly bridged over by the Catacombs . ST . PETER 'S CATHEDRAL It would be as impossible to give an adequate idea of Rome 's multitudinous churches as it would of the enormous quantity of art treasures in the museums , or an adequate and intelligible idea of the city 's unique and marvelous history . The overpowering monument of the Church of Rome is St. Peter 's Cathedral ? the tangible evidence of the evolution of the early Church into the present-day worldencircling spiritual power . Many an architect had a share in its building , but all that is admirable may be accredited to two : first . 1iramanti , then Michelangelo , who planned that vast dome , floating lightly as a soap-bubble above the roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effect by cutting off the view of the whole lower part by a lengthened nave and statues 19 feet high above the facade ! ( see pages 302-305 ) . About So , 000 persons ? nearly a sixth of the entire population of Rome ? can gather in this huge cathedral . The vast nave stretches away tremendously impressive under its magnificent barrel vault , 75 feet in span ; yet so perfectly is the building proportioned that only when standing beside a given detail can one grasp its real size . Nothing but a catalogue could describe the great interior , with its lavish mortuary monuments to dead Popes , its magnificent bronze baldachin , its celebrated effigy of the kissing ceremony , its amazingly perfect mosaic copies of the paintings of the old masters , which have been removed . Nor could any pen picture a tithe of the glory of Michelangelo 's frescoes in  | the Sistine Chapel , of the frescoes and paintings and other treasures in the Stanze and Galleries of Raphael in the adjoining Vatican ; indeed , of any of the wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthralling prospect from Michelangelo 's dome , 400 feet above the pavement . Below , Bernini 's huge colonnade , the grandest Doric peristyle since the Parthenon , extends its giant arms to gather the worshiping nations to its heart . The river , guarded by the mighty cylinder of the Castello Sant ' Angelo , glistens like a strip of curving asphalt after a summer shower , as it winds between its fortress walls . All about on every hand glows the turbid monotony of orange-brown tiles , broken hither and yon by round dome or square campanile , by the green of gardens and the gray of open squares , with the ancient streets cutting it all into erratic patchwork ; and beyond the city , the flat monochrome of the Campagna that tones away into the hazy mountains , those looming Alban hills whose wandering sons begat all this ? Rome ! ST . PAUL'S-BEYOND-THE-WALLS St. Paul , too , has his memorial , on the spot outside the walls where he is said to have been buried , a church that outranks all other basilicas in vastness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adornment , with eighty granite columns , rich old mosaics , and a frieze of mosaic medallion portraits of every Pope , from St. Peter down to Pius X. Adjoining the church are beautiful cloisters , cool and refreshing after the ornate interior . Graceful columns surround them in couples , here plain , here twisted into fanciful contours , here richly encrusted with Cosmato mosaics . They give both charm and distinction to the now silent close where the monks of old used to take their sober pleasurings . Modern Rome is as the visitor , and he would be a hardy soul indeed to say how and where the city most interestingly dis- closes itself ; whether in the surging life of the Via Nazionale or the Corso , each with its restless tide of cosmopolitan hue ; the Piazza del Popolo , with its diurnal passeggiata winding up the steep slopes of the wooded Pincio and through the formal gardens ; the Piazza di Spagna , where the ardent kodaker finds ample quarry among the picturesquely costumed artists ' models who loiter about the flower market on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain Trinity ; the Seven Hills themselves , or the lower quarters where the crowded masses herd in noisy camaraderie . To each who sees it all comes a different impression of the sense and purpose of the ever youthful city of the hills . THE SPIRIT OP MODERN ROME But equally to all who stand , of a sunny day in the garden of the Knights of Malta , on Aventine 's crest , and look away through the leafy lane among the trees , comes the sense that here , regardless of the vivid life of the city below , is visible the spirit of the true Rome , of the Eternal City ; for off in the near distance , framed by the branches of the little park , floats the dome of St. Peter 's triumphant above man and all his works ; as proud , as vast , as massive as ever Italian art could make it ; sign and symbol even yet of the character and force of the city which for centuries has molded not only her own sons , but stamped an ineradicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMPAGNA The picturesque desolation of the Campagna , dotted with the summer straw and wicker huts of the peasants instead of the villas of the rich and noble ancients , is swept about by mountain , forest , and sea , gemmed with sparkling lakes and pocked with dead craters and splendid ruins . The planting of eucalyptus trees and systematic drainage is working bravely for a reclamation of the rnarshy plain to its flourishing condition when , as ancient Latium , it gave the Romans to the world . To the southeast the extinct volcanic Alban Mountains form a striking background for equally striking towns ? Castel Gandolfo of papal fame , with its huge palace dominating the somberly lovely Lake Albano , darkly cupped by the lips of an extinct but forbidding crater ; and the serene , pellucid sapphire of the Lake of Nemi , " Diana 's Mirror , " hardly ever kissed by the faintest breeze . Its lofty lava walls are so precipitous one marvels at the daring , skill , and patience of the peasants who have so wonderfully cultivated them . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt Sabine Range , beautiful , heavily wooded , copiously watered limestone peaks . Tivoli is cradled like an eagle 's nest high among these sheltering hills , moated about on three sides by the foaming impatience of the Anio , that bursts violently out hither and yon in long , snowy pennons of flying spume . The precipice is jeweled with the mutilated little temple of the Sybil , the town ragged and twisty and instinct with charming irregularities and contradictions ; and the great , gloomy , neglected Villa d'Este is magnificent yet with the saturnine beauty of its dusky cypresses and ilex , gray olives and heavy hedges . Small wonder that Tivoli and these lovely Sabine hills drew the ancient summer colonists , or that a mile away Hadrian himself should have erected an imperial villa that was a marvel in its day , and now in ours is only a confusing , conglomerate ruin among weedy gardens . THE GRIFFIN CITY OF PERUGIA Away to the north and west stretches that most delightful and suggestive region , Umbria , well called the " Galilee of Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a green and brown land of isolated hills , each crowned by its special type of city , and of rolling meads between ; a rich and fertile land , full of the quiet , pastoral beauty that infuses the work of the Umbrian School of painters ; a land of cities romantically unchanged . Of all the Umbrian communities , the Griffin City of Perugia is the most interesting , the bloodiest , the most compelling . Here again we have striking proof of the value of geographical location . Much of the power and eminence of the city was due to its situation at the juncture of several long spines of hill , 1,200 feet high , commanding the Tiber , that winds  | at its feet , and two great Roman roads . Today it sprawls about its hilltops , for all the world like some uncouth sea monster with thick , wavy legs and arms flung out in groping search for prey , bolstered up here , braced there , underlaid yonder by tremendous masses of masonry . The old towers and donjon keeps , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have most of them vanished ; others have been beheaded ; but the whole aspect of the town is even today military and despotic ; and many a house still shows traces of the heavy chains that barred the dangerous streets after nightfall , when , if a man forgot his steel undershirt , he came home in a shroud ! Even the quaint and beautiful friezes above some of the doors , with Latin inscriptions and mottoes , can not abate its severity . Here one reads Pulchra janua ubi honesta downs ( Beautiful the door of an honest house ) , there Soli'citudo mater divitaruin ( Carefulness is the mother of riches ) , and over a church lintel the pious Jauua Coeli ( Door of Heaven ) . The old , joyous life of the city centered in the Piazza del Duomo . Here the gentle Perugians played at their game of hurling stones at one another until often a dozen were killed and scores wounded . But that was Perugia ! And what of the innocent looking iron fence about the central fountain ? Many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stuck there by other nobles whose turn was yet to come . No wonder Perugia needed Porte del mortuccio ? special " doors of the dead " ? tall , arched , narrow ; walled up now and easily passed unseen . At one side of the Piazza is the big , unfinished Gothic Cathedral of San Lorenzo , with its beautifully carven choir stalls and that graceful little open-air pulpit , leaning slightly toward the sun . where St. Bernard preached to an unregenerate people and watched the books on necromancy and the ladies ' false hair burned . THE HOLY CITY OF ASSISI Across the fertile vale softly colored Assisi , the Holy City , the town of the Saints , the mystic heart of Umbria , stands upon its hills , and high above all . like a Titan smitten by the thunder , rises the grim , austere old ruin of the Rocca , that castle the Assisans regretted as bitterly as they had longed fervently for its protection . In the plain below , the little river Tescio winds and twists in burnished zigzags that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corn and olive clad slopes of the hills . There is hardly a more medieval city in Italy in aspect than Assisi , and this quaint idea is intensified by the burrows that run in a perfect labyrinth beneath the level of the twisty , narrow , shut-in streets ? hiding places into which , before the city was fortified , the frightened citizens could pop at the first sign of an approaching enemy . It is a city of churches and confraternity buildings , held even yet in the spell of St. Francis . And not of St. Francis alone . His ideals and work so moved the rich and lovely Clara Scifi that she forsook everything in life to be his co-worker and inspirer . Like him , she founded an Order ? the Poor Claresand lies today in the simple church that bears her saintly name , embayed among the soft gray olives on the hillside . THE PREACHER OF POVERTY 'S Magnificent CHURCH It was the glorification rather than the spell of St. Francis that inspired the genius who , at the very tip of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazingly strong and beautiful Church of San Francesco , the first Gothic church in Italy ? a vast double pile , one church above another ? with a magnificent monastery sweeping down its side . It stands solidly upon massive substructures among the gnarled old olive trees of the slope , so perfect in design and location that from every vantage point and in every light it is new and different . But what a church , what a monastery for the preacher of poverty ! Within , from floor to arches , Italian painting was reborn in wondrous frescoes that " spoke to : lien who could not read . . . but whose hearts received . . . teaching through the eye . " Cimabue , Gaddo Gaddi , Giunta , and the greatest of all ,  | Giotto , covered these walls with pictures that had far more than mere decorative significance . For the first time in the story of Christian a r t t h e whole Christian belief was summarized in such a lifelike , natural way upon these acres of walls that it sufficed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and indeed even for ourselves . Far nearer to the Franciscan ideal is the desolate hermitage of Le Carceri , far out beyond the town in a bleak , wild g o r g e , where the e y e can hardly distinguish man-made walls from natural rock . St. Francis loved to retire to this barren solitude for meditation when the battle he fought against worldliness and sin impaired his physical and spiritual vigor . About t h e Carceri grow somber ilex tree s , beneath which he preached his sermon to the birds , and above all rises the jagged peak of Subasio , gray as the monkish habit . It is the abode of silence and of peace and memory . Indeed , that is Assisi ? memory , silence , peace ! THE QUEEN CITY OF TUSCANY Northwest of Umbria , Tuscany unrolls a panorama of surpassing beauty and contrast , from the grim Apennine crags on the east , downward in a gentle slope dotted with hills , watered by innumerable streams on every side , to the blue Tyrrhenian Sea . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry beds of prehistoric lakes near certain of its cities and toward the coast forming little plains that serve to intensify the more rugged charm of its hilliness . Tuscany 's three great cities ? Florence , Siena , and Pisa ? stand opposed in every respect : in character , appearance , history , and interest today . The story of Florence is the story of humanity : the broad , deep , moving epic of the awakening of man to his own divine power ; the story of wonderful selfmade men who had but one idea in common ? the thirst for free activity of soul . So the tale of the New Birth , the Renaissance , is the record of individual spirit so free , so subtle and elastic , so profoundly penetrating to the springs of human purpose , that it has furnished the motive power of the world ever since ; and Florence , as its source and focus , because of  | the conditions then obtaining in tue city i and throughout Italy , was the one spot in the world capable of producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RENAISSANCE BEGAN IN FLORENCE And all this astonishing genius grew directly out of ? business ! The city was peopled by men who manufactured the necessities of life , by merchants , speculators , bankers , tradesmen , artisans , handicraftsmen of every type . Business , work , was a condition of active participation in the life of the State , and because they did not work , the nobles were debarred from this . It was the burghers. the people , who ruled ; and even when evil chance laid the State under the heavy hand of a despot , the was forced to develop his own character to the uttermost , because his rule depended entirely upon his capacity as a man . The aristocracy , accordingly , was that of intelligence , of men who became eminent because , first of all , they were the best in their own individual work . Under the practical inspiration of these mental giants , Florence was recreated and learned to view life from within instead of superficially ; she learned that the individual is the soul of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true to the best interests of its individuals . And the Renaissance , the new creation ? was it merely a wonderful revival of learning ? It was infinitely more : it was the freeing of the human spirit from shackling bonds of medieval tradition , superstition , and misconception ; it was the dawning- of the mental liberty we enjoy today ; it was the beginning of the third distinct period Italian genius gave to civilization , the greatest period and the greatest gift of all ; it was the launching of man 's greatest and most heroic adventure . The severe grandeur of medieval Florence still gives a specific character to the  | town of the Guilds . Its palaces , its bridges , the sweep of its Lung ' Arno , its embattled visage with the souls of the houses peering from behind their iron bars at the blue hills , are still the same . The proudest jewels in its crown are the three great buildings in the Piazza Duomo . Oldest of these is the beautiful octagonal I aptistery , with Ghiberti 's perfect bronze doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " young Michelangelo cried when he saw them . The cathedral , Sta . Maria dei F'iorias much a feature of the Florentine landscape as a man 's nose is a part of his face ? looms large from any vantage point , its buoyant dome floating airily above the marble paneling of the softcolored walls . It fills one with admiring astonishment for its symmetrical dimension , its perfect poise , its grandeur , its everlasting strength . Fit companion to it is Giotto 's Campanile , slender and strong and graceful as a young maid beside her portly mother . Richly ornamented with bas-reliefs and statues , the superb belltower is a marble history , left standing open for the delight of appreciative readers ( see page 326 ) . THE CHURCH OF THE BROKEN HEART 'S As a general thing the intellectuals of Florence went calmly on with their creative work , unmindful of the tumult about them . Not so Dante . With all the fervor of his artistic temperament , he plunged into the thick of politics , in the endeavor to save his beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he reached the zenith of his powers . Broken-hearted and bitter , he died at Ravenna in 1321 , and his ashes are still there ; but in the old Franciscan church of the Holy Cross rises one of the two monuments disdainful Florence condescended to give her greatest poet , whose greatest honor lies in his gift to the world at one splendid sweep of a pure and recreated Italian language ? until his time halting and feeble in that immortal masterpiece of literature . the Divina Commedia . This church might well be known as the Broken Hearts , instead of Santa Croce. for near Dante 's cenotaph lies the body of that other terrific genius , Michelangelo , who , broken in spirit , ( lied gladly when the city so dear to his heart fell once more upon dark and tyrannous days . And Galileo is here , too , and Alfieri , and iiacchiavelli , and many another , a brilliant train . Michelangelo 's last work is in the Church of San Lorenzo , in the mortuary chapel of the Medici ? the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its enmity throughout his life . He ( lid not make portraits of the statues over the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo , son and grandson of the Magnifico . When some one remonstrated , he replied with haughty carelessness that he did not suppose people a century later would care much how the Dukes looked . IN lost probably they did n't ! While he was working in the mausoleum the Aiedici , who had been expelled for the third time , came thundering at the city 's gates . Always a strong republican , Michelangelo engineered the fortifications by day and worked stealthily on his statues by night . Florence fell : her sun had set : and the tombs became less a monument to the tyrants for whom they were reared than to his cherished city . And so he wrought , not the still beauty of the Greeks , but the symbols of his own desperation in the marvelous Twilight and Dawn , and Day and Night upon the tombs . THE UFFIZZI AND PITTI PALACES In the two great palaces of the Uffizzi and Pitti are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of the geniuses who made Florence the peerless city of art transcendent , and left behind them models for all time , not merely of material beauty and perfection in painting and sculpture , but of thought as well ? Fra Angelico of the sexless , radiant angels ; Lippo Lippi of the daringly human Madonnas ; visionary Botticelli ; del Sarto of the soulless , exquisite technique as smooth as Nature ; emotional , precocious Correggio ; and R a p h a e 1 , greater than all , summing up in his swift , apparently effortless mastery more than the genius of all the rest ? color , proportion , beauty , intellect , spirituality , and rare human kindness . Florence wears a splendid living girdle  | in the silvery Arno , barred with many a stately bridge , bordered on either hand by the broad , plain edging of the Lung ' Arno promenade . With the measured tramp of the soldiers and the squeal of their angry-sounding bugles ? and the soldier is always in evidence in Florence , even in times of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The illusion of the medieval is even greater by night , when the bridges set twinkling coronets over the sparkling stream , and the mysterious military figures marching past might be the halberdiers and pikemen of Lorenzo I1 Magnifico , instead of the Bersaglieri of Vittorio Emmanuele III . THE GREAT GUILDS The Ponte Vecchio , with its queer , covered , second-story passageway between the two palaces , is a pure delight , its little houses looking so insecurely slapped against its sides that they seem always threatening to come off and drop into the stream ( see page 330 ) . The inside of the bridge is equally curious , with its beguiling shops of jewelry and precious stones . Since the fourteenth century it has been occupied by the Guild of the Goldsmiths , one of the original societies of Florentine labor and science . These guilds were the prototypes of our labor organizations and played a prominent part , not only in politics , but in the artistic development of the city as well . This interest of the working people was one of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . the PALAZZO VECCHIO AND SAVONAROLA In the old , battlemented Palazzo Vecchio , which still rears its created head in the pride of militant beauty , we may say that Florentine history was made from the beginning of the fourteenth century down to the unification of Italy under Victor Immanuel II of Sardinia . It stands on the Piazza of the Signoria , the great forum of the people . To one side is the Loggia dei Lanzi , a splendid , open , vaulted rostrum or platform , now an open-air museum of sculpture . Among the figures is the beautiful , if somewhat affected . Perseus of Benvenuto Cellini , a master work that has been copied all over the world . It was in this piazza that the austere monk , Girolamo Savonarola , who towers above the most splendid figures w ho have peopled Florence , gallantly died by fire . The most charming and attractive mural decorations in Florence are the figures and groups of glazed white terracotta , usually on a blue ground , larger - the work of the della Robbia family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapels , with their sympathetic , floating figures , and from the spandrels of the battered , grimy old Hospital of the Innocenti ? the first real Renaissance structure ? a lovely band of Andrea della Robbia 's swaddled infants gaze out , extending tiny hands in mute supplication to the hard-hearted . Luca della Robbia worked well in both bronze and marble before he began his work in clay , as his exquisite singing and dancing boys , panels once nthe choir screen , and now in the cathedral museum , attest ( see page 329 ) . SunseT In FLORENCE Though the sun of the Florentine republic set nearly four centuries ago , the sun of ature still continues to set over the city as it did in the days of her glory . Cross the river , and wind slowly up the lovely , rose - hedged , tree - embowered Viale dei Colli to the Piazza Michelangelo , high above the city , to see the Master Painter spread his wonder-palette at the close of day . The sun steals down toward his cool bed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bluish green of the river fires with molten gold ? bridges and towers and roofs are etched sharply black under the flaming canopy of the heavens . For a moment Florence glows and darkens with the spell of a more than earthly transformation . Then the shadows lengthen , deepen . The dim and distant hills fade into obscurity . The Genius of the Dark throws his azure mantle over city and plain , and Florence lies wrapped in the subtle integument of night . Out in the gardens the sparrows twitter sleepily , a chill little wind ruffles the smooth cheek of the Arno , the edges of the clouds are tipped suddenly with silver , and a flood of  | argent glory bathes the scene , Again the river awakens . Lights twinkle gaily throughout the city and gem the bridges with diamond sparklets of fire . Florence that lived and died is alive again , the city of unforgettable glories , the city of art transcendent , the city that gave so much ' make life worth while today . ON THE SLOPES BEYOND Everywhere about Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cypresses up through olive groves that glisten a ray green in the sun , past white villas , here bright-eyed lizards bask on the simmering walls . One of the most attractive is the great Palmieri Villa , where Boccaccio and his ompanions are said to have fled when ' he Black Plague of 1318 swept Europe , lid , to pass the weary hours ; told those stories which took permanent shape in the Decameron . Farther out , on t h e lopes of Fiesole , Lorenzo the Magnificent built his favorite villa of Careggi , ' n whose spacious halls and gardens he athered a court of artists and poets , magicians and sculptors . On these same lovely green and white slopes , where Nature has so lavished her Moral gifts , the peasant lads are still the same simple , unaffected children of the sun and the soil that Giotto was when Cimabue found him sketching his sheep ; and the great milk-white Tuscan oxen , mild and patient , toil steadily through the powdery white dust with their primitive , umbering carts , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DREAMING IN THE SUNSHINE High among the rich vines and olives of the farthest slope Etruscan Ftsulte , or Fiesole , that gave Era Angelico to the world , dreams in the mild sunshine . It is not much of a town today , this little settlement of straw-weavers , with its houses so tightly shuttered against both heat and cold they look like robber strongholds . But Fiesole was old and important before the shining city beside the Arno was born . Bits of its cyclopean Etruscan walls still stand , and one may sit on the grass-grown steps of the Roman amphitheater on the slope below the medieval cathedral with its stalwart campanile . Velathri , or Volterra , of magnificent views , on a commanding , olive-clad eminence in the province of Pisa , was another great Etruscan city ? one of the most powerful of the Twelve Confederated Cities of Etruria . It is medieval today , with picturesque towers and houses , and a beautiful thirteenth century cathedral and babtistery of black and white marble . Put the everlasting megalithic Etruscan walls , 40 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along their 4/ miles of teapot-shaped circumference , their most important feature the Porta dell ' Arco , an archway of darkgray stone 20 feet high , with corbels on which are still dimly visible chiseled heads , possibly the stern gods this vanished people worshiped . We have learned much of the life and customs of the Etruscans from their tomb-paintings and the articles that now fill the museums we know the ladies used mirrors and curling-irons ; we have seen the children 's toys but though we have found long inscriptions , no one has as yet been able to decipher more than their letters ; the words still veil the story in them . THE " FRIVOLOUS GENTRY " oF SIENNA As in the cases of Rome and Perugia , Nature provided for Siena a position that was the commanding center of all her region : a lofty tripart ridge , dividing the network of streams that flow to both north and west ; but she withheld the one further thing needed ? water . Not only were the near-by streams mere brooks , affording no means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even enough water for the city 's supply . Patiently engineers searched the hills for any trace of the precious fluid , and with remarkable skill brought the flow of every available spring into subterranean conduits that still move us to admiration by their cleverness . Once , when they found an extra drop ? enough to furnish a thin stream for a new and lovely fountain ? the whole city carni- waled for two solid weeks in joyous abandon , and named their new treasure the Fonte Caia ! It was a typical celebration of this kindly , simple , provincial folk whom Dante patronizes a little sorrowfully as " frivolous gentry . " With the natural gaiety and mercurial temperament of impulsive youngsters , gaily they began , and as gaily forsook an object . Their very cathedral , unfinished and bizarre , is one of their most characteristic records , incomplete as the men who stopped building at it when adverse circumstances damped their juvenescent enthusiasm . It is a building of contradictions and excesses , neither Romanesque nor Gothic , but of both schools , tinctured with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black and white marbles , mostly wrong in its fundamentals , and yet , in some intangible way despite all its shortcomings , it makes as distinct an impression as a Roman triumphal arch , for it is incongruous with genius , not with stupidity ( see page 332 ) . Not all Siena 's children merited the great Florentine 's epithet certainly neither Pope Pius II nor St. llernardino could he accused of frivolity , and the mystic Ste. Catharine , greatest . perhaps , of them ill , despite her humble origin in a dyer 's family , lived a short , beautiful , tremendously effective life , and left her impress upon both her Church and her city for ages to come . SIENNA An ART CENTER Witli , its many beautiful palaces and churches , loggias and fountains , Siena ranks immediately after Rome , Florence , and Venice in the importance of its art during the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries . The whole city is instinct with character ? a maze of fascinating streets winding and twisting about behind stout stone walls that rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the Middle Ages personified , its palaces of a later date merely adding a touch of Renaissance meringue to the solid medievalism that finds its most vivid expression in the Piazza del Campo , that unique , almost semi-circular , square in a pocket at the juncture of Siena 's three hill-spurs . Here the hot-headed Sienese used to revel in bloody , joyous , free - for - all fights , first with staves and stones , later ? because of too numerous casualties ? with their bare fists . Today the citizens content themselves with a pageant and horseraces , in which for the moment the campo is gay with reminiscent glories . Siena makes rather a pathetic figure in history . While the Florentines possessed enough imagination , initiative , and determination to accomplish whatever they set their hands to do , the Sienese , lacking their mental discipline , developed to a certain medieval standard and stopped growing . Even ( luring the Renaissance , when all the rest of Italy was striking boldly out under the inspiration of Florence , Siena contented herself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty neighbor that ended with her own eclipse ; and once the Florentine supremacy was established , Siena became what she is today , merely a fine old provincial town full of glorious art and memories . It is of interest to note that the underlying cause of all the jealousy and the bloody wars between Siena and Florence was pure commercial rivalry . THE FIRST OF THE MARITIME REPUBLICS The first of the north Italian States to be mistress of the seas was Pisa , a river town , then only two miles from the sea upon which she so gloriously proved her strength in the troublous days of the eleventh , twelfth , and thirteenth centuries . Her monumental buildings , though they are within the circuit of her ancient walls , stand clear of the city proper , happy in their isolation ; and no one who is drawn to Pisa today be the fame of their dazzling splendors can fail to read in each and every one ? cathedral . campanile , baptistery , and Campo Santo ? the record of her maritime successes . The cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great naval victory over the Saracens at Palermo , Sicily , in the eleventh century , and the Pisans brought home no less than six whole shiploads of loot ? bronzes , columns , gold , and marbles and precious stones ? for its decoration . Inside and out it rises in layers of black and white  | marbles : masses of rich Corinthian columns and arcades , colored mosaics and ornaments of antique pattern , diversify its wonderful facade ? the crowning glory of the edifice ? and from the crossing springs a huge dome that adds both dignity and height to its basilican form . Within , swinging pendulously a m o n g the red granite columns that support the roof , is a beautiful and f amous old bronze lamp , whose fame is based upon the gentle oscillations that set Galileo to thinking out the pendulum . Incidentally ; this is not the lamp ; it was an older one , Not only did t h e cathedral mark the naval and maritime achievements of Pisa , but it also stood for a magnificent beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfortunately , were never fulfilled . THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ITALIAN GENIUS How strange it seems to us today that the great city-republics of Italy never seem to have thought of permanent confederation , but only of conquest ! When a temporary alliance was formed , as was often the case , it was invariably for the destruction or subjugation of some sister city , and dissolved as soon as its purpose was accomplished . This lack of Italian unity in politics explains perfectly the failure to develop a national style in architecture . Such a development requires the cooperation of ' a whole people , working together sympathetically toward a common end , as was the case in France during the development of the Gothic . This never occurred in Italy , and so whatever great architecture we find there is the work of individual genius . But however much architecture suffered from the general disunity , exactly the opposite occurred in painting and sculpture . These are always the result of special personal ability . Accordingly , the Italians , because of their strong individuality and their political systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to think for themselves , rank as the foremost painters the world has ever seen . About a century after the cathedral was begun the baptistery was founded , a 341 magnificent circular structure surrounded completely with arcades and crowned with a soaring dome of majestic proportions and height . Splendid adjunct to the cathedral as it is externally , it is the dazzling interior we can never forget , with its wonderful mosaics of colored stones and its glorious hexagonal pulpit in which Niccola I'isano foreshadowed e Renaissance . Most remarkable of all the superb group , however , is the exquisite , colonnaded , white marble campanile or belltower . It was intended to be perfectly erect , but by the time the third story had been built the foundations of the south side had subsided and the structure leaned heavily . To prevent it from falling when completed , the Pisans inclined every story above the third slightly toward the north , and the flag-pole and the heaviest bells were placed on the safe side . Yet , despite the correction in its inclination , it leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because of further subsidence of the foundation grave fears are felt for its safety ( see page 340 ) . PISA of ToDAy Alongside the cathedral , to the north , is the Campo Santo . or cemetery , every inch of whose sepulchral soil is holy ground , brought from the Holy Land . Its cloisters are now a museum decorated with the trophies of antiquity and research , the walls covered with remarkable frescoes . The city offers little of its once picturesque fame as a town without houses , but full of mighty defensive towers . Most of them have lost their heads , but some remain to hint of the desperate internecine struggles that raged betimes in the dark and airless streets . The old battlemented walls that hemmed them in still stand , lofty and scarred and patched . 1 Outside the rich plain waves with F whispering grain and vines , and is odorous with the aromatic , balsamv breath of the pine forests that reach down toward the sea , whose ungentle winds have tortured the ancient trees into uncouth gnomes . Near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields and roads are picturesquely dotted with cancels ? the only herds in Italy ? and the royal race horses . It is impossible to express in a few words the charm of northern Tuscany , with its wealth of walled towns , its medieval architecture , its luxurious and stately villas and gardens , and the fresh , clean , joyous greenery of the countryside . In such a setting as this the thorny outcrop of factory chimneys would move a Ruskin to cry " Detestable ! " The chimneys are detestable , as landscape , but the industries of which they are the symbol are the life of the region . AMERICA IN ITALY No less surprising is the fluent Americanese that everywhere greets the ear , tripping gaily from the tongues of countless americani , as those Italians who have been to either of our continents are jocularly called by those who have not . Incidentally , many of the chimneys are the property of those repatriated americani . In every town that amounts to anything at all the neat factory girls and men give the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scurry ? in sharp contrast to their leisurely neighbors ? as they obey the big whistles that cut through the melodious appeal of the bells with their imperious summons : " Come ! Plunge into my noise of loom and machine , my roar of furnace and grinding of gears , my smoky plumes that are the aura of gold . Forget your dolce far niente of the past . Look to the future . Work ? hurry ? make progress or die . Be independent ? and happy ! " TILE BIRTHPL.ACE , OF RAPHAEL To the east of Tuscany is the province of The Marches , high and rugged ground with a narrow strip of coast along the Adriatic furrowed by little river valleys . Its one large seaport , Ancona , is magnificently situated on the slopes of Monte Conero , with its citadel on a peak to the south , the cathedral on a similar height to the north . Between spreads the busy town , fringed by its harbor full of shipping . Hundreds of vessels of all the flags afloat discharge great merchandise of coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange the black and smelly asphalt and the white and odorless calcium carbide.  | The town is full of ( lark , narrow , crooked , very medieval-looking streetsjust the ideal place to stimulate the imagination and fire the talents of its greatest son , Raphael , the g r e a t e s t painter who ever set brush to canvas , of far away , on the Adriatic , is the birthplace of the composer Rossini , the town of Pesaro ; and then , farther alongshore , between two brawling streams , Rimini the beautiful and historic , terminus of the Roman Via Flaminia . Here , too , the Via AEmilia starts to the northwest . The pedestal commemorating Cpesar 's passage of the near-by Rubicon , the great and elegant triumphal arch of Augustus , and his superb , five-arched bridge over the iarecchia ? one of the noblest works of its class in the Roman world ? still remain to give us the flavor of the brilliant and constructive Roman era . RIMINI 'S ARCHITECTURAI , GEM Bttt Rimini 's grip upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , as the beautiful Church of San Francesco so eloquently testifies . It is an astonishing little gem of an unfinished Renaissance temple , built in the middle of the fifteenth century around a Gothic church two centuries older , by the tyrant Sigismondo Malatesta , a great prince , a great patron of the arts and letters ? himself no mean poet ? a great warrior , and a man of wild passions who loved fiercely and often . His church was built ostensibly as a thank offering for his safety during a dangerous campaign , but it actually celebrates his mad love for the beautiful Isotta degli Atti . The architect gave expression to his patron 's passion by various ingenious and effective devices : the ceaseless repetition of the initial monogram I S , the arms of the pair -- an elephant and a rose ? and the figure of the archangel upon the altar -- a portrait of the lovely Isotta . Six years after the strangling of his second wife , Sigismondo leisurely made Isotta his new consort . The story of Francesa da Rimini , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members perished by violence , was immortalized by Dante in his Inferno . RAVENNAA OF THE BYZANTINE ARCIIITECTURE Originally " a city in the sea , " like Venice , and well-nigh impregnable , Ravenna stands today in a marshy plain six miles away from the coastline . Once a mighty capital , the city also maintained a commanding position in art and letters ( luring the Middle Ages . According to Professor Ricci , Italian Director General of Fine Arts , " the most beautiful , the most complete , and the least impaired monuments of so-called Byzantine art are preserved " here . Mosaics might be called Ravenna 's distinguishing feature . In one of the city 's earliest and most interesting buildings , the fifth century tomb of the Empress Galla Placidia , they stand sharply out from a wonderfully blue background . They are still more beautiful in the cathedral 's baptistery of the Orthodox , and full of a clearly Roman spirit of stateliness and unaffected simplicity , while in the handsome octagonal Church of San Vitale they glow with a superbly rich and gorgeous coloring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorned with them , and with exquisitely translucent alabaster ? behind which lamps were setrare cipollino columns , and panels statues , and screens of other precious marbles . Ravenna itself has been stripped of much of its beauty and importance by the withdrawal of the sea , but none of its significance , for its grand and stately buildings link the Roman and Byzantine styles of architecture perfectly and give the art-lover of the present both inspiration and delight . A ROAD 2 , I00 YEARS IN USE , Exactly 2,103 years ago Marcus - Emilius Lepidus assured his fame forever by building the long , broad , straight road from Rimini through the cities that are now called Bologna , Modena , Reggio , Parma , and Piacenza . The road was named for him , and it still traverses the district of Emilia , a favored region of natural fertility of land and intelligence  | of inhabitants . Perhaps its prosperity may be assigned as much to the tide of life and commerce that flowed along the Roman road ? its work is largely done today by the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis , the fact remains that AEmilia is full of cities of artistic , social , and manufacturing importance , rich in painting , architecture , and sculpture , and gifted in innumerable other ways ; for . unlike some other provinces , Xmilia has never concentrated all its abilities in the greatest towns , but diffuses its energies so that all centers , of whatever degree . have an interest and importance that is almost unique . Bologna , as important a railway center today as it once was a halt on the Roman roads , is a remarkable and interesting town . The old Roman section , of which nothing remains above ground , is the heart of the city , easily recognized because its streets run at right angles and all form a big rectangle . Neither sun nor rain nor snow , nor even wind , bothers one much in bologna , for many of the streets ? most , in fact ? are are beautifully arcaded , and one may go , untouched by varying weather , under the shady overhangs of shop and palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the nave of the sky-roofed highways . The big , solid piers shadow the pave like a modern awning-stripe gown , and the pleasant afternoon and evening life of the Bolognesi , gossiping and taking their refreshments at little tables in these endless galleries , is very delightful . The arcades originated as snow-sheds to shelter the houses from the blizzards that sweep down from the northern slopes . Many of them are very beautiful Renaissance structures , with elaborately carved capitals . The queerest things in town are the two square brick leaning towers , Garisenda and Nsinelli. ? intoxicated obelisks. one complete , the other unfinished . They  | would not look so queer if they both leaned at the same angle ; but Torre Asirelli , 320 feet high , leans four feet out of plumb , while its unfinished companion , only half so high , swings out 8 . At one time there were more than 200 towers of this freakish , fortified-home class in Bologna ( see page 347 ) . In contrast with these highly imaginative products , the tall , graceful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest and most beautiful in Italy , covered with a delicate network of decoration in terra-cotta , seems all the more lovely . h . FERRARA 'S PALACES Peaceful Ferrara may justly claim to be the first modern city in Europe . It was the court and home of the great Este family during the Renaissance , and Hercules I , with a foresight and spirit remarkable in even that period of awakening and enlightenment , transformed his cramped and crowded capital by plowing it through with broad , straight streets that let the air and sunshine in , and gave the people ? they probably grumbled bitterly at the change ? room and health . The most striking feature of the city architecturally is the great , square , moated , heavily battlemented brick castle of the Este , defended by a massive tower at each corner , on top of which some genius in 1554 clapped absurd little square , twostoried cupolas like bird-cages . Not far away is the hospital where the poet Tasso was confined seven years while out of his mind ? and also out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savonarola , born here in 1452 . THE RIVER PO Three miles north of Ferrara the country is ridged with the levees or embankments that control the Po , which here marks the boundary between ' Emilia and Venetia . The river is 417 miles long , navigable for 337 miles for light-draft vessels , and practically all of northern Italy is included in its tremendous basin . The great ( likes hem it in on both sides from Cremona to the delta , more than 300 miles . A Paleolithic race who dwelt in the swampy lowlands beside the stream , in houses reared on stilts , were the first dike-builders . This construction continued , until at the present time in several places along its lower reaches the riverbed , through silting up , is actually above the level of the surrounding country . The Po is also the main artery of an interesting and complicated system of canals which connect it with some of its own tributaries , which are connected in turn with one another by other canals , all of which carry off water for irrigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of the splendor of Pisa as mistress of the seas , but her power could not last forever . Genoa , growing fast , sprang at her throat in the battle of Aleloria in 1284 , and the Pisan rule was over , so far as the seas were concerned . La Sit perba , Genoa called herself . Iler flag swept its way into port after port , until the whole Levant knew its ominous beacon . Genoa 's progress , however , was far from smooth sailing . Across the Italian peninsula an active and increasingly powerful rival was scouring the Adriatic ; and if Genoa could call herself The Superb , Venice was growing into a city-kingdom which merited the title of The Magnificent . Within a century after the maritime supremacy had been wrested from Pisa by Genoa it was unwillingly passed on to Venice . From her very beginnings Venice prospered beyond all proportion to her size ; and before the end of the fifteenth century was more than shadowed she owned city after city to the west , vast colonial empire by sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus of the whole world 's trade , with a population of nearly a quarter million. * EUGENIC SILKWORMS Not another province of Italy can show so many and such diversified and profitable features as Lombardy . It is at once an agricultural and a manufacturing region , the focal point of the peninsular railway system into other countries , the setting of one of the world 's largest and most remarkable cathedrals , a battleground of the past , with many a stirring and bloody field to remember , the most beautiful lake district in the world . It has also been a mighty force throughout Italian history . Geographically speaking , the Lombard plain , bounded partly on the south by the Po , in part on the west by its large affluent , the Ticino , is a rich and fertile agricultural country , very hot in summer , but exposed in winter to bitter cold and fierce mountain storms . Below the mountains there is very little rain in summer , but , thanks to the medieval system of irrigation , which has no superior anywhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail . They grow in three tiers in Lombardy ? pastures in the mountain regions , vines and fruit trees and chestnuts on the lower slopes , and shining acres of cereals and grapes and innumerable spreading mulberries in the plain itself . But it is not quite the same Lombardy now that it used to be , for the medieval sheep for which it was so celebrated have all turned with the centuries into ? silkworms ; eugenic worms at that ! The greatest care is taken in crossing and breeding the native worms eugenically with perfect Chinese and Japanese stock , with the result that the Italian worms are steadily improving and producing more and better silk . Beside its agriculture and silk industries ? Milan is the principal silk market of the world ? Lombardy is perhaps the most important manufacturing region in the whole country , with great factories turning out hats , rope , paper , iron and steel , cannon , linens , woolens , and whatnot ; mines from whose depths come copper and zinc and iron ores ; quarries that yield ample marbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITS CATHEDRAL The first thing to strike one in Milan is its air of cosmopolitan ? I might almost say Yankee ? shrewdness and bustle in business . The commonplace streets are lined with good shops , and the energetic people give them the appearance of the streets of a big American manufacturing city with a large foreign element . Milan was built in a fairly regular polygon , surrounded by walls , and the walls by a moat . The former have moved out into the country a bit , but the moat is still there , inclosing thoroughfares that turn and twist like cowpaths , though from the Piazza Duomo radiate some that are newer and broader . But one does not consider streets when he reaches the piazza , for there , white as salt and delicate as a gigantic filigree jewel fresh from the hands of the silversmith , the Cathedral of the Nascent Virgin , a miraculous stalagmite ; yearns upward toward heaven with every slender , arrowy spire and shaft and pinnacle ( see pages 362-363 ) . In many ways it is not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet notwithstanding every criticism , despite obvious faults , the Cathedral of Milan is a marvel . More than 4,000 statues poise and hover about it ; its lines tend upward as resistlessly as the spears of a field of wheat ; the very number of them adds to the illusion ? a great work of Nature about whose feet the human ants in the piazza have dug themselves in , reared their tiny hillocks , and gone bustling and struggling about their tiny affairs in its protecting shadow . THE BATTLEFIELDS or LOMBARDY The plain of Lombardy is as dotted with battlefields as most other plains are with ordinary cities , and whichever way one looks from Milan some famous day is almost in sight ? Solferino , Magenta , Rivoli , Lodi , Pavia , Novara ? fights that were not the mere bickerings of bloodyminded local despots , but combats that shaped or shook international affairs . Beside or upon almost every field rises a city either lovely to look upon or fascinating to read about . Many other towns there are , too , of beauty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls turned into promenades loved of lovers ; Brescia , beautifully situated at the foot of the frosty Alps ; quiet Cremona of the silk-mills and palaces ; little Tavazzano , where the whole plain is grooved by  | - tintless and endless little irrigation ditches ; Monza , where King Humbert I 's crown was snatched from him by the asassin 's bullet . Garda , Idro , Iseo , Como , Lugano , Maggiore , and Orta ! How can any pen give a true picture of these exquisite sheets of water , now sapphire , now emerald , now iridescent as opals in the sun here bound by wild , irregular shores , here by luxuriant gardens ; splashed with the color of countless sunny villas , red-roofed and tinted of wall ; guarded by old castles that molder in grim beauty upon their grimmer heights ! SUPERB VISTAS The islands aford superb vistas of shore and mountain , but the climax is the panorama from the top of bald , windy old Monte Mottarone . From its bleak crown the eye includes in one plendid sweep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piedmont , with the white , glistening , pinnacled jewel of Milan Cathedral resting lightly as a white dove in the center ? the genius of Man complementing the glorious works of Nature . It would be difficult indeed to find two other contiguous regions so entirely different geographically as the two northwestern provinces of Italy , Piedmont and Liguria : one a vast bowl , into which are gathered the slender little blue threads that unite in the greater cable of the mighty Po , thus once again emphasizing the geographical dominance of that remarkable stream ; the other almost all straight up and down ? mountain piled upon mountain , with a narrow strip of littoral which takes tribute from all the world ? the Riviera ( see map , page 36o ) . Around three sides of the Piedmontese bowl - the Alps fling a towering barrier , leaving the fertile , rolling plain open only toward the valley of the Po on the east . One feature that attracts attention inevitably is the way it is settled . The people live in villages or communes almost entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages made the peasantry huddle together for mutual protection . GENOA " LA SUPERB A " Piedmont never touches the coast , and what it has left , mostly mountains and beach , makes up the narrow province of Liguria , whose boundary leaps along the mountain tops like a frightened chamois . It is a region at once remarkably favored and hindered by Nature . Near the middle of the strip is Genoa , the only great community on this rugged coast , a wonderful crescent city climbing the hills which protect that magnificent harbor the Greek adventurers of 2,500 years ago discovered and settled . Behind the town , now close to the houses , now in wide open spaces , a mighty defensive wall runs along over hill and dale for nearly 12 miles , defended by the great fort called the Spur and by many a stout little battery and fortress . The ancient part of the town huddles , cramped and crowded , in many-storied houses on the steepest , crookedest , most Dark - Ages - looking streets imaginable , some of them mere flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menacing miniature chasms . In brilliant contrast to all this , the newer city develops broad , handsome thoroughfares and solid , well-constructed modern buildings . Genoa is the chief seaport and commercial city of Italy , with a harbor and port facilities which have been extended and expanded again and again in the effort to keep pace with the steady growth of the city 's enormous maritime commerce . One of her most public-spirited sons , the wealthy Duke of Galliera , gave no less than $4,000,000 out of his own pocket to help provide the facilities needed 40 years ago ? and that was only the beginning . Trade and port have been growing rapidly and steadily ever since . Genoa h : s always been busy , and even when she Most the maritime supremacy to Venice she did not fall asleep , as did Pisa , but kept on sending out her ships and men into every sea . One of these sturdy sailor sons we have cause to know ? Columbus . In the Piazza Acquaverde ? Greenwater Square ? Columbus 's laggard fellow-townsmen have reared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet ? but they allowed 370 years to go by before they could bring themselves to honor the intrepid mariner whose real monument is no bit of lifeless stone , but a living , breathing , creative New World . THE " GARDEN WALL OF EUROPE " Along the coast in either direction from Genoa runs the sunniest , loveliest , most popular strand in the world , the " garden wall of Europe , " the Riviera , place of a thousand delights . It is a sinuously seductive shore , whose iron ribs , pierced through and through with innumerable smoky little tunnels , curve down to the sea ; a coast of inexpressibly beautiful indentations , bays and inlets whose shores rise in sheer rock or gleam with the rich verdance of heavy foliage , relieved by the color of myriad blossoms . Quaint towns gem it like beads of parti-colored glass upon a silver thread . Sheltered behind by their granite hills from the tempestuous and icy Mistral that goes roaring out to sea far overhead , and warmed by the generous southern sun , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , half new are favorite resorts of pleasure and health seekers from every clime . And to the west , looking away toward the blue shore of beautiful France , for miles one superb vista after another unfolds of the intervening coast-line , with its ragged contours . Olive groves and old castle ruins , picturesquely situated towns and tenth century pirate watchtowers , make preparation for San Remo , upon terraced slopes whose gray-green olives shade into the differing hues of the agaves , oranges , and pomegranates at the edge of the bay ( see page 359 ) . THE GIFTED MOTHER OF MEN Beyond lies Bordighera of the exquisite flowers and the date palms , and at the French frontier , hilltop Ventimiglia , walled about loftily , as if to keep it from being blown into the sea by the first mischievous zephyr . They are all so lovely , all so rich with one or another gift , so mild , so perfumed ? with the thousands of acres of flowers of every description raised for sale and to supply the perfume distillers ? so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enow . " And all along the coastal hills are dotted with the bold and striking ruins of mighty castles and strongholds , tombstones of the great and noble families who once upon a time dwelt here in lordly state . As we stand at this western end of the Riviera and look back and down through Nature and the years at all the loveliness and wisdom and fascination of Italy , what does it all mean ; what does it convey ? To what extent is the modern the product of those great periods developed in " Italia . . . who hast the fatal gift of beauty " ? History and education answer alike : Italy has pioneered and passed on her discoveries for the benefit of all mankind . Within her borders developed the two greatest forces of civilization : that Christianity to which , more or less directly , we owe all our material and spiritual progress , and the liberation of human thought and spirit in the tremendous uplift of the Renaissance . Had Italy never produced aught but these , the world would still owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy failed to go on with the great work so nobly begun , our debt is none the less great . She gave the impulse that others were able to carry on . And after a period of quiescence , what is she doing today ? Ask of the bitter , bloodied snows of the southern Alp ; peer into those mist and cloud-shrouded heights where , as one man , united Italy is fighting with desperate valor for what she and her allies conceive to be their duty , not merely to themselves , but to all civilization for all posterity . And in peace , as in war , she is alert , full of high purpose and the conviction of service . In her civil life and domestic affairs we must recognize in her again those beauties and qualities and charms , those stern , enduring virtues , as well as those bewitching coquetries , that so preeminently characterize her as a noble mother of men , winning as her own brilliant skies , patient with the maternal patience that neither swerves nor falters , and progressive once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promulgated so many centuries ago , or even to go beyond the limits her apparently inexhaustible genius set .  |
