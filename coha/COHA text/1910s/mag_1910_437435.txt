I WAS , the other day , at a meeting here in Richmond of an Equal Suffrage League ? the first considerable association of the kind ever formed in Virginia , and now only a few months old . Virginia , if the dearest of states , is also the most conservative . Her men are chivalric , her women domestic ; since the eighteenth century no heavy wave of immigration has touched her shores . She has no large cities , she has a lovely country , wood and field and flood , she has great memories . She makes progress , too , but her eyes are apt to turn to the past . More ! ad vanced " communities will hardly understand the shock of surprise , of more or less indignant incredulity , with which Richmond received the intimation that within her walls were women who wished votes ? that is , voices ? for women ! In the three months since the birth of the infant society the town has grown decidedly interested , but it does not invade the nursery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good end . Probably the child will be hanged before it attains majority . The meeting of which I speak , and which is in my mind because it was only yesterday , and because , too , I think it typical of what is occurring in a hundred quiet places removed from the central current of ideas , this meeting was held in a small , old-time parlor rented by the League for the nursery of their Idea . Over the chimney-piece and the open fire hangs a time-yellow ed engraving of Pocohontas wedding John Rolfe . On the opposite wall is Columbus Demonstrating the Theory of the New World . There are the old gilt candelabra , with swinging prisms , that most of us have in our parlors , and there are some pieces of china from Monticello . The author of the Declaration of Independence helped himself to sugar out of that sugar-bowl . Outside the window is the street up and clown which once marched the armies of Lee and of Stonewall Jackson , up which once marched the army of Grant . There were present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for one reason or another many could not attend. ? It was late in the afternoon , and the room not brightly lit . In one place there would be a glow from the fire , in another , shadow . A few of the women were young , one or two were elderly , but the most were in the middle of life , moving with the moving hours across that high plateau of sun and shade . All sat in a circle around the room , in the firelight and the shadow . There were reports ? a hundred and odd dollars in the treasury , so many pamphlets distributed , so many new members ; then , business over , here and there , out of the red-brown shadow , a woman spoke , diffidently , keeping her seat , somewhat confused , for in the South we are not used to woman 's speaking ? not , certainly , on the present subject . For all the Indian maiden over the mantel-shelf , and the Genoese admiral on the wall , and the china that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight hour , looked like an interior by Rembrandt . It had , that small gathering in the old-fashioned parlor , a simplicity , a homeliness , a pathos , a touching and spiritual and , yes , a rugged beauty ! It was like a Rembrandt , and it was like a Millet . It was a lovingly touched , a shadowed picture of the beginning of things . There was music , too , ? Beethoven , perhaps , ? and under all there was a sense of the quiet Earth . This small Richmond meeting is mentioned only because it is typical of many . In this tenth year of the twentieth century , throughout the length and breadth of the land , assemblies such as this are frequent . What is their innermost meaning , what is the soul of them ? How is to be defined the general movement of which each is but a tiny facet ? What will a hundred years from now have to say of it ? What will a thousand years ? This morning 's paper states that to most men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Other men , and some women also , have been found to christen the Idea ? there is an Idea embodied in the movement ? to christen the Idea " trivial , ? harmful , ? absurd and ridiculous . " I wonder ? I wonder ! Will a hundred years hence , will a thousand years , echo those epithets ? And no golden thing was ever brought to the King 's storehouse but men said , " It is worthless . " But the King accepted it . It is cheerfully granted that here and there , through the length and breadth of the Idea , things occur to touch the sense of humor . It is good to laugh . Now and then is heard an exquisite absurdity , but even that absurdity usually bubbles forth from a clear well of feeling ? right feeling . And often enough it has for neighbor a masterstroke of pathos , a cry from the heart , startlingly sincere . Sometimes ? not often ? an ugly thing is seen or heard , Women are not angels . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes an echo from the future of a divinely lovely chord . Purity ? fortitude ? altruistic love . The individual , the group , the society , the nation , the race , that strikes , and holds , that chord , has found the dominant . By them will be built the vast symphony of the future . Trivial ? Only they find it so who , did they think upon such subjects at all , would find trivial , tedious , and degrading , all physical , all evolutionary processes ? Hunger , Love , Nutrition , Reproduction , the first vague flowing together of two unicellular organisms into one , the immortal chain of the germ-plasm , the warp and woof of male and female elements , the flying shuttle of organic law , the alternation and rhythm of the universe , and that tremendous upward spiral that , as slowly and as surely as the coral insects , we do spend our days in building ! Retrograde and sinister ? They who find it so are without the historic sense , and in the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream of tendency . They themselves would walk like the crab , backward ; and force the same regression upon the whole wide , onward-spinning earth . Or , say they , " We would stand still " ? and do not know that nothing ever stands still . There is progression and there is regression , but there is never immobility . They say , " We will stay where we are , in these still waters , " and do not see that it is a landlocked pool from which the billows have fled ! A piece of foolishness to be dismissed by a caricature ? There were no humorous journals at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella . They were all in the Inquisition . But had there been , then to-day some American collector might have among his treasures a colored print of a foolish Genoese sailor trying to prove to his betters that there were two roads to the Indies . Or , had such publications flourished under Catherine de Medici , there might survive , in the collector 's portfolio , some bright young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned his household furniture to feed the dying fire of his furnace . Had they always flourished he might have so end of treasures ! Turn a leaf . How easy to caricature was that young monk nailing his thesis to a church door in Wittenberg ! Turn another . A shepherd girl dreaming on the hills above DomrOmy . How bewitchingly Dutch the artist has made it ? with cabbages for lilies ! And so on through the portfolio , which must be a large one if it is to hold every caricature of a noble man , a noble woman , or a noble cause , ? from the caricature of the Crucifixion on the wall of the Pmdagogium in Rome to the latest page of the latest American Journal of Humor ! Do you not know that the higher the Idea the more certain the pillory or the stocks ? Ridicule is a weapon that any fool can pick up . Indeed it is the only weapon that can be at once rotten and effective . Yes ; very " funny " things happen , ? things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of which they are the refreshing concomitants , the Woman Movement , is not " funny . " In all the darting motion of this dynamic age it is most significant , most vital , most important . It is in the van . Were its units all but indifferent , yet go forward it must , for behind it is the life-force , the stream of tendency , the evolutionary will . Before that cosmic tide , man or woman is as stubble and as straw . On we go because we must . But the units in the van are not indifferent . Each , to the l'OL. 105-NO. 4 extent of its puny might , wills to go with the tide , and , just to that extent , is a clearer-eyed unit than its brother or its sister somewhere in the rear , who is buffeting the tide . For they in the very van , like Columbus on the poop of the Santa Maria , know that the waste of seas is not forever . 11 The Woman Movement did not begin to-day , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . It began an uncertain number of millions of years ago . It began when first a primitive , asexual organism slipped almost unawares into a sexual method of reproduction . It began when the union of two cells , hitherto undifferentiated , gave way to the union of two cells gradually , very , very gradually , Differentiated . It began when the Masculine Movement began . They began together . Which was the more important cell ? God knows ! It is true that the female cell retained more of the nutritive , constructive , developing , and staying power of the asexual parent . The biologist will tell you that under certain circumstances , on certain planes of the great stairway of animal life , the ovum can , and does , develop by its own internal powers . It can continue its growth , bringing forth itself in a d hter form , and that without male coOpera ion . Very rarely the sperm undertakes a like development , but it never comes to anything . As organic life mounts the stairway , that power goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a mother . But the mother remains the more " natural , " the more nutritive , the more constructive , the nearer to the womb of all things . The father apparently ? for the contention is not proved ? is the larger carrier of the factors that make for variability . He is the more disruptive , destructive , energetic . The male inclines to the dynamic , the female to the static aspect , and dynamics and statics are but opposite balances of the evolutionary scales . The male element ? the female element ! In the world of protoplasm , in the world behind protoplasm , how absurd to say , " This is inferior . ? This is superior . " These are equal . Not like , but equivalent . Two branches sprung from one root , unfathomably deep . Each , in that reproduction which is but discontinuous growth , hands on an inheritance woven of two . There are present , in the mysterious nuclei , in the undying germ-plasm , both lines of descent . Everyman has in him Everywoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feminine Movement and the Masculine Movement have the same weight , no more and no less . They are co-partners , co-heirs , yoked bearers of life . On that plane the woman has no need to say , " You wrong me " ; no need to ask , " Is this justice ? " no need to assert , " I am your equal . " Here all Nature is her advocate . Omne Minim ex ovo . What of the two Movements upon the plane of human history ? Woman is , to-day , crying for recognition of equality with Man . Her cry implies one of two things her actual inequality , or Man 's denial of her equality . Let us , once for all , mean equality ? equivalence ? equal value , and not similarity ? identity ? the same thing . Man and Woman are not identical ; were they so , the words " sexual dimorphism , " " gender , " " sex , " would not occur in the dictionaries . The etymology of the word " sex " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verb secare , to cut . A trace of it is apparent in " distinct , distinction . " What are then the more salient distinctions between the two branches of humanity ? Woman bears the human race . Let women , let biologists , physicians , and educators , testify as to what that means . Man , without that function to perform , uses in other ways the energy saved . Where the woman builds , brings forth , and nourishes a human creature , he builds a bridge , a fortress , a cathedral . She bears a poet : he writes the poetry ; a musician : he composes the opera ; a conqueror : he goes forth to conquer ; a daughter : she in her turn will build , bring forth , nourish , rear through childhood a human creature . If she never mates , then , obedient to the spirit of the hive , she will , like the worker-bee , help ? in how many ways , God who watches only knows ! So much for the functional difference . What of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no dissertation here . Physical man is stronger than physical woman . His limbs are better sustaining columns ; owing to the position and nature of the organs con. tained within the pelvis of the woman , erect stature is easier to him ; his foot is of stronger make , he has the advantage in lung capacity , there are more red corpuscles in his blood , he has a longer reach of arm and a wider grasp of hand , very much greater muscular force , and all the advantages on the physical and individual side to be gained by the absence of the characteristic functions of the woman . He is , in short , the stronger animal . Man is aware of it , and so is Woman . What of the brain ? In the larger frame , its mass is something greater than in the smaller . Relatively to body-weight , the brain of woman is a little larger than the brain of man . It is as rich in convolutions as is the man 's . Why should it not be ? Her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind those two stand two men and two women ; behind those four , four men and four women ; behind that eight , eight men and eight women ; behind that sixteen , sixteen men and sixteen women ; behind that thirty-two ? no use to go on with the wondrous House that Jack ( and Jill ) Built ! Is she deficient in mental power ? Then her forbears , men and women , were so . Did she inherit only from the women ? Then we are again eighteenth-century Ovists , claiming almost the entire credit for the distaff side , and that despite the fact that often a daughter has her father 's eyes ! No : we are not Ovists , though verily there are many who yet linger in the opposite school of the Animalculists ! No : the male and female cells , the mother and the father , the man and the woman , two halves of one whole , differentiated elements of one stock , come together ; and again , for a moment of time , there is unity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function , and therefore the containing walls of that function ; differentiation of bodily structure , and therefore emotional differentiation ; and therefore , to some extent , intellectual differentiation . Differentiation is unity multiplied by division , to the end that unity 's work may be better done . The sexes are two halves of one whole , and the material is homogeneous . Nor is the whole like a wedding-cake ? where the batter is the same , truly , but only one side has the golden ring and the lucky sixpence . Nature abhors violent and unrelated contrasts . Unrelation , indeed , does not exist in her province ? nor in any other . Suppose , on the whole , we agree with the very many great men who , from the dawn of Aryan civilization to the present day , have poured oblation to the mind of the mother of the Aryan race . And yet a Spirit still , and bright With something of angelic light . There are more of such men than you would think until you look ? into the matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern thinkers , that much of the man is due to his mother . Suppose we agree that women are mentally capable . And suppose we stop what the Negroes call " mimtion " ? this wonderful " miration " ? over the fact that there has been no woman Homer , no woman Dante , no woman Shakespeare , Molit6re , Michael Angelo , Rubens , Beethoven , Wagner , Galileo , Newton , Darwin , Aristotle , Bacon , Kant , and so on . Very frankly there has not . We have our own honor roll , but it is nothing like so imposing . True , every one of those men had a mother , without whose care he would not have written , painted , made music , or speculated on the universe . True , motherhood in itself is something of a poem , something of a picture , something of a musical composition , and of quite quintessential importance in the scheme of life . True , women have had at best a most scattering education ; often , none at all ; oftener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better showing we might have done better . True , ignorance , superstition , ecclesiasticism , militarism , Mrs. Grundy , and Saint Paul , have combined somewhat to blight feminine ambition . True , with freedom and education we may yet oast-Sappho Sappho . Caroline Herschel was a fair astronomer . In France there lives to-day the woman who , co-worker with her husband , proved the divisibility of the atom . A Nobel prize went this year to a woman . True , all this , and more ; and yet we agree that probably men will continue to write the best poems , paint the best pictures , make the best music , accomplish the most in science and invention , lead in philosophy . Their ability along these lines is greater , and the reason is as deep as are the foundations of life . The kinetic side of woman is subordinated in the individual , that it may reappear in the species . The reproductive sacrifice is hers , not the man 's . The energy of the male , not sluiced away as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem and drama , in architecture , in scientific thought , in philosophical speculation . The trouble is that it does not often enough overflow in those ways . Violence , unscrupulous scheming , rough-shod climbing after power , lust , intemperance , crime , economic free-bootery ? masculine energy unweighted by morals ! No . Man will remain the more dynamic , woman the more static . He will discover , invent , adorn , draw aside inch by inch the veil from the face of knowledge , build the ship , build the sea-wall , the lighthouse , the museum , and the temple . As with the birds , he has the richer song , the more brilliant plumage . She will conserve the species ; she will instruct the youth of both sexes , and to a large extent the reins of administration will fall into her hands . One generation of practical training , and as administrator she will be the equal of man ; two generations , and she will be his superior . Women make able sovereigns . The wisdom of Porkies was largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles the Fifth , Catherine the Second balance Frederick the Great , Victoria equal Franz Joseph . The list of great sovereigns is long . The list of women who have been the power behind the throne is long ; the list of able consorts and regents is long , and the list of women who have influenced the king 's ministers is long . Here is native ability , innate power ; and , like murder , it will out . There is really no reason to suppose that in a democracy a woman would not do well as a town-councilor , as a member of the board of health , or even , at a pinch , as a mayor . Maternal instinct is a curious thing . It is rather like nature in that it can care , with a whole-souled intensity , for one little honey-bee winging its way toward a clover blossom ; and also , by a simple act of expansion , for all the bees in the hive , and all the clover in the field . What of the moral distinction ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lover , friend , neighbor , fellow citizen% What is the distinction , and is the feminine still the weaker side ? What of the village women ? What of the women in the farmhouses ? What of the mass of women in the cities ? What of the comfortable mothers of the American people , the happy wives , the fortunate daughters ? What of the congregations in the churches ? What of the charitable associations ? What of the associations of nurses , the settlement-workers , the Red Cross ? What of the workers over all the land for social reform ? What of the teachers , three hundred and odd thousand in the United States ? What of the workers in libraries ? What of the writers , an army of them ? What of the two thousand journalists , the seventy-four thousand bookkeepers , the eighty-five thousand office-clerics , the eighty-six thousand stenographers ? And what of other legions of working women ? What of the girls in service ? What of the telegraph and telephone girls , the women in printing establishments , in shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in mills , in factories , and in sweat-shops ? Without strength of arm , without a voice that is counted , underpaid , underfed , exploited at every turn , tempted upon every side , disfranchised , held in ignorance ? what of the mass of working women ? There are perhaps twenty-five million women in the United States ? over five million of them wage-earning . There are more wage-earning women in this country to-day than there were men , women , and children in the day of the Declaration of Independence . What does it mean to say that , of the adult population of a country , one moiety furnishes to the prisons ninety-four and one-half per cent of the inmates , and the other moiety five and one-half percent ? What is the meaning of the enormous discrepancy shown by the drink statistics ? The prostitutes ? Yes ; but to the making of one harlot there go , as a minimum , two rakehells . The silly , the common , the frivolous , he selfish , the dishonest , the unscrupulous , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hope to reduce them . But we think that even there , were statistics available , the feminine hemisphere might be found less heavily shaded than the masculine . We think that that is , fairly , the opinion of the world . it would seem that there is an inference to be drawn from two simple facts . First : the militarist , the employer of cheap and of child labor , the bribed politician , the contemner of education , the liquor interest , the brothel interest , every interest that sets its face against reform , from reform of the milk-supply to disarmament of nations , is opposed to the political liberty of woman . Second : the biologist , the political economist , the statesman , the sociologist , the eugenist , the physician , the educator , the student , and the moralist , are to be found , in ever-increasing number , advocates of her enfranchisement . Distinctions of sex exist ? naturally . They play an enormous part in life . But the sexes are but the two arms of Life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the potter will have an ill-shaped vessel . Ile will break Human Life into shards , and turn to work with other clay . Es- sential inequality ! That is a Mumbo Jumbo mask , which , when held by a masculine hand , is used to hide the face of a very human reluctance to share power . When a woman 's hand raises the fetish thing , ? she knows not what she does . Once , long ago , I stood with an old friend before a window open to the summer night . " What a beautiful moon ! " I said . " Oh , my dear , " she answered , " if you could have seen the moon before the war ! " It is , apparently , the same moon : as large , as round , as silver , now as then . The difference lies in what it shines upon . The moon shone then upon a country yet heavily wooded ; upon a country very largely agricultural , upon a people very fairly simple . She shone upon thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a few years , and her beams will fall upon double that number ; a few more , and she will gaze upon a crowded continent , to her a seething plain like India or like China . Before the war she looked epon farmhouse and village , and throughout the length and breadth of the land upon but one city as large as is Baltimore today . To-night upon how many abandoned farms does she look , upon how many deserted villages , upon how many great cities , Babylons and Ninevehs of the Occident ! Upon how many mill towns , mining towns , railroad towns ! Where is the old-time village , the sanest and sweetest of political units ? , The houses are there , the river is there , the everlasting hills.are there , there are people there , more people than of old . And yet it is gone , the self-contained village of our memory ? there is hardly a trace upon the air of the syringa fragrance . The trains thunder through , the telegraph ticks and ticks , the city papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outspreads its poisonous wares , there are glances toward a certain street , narrow , indefinably sinister , the bent laborer goes by , the housewife comes to her door and stands , looking out . " Is not John coming home , and how is he coming home ? Where is young John ? Tempted or tempter , where is he ? And where " ? oh , much , much to the point ! ? " where is Mary ? It is dark . Why does she not come home ? " In the old days there was small harm in the moonlit village streets . It was pleasant to hear the young folks ' voices , coming home from church , from reading-society , from spelling-bee , from tableaux , from parties where nothing stronger than lemonade was handed , and where they only played at Beggarmy-Neighbor . It is different now . The streets are gas-lit , and other amusements are provided . And in that doorway the woman stands and stands -- a woman ? say rather there is one great heartache standing there ! They for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elder children ? The* have gone to the city . " Oh ! " says some one , " here is exaggeration . There is so much pleasant and wholesome life , sweet and sane , and bright with promise ! " Oh , we hasten to agree , there is ! That segment is the rainbow cast across a darkened heaven . It is , we trust in God , a sample cut from the whole great web of the future ! But how large , after all , is the sample we have in hand ? and is it not time that we wove more rapidly the web that shall match it ? How many , after all , among us are quite safe , fortunate , happy , content that the world and that the less wise , less happy , shall remain as they are ? How many among us are endangered , oppressed , exploited , ruined , lost through ignorance in the maze ; tied by greed to a million whirring wheels ; bound by a vitiated inheritance to that utter gargoyle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongdoing to all the hateful fruit of evil ; unfortunate , unhappy , and most miserably unwise ? Are they in this latter category vastly in the minority ? Are they ? Are they ? No . The moon shines to-night upon conditions , possibilities , dangers , hopes , struggles , and warfare gigantically greater than ever before . Moreover the contest grows . To the clash of bodies succeeds the clash of intellects ; to the war of the cranes and pygmies , the war of the Titans . Heretofore , arithmetical progression ; now and hereafter , geometrical progression . We have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge . Instinctive growth has become conscious growth . Conscious growth is in slow process of becoming rational growth . Above , below , around the crystal sphere of the rational , immeasurably streams the spiritual . Not even these concentric rings , these spheres within spheres , are detached and unrelated . As there are protoplasmic bridges between the living cells , so there arc passages from one of these to another . Near descendants of pithecanthrope erectus are among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage , the barbarian , the semi-civilized , the man and woman , goblin-haunted , of the Middle Ages . Nor , from earliest times , have there lacked traversers of the gossamer bridges from the sphere above to the sphere below . Retrospective thought names them " men in advance of their day . " They are the great , dramatic figures , they are the cosmic adventurers . Usually they are stoned , or burned , or crucified . Enslaved or done to death upon that lbwer sphere , when this at last rises , melts , into the next higher , they are tolerated . Another lift and coalescence and they are deified ; another , to the sphere from which they came , and they are recognized . Today happy are we that we recognized many who , long ago , came over the hair-like bridges from the higher to the lower . We recognize many , but not all . There are a number to whose estate we have not come . We are happy too , that if we have a growing pity we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savage , lustful and greedy , the barbarian with his war-cries and his idols ; the semi-civilized with his insistence upon remaining semi-civilized ; and the mediaeval mind , fine at times but narrower than the needle-eye . They trouble us ; if the tragedy of it all were not too deep for such a word as tedium , we might say that they bore us . A good , dog , ? most dogs are good , ? a sensible horse , are both pleasanter and more improving company . What of the travelers among us today from the land of to-morrow ? For just so surely as the spirit of the past is in presence , so surely is also the spirit of the future . The near past is represented , and the near future ; the far past , and the far future . The far , far past comes not ; it would terrify us if it did . And the far , far future comes not yet ; it would blind us with its glory , too utterly confound and humble us with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Slowly , slowly , as the great body of evil is reduced to carbon dioxide , ? as the brute past sinks , as Humanity , now in the darkness with the roots of things , pushes above the soil , blades like the wheat , like the hyacinth , springs like the oak , like the palm , ? matters will improve . Then , ah , then will the visitants come , the seraphs from afar ! ut What has this to do with woman ? Much , oh , much ! What has woman to do with this ? More than you think , my friend , more than you think ! For woman is half of humanity , and , broadly speaking , the altruistic half . I am a woman , and I have faith in women . I know their weaknesses . We are hearing a good deal about these just now ; we are likely to hear more . I know that they are inaccurate ? but not often so as bookkeepers . I know that they are credulous ? many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them few false prophets . And credulity is the very thing in which they are improving . They are not half so credulous as they were ; indeed , it is not too much to say that a fair proportion of them are growing critical . Inconsequent ? Well , perhaps a certain number , and along certain lines . I have never seen much inconsequence when they were in earnest . It is a word that can not possibly be applied to womanhood in the round . I know that many of them wear murdered birds in their hats , and I wish they did n't . I doubt if they do so much longer . I know that they play bridge ? some of them . But there is little gambling , I should say , and an enormous number of women scarcely know one card from another . I do n't think they gossip as much as they did ; there are more interesting things to talk about . I have heard the amazing accusation that they are lawless . ( The lawlessness of women ! Just heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for her policeman ? any policeman ? her pastor , and her lawyer ? ) I know they have , many of them , a sinuous , an indirect way of approaching and of obtaining the object or the end which they desire . It is a grave fault ? perhaps their gravest . But , in the name of God , who is responsible for it ? To-day , from half the pulpits of the land , by the press , by whom not , woman is told , " Continueas you are ! Pursue the methods you were forced to use when you were the cowering mate of a savage half as strong again as you ! Do as you did when you were Elizabeth of Hungary , and your lord demanded what you carried gathered in your apron . Say as you said then , ' Roses , ' although , in fact , it is bread for the poor ! Do as you did when you were Godiva of Coventry . Petition ; and however degrading a price your lord exacts for the lifted tax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " It is not improbable that the phrase which , in the next few years , will become most distasteful to a naturally self-respecting and straightforward woman ? and there are hundreds of thousands of such ? will be the phrase " indirect influence . " She is in train to hear it from many lips . It means , Make me comfortable , and I will see what I can do about it . Immorality ? There are prostitutes , there are immoral women . There will come some rain-washed , star-spangled night when there will be vastly fewer of these . The great mass of womankind is pure . Divorce ? After all , not many women are divorced , and of those who are , a great number may be held quite guiltless of wrong-doing . The remedy for divorce lies in education and in more careful marriage laws . Just so long as in the training of the child we blink every basic fact of life ; just so long as we split temperance , chastity , right-living , into two stand .. ards , attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eternal Law a double-faced Janus , one aspect toward the man , another toward the woman ; just so long as hordes of the Unfit hurl themselves , en masse , into marriage ; just so long as these things obtain will there be needed a wide exit from that estate . It should be a high and sacred Temple of Life , entered only by true , warm , and mutual love , by reverent regard for the human life that the man is to kindle and the woman is to bear . To the ignorant , to the rash and weak , to the most miserable , to the Unfit , it has become the Pit of the Inquisition . Discourage , with all the wisdom of which we are capable , the mating of the Unfit ; encourage far , far more than we do now encourage , the mating of the Fit ! So will we bring aid to the anxious millions of the future ? to the children of the vast , blue hall in Maeterlinck 's Blue Bird , the Unborn Children . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each attending his summons , each with some symbol of what he is to do or to become in that Life toward which he is voyaging . Time opens the door .

" " Wait , wait , Father Time , until I find the jug marked Old Bourbon ! " ? " I ca n't come any quicker , sir . I 'm lame . Mother worked overtime ? ten hours and a half , and nine looms to mind . " And out they troop , the Condemned . Verily , womanhood is not without blemish ; nor is manhood . Imperfect , frail , and tarnished , are they both .

It was for the right kind of a home for you ? and that you should have strong bodies and clear eyes and a right spirit . 0 my daughters , was I not right to develop myself , to make them give me education , to make them give me liberty ? How could I use my powers until I had trained them ? How could I even find that I had them until I tried ? Where could I try but in the place of trial ? Where could I get my training but in the arena of life ? There is none other provided . Yea , I have fought with beasts at Ephesus . I fought that you might he fair and chaste and strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sons ! it was for you , too , that I fought . They say that in the long , long past , I brought you in my arms , a sacrifice to Moloch ; that upon the Ganges I gave you to the river , a sacrifice to the crocodile . I know not ; my life has been very long ; I have done wild things . But oh , a million times more often have I been the sacrifice ! I have been the scapegoat of the world . But when I fought at last , it was for you , too , that I fought . I fought that you might be fair and chaste and strong and free and wise , and I conquered ! For I would be the mother , not of Death , but of Life ; not of slaves , but of heroes . " Will she not have recognition in the vast , blue halls ? Yea , verily , she will ! And not she alone , the Mother , ? . the vital point of this matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to Nature , however it may be with the End whom Nature serves , ? but those others will be welcomed , the women who have never married , who have only helped other people 's children , who have only served . They , too , reproduce in their own way , but their children are ideas , ? brain children . Brain children are of great consequence in the future , but they do not fill the human arms . Thus it is the unmarried women are good soldiers in the Woman 's War . They are stanch legionaries ; they make a strong color-guard . But the bearer of the colors is Nature 's masterpiece , and the colors are ? One says they are one thing , and one says they are another . To this man the banner seems blood-red , to an-other it is a washed-out white , a third sees a mere flag of revolt , a fourth , somewhat wiser , the eagles of human progress . One cries , " An uprising of the Helots ! " Another smiles , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontent . " A spirit , in act to cross from a higher sphere , might pause to mark the approaching army ; might say , " I see the ensign ? and it is a babe in arms . " The future ? the future ! What will be the religion of the future ? It will be ? the Future . Why , how mad are we with our Shintoism , with our ancestor-worship ! binding our feet because our great-grandmothers bound theirs ; pouring our minds into the medifeval mould , into the eighteenth-century mould , long after candle-moulds have been discarded in favor of electric light ! What is ancestor-worship ? It is worship of what we were , ? we ? we ? we who tread the earth to-day ! What is worship of posterity ? It is worship of what we may become ? worship of the many-whorled flower potential in the daisy of the field ; of the deep and glowing rose potential in the stem ; of the rustless wheat , of the finer form , of the nobler mind , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man a demi-god , a Prometheus Unbound ; of the child ? ah , what birthday gifts may we not bring the child in that future in which we ? we  --  we shall still tread this Earth ! Beyond that fair estate of the future , what far and fair futures yet ; what vistas , what grandeurs , what harmonies , what growth ! Religion ! What is religion ? Faith , ? the theologian will tell you , ? and Works . Neither has much to do with the past . You can believe that a thing happened in the past , but you can hardly exercise faith toward the past . Faith is the worker at the loom of the moment , the weaver of the future into " AUTRE FOIS " the present . We live by faith , backed with memory . Faith is the substance of things hoped for . Faith without Works is dead . And Works ? How is it possible to work for the past ? And Hope ? How is it possible to hope for the past ? And Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much in it that was lovable . But it is more helpful to love the future ! We are sweeping out of the realm of brute force into the realm of intellectual force ; out of the arid and dead lands of Egoism into the fair country of Altruism . One day , one great Sunday of the World , to the sound of deeper , richer , more golden .. tongued bells than ever we heard in our loveliest dream , Altruism will wake to conscious unity with the Absolute ? which is God . Between us and that day lie many battlefields ? ages of battlefields . There will be defeats and victories . The defeats lie nearer to us ; beyond them is the zone of victory . Even to-day inthe fight for the Unborn Babe the al . lied forces are large . Men are fighting , boldly and well . Women are fighting ; more and more and yet more of women . But their arms are antiquated . If they had even an old smooth-bore musket or a Revolutionary flint-lock ! but they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call a weapon . They have a thing called " indirect influence , " the indirection of which is extreme indeed . It has been claimed that they are furnished with an ancient arguebuse called " Virtual representation . " Virtual representation ? There is no such thing in the field of law , nor , I should imagine , in any other field . The elector is directly represented by the man he sends to the legislature . An army corps " virtually represented " on the battlefield , Sounds somehow like something out of Alice in Wonderland . The arm the women want is the standard one of tested efficiency . It is called the Ballot .
