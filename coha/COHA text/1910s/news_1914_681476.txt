txt Elsewhere upon this page will be found an analysis of the increase in the city 's next budget , and a reference to its causes . The actual increase is a little over 3 per cent . It may be said that is 3 per cent too much . Even so , it Is about half the average increase over the last dozen years , and about a quarter of the increase of 1907 . That is not a bad record in itself , and it appears better upon tracing the causes of the increase , such as it is . The " net city expenses " ? that is city expenditures other than debt service less the deficiency in taxes  --  actually shows a decrease of $422,468 , which comes pretty near a miracle . It is not a miracle because it Is possible to explain it . This year the city budget has the help of relief from the State tax and rents to a total of $4,437,832 , which is not fairly a credit to the city adnainistration . And the cost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 000 ? is a deduction from economies which otherwise would be larger . It is buried in " debt service , " but it will not appear again , and will be a relief to the next budget in the same hidden manner as relief from the State tax is a relief this year . Altogether the showing Is creditable . The efforts to keep down thelbudget.have been ' iliiateadeentocesqui erable degree compared with other years . Yet the budget ever grows ' . There is a superfluity of reasons why the budget is ? uncontrollable . All are undeniable . There is nothing wrong with them , except that they come from the men intrusted with a Mandate to find ways and means to control the conditions to which they surrender . There is no disposition to Underrate the difficulties which confront them . The mandate was given them upon the argument that the city 's growing needs could be provided for by economy and efficiency . There is reason to believe that there is an improvement in those respects , but if so there has been greater extravagance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's business is like a railway 's , in that it must go on in good and bad times alike . No fault is to be found with reasons like these . What is wanted is reasons of a different sort , and proposals to make the reasons which are good this year unnecessary hereafter . There are some suggestions of this character , but they do not come in the quantity or with the enthusiasm expected from those elected upon that platform . Excuses for this year are no substitute for action another year . This year Is the year to expect and to make them , because it Is the year of the Constitutional Convention , which might be looked to for what the Legislature has denied . From the Legislature the city has received the equal pay law , the prevailing rate of wages law , and other similar orders to spend money , given by those who do not pay the taxes . The city suffers also from special as well as general laws . For example , of the county salaries 78 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion in 22 per cent . That is a mockery of Home Rule . If this year 's budget is condoned it should be upon the distinct understanding that the reduction of the budget next year is to start from those who make it , not from outsiders whom it is so easy to put in the wrong on details .
