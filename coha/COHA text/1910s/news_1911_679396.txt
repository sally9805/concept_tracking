txt George J. Gould 's control of the Missouri Pacific Railway will be disputed at the annual meeting of the stockholders , ill ' St. Louis , March 14. according to infer-ences which were drawn in the financial district yesterday . Opposition from the combined Rockefeller and Kuhn , Loeb , ST . Co. interests , it is believed , will be encountered by Mr. Gould . and the requests for proxies which have already gone out from the management will shortly be followed , it was said , by a request for proxies to be used by the opposition . Dhmatches from St. Louis yesterday told of a demand made by lawyers , said to be acting for the Rockefeller-Kuhn , Loeb S. Co. interests , for a list of Missouri Pacific shareholders . Kuhn . Leeb a Co. refused to admit or deny that any such action had been taken in their behalf nor would they comment on the reports that they would co-operate with the Rockefeller interests in seeking ' proxies for use at the annual meeting . Some weeks ago it became known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Missouri Pacific , and the place was actually offered to President Truesdale of the Delar. ' are , Lackawanna S. Western . who refused it . Since then the search for a new President has gone on apparently under the direction of the Rockefeller-Kuhn , ' Loeb interests . Yesterday 's reports were taken to indicate that Mr. Gould had reconsidered his purpose to withdraw as head of the Missouri Pacific . and that this has opened up a contest for control of the road . Kuhn . Loeb &; Co's. interest In the Missouri Pacific arises from their purchase a year and a half ago of about 8:10,000,000 worth of Missouri Pacific bonds and their acquisition in July last of a block of Missouri Pacific stock , with other stocks which they took over from members of the Pearson syndicate . The Rockefeller interests are credited with very large holdings which represent repurchases during the last few years of stock which they had previously sold . While it has been said recently that Mr. Gould could not be dislodged against his will ; it is doubted if he controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report in circulation yesterday was thaf the Gould holdings amounted to only about 2 per cent . of the Missouri Pacific 's $83,112,300 outstanding stock , or something more than 200,000 shares . It is believed that the combined holdings of the Rockefeller and Kuhn . Loeb &; Co . Interests in Missouri Pacific considerably exceed that number of shares . In a quest for proxies it is thought that the opposition which has been expressed in so many quarters to the Gould management would be effective in throwing many proxies to the Kuhn-Loeb party in addition to those which the banking interests would command through close associations with stock exchange houses and individual holders of the stock . Shortly after the sale to Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. of the bonds which they took in the Fall of 19011 , it was reported that representatives of the bankers would be elect . ed to the Missouri Pacific Directorate . This was not done , hut instead Mr. Gould added his son Ningdon Gould to tile Directors and elected him also a Vice President of the road . It was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply to the suggestions that the Board of Directors of the Missouri Pacific should he strengthened by the election of representatives of strong financial interests . George J. Gould is President . Kingdon Gould is a Vice President . and Frank J. Gould is another Vice President . Until the election later last year of Cornelius Vanderbilt. the board was almost an out-and-out Gould Directorate . for , besides the three already named . and officers of the road directly responsible to Mr. Gould . the board includes Edwin Gould and Howard Gould . In considering what the Gould holdings in Missouri Pacific may be , it is now being pointed out that the Goulds held only a little more than 20 per cent . of the stock of the Western Union Telegraph Cctnpan3r , although that company , up to the time of its sale to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , was looked upon as completely a Gould possession . The Gould request for proxies went out a week ago to-day . The proxies run in the names of George T. Gould , A. H. Calef , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.'Clarke , who is one of the Vice Presidents . It is thought that these requests for . proxies stirred the banking interests to assert themselves at the forthcoming meeting , with a view of bringing the management more in line with the policies of the more progressive roads of the country . Control of the Missouri Pacific carries practical control of the Denver &; Rio Grande , and with the Rio Grande is lodged control of the Western Pacific , so that the Missouri Pacific is open from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Coast . The Missouri Pacific holds 814.800,000 of the Rio Grande 's $38.000,000 common stock and $1,800,000 of its $45,770,800 preferred stock .
