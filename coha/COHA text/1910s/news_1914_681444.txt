txt In two long reports made public today Field Marshal Sir John French . Commander in Chief or the British forces on the Continent , recounts with considerable detail the fighting . n which the British expeditionary force was engaged during the month ended Sept. 28 . This fighting included the retirement from Mons southward to the Seine , and the advance after a most vigorous of ' fensive on ' he part of the Allies back to the River Aisne and the first stage of the desperate encounters along the line of that river , which included the crossing of the stream in the face of the determined opposition by the Germans . The first report discloses that it was Sept. 6 that the Allies took the offensive which checked the German Gen. von Kluck 's advance to the southeast of Paris and that it required four days to compel the Germans to turn their backs on the French capital . Two days later the Germans , according to the report . were back across the Aisne , having lost heavily in men , guns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aisne , which lasted for a month , and the first phases of which are dealt with . In the ' - econd report , which is dated Oct. 8 . Gen. French refers to the attacks and counter attacks , which were still going on when the report was concluded Sept. 28 . In one of the reports Gen. French makes special mention of a long list of officers and men who have distinguished themselves in the fighting . Under Fire Twenty-fire Days . The earlier report , dated Sept. 17 , calls special attention to the fact that " from Sunday , Aug. 23. up to the present date . from Mobs back almost to the Seine and from the Seine to the Aisne , the army under my command has been ceaselessly engaged , without one single day 's halt or rest of any kind . " Further along Field ' Marshal French says : " In spite of very determined resistance on the part of the enemy , who is holding in strength and with great tenacity a position peculiarly favorable to defense , the battle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced the enemy back from his first Position . I secured passage of the river , and inflicted great loss upon him , including the capture of over 2,000 prisoners and several guns . " The dispatch gives details of the retreat on Aug. 28 and 29 . Gene . Gough and Chetwode , with the Third and Fifth Cavalry Brigades covered the retreat , repulsing the Germans with great loss . " The pursuit by the enemy , " continues the report , " was very vigorous . Some five or six German corns were on the Somme facing the Fifth Army ; on the Oise at least two corps were advancing toward - my front and were crossing the Somme east and west of Hain ; three or four more German corps were opposing the Sixth French army on my left . Set Trap for Germans . " This was the situation when at 1 o'clock I received a visit from Gen. Joffre at my headquarters . I strongly represented my position to the French Commander in Chief , who was most kind , cordial , and sympathetic , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed the Fifth French Army , on the Oise , to move forward and attack the Germans on the Somme , with a view to checking the pursuit " I finally arrangea with Gen. Toffre to effect a further short retirement toward the line between Compiegne and Soissons. promising him , however , to do my utmost to keep always within a day 's march of him . " The Germans were threatening the British line of communication , and , continues the report : " While closely adhering to his strategic conception to draw the enemy on all points until a favorable situation was created from which to assume the offensive , Gen. Joffre found it necessary from day to day to modify the methods by which he sought to attain this object , owing to the development of the enemy 's plans and a change in the general situation . " On Sept 3 Gen. Joffre decided to take the offensive , as he considered conditions very favorable to success . Field Marshal French believes that about noon on the 6th the enemy realized that a powerful threat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and east , and began the great retreat which opened the battle . This battle . so far as the Sixth French Army . the British Army , and the Fifth and Ninth French Armies were concerned , was concluded on the evening of Sept. 10 , when the Germans had been driven to the Soissons-Rheims line . with the loss of thousands of prisoners . many guns , and enormous masses of transport . Germans Change . Plans . The change in the German plans from a direct advance on Paris appears to have been made on Sept. 3 . Describing the various stages of the advance against the Germans , Field Marshal French praises the cavalry , especially Gen. de Lisle 's brigade , with the Ninth Lancers and Eighteenth Hussars . On the 8th both the First and Second Army Corps made large captures and took some guns . On the 9th , after forcing the passage of the Marne . they inflicted a heavy loss in killed and wounded on the Germans , while the Second Division took some hundreds of prisoners and a battery of eight- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine duns . 2,000 prisoners and quantities of transport fell into British hands and the enemy left many dead on the field . In conclusion the report says : " Although I deeply regret to have to report heavy losses in killed and wounded throughout these operations , I do not think they have been excessive in view of the magnitude of the great fight and the demoralization and loss in killed and wont-idea. which are known to have been caused the enemy by the vigor and severity of our pursuit . " ? Advance to the Aisne . Fild Marshal French 's second report , dated Oct. 8 , concerns the operation of the British forces since the evening of Sept. 10 . " Early in the morning of the 11th , " says the report , " three corps crossed the Ourcq , fur-ther pursuit of the enemy being practically unopposed , the cavalry reaching the line of the Aisne , two brigades south of Soissons , and three brigades at COuVrei. a : id Cerseuil on the afternoon of Se : . " From the opposit. , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of Soissons , and two of our army corps south of Missy , and certain other indications along the line , I formed the opinion that the enemy had for the moment , at any rate , arrested his retreat , and was preparing to contest the passage of the Aisne with some vigor south of Soissons. where the Germans were holding Mont de Paris against attack . With the assistance of artillery the Third Corps of the French drove them back across the river at Soissons. where they destroyed the bridges . Heavy artillery fire showed that the Sixth French Army was meeting with heavy opposition all along the line . " On this day the cavalry under Gen. Allenby reached the neighborhood of Braine , and did good work in clearing the town and the high ground beyond it of strong , hostile detachments . The Queen 's Bays are particularly mentioned by the General as having greatly contributed in the success of this operation . They were well supported by the Third Division , which , on this night , bivouacked at Brenelle , south of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unable to make headway . The First Army Corps reached the neighborhood of Vauxcere without much Onposition . In this manner the battle of the Aisne commenced . " The Aisne Valley runs generallyeast and west . and consists of a flatbottomed depression varying from half to two miles wide , down which the river follows a winding course . To ? lie west is hil- , ? *1 ground . Both sides of th. ? river are approximately 400 feet above the valley , broken into spurs . The most prominent slopes and plateaus overlooking the Aisne , of varying steepness. are covered with patches of wood which extend on . to the high ! ground . Several small villages and towns are dotted abort . chief of which is Soissons . " The Aisne is a sluggish stream . 170 feet wide and 15 feet deep in the centre , and is unfordable . Between Soissons on the west and Villers on - the east . the part of the river attacked and secured by the British forces , are eleven road bridges . One narrow-gauge and a double-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enemy was very strong , either for delaying action or for a defensive battle . One of the chief military characteristics is that , except for small stretches on the top of the plateau , either side can not he seen , owing to the woods on the edges of the slopes . The tract of country above described is well adapted for concealment . The enemy so skillfully turned this to account that it made it impossible to judge of the real nature of his opposition to his passage of the river , but I have every reason to conclude that strong rear guards , at least three army corps , were holding the passages early in the morning of the lath . " On that morning I ordered the British forces to advance and make good the Mane . The First Corps and cavalry advanced on the river . The First Division was directed on Chanouille , via the canal bridge alt Bourg . On the right , the cavalry and First Division met with little opposition and found passage by means of the canal aqueduct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to press on , supported by the Cavalry on the outer flank , driving the enemy before it . On the left the leading troops , of the Second Division reached the river by 9 o'clock . The Fifth Infantry brigade only was able to cross the river in single file , under considerable shell fire , by means of a broken girder of a bridge which was not entirely submerged in the river . A pontoon bridge was constructed by 5 o'clock in the afternoon . " The Fourth Guards brigade met with severe opposition at Chavonne , and were able only late in the afternoon to establish a foothold on the northern bank of the river . " By nightfall the First Division occupied the area around Moulins , Paissy. and Geny . The Second Division bivouacked on the southern bank of the river , leaving only the Fifth Brigade on the north bank to establish a bridge head . The Second Corps found all the bridges destroyed except that at Conde , which was in possession of the enemy and remained so until the end of the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division eventually crossed , there is some open ground which was swept by artillery fire from the opposite bank . The Thirteenth Brigade therefore was unable to advance , but the Fourteenth , directed to a less exposed point , was rafted over and at night established itself on the left of St. Marguerite , where later it was joined by the Fifteenth Brigade , supported by the Fourth Division on their left . " It succeeded in repelling heavy counter attacks on the Third Corps . Move Artillery by Hand . " On the morning of the 13th the Third Corps found the enemy established in strength on Vregny plateau . The 12th Infantry crossed at Venizel , but the bridge was so damaged that the artillery could ? nly be man-handled across it . Meanwhile the construction of a bridge began close to the road bridge at Venizel . " At 2 P .. M. an infantry attack in the direction of Chivres and Vregny had made good progress , but at 5:30 P. M. the enemy 's artillery and machine gun fire from the direction of Vregny became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The positions reached were held until dark . The Third Corps made an attempt to throw a heavy pontoon bridge across the river late in the afternoon , but gave up because of the heavy howitzer fire of the enemy . " In the evening the enemy retired to all points and intrenched himself on high ground about two nines north of the river , along which road runs the Chemin des Dames . Detachments of infantry , however , strongly intrenched in commanding positions down the slopes and on various spurs , were left in front of all three army corps with powerful artillery in support of them . During the night of the 13th and on the 14th and following days field companies incessantly worked night and day throwing eight pontoon and one foot bridge across the river under a generally heavy artillery fire , which was incessantly kept up on most of the crossings after their completion . The other wagon and railway bridges were temporarily repaired to take foot passengers ; one would take a weight up to six tons . The operations of the field companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the royal engineers . " Weather added to the difficulties . On the evening of the 14tn It was still impossible to decide whether the enemy was only making a temporary halt or intended to stand and defend his position . With a view of clearing the situation I ordered a general advance . The action of the First Corps on this day , under the direction and command of Sir Douglas Haig , was of so skillful , bold , and decisive a character that he gained positions which alone would have enabled me to maintain my position for more than three weeks of very severe fighting on the north bank of the river . By noon of this day the Position , roughly , was that two brigades extended along a. line running east and west ; on the north a line to Troyon , on the south to Chemin des Dames . " About 1 P. M. the enemy obtained a footing between the First and Second Corps and threatened to cut the communications of the latter . Gen. Haig was hard pressed and had no reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal , part of which he skillfully used to prolong and secure the left flank of the Guards Brigade . Some heavy fighting ensued , which resulted in the enemy being driven back wan heavy losses . ' " About 4 o'clock a weakening of-the : counter-attacks by the enemy and other indications .. tendedsato show that his . . resistance was decreasing , and a general advance ' was ordered by the arn1Y corps commander . Although meeting with considerable opposition and craning under very heavy artillery and rifle fire , the position of the eprps at the end of the day 's operations extended from the Chemin des Dames on the right through Chivy to Le Cour de Soupir , with the First Cavalry Brigade extending to the Chavonne-Soissons road . On the right the corps was in close touch with the French Moroccan troops of the Eighteenth Corps. which were intrenched in echelon to its right rear . During the night they intrenched this position . Praises Sir Douglas Haig . " Throughout the battle of the Aisne this advanced and commanding position was maintained , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sir Douglas Haig and the army corps under his command . Day after day , night after night , the enemy 's infantry has been hurled against him in a violent counter attack , which has never on any one occasion succeeded , while the trenches all over his position have been under continuous and heavy artillery fire . " The operations of the First Corps on this day resulted in the capture of several hundred prisoners and some field pieces and machine guns . The casual : ties were very severe , one brigade alone losing three of its four Colonels . " The Third Division commenced a further advance and had nearly reached the plateau of Aizy when they were driven back by a powerful counter-attack supported by heavy artillery . The division , however , fell back in the best order and finally intrenched itself about a mile north of Vailly Bridge , effectively covering its passage . " The Fourth and Fifth Divisions were unable to do more than . maintain their ground . ' On the morning of the 15th , after a close examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined stand . This was confirmed by reports reaching me from the French armies operating on my right and left . which clearly indicated that the enemy was occupying a strongly intrenched line along the whole Valley of the Aisne . A few days previously the fortresses of afaubeuge had fallen and a quantity of siege artillery had been brought from there to - strengthen the enemy 's front . " During the day shells , judged by experts to be from eight-inch guns , fell on our position . These had a range of 10,000 yards , and during the course of the battle our troops have suffered heavily from this fire , although latterly its effects have been largely mitigated by more efficient and thorough intrenching , the necessity for which I have impressed strongly upon the army corps commanders . " As the enemy was able to bring a flank fire on it , the Fifth Division was , unable to maintain its position , and had to retire back to the river oast of Missy , where , with great skill and tenacity . Major Gen. Sir Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trenches were on lower ground than those of the enemy on a plateau only 400 yards away . " Gen. Hamilton , with tine Third Division . attacked vigorously , and regained the ground lost on the 14th . " I was compelled to change my plans when I learned that the further advance of the First Corps would have dangerously exposed my right flank , and , furthe ? , I learned from the French Commander in Chief that he was strongly reinforcing the Sixth French Army on my left , with the intention of bringing up the allied left to attack the enemy 's flank , and thus compel his retirement . " On the 17th , 18th , and 19th the whole of our line was heavily bombarded . The First Corps was heavily and constantly engaged . On the afternoon of the 17th the right flank of the First Division was seriously threatened . The enemy 's attack was ultimately driven back with heavy loss . " On the 18th information reached me that Gen. Joffre had found it necessary to make a new plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evident to me that the battle in which we had been engaged since the 12th must last some days longer , until the flank movement could be felt and the way opened to drive the enemy from his positions . " Thus it became essential to establish some system of relief in the trenches , and I have used the infantry of the Sixth Division with good results for this purpose . On the evening of the 19th the enemy again began to show activity . After dark the enemy continued his attack on the Second Division , only to be again forced back . Our losses in these two days were considerable . hut the enemy's. as obtained , vastly exceeded them . Gets Heavier Artillery . " On the night of the 21st another violent counter-attack was repulsed by the third division , the enemy losing heavily . On the 23c1 four 6-inch howitzer batteries which I had asked to be sent from home arrived . Two batteries were handed over to the Second Corps. two to the First Corps . They were brought into action on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this campaign seem to point to the employment of more heavy guns of larger calibre in great battles which last several days , during which time powerful intrenching work on both sides can be carried out . These batteries were used with considerable effect on the 24th and following days . " On the 23d the action of Gen. De Castelnau 's army on the allied left developed considerably , and apparently withdrew considerable forces of the enemy from the centre and the east . I am not aware whether it was due to this cause or not , but until the 26th it appeared as though the enemy 's opposition in our front was weakening . On that day , however , a very marked renewal of activity commenced . A constant and vigorous artillery bombardment was maintained all day , and the Germans in front of the first division were observed to be sapping up to our lines and trying to establish new trenches . Renewed counter-attacks were delivered and beaten off during the course of the day . and in the afternoon a welltimed attack by the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night of the intrenching and 28th the enemy again made the most determined attempts to capture the trenches of the first division , but without the slightest success . Similar attacks were reported during these three days all along the lines of the allied front , and it is certain that the enemy then made one last great effort to establish ascendancy . He , however , was unsuccessful everywhere , and is reported to have suffered heavy losses . " The same futile attempts were Made all along our front up to the evening of the 28th , when they died away and have not since been renewed . " On former occasions I have brought to your Lordship 's notice the valuable services performed during this care ' pai-n by the Royal Artillery . Throughout the battle of the Aisne they have displayed the same skill , endurance . and tenacity , and I deeply appreciate the work they have done . " Sir David ' Henderson and the Royal Flying Corps under his command have again proved their incalculable value . Great strid , s have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tactical sphere by establishing effective eommenleation between the aircraft and the units in action . Under Constant Fire . " St is difficult to describe adequately and accurately the  --  great strain to which the officers and men were subjected almost every hour of the day and night throughout this battle . I have described above the severe character of the artillery fire which was directed from morning till night , not only upon the trenches. but over the whole surface of the ground occupied by our forces . It was not ' until a few days before the position was evacuated that tie heavy guns were removed and the fire slackened . Attack arid counter-attack occurred at all hours of the night and day throughout the whole position , demanding extreme vigilance and permitting only a minimum of rest . The fact that between Sept. 12 and the date of this dispatch ( Oct. ft ) the total number of killed , wounded , and missing reached the figures amounting to 561 officers and 12.980 men proves the severity of the struggle . " The tax on the endurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cold which prevailed for . some ten or twelve days of this trying , time . The battle of the Aisne has once more demonstrated the splendid spirit . gal1 lantry , and devotion which animatev the officers and men of His Majesty 's forces . "
