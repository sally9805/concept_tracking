txt Following the line of attack started recently by Clement G. Driscoll , City Commissioner of Weights and Measures , Collector Loeb has issued an order to Appraiser Wanmaker to the effect that after Aug. 15 all dry goods falsely marked as to measurement will not be admitted at the port of New Ycrk . The order includes everything from lace curtains to shoe strings , and it has spread the greatest dismay and confusion among the importers big and little in this city . Although such admission has always been illegal , and although It is expressly , forbidden in Section T of the present tariff law , the custom authorities haws ninked at the violation for years , believing that the Government was not defrauded thereby . If a. curtain were marked 86 by 40 , and the actual size were 32 by 34 , it was on the actual size that the duty would be computed , so that the Federal revenue did.not suffer . Many goods have entered this port on such false markings , although some have always been marked correctly . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importers were fully aware of what they were doing . In many cases their invoices have the sizes for the same piece of goods ranged in three columns , headed actual size , marked size , and Custom House size . Upon the arrival of a shoe string marked thirty inches the importer would point out that its actual . size was only twenty-eight inches , which correction being obligingly verified for the customs schedules the importer would pay the lesser duty . That he could be sure of the needed alteration without any examination of the goods is proof enough for Mr. Driscoll that the goods were ordered with the false marking . Collector Laeb gives the importers until Aug. 15 to adjust themselves to the new order of things , far shorter shrift than the four or five months allowed the retail dealers here after Mr. Driscoll fired bis first gun . At first all falsely measured goods were held for correction , and immediately more than a million dollars worth piled up . One importer had a consignment of nearly $500,000 thus caught . After Aug. 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Driscoll started his campaign some of the more restive dealers pointed out that the custom of incorrectly marking goods was permitted by the United States Government , and pointed to the Custom House by way of proof . That started all their present troubles . In explanation of so extensive a fraud importers say that the custom began years ago , and that they can no more alter the accepted markings now than they could alter a trade mark . Wherever a certain style of dry goods has found a market , the purchasers will distrust the offer of anything bearing an apparent reduction in size . If this is their defense , Mr. Driscoll does not think much of it . At all events the new order from Cole lector Loeb will change everything . Now it is understood that the importers here have the cables to Ireland , Germany , and France burdened with rush messages containing orders that the houses abroad shall immediately adopt the novel practice of marking a seventy-two-inch plebe of goods seventy-two inches . With this much accomplished , Commissioner Driscoll said last night that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that he is not yet sure lies within his authority . If a merchant may not offer for sale an article incorrectly marked as to quantity , why should he be allowed to do so with an article incorrectly marked as to quality ? If he may not call a piece of goods " a yard wide ' unless it is a yard wide , may he describe it as " pure wool " when it is part cotton ? Whether an attack on fraud of this character lies within the powers of the Commissioner of Weights and Measures , Mr. Driscoll is not sure , and he has put It up to Corporation Counsel Watson ; from whom he has yet to hear . Anyway , he is itching to start in on it . Some people are wondering whether such a reform , were Mr. Driscoll allowed to undertake it , would reach as far and disturb the habits of so many people as has his attack on fraudulent weights and measures , which beg , an with the pushcart peddler and the local dealer , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe .
