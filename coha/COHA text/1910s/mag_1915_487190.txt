Three very modest and simple recommendations are made by Attorney-General Gregory for the strengthening of the national Government in its dealings with offences committed in behalf of belligerents in a war in which our own . country Is neutral . The first is that authority be given the Government to seize arms and ammunition about to be shipped from the country under circumstances which make the shipment a violation of our neutrality : aws . The third deals with persons escaping or attempting to escape from an interned warship of a belligerent nation ; Mr. Gregory recommends that this be made a crime against the United States , or at least that authority be given to the Government to arrest persons so offending . The second recommendation comes much closer home to what has been agitating the public mind ; this is that it be specifically made a crime against the United States to place bombs or other explosives on vessels sailing from the United States . Such a provision of law is so obviously desirable that there can be no doubt of its prompt and unhesitating enactment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excite curiosity or discussion . is whether this measure is the only one that is practicable  --  or necessary  --  for dealing with the situation . If that is as serious as is indicated by the language of the President 's message concerning plots against American industry as well as in violation of our neutrality , the question obtrudes itself whether it can be effectively dealt with under existing laws . The absence of any recommendation by the Attorney-General on this head , except that relating to bombs placed on ships , suggests the inference that the difficulty is not as serious as it has sometimes appeared to be . " Recently , " says Secretary Daniels in his annual report , " in naval circles the pendulum may be said to have swung away from an over-large undersea programme , with emphasis again . placed on the Dreadnought . " We are thus in a position to grasp the workings of that awesome mystery , the expert mind . When a German . submarine sinks three British cruisers at a stroke , the man in the street quickly believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cautious and well-informed expert recognizes that the undersea boat is destined to work a revolution in the history of maritime warfare . When German submarines keep picking off a brace of British merchantmen per day , the humble newspaper reader gives it as his opinion that the submarine-is decidedly " it , " whereas the expert recognizes that Britain 's supremacy of the seas is seriously threatened . After half a year the man who reads his newspaper every morning discovers that the German submarines are not doing very much , for the simple reason that the British navy has found a way of dealing with them most effectively . So the man in the street concludes that , after all , there is something to be said for the big ship . Does the expert put it so crudely ? No . In. naval circles the pendulum swings from an over-large undersea programme to a big-ship programme . Thus the difference between the ordinary man and the expert in deducing lessons from the war while the war is still under way consists in the fact that the ordinary man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The seizure by a French cruiser of Germans working on an American merchant ship appears to have been a clear violation of established principles of international law . Had these men been bound for a German port , the seizure might have been justified on the ground that the men , being capable of military service , were presumptively destined for the German army . But such right to seize and remove them does not hold if , as in the actual case , - the ship on which the men were found was bound from one neutral port to another . Our Government has taken up the case , and we have no doubt will insist upon the maintenance of American rights in this matter . In the famous case of Mason and Slidell , the United States did , in regard to those Confederate Commissioners , very much what France has done in the matter of these Germans ; but we were sharply challenged by Great Britain , disavowed the act , and freed the Commissioners . In more than one way the German Socialists are logically the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are the Opposition in the Reichstag . They represent more than any other party the masses upon whom the burden of the war has fallen most heavily . But , above all , the international character of the Socialist movement compels it to be the pioneer in any attempt towards the appeasement of national hatreds and suspicions . To be sure , the internationalism of the Socialists is today badly damaged , but in all countries efforts are under way towards its reconstruction tion . It would be fatal for the future of international Socialism if to non-Socialists were left the initiative in a movement towards peace and reconciliation . From this point of , view , the debate in the Reichstag on Thursday of last week may prove to be not altogether without result . The German Government has gone officially on record against making peace overtures to the enemy . But the Socialists have equally declared in favue of peace on the basis of no annexations . What we await with interest is the sign of any response by Socialists in Allied countries . There is little chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in France meeting the German Socialists half way , but even if a small but appreciable number of Socialists in. either country come forward , the beginning will have been made towards bridging the chasm . One statement in the German Chancellor 's speech last week has received official denial by the British Government . Bethmann-Hollweg referred to the Baralong case , and asserted that German sailors from a submarine had been brutally fired upon and killed when in the water by that British war yes- , sel . This is the charge which made a sensation . in the Reichstag , as uttered by the Chancellor , but which the English official communication of last Saturday declares to be " unwarranted . " The full evidence in the affair has not yet been made public , being the subject of diplomatic correspondence between London and Washington . All that we have had has been affidavits by some muleteers who were aboard the Nicosia , n , which ship the submarine had attacked before the Baralong came up . The captain of the Nicosian denied that helpless German sailors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is that the affidavits themselves , upon which alone , it would appear , the German Government depends , were on their face incredible . Here , for example , is a statement sworn to by one muleteer : We were picked up by the steamer the Baralong . . . . There was a general rejoicing , shaking of hands , and congratulating us upon our escape , when the captain of the steamer , William McBride by name , gave the command : " Come on . boys , let us shoot these poor wounded devils in the water . " This is so plainly and flatly impossible that anything else made oath to by the author of that affidavit could not be believed without corroboration . Yet the Germans appear to have swallowed it whole . Four million is undoubtedly an exaggerated estimate of the number of Englishmen who have come forward to enlist under Lord Derby 's scheme . But there is little doubt that the response has been enormous , and that the prospects of conscription in England are remote . About a week ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spoke of the rising tide of recruiting in a way to indicate that the conscription game was up . To understand , however , the rush for enlistment it is necessary to recall that enlistment under Lord Derby 's plan is not volunteering for immediate service . On the basis of the recent register of all males of military age , there have been organized forty-six groups . Groups 1 to 23 are the unmarried men from 18 years to 41 . Groups 24 to 46 are the married men , classified in the same way . When a man enlists he is assigned to his proper group according to age and marital condition . Thus an unmarried man of twenty-five goes into group 8 , a married man of eighteen into group 24 , the principle being that the unmarried men of 40 will be called up before the married men of 18 . The groups will be summoned in numerical order as the need arises , but opportunities will be supplied for the members of all groups to indulge in preliminary training if they are so inclined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive a chance to show cause why he should be transferred to a later group . More important will be the work of the councils established for the purpose of excluding those men who are needed for war-work at home . Apparently , the great mass of Englishmen have accepted the new system . In commenting on the first year 's returns from the Federal income tax , Representative Underwood pointed out , in July , 1914 , that the tax as a whole had been operative for only ten months of the calendar year 1913 , and that the supertax on large incomes had become operative only after the passage of the bill in October . As the period in which it applied in regard to this class of incomes , besides being so short , did not cover either of the great dividend dates ? January 1 and July 1 ? he regarded the tax collected during the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1914 , as equivalent to little more than half a year 's tax . The total was about $28,250,000 , or far less than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The figures for the year ending June 30 , 1915 , as made public on Saturday by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue , show that Representative Underwood 's forecast of the future was too hopeful . The increase does not double the first year 's collections , butadds only half again as much to them . There is an added revenue from this source of $13,000,000 , or nearly that , making the whole return $41,046,162 ? a sum still short of the initial forecast of $45,000,000 . Moreover , it is thought that several millions of income taxes held back under the provision of ten days ' grace after June 30 , 1914 , appeared as receipts for the fiscal year just closed , though really belonging to that preceding . But it is to be pointed out that there was a marked decrease in. the returns from large corporations , which had apparently suffered much during the earlier part of the fiscal year . Postmaster-General Burleson , in his annual report , renews the recommendations made in his last two annual reports that early action be taken by Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission of intelligence . He wants the telephone and telegraph systems of the country incorporated as soon as possible into the postal establishment . There is no sign , however , that this desire , expressed not only in successive years by the present Postmaster-General , but likewise by his predecessor in Taft 's Administration , is being backed up in any other important quarter . President Taft made it very plain that he was not responsible for the recommendation , and President Wilson has been , so far as we can remember , entirely silent on the subject . Accordingly , as the Postmaster-General reports not to Congress , but to the President , the suggestion is not before Congress at all , except as it might be if any private citizen who had the ear of the nation had made it . As for public interest in the project , it is so slight as to be negligible , in relation to a project of such enormous magnitude as that of the acquisition and operation of the telegraph and telephone systems of the United States . The predominance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise much in the way of a Republican issue . Of the 53 standing committees in the House , 31 have Southern chairmen and 22 have Northern chairmen . But , as the Atlanta Constitution remarks , the division of important chairmanships is a fair one , and , " if political strength and political loyalty be considered , the South has received no more than it is entitled to , and , perhaps , a little bit less . " One reason for this preponderance is that the South has the habit of keeping a man at Washington term after term , withthe result that its members are apt to surpass others in seniority of service and thus be at the head of the line when chairmanships are to be awarded . Of the Northern States , only Maine has been shrewd enough to follow this policy consistently . At the same time , the solidity of the South has worked against its own interests . Its vote was taken for granted , with the result that a Democratic triumph like that of Cleveland meant more for the party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest . Another factor of more or less influence was the persistence of sectional feeling , which made it much harder for a Democratic Administration of the nineties to place many members from the South in the seats of the mighty than is the case to-day . The war with Spain may have to its credit a definite lessening of this feeling , although the real or fancied dragging in of the " issue " in the recent reelection of Senator Clarke of Arkansas as President pro tem. of the Senate shows how long it takes to end it . Certainly it is high time that the North stopped speak . ing of the South as if it were in some way tinged with hyphenism . Mayor Blankenburg 's ringing words for straight Americanism have a force far be- , yond that of the words themselves . The man that does the kind of work for his own city that Rudolph Blankenburg has done for Philadelphia need give no assurance , so far as he himself is concerned , that he is as good an American as any native-born son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two sides in the great war , we do not know ; but whatever they may be , we are quite sure that they are such as not to interfere with a whole-hearted devotion to the country in which he has lived his adult life , and to which he has given an abundant return for all that it may have done for him . There are , of course , extremely few citizens of any class that can point to such a record of service and leadership ; but there can be no doubt that the number of Americans of German birth or descent who feel just as Mr. Blankenburg does is incomparably greater than that of those whose allegiance is divided or lukewarm . The trouble is that it is the latter kind who have been doing most of the talking during these troubled times . " There are hundreds of millions in it " is a statement that would have taken away the breath even of Col. Sellers . Yet it is asserted of railway plans during the last ten years that they have more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day could be saved by scientific management . One student has been surveying the freight traffic of thirty-five leading railways . He finds that during the last fiscal year the average train carried 504 tons ; during the fiscal year ending in 1914 it hauled but 482 . As in 1904 , the average number of tons per freight train was little over 305 , in the decade the carrying capacity had been increased 65 per cent . The result is an annual saving of millions of train miles , and a very great reduction in the cost of operation . The experiments in train-loading started by James J. Hill represent , of course , only one side of the general struggle of the railways for economy . In passenger traffic also , in the maintenance of the roads , and in administration the efficiency engineers have made improvements of far-reaching value . There is no doubt that hard times have spurred the railways in their efforts , but the general tendency of business and industry towards greater efficiency would have played its part under any circumstances . The announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellor of the Exchequer as to the Government 's intention to buy American securities now held in Great Britain is of great interest on both sides of the water . The securities will be paid for in 5 per cent . five-year Exchequer bonds . In addition to securities thus bought , American securities will be taken on deposit by the Government , with the privilege of selling in certain contingencies . The general object of the proceeding is , of course , that of ' providing means of establishing credits in this country , to meet the mounting balance of trade resulting from the enormous excess of exports from this country over imports into it . This will inevitably continue throughout the duration of the war . It is possible  --  though this was not at all indicated in Mr. McKenna 's remarks  --  that American securities acquired by the British Treasury , whether obtained by purchase or held on deposit , may be made to serve as collateral securities for some future Government loan to be placed in this country . But more probably they will be used simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem most expedient . If the tremendous export balance that has been shown now for many months should , continue , it will manifestly be necessary either that we buy British securities or that the British sell American ones . In. the recent placing of the Anglo-French loan- in this country , followed so soon by this move of the Chancellor of the Exchequer , we see both processes going on upon a large scale . Proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for utilizing the savings of workingmen for purposes of war contain some indication of the differences between the average British and the average Continental home at the present moment . He would issue bonds in multiples of one pound , bearing an interest which increased year by year until by 1920 it bore 5 per cent . The rate of individual wage throughout England , measured by purchasing power , has undoubtedly fallen , for food prices are estimated to have risen 42 per cent. , and housing , fuel , and clothing are also much higher . But the absolute increase in wages is considerable ; overtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the state allowance on behalf of absent earners is liberal ; and , above all , large sections of the population once thought unfit for employment , as women and boys , now receive profitable work . To measure the first of these considerations only , the employers ' returns for the textile and several other staple industries are stated to indicate a total increased payment in wages of 24.3 per cent. , for an increased number of persons as compared with a year ago . The net result is that , while the existence of sporadic distress is shown by the work of relief funds , and by measures like that for relieving poor tenants of increased war rents , the average British family of the working classes must show a slender surplus at the very time that many German and French households are facing the acutest financial problems . The original purpose of the British advance in Mesopotamia , which has encountered a severe setback south of Bagdad , was an . ambitious one . While the British were pushing up the valley of the Tigris to Bagdad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caucasus through the region of Lake Van , and strike for the Tigris along the stretch between Diarbekr and Mussoul . For many months it has been apparent that the Russians could not be counted upon to put through their part of the assigned task . The British , on the contrary , made progress . At first they encountered no serious resistance . Bussora , the port from which Sinbtd set forth on his voyages , surrendered easily , and the British campaign resolved itself into a slow but steady advance northward along the Tigris , which was the army 's sole line of communications and supply . The vagaries of the Tigris channel and the network of irrigation canals presented a peculiarly difficult problem for the large fleet of light-draught steamers and numerous native boats . This fleet has been described as " the cavalry screen , advance guard , rear guard , flank guard , railway , general headquarters , heavy artillery , line of communications , supply depot , police force , field ambulance , aerial hangar , and base of supply of the Mesopotamian expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Kutel-Amarna , about 100 miles south of Bagdad and 250 miles from the Persian Gulf . There was a battle at Kut-el-Amarna , September 27-29 , in which the Turks were driven from a prepared position . The pursuit must have been rapid , under existing conditions , if in two months the British were within striking distance of Bagdad . Events have shown that it was too rapid . Between President Yuan Shi-Kai hesitating to assume the crown , and Emperor Yuan Shi-Kai accepting the crown in. principle but postponing the act to a more opportune time , the difference is small . As head of the republic , Yuan Shi-Kai has been waiting for the temper of the country to show itself . As Emperor designate , he will continue to wait . Until within a few days ago it was only the monarchists who spoke out , and in a manner indicating a carefully organized campaign . The naval mutiny last week in the harbor of Shanghai is probably the first expression of sentiment from the anti-monarchists , and it is not likely that they have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal accession until a more favorable opportunity is not a logical step from the monarchist point of view . The great argument on that side has been that the country is suffering from the uncertain state of affairs at Peking , and that only the strong hand of an Emperor can establish order . If Yuan is to wait until order has been established , the argument for a monarchy falls to the ground . For the permanent peace of China the accession of Yuan would be an unhappy thing . It would not be the end , but the beginning , of an epoch . It is not to be supposed that the progressive elements in China will give in without resistance . Yuan himself may be strong enough to defend his Emperorship . When he goes , turmoil will begin . Better for China if the strong man Yuan were to use his strength in educating his people to a free government . As it is , he may be the Porfirio Diaz of China , with results similar to those Mexico has experien.ced .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
