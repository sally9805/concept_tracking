. In Praise of Footbinding A BARBAROUS custom , you call it . Barbarous it can not be , since it has never prevailed among barbarians and only became established in the oldest and maturest civilization in the world . What you mean is that footbinding is painful , unnatural . It is indeed painful , exquisitely painful . But one of the measures of civilization is pain . Central Africa has no tortures so intense as those endured in New York or London . Footbinding is unnatural , true ; but how much of civilization is natural ? When the medical missionaries first exhibited by X-ray photographs the inside of a bound ' foot I was shocked , I admit . All those little bones distorted , twisted , run together in spongy masses ? ugh ! You would be shocked , too , if you could see X-ray photographs of the inside of some of your own women 's minds . Soon , however , you would recover from the shock as I did . Civilization cares nothing for the inside , so the externals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lily mind : these are altogether lovely , so far as you and I can see . We shall leave it to the specialist to fret over what lies within . A barbarous custom ? Let us look to the real ways of the barbarians as they are recorded in the venerable Ghin texts , over two thousand years old . In those ancient days the wild ChO-su tribes roamed over the slopes of Altai . It is written that the ChO-su thought it sacrilege to add to the disabilities that God had imposed upon the female sex . Therefore men and women dressed alike , fared alike , joined equally in the chase , went side by side into battle , shared equally in deliberations and decisions even of greatest import . And sometimes the wife proved more skilful in the chase or more valiant in war than her husband , and often and often a woman 's voice prevailed in the tribal councils . These were true barbarians . Two thousand years ago your own ancestors were barbarians , very like the Clth-su . They too were content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little by little you have become more civilized and have added steadily to the disabilities of woman . She may no longer dress like you , exercise freely like you . You do not let her say and hear many of the things you say and hear ; many things you desire to know you seek to prevent her from knowing . From the chase , from war , from tribal councils , you exclude her altogether . You do not bind her feet ; not yet . But you are new to civilization and inexpert in science of means and ends . By your clumsy methods you have succeeded in improving a small fraction of your women in the degree appropriate to a high civilization . Bind their feet and you will succeed with all of them . You shrink from the cruelty of footbinding . It is not cruel , since it is for the good of all , women as well as men . It is painful ? for child and parents . You suppose that we in China do not love our daughters , but only our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender-hearted people , and after the first chill of disappointment our hearts grow very warm to the wee pale sprites that have come to share our lives . I have a little daughter of my own , and , while I write this at my ease , somewhere in China my little girl sits mournfully on a mat , gripping her knees with her tiny hands as if this would stop the aching . The twinges reach me here , through ten thousand miles of space . " A barrel of tears for each pair of bound feet , " says the proverb . That is an exaggeration . My little girl wept at first , bitterly , but soon she dropped into silent despair . It was an unusually difficult case because we began late . In my family we have always begun to bind at three . But my wife would plead , " A few days more for the little twinkling feet . " " It will be all the harder , " I would grumble . " This hopping about makes the feet big and sensitive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at our first attempts to put on the tight bandages she made such piteous gestures with her chubby arms , as if despairing of the world since we could be so cruel , that we put it off far too long . But the worst is over now . There has been little sleep under my roof for the last year . A barrel of tears ? Yes , but they were the mother 's . Footbinding is a harsher duty now than it was a generation ago , for then it was never questioned . But now we have a great number of irresponsible young men of good family who have been abroad , or have read foreign books . They are like your parlor revolutionaries ; their constant song is , " All this must go ; requirement of offspring , reverence for parents , sound education , footbinding , all must go , " No man of sense pays any attention to their paradoxes . Except when you have lain awake night after night listening to a sobbing child . Then the demon of doubt prompts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary ? What if footbinding must go ? " These new ideas are but a pest to afflict parents in the performance of their difficult duties . Footbinding can not go . " The natural foot " that the reformers prate about , what is it but a fad ? It will work its transitory mischief and disappear . Superficial occidental writers assert that the bound foot is to be explained by a perverted aesthetic sense in the male sex . This is to miss its deep spiritual significance . The bound foot is the condition of a life of dignity for man , of a life of contentment for woman . Let me make this clear . I am a Chinese fairly typical of my class . I pored too much over classic texts in my youth and dimmed my eyes , narrowed my chest , crooked my back . My memory is not strong , and in an old civilization there is a vast deal to learn before you can know anything . Accordingly among scholars I cut a poor figure . I am timid , and my voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my footbound wife , confined for life to her house except when I bear her in my arms to her palanquin , my stride is heroic , my voice is that of a roaring lion , my wisdom is of the sages . To her I am the world ; I am life itself . As you see me I seem little and weak , but as my wife sees me I am colosally great . Therefore life seems good to me . I need not go forth to strive on the battlefield , nor to seek even more difficult glory in the arts of peace . Life seems good to my wife also . All the petty services she undertakes for me are satisfying to her because they are illuminated by my greatness . All her unending labors in caring for my children are agreeable to her because these children have the seed of greatness in them . Every man in all the world desires to be a hero ; every woman in the world desires to be the wife of a hero . In China , thanks to footbinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I have often sought light on this question . How is it possible for Americans and Europeans to seem great men in the eyes of their big , fine , active wives ? As I find it the custom among you to discuss such subjects freely , I am wont to put the question directly : " Are you a great man in your wife 's estimation ? ' " Of course , " you reply , but your eyelids droop and I am puzzled . If I am questioning a lady I ask , " Does your husband really seem a great man to you ? " " Of course , " she replies , but she opens her eyes very wide and I am still more puzzled . To be great men to such wives as I have seen in western lands , that is what you call a big contract ! It would be different if you were all so robust and eagle-eyed as some of the Rocky Mountain men , who , like the old Chii-su , believe it a sacrilege to add to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you men of the cities look to me very much like Chinese . How are you able to play the superior part proper to the head of a civilized household ? I surmise that you realize your predicament and are taking active measures to strengthen your position against further weakening . You are beginning to see the necessity of standing for the civilized ideal of woman affected with more disabilities than God had intended . As a representative of a much riper civilization , I may assure you with authority that you are on the right track . I can not give similarly unqualified approval to the means you employ . You deny woman the ballot , handicap her in proDecember x8 , xpis THE NEW fessional life , discriminate against her in industry , belittle her intellectual achievements , or , if these are too palpably solid , you cry down the value of her personality . So far , good . But the dangerous barbaric spirit of independence among women can not be held in check merely by throwing barriers across one and another avenue of expression . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radical strategy . Bind their feet .
