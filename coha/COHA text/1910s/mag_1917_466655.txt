THERE is a belief abroad to-day that many Americans , whose number can only be conjectured , have never thrilled with patriotic emotion , have never said to themselves , proudly and gratefully , " This is my own , my native land ! " They feel no dread of forfeiting fair renown because of their lack of patriot- ism . However they may disguise the fact to themselves , they are the victims of egotism , of a peculiarly mean and depraving egotism . When you hear men say , " The country has no claims upon us , " you can be sure that they have either been misled by sophists and by the sly and secret enemies of the country , or that their hearts have become too incrusted with selfishness for any noble impulse to penetrate . There are , of course , radicals who , in this age of dissolution , hold that patriotism , like religion and like the most sacred family ties , are worn-out ideals , pretty but fatuous survivals of a superstitious stage in human development . They argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , morality is " a mere question of latitude , " and , therefore , that it may be disregarded . They had no part in shaping the laws , religious or soda ! , which have been handed down and still govern public affairs and private conduct ; why , then , should they heed them ? With these and similar j pleas they justify their egotism . In truth , however , the man or woman who reasons thus is the most pitiable of human beings . Not to feel that you are part of a community is really to be ' inhuman ; for the animals have this feeling by instinct , and in ants and bees it produces results which rival those of the highest type of men .

In general , persons who announce , often somewhat boastfully , that they have discarded patriotism ? as if by so doing they proved their superior intelligence ? do not philosophize . They pursue their own ease and comfort . Most of their days , until an emergency comes , they give little thought to the country , which remains an abstraction for them except when it calls on them to pay taxes . They grumble if the local government allows the streets , or the water-supply , or the policing , to run down ; but even then they do not take the trouble to go to the polls and vote for a better mayor . If they are in business , they probably regard the national Government as a vast purveyor of benefits , through appropriations or through the tariff , for those citizens who know how to get them . They usually take no more thought of what the country does for them than little children take of the means by which their parents supply them with food and clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel neither gratitude nor affection ; instead of being thankful for what they have , they complain that it is so little . Is the alleged decay of American patriotism of recent growth ? Since the outbreak of the atrocious war in August , mit , powerful influences have been at work loosening the spiritual fiber of Americans . Some of these influences were accidental , some sprang from lack of leadership , others from ill-judged and possibly misconstrued advice , and others from deliberately malign propaganda . The undermining , thus begun , was carried on from two different directions , both aimed at the same goal . The Prussian propagandists , almost frantically bent on preventing this country not merely from joining the Allies , but even from selling them food and munitions ? a perfectly legitimate trade ? circulated doubts , falsehoods , misrepre-sentations , all of which tended to plant in the American mind the assumption that there was no distinction between right and wrong . Such insinuations , accompanied by the suggestion that it was the Allies who made Germany seem harsh to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral sense in which patriotic emotion grows . Most efficient accomplices of Prossianism were the champions of Pacifism . The minority of the Pacifists consisted of devoted zealots who , like the rest of the world , outside of Germany , regard peace as a final blessing and object of mankind , an object so transcendent that it must be striven for even at the cost of national honor , and of private obligation to family and friends . Since the Witchcraft Delusion over two centuries ago there has been no obsession like Pacifism . This , too , like the belief in witches , renders its victims insensible to moral considerations and impervious to the affections which govern normal men . The majority of Pacifists , less sincere than these fanatics , made Pacifism a screen for their cowardice , for their indifference , and for their greed . " Peace-at-any-price " was their motto , anything to prevent war was their endeavor . Many of them were secretly conniving with the Prussian propagandists , for whom these doctrines summed up the goal of German desires over here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by and do nothing when a ruffian assaulted his wife on the street ; and the Pacifist mother would allow a kidnapper to snatch her child from her arms without resisting him . Fortunately fare does not always allow us to he as wicked as the doctrines we profess . Amid the contradiction of these various opinions the ideal of patriotism inevitably suffered . What was the average man , ro whom patriotism was as much an innate ideal as was his love for his mother , to think when he heard it either disparaged or left to be obeyed or not according to the preference of each individual ? What should he think of a patriotism made to conform with business interests ? Whatever he thought , these contradictions perplexed him , and his perplexity cooled his ardor . Let us examine whether the apparent decline in patriotism during the atrocious war be only a symptom of a longstanding disease . Ordeal by battle is the final test of character , and character is an accumulative product . Could American manliness be sapped in only thirty months ? What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the years preceding the world-wide conflict ? At the close of the Civil War in 1865 patriotism glowed in all the Northern States ; and by degrees the Southerners , who had paid the full measure of devotion to their section , renewed their loyalty to the Union , and nobody dreams that they will ever again organize an armed conspiracy against the national existence . By 188o , however , several causes had come into play which , as it turned out , were seriously to affect American patriotism . The first of these was immigration ; foreigners poured into this country in ever-increasing numbers , until the rate of inflow surpassed our powers of assimilation . After a while countries more and more remote in space were combed by the rapacious dealers in labor and by the agents of greedy steamship companies , for those multitudes more and more remote in language , customs , and ideals , which they dumped upon our land . And now the United States has assembled the largest collection of illiterates of different tongues that exists in the world . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and race differences can be studied . Instead of being transformed into Americans , these immigrants have transplanted to our social soil their own churches and customs , and they retain their own lan- William Lloyd Garrison , who was no socialist , summed up this doctrine most seductively in his famous phrase , " My country is the world ; my countrymen are mankind . " A glittering ideal and one which has replaced that of being " a citizen of the world , " which Socrates described himself . But to sympathize with the people of other countries , to wish to treat them with all the honor and justice you would show your neighbors , does not require that you give up your affection , your obligation , and your duty , as a son of your mother country . When the " citizen of the world " was in fashion the person who aimed at being such a " citizen " implied that he was a man whose cultivation and manners fitted him to appear in any society in any country . No local prejudices , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemmed him in . He had no convictions to be rasped . These " citizens " who shed their worldly wisdom on the eighteenth century were followed by the " cosmopolitans " of the nineteenth century and of to-day ? most agreeable companions , especially if they come by their cosmopolitanism naturally instead of adopting it as a pose . But the socialist and Garrison and the rest , in hoping that by blotting out the limits which inclose nations they can annul national antagonisms and establish an international Utopia , overlook what seem to be permanent conditions in the improvement of mankind . Probably the propaganda which has steadily grown louder during the past twenty years , " that democracy is a failure , " has poisoned some minds , and to that extent it has contributed to the eclipse of patriotism . The worship of efficiency ? a crassly materialist cult ? has been promoted to the disparagement of the United States , because it has usually been illustrated by a comparison between Germany , the efficient despotism , and the United States , the inefficient democracy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be efficient they must give up democracy and organize despotism . The Germans are ready , nay eager , to save them the bother of working this change . With these facts before us , we must recognize that in 1914 , before the warbegan , influences and conditions which were by no means recent had corroded the patriotic instincts of many Americans , and had predisposed them to listen indulgently to the anti-patriotic appeals of Pacifists and to the moral sedatives of neutralists . Neutrality , too , has been conjured up to persuade slackers and the indifferent that they have no patriotic duties . But it remains eternally true that those who are not with the truth are against it . In earlier stages patriotism , being a necessity , developed as a matter of course in every one . So long as the tribal stage existed , each member of a tribe must cleave to it for self-preservation . All he was , his fortune in peace or in war , depended upon the prosperity of his tribe , and his devotion to his chief was unquestioning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians and the Scottish clans , but among the tiny city-states of antiquity and similar communities elsewhere . The mere fact of being a stranger was equivalent to being an enemy ; the customs or laws of a tribe applied only to it ; accordingly , persons not of the tribe were outlaws , liable to be enslaved or killed for no other reason than that . So a man stood by his clan and obeyed his chief as a matter of course , requiring no demonstration that duty as well as self-interest admonished him to patriotism . When the smaller and often isolated state gave way to larger political combinations ? to kingdoms and empires patriotism continued to be the natural ideal of every citizen , and the ruler , who symbolized the state , received the obedience and the loyalty of all . The great empire protected its members just as the small clan had done , and in return they honored and supported and almost worshiped it . They felt a mighty pride in being members of a mighty empire . The best service that monarchs have rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being finds it so hard to burn with zeal for an abstract ideal and so easy to idolize a person ! As rulers , the last . Stuarts were incompetent and ignoble ; as men , immoral ? and yet infatuation for them and their line persisted for nearly a century after they had disappeared . When constitutional government came and parties managed national affairs , we might expect that devotion to the sovereign would weaken , because his subjects could not fail to note that the leaders in parliament and the dominant political party actually ruled the state . In fact , however , though the prestige of the monarch , for the time being , may have weakened , patriotism has not . In England , for example , love of country never slackened , but the recognition of the obligations which that love creates did grow dim . And that is the case here . Loyalty , the outward expression of patriotism , has fur its reverse , treason , the most detestable crime of which a citizen can be guilty . And justly so , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeopardy , and is , potentially , a murderer on a vast scale . His baseness has neither parallel nor palliation . The final bond between man and man is mutual trust . The traitor breaks trust not merely with one man , but with all his countrymen and women , and in order to achieve his crime he resorts to deceit . Dante , an infallible appraiser of human wickedness , assigned traitors , as being the most depraved of criminals , to the deepest pit of hell . Type of them all was Judas , who added supreme deceit to his supreme guilt , betraying his Master with a kiss . By the magnitude of the punishment we measure the preciousness of the object betrayed . In all countries traitors have been accursed . Even monarchs who plot treason against their rivals hate or despise the traitors whom they employ . Benedict Arnold 's treason proved to be insignificant , so far as concerned the outcome of the Revolutionary War , but it brought him an immortality of infamy which all his remorse could not wash out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the latest posterity . For patriotism is not the sentiment of a few of the overfastidious , but of the great mass of men and women whose instincts are healthy , whose aims are worthy , and whose judgments aresound . They revolt against treason as against filth . How could it be otherwise ? How could we fail to love our great mother ? our country ? to whom we owe all that we are ? Our country is our larger home , and home , for every creature who is not a slave or a pitiable human derelict , orphaned and outcast , is a sacred abode , unlike any other , not to be exchanged for any other . The Swiss peasant finds home in his bleak chalet , with no comforts , with many deprivations , very scantily provisioned , cut off in winter for weeks it may be from his nearest neighbors ; and yet , transplant him to the city , surround him with luxury and repose , spare him from drudging for tomorrow 's meager fare , and he will pine of homesickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home with him wherever he pitches his tent ; and he , too , would languish were he forced to exchange his nomadic freedom for any dwelling , were it a palace , fixed on immovable foundations . And so of each of us ; there is no place like home . The triteness of the maxim confirms its truth . The outer habitation does not make the home ; nor do the furniture , clothes , and food . Home is a complex of whatever has shaped our life ? in childhood , the love and discipline of father and mother , the comradeship of brothers and sisters , the intimacy of playmates , and all sounds , sights , impressions , and emotions which we were drawing in unawares from nature and the world outside of us ; as we mature , home means wife and children , and the friends at table or by the fireside , the dreams , the labor , the sorrows , joys , and aspirations which are the lot of man . Wooden walls and plaster ceilings are but the shell that holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are past . Associations almost unobserved in the making bind us forever , having become an indivisible part of ourselves . Not less noble and scarcely less instinctive should be the love we feel for our larger home , our country . The claim of patriotism will not be denied . The sophists who would steal away your belief in courage , in honor , in your duty to your country and land , the perverts who would argue away your devotion and ridicule your ideal of chivalry , are spawned by and do the bidding of Belial , who can make the worse appear the better reason . Modern assailants of the family suppose that by destroying it they can emancipate the individuals who compose it . In their delirium they conceive that the goal of life is the throwing off of all restraints . Nothing could he more mistaken . Normal restraints , those which build up a man and make him master of himself , are really the means by which he gets his true freedom . A little water in a boiler will generate enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground is a puddle , and no more . Discipline is the barrel of the gun , the rudder of the ship . The same law applies to human beings , and such an institution as the family has proved itself indispensable to the highest development of its members . The man who thinks that by casting off its ties he gets a larger freedom deceives himself . At most he exchanges a higher plane for a lower and secures whatever privileges that descent implies . He retreats toward the plane of the beast , out of which it has been man 's mission to rise and climb . He accepts the bondage of a more insistent selfishness . Does not the same happen in the case of those who deny patriotism ? Patriotism is not an institution like the family ; rather is it an emotion , a passion , the flower of man 's communal life . Not to feel it is to be dead indeed ! is to suffer a loss which for the citizen is like incapacity to love for the individual . Destiny works through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind . From the individual as the central point rounds the first circle ? the family . Girdling this the next , with a longer radius , incloses his community , village or town or city . Next , of still wider diameter , his business and professional interests and his religion ; finally , the all-embracing circle of his country . The true man does not shut himself up in any of these , but lives in them all , drawing from each of them its particular inspiration . And just as the body develops its strength by the exercise of its different members , so he rounds out his potential self by exercising his powers in each of the spheres which infold him . Cosmopolitanism has no such formative purpose . It is like a freshet which overflows fields and meadows , but lacks dynamic usefulness and cumbers the ground until it has evaporated or sunk into the soil . If its waste waters had flowed through the banks of a canal they would not have been lost . Internationalism seems to me similarly ineffectual . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noble , unselfish love , I suspect the value of his love for twenty or thirty or a hundred foreign countries . The range of a man 's sense of duty measures his level on the moral scale . Now patriotism is a duty just as love of parents or of children is . The wretch who deserts his wife and children or leaves his needy parents to starve , saying that he feels no obligation toward them , can find no one to defend him except another wretch as base as himself . How shall we qualify those who declare , often with bravado or with a tone of superiority , that patriotism does not concern them ? What sort of a heart ? if he have a heart at all ? must his be who repudiates his country , his mother ? The normal child repays affection with affection ; the normal man and woman tingle with gratitude and desire to show it to those to whom they owe much . They do not think of it as a duty ; they do not dissect their motive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuition which justifies itself . Likewise , though patriotism be a duty , every right-minded soul regards it as an ideal and rejoices that he can give everything ? his life if required ? in its service . " He alone is base , " says Emerson , " and that is the one base thing in the universe , to receive benefits and confer none . " " Dear God , " exclaimed the French peasant mother , on learning that her last son ? the fifth ? had been killed at Verdun , " I wish that I had five more to sacrifice for France ! " Do you , whoever you are , refuse to recognize your patriotic duty to this , your mother country ? You have received from her everything ? your parents , your home , your associations , your opportunity , your fortune , your ideals ; have you nothing to pay back ? Is your heart dead , unstirred by the feeblest throb of affection ? Is your conscience dead , beyond the faintest whisper of duty ? Bereft of heart and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who enabled you to dwell in this Republic ? Was it not George Washington and his associates , who created the Republic reprdless of cost or sacrifice ? If Washington were alive now and gave you an estate of priceless value , would you not thank him ? Would you not strive to keep it safe ? He has given you this Republic to guard and love ? for he still lives , both in his gift and in his imperishable influence . Who preserved the Republic for you ? Was it not Abraham Lincoln ? If he stood beside you now , would not shame stop your lips from saying , " I do not believe in patriotism which calls on me to risk my life in battle " ? Could you bear to look in his face , to see his expression of amazement that any one born an American should deny his mother ? And beside him , risen from his martyr 's grave , would rise up the four hundred thousand slain in that war , for whom ? For you . Like all other forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noble wish . but it manifests itself in service ? in service that neither doubts , nor counts the cost , nor asks recognition . in peace or in war the patriot serves his country joyfully , because it is the natural thing to do . Life is not worth living unless your country is founded on principles worth dying for . The estate which every American inherits he holds in trust . On him it depends whether his share in the Republic shall be handed on unsullied to his descendants ? and not only unsullied , but increased and strengthened as is necessary ? or whether , shorn and corrupted and shrunken through his unworthiness , it shall hear the seeds of decay for the entire fabric . Lack of imagination alone causes us not to see our obligation toward posterity . If we did see it , the sense of our responsibility to the future joined with that to the present would overwhelm us . " All men on whom the higher nature has stamped the love of truth , " says Dante , " should especially concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations may be enriched by their efforts , as they themselves were made rich by the efforts of generations past . " " The sense of obligations " Is not that the most widespread and pressing need of this age ? Selfishness , egotism , has brought us to the pass where we turn our back on every duty which tries us , on everything annoying , unpleasant , dull . " I do n't care to hear accounts of thesufferings of the wounded . They disturb my peace of mind ; they do n't concern me , anyway , " said one of these egotists who was asked to subscribe to the American Ambulance Fund . But the final and unapproached example of this egotism was given by Germany , when she declared that the most solemn treaty which a nation can enter into was only " a scrap of paper . " The patriotic obligation which every native-born American should acknowledge ought to bind even more tightly the alien who has become naturalized as an American . The native , we may say , had no part in determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigner , having found his native land unsatisfactory , and having looked over the world , chooses to plant himself in the United States , as a country which best satisfies his ideals , and offers most to his material needs and desires . As the choice is his , so is he doubly bound to be loyal to the land of his adoption . Let whoever lacks patriotism be warned that , though he knows it not , he is a slave to selfishness . He may hope to evade his duty by pleading prudence , or lack of conviction , or his disbelief in war , or any other excuse ; but he is refuted by the actions of patriots in every country and in every time ? actions which shine as stars to guide and inspire mankind forever . Peace-at-any-price is constructive treason . Cowardice can no more do the work of courage than putty that of steel . As we are all parts of a larger group , so must we set the welfare of that group , be it village or city , above our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , but the twig dies if it be cut off from the tree . On every tree there are dead branches into which the sap , which feeds the rest , has ceased to flow . Do not mistake the rustling of the dead leaves on those branches for whispers of life-bringing messengers . Least of all mistake for true prophets those seducers who urge you to set comfort above honor , cowardice above valor , visions of an imaginary Utopia above love of your actual country . Life is a commodity allotted to every creature ? to snail and snake , to tiger and hawk , and to all the myriad sorts of men . It is the stuff out of which each weaves his particular fabric ? the wicked his iniquity , the wretch his baseness , the good his benefits , the noble-minded his heroism . Therefore was it said two thousand and more years ago that " not merely to live , but to live nobly " should be the end of man . And therefore did our supreme American seer sing in a crisis like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
