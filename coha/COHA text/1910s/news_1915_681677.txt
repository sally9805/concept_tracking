txt Information reached THE TIMES yesterday that at least one of the Governments allied against Germany in the war bad appointed a confidential agent to investigate quietly rumors that had reached Europe to the effect that the Allies were being swindled in a vast majority of the purchases of war supplies made in the United States . The confidential agent whose name was given was visited at his hotel by a TIMES reporter yesterday . After insisting that his name be withheld from publication because of the secrecy of his mission , he confirmed the report . He could not begin to estimate the total amount which graft in the buying of war supplies had aggregated during the seven months ' of the war , he said , but declared that it ran well into millions . " I have been conducting this investigation for more than three months , " said the agent . " Some of the things I have found out would be amazing , but they will never be made public , unless in history . In one case , where an order was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strongest leather ob-1 tamable , the ' commissions taken from the amount the Government in question bad to pay for the shoes amounted to 25 cents on each pair . or $25,000 on the entire order . An order for 150,000 pairs I of shoes was placed in America when the first consignment had been deliv-1 ered . The commissions were even higher on this order . But the Government had to have shoes and needed them : quickly . Another order for 250,000 pairs was placed here , and the commissions were still larger . Agents Not Qualified . " This will not sound so strange when the circumstances- under which these goods are bought I-ave been explained . Each of the Allies has hundreds  --  one  --  of them over a. thousand  --  military and other agents in this country to buy war supplies . The military agents know little of business and many of them do not speak English . They deal with the American manufacturers through a most circuitous route . There are ' business representatives ' associated with i he military agents - who deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn place the orders with the manufacturers of the goods . Often there are even more hands through which the transactions must pass . " A fair and stated commission on the purchases is due the brokers if the business must continue through their hands  --  say 2 per cent . would be about just . But I regret to say ? that not a few of the agents actually appointed by the foreign Governments are culpable to the same extent that the horde of hangers-on who encourage them transact business through their hands are culpable in demanding exorbitant commissions from the manufacturers under threat of placing the orders elsewhere unless the conditions are met . Inferior Goods Sold . " The natural result is that the manufacturer . who must subtract so many commissions from the total he is to receive for  --  his supposedly best grade goods , supplies goods of a very inferior grade instead of the goods bargained for , thus allowing himself a large profit in spite of the commissions . The commissions charged on the shoes I have mentioned is only a detail . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased by other Governments than mine since the war began . But much more money has been expended and much more graft extracted in the purchase ot other war supplies , such as horses , clothing , cotton , guns , ammunition  --  in fact , It appears , after careful investigation and inquiry among those who know what sort of propositions have been put up to them , that graft has been systematically extracted , both by American and foreign agents , in every line of goods purchased to meet the emergency created by the war . Hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of goods have been bought here by all of the Allies together  --  it is impossible at the present time to estimate anything like the accurate figure  --  and the graft has run well into the millions . ? ? The conditions under which the purchases are made make this investigation an especially delicate one . All of the Governments concerned know that the exorbitant commissions are being charged , but it is practically impossible to prove it . Many of the transactions are made orally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinder the conditions if a specific case of this graft were charged against any individual manufacturer and groups of agents except to cut off that manufacturer as regards further orders and to try to prevent-the agents concerned from handling any more business . Prosecutions at the present time and under the present conditions are almost entirely out of the question , as far as the American agents are concerned . Punishment for the agents sent here from abroad , of course , is a different matter . There may be some very great surprises among a few of these in the near future , though there is little chance that their withdrawal from America , the reason for it . or the consequences , will by any chance become a matter of public knowledge . " Others Are Investigating . The agent explained the circumstances under which he was selected to investigate for his Government , and said that he was under the impression that other ' Governments than his were secretly conducting similar investiga-1 tions in the United States at the present time . " I did not come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Had I been cent here Especially to conduct this investigation my presence would have attracted attention . I came here on private business , my sons , who are young enbugh to enlist . remaining in Europe to serve their country . It was after T had been here a short time that I received a communication from one of the high officials of my country asking me to make the investigation and to report on its results . " My report has just been rendered and as yet no action has been taken on it to my knowledge . Probably it has not vet been received . " The confidential agent was asked what steps he had urged in his report as a remedy for the alleged grafting . " I urged that the Government appoint one prominent business man who woule be above suspicion as its sole purchasing agent in America , " he replied . " The agent might have military advisers to pass Judgment on the military goods purchased , but not to transact any business themselves . Then , following the good business custom ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agent to come out openly and make public the nature of the goods required . and to ask for bids for their production directly from manufacturers . There need no longer be any secrecy about the nature of the goods needed by the Allies . At any rate , the plan for open bidding is worthy of serious consideration . " The situation is especially lamentable in view of the fact that everywhere I have gone here in America I have found an overwhelming sympathy for the war sufferers , particularly those in Belgium . But the people of Europe have not been as close to Americans as I have since the war began , and when they hear that the people of this country are deliberately cheating the Allies when they buy war supplies it creates an impression that will be hard to efface . It is not a few individuals of small importance who are guilty of this despicable form of wholesale graft at the present time  --  many of the orders on which the largest commissions have been collected have been placed through men of great importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
