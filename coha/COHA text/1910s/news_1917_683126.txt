txt The magnitude of the Government 's military , naval , financial , and industrial preparations should clear away all popular misunderstanding as to the extent of our participation In the war . We are preparing for a great war , not for a small war or a short war . We are making ready for full co-operation with the Allies . We are going to fight Germany in earnest , and with all the forces at our command . The people of the country must draw that conclusion , and it is their duty and for their interest that they should draw it , in order that they may be prepared to render what service they can , make the.necessary sacrifices , and hear . with courage the losses that may come . They should carefully note and understand the scope and extent of the Government 's preparation . We are to raise and equip with all possible speed an army of 1,727,000 men . The Secretary of the Treasury has sent to Congress estimates calling for appropsiations of , ; ' , 3 , - 100,000.

These measures are taken under the explicit direction of Congress . In the resolution declaring a state of war the President was " authorized and directed to employ the entire naval and military forces of the United States and the resources of the Government to carry on war against the Imperial German Government . and , to bring the conflict to a successful determination , all of the resources of the country are hereby pledged by the Congress of the United States . " To understand what this means we have but to make comparison with the preparations made for the war with Spain in 1s9 ' .4 . That was a small war , the country knew it could not'be a long war . The enemy we now challenge is powerful . At the beginning of the war Germany was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mi ? 3t have been in sonic measure diminished by two years and a half of war , Germany still has immense armies in the field , the determination of her Government and her people to continue the war with desperate energy has not been broken . A good way to insure a long war is to prepare for a short one . We are not to make that dangerous mistake . The pledge of all our immense resources . the preparations to raise a great army , the measures already on foot to marshal the industrial and financial resources of the country for the support of the Government . prove to our own people , to all the world , and especially to Germany , that we are to fight her as England and France are fighting her , with all our might , determined to bring her to terms in tile shortest possible time . Any resolve less firm . any preparation less extensive , would have been an unworthy response to the lofty and inspiring appeal of the President , which has so profoundly moved the great civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of democracy , to make the world safe for democracy . We shall take our place beside our European comrades in arms in a spirit and with an array of force worthy of the great objects of the war . The President 's proclamation enjoins upon the people vigilance and zeal in the performance of their duties in time of war , it bespeaks their loyal devotion to the country and to its foundation principles , which were the real issue of the war , and it prescribes the regulations to be observed with respect to nationals of the enemy within our borders . They are the usual regulations , but with some broadening of scope and definition , to make them applicable to quite unusual conditions . There ere a large number of subjects of the German Emperor in the United States , &; much larger number , who , while of German birth or descent , have become citizens . Our citizens born in Germany or here of German parents have given , as was expected , abundant evidence of their loyalty .

They are Americans ; they can not be otherwise , for it is impossible that , coming here to enjoy . the privileges of liberty and democracy , they should now incline to the great enemy of both . For those among us who are still German subjects the President has with great consideration , but clearly arid firmly , laid down the safe rule of conduct . By obedience to the laws and avoidance of unseemly utterance and behavior they will avoid all interference with their liberty . Americans not of the German stock , too , should , In the spirit of the President 's proclamation , avoid all appearance of unfriendliness and suspicion toward those who are placed in the hard position of residing in a country at war with their own . It may be well to say that German subjects here should nAt assume that they are enjoying the benefit of the doubt . In time of war nobody gets the benefit of any doubt . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a way that no doubt shall arise . It is a serious matter , and they should always he on their guard against manifestation of interest or sympathy that might give occasion for doubt . Faithful obedience to the injunction of the President and of the Attorney General is the way to make sure of courteous treatment from their American neighbors.
