Griswold 's drawing room , the afternoon of Oct. 28th . At the back , double doors leading into the hall , which can be seen when the doors are opened . A newel post and balustrade leading upstairs are also seen in the hall . At right two large windows looking upon the lawn and street beyond . To right  --  front , near the windows , is a low tea table , at present occupied by cigarette box , ash tray , and flowers . To the right at back is a baby grand piano , facing the windows . Near this is a big grandfather chair . Other chairs , smaller table . In several large vases on tables , piano , and the mantelpiece , are quantities of superb American Beauty roses . They strike the eye at once . At left the fireplace . As the curtain rises , Griswold is seen walking nervously to and fro . He is a wellbred man of fifty or so , carefully and soberly dressed . He looks very worried , and keeps glancing at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar into the grate , then lights another and recommences his restless walk . Suddenly he stops at the window , glances out , then goes quickly to the door at back , opens it and listens . The closing of the front door is heard . JAMES ( Calling . ) That you , Donald ? DONALD ( Outside . ) Yes . p. 3 JAMES Come in here . ( DONALD appears still in his overcoat and gloves , a newspaper under his arm . He is a distinguished-looking , brilliant , eager young man of about thirty . The following scene is to be played at high tension by both men ,  --  sharply , quickly , nervously . ) Now what did he say ? DONALD Wait till I shut the door . ( He does so . ) JAMES Well ? DONALD ( Turning . ) It 's all right  --  he says he 'll come here at five and talk it over . ( Puts hat and paper on piano . ) JAMES ( Infinitely relieved . ) Thank God ! You 've been just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to think ! DONALD ( Taking off his gloves at piano . ) He kept me waiting . His office is jam full . JAMES ( Quickly . ) D' you think the people know , then ? DONALD Know what ? JAMES That he 's pushed us out of business . DONALD ( Takes off his coat , puts it on the piano . ) Not yet . Remember  --  the Western Amalgamated only went over to him to-day . When did they wire us ? About two o'clock ? p. 4 JAMES ( Turning away . ) All the rest 'll follow suit within a month ! DONALD ( Takes up newspaper . ) Steady , father ! JAMES Did you have any . chance to talk to him ? DONALD Not much . He chewed a big cigar and put his feet on the desk , and told me he 'd had his eyes on our grain contracts ever since he began handling freight in ' 92 . JAMES Of course he wanted them  --  why , they 're the big reason this city has for existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there through this port ! DONALD ( Half to himself . ) I wish I 'd smashed him in the face  --  right before his stenographers ! JAMES ( Walking up and down . ) I 've run the business as well as I could . I felt a public responsibility  --  you know that ! DONALD And now this Irish tough of an ex-barkeep has come along and swindled and blackjacked and knifed his way up to the place you 've  --  JAMES ( Stopping him . ) Do n't , my boy , do n't ! He 'll be here in half an hour . We 've got to keep cool and think ! p. 5 DONALD ( Continuing his own line of thought . ) Why , we could have managed him if we 'd been willing to stoop a bit and dabble in his own dirt ! JAMES ( Desperately . ) We must think  --  that 's it !  --  think ! DONALD ( Satirically . ) You could have put him up at the elubs , introduced him to Emily , had him here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , called him by the first name  --  ( Angrily . ) That 's what he wanted ! He 'd have paid for that ! JAMES Donald ! Drop it ! We 've got just an hour to get up something before he comes ! DONALD But he 's a disgrace to the city ! He knows it , and he knows we know it , and that 's why he hates us so ! ( Sharply . ) Father , let me ring him up and tell him we 've changed our minds  --  we 'll get on without any arbitrating ! JAMES Not let him come ? DONALD Yes . What 's the use ? He 's just doing it to gloat over us . He hopes we 're going to crawl and whine ! He 'd enjoy that ! JAMES I do n't care . I 've got to see him and find out if there is n't some way out . DONALD There is n't . p. 6 JAMES There must be ! My boy , d' you realize what we 're in for ? DONALD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money were the only thing ! DONALD ( Soothingly . ) I know that . JAMES It 's the integrity of the firm  --  it 's my own good name  --  DONALD Please , father ! JAMES Those notes  --  those savings bank notes  --  what about them ? They 're due on December 1st . If we fail I ca n't meet them  --  those banks 'll go under like that  --  ( Snaps fingers . ) DONALD Stop , father , do n't ! JAMES And , Donald , d' you know what those stockholders are going to say ? They 're going to say , " He was a director  --  Griswold was a director , and  --  " ( Door closes off stage . ) DONALD ( Interrupting . ) That sounds like the front door . JAMES What  --  ? DONALD ( Goes to the door , opens it , listens . Then , reassuringly . ) It 's all right ! Just Emily . EMILY GRISWOLD. appears . She is a brilliant , beautiful , assured young woman of about 28 , dressed very simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Stopping on seeing them . ) Hello ! Whatever made you two come home so early  --  ( Suddenly . ) Dad , you 're ill ! You 're white as a sheet ! Don  --  ( Frightened . ) Why , what 's the matter ? What 's happened ? DONALD Nothing . Nothing at all . EMILY Yes , there is . Oh , tell me , please , quick ! JAMES It 's all right , dear , Donald and I have to talk business with a man we could n't very well ask to the office , so I suggested his coming here . You are n't expecting anyone to tea , are you ? EMILY Just Lanrie Duncan  --  he does n't count . ( Still anxiously . ) Oh , dad , you do look dreadfully ! JAMES Then we can use this room  --  yes , that would be better than taking him upstairs . EMILY Him ? JAMES You see , it 's " Shindy Mike . " EMILY ( Surprised . ) You do n't mean Regan . ( Slight pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) What have you two got to see Regan about ? DONALD Oh , a lot of things a woman would n't understand . ( Buries himself in a newspaper. ) p. 8 EMILY Do n't be so snappy , Don ! DONALD ( Over paper . ) You may be all right down in the slums but you 're no good when it comes to business . D' you hear ? No earthly good ! EMILY You 're evidently in one of your fox-terrier moods to-day . DONALD Well , is she , father ? JAMES ( Nervously . ) Stop squabbling , please . EMILY ( Protesting . ) But , dad , I  --  JAMES ( Interrupting . ) How 's my young scientific philanthropist ? You 've spent the whole afternoon in your beloved slums , have n't you ? Well , where did you go ? EMILY ( Taking off her furs . ) Oh , down in the Fourth Ward , around the docks . JAMES Regan 's district . ( He becomes lost in his own thoughts . ) EMILY Yes . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wages on drink , so of course the women ca n't feed the children and they have n't any shoes or coal  --  think of it !  --  with the winter coming on ! And the worst of it is they do n't really care . They just seem tired and listless and they say they ca n't help it and that I do n't understand . Well , perhaps I do n't , but every time I see their faces I feel all of a sudden how much the world is carrying on its back , and it makes me want to cry , because there 's so little , so awfully little that I can do to help . p. 9 DONALD That 's perfectly true , so why do n't you drop it , Emily , and act like other girls ? Those people can get on without you . You 're not so important as all that . EMILY ( Smiling . ) As a matter of fact , I 'm awfully important . DONALD What ? EMILY You ought to hear what Mrs. Moriarity said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said if the angels were n't built on my style , not even God could make her go to Heaven ! DONALD ( Grinning . ) Mrs. Moriarity must be somewhat of a humorist . EMILY So do n't ask me to stop working  --  I wo n't ! Not until I have a big club house for the men , and a cooking school for the women  --  DONALD ( Interrupting . ) And an incubator for the children . That it ? EMILY ( Smiling . ) Yes , that 's it . JAMES ( To DONALD . ) Are you sure he said five o'clock ? DONALD Yes , why ? It 's only twenty-five minutes now . ( Glances at watch and clock and looks out of window. ) p. 10 EMILY ( Annoyed . ) Dad , you have n't listened to one word I 've been saying . JAMES ( Rousing himself . ) Have n't I , dear ? I 'm awfully sorry , but I 've got so much on my mind . EMILY I know it ! Something is the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the whole day down in the ward and you 've been in trouble and I have n't been here to help you . I do n't think your Emily 's much good after all . But please forgive her , dear , for my sake , and tell me all about it . DONALD ( Warningly . ) Now , father ! JAMES Nothing , dear . I said so once . EMILY Wait a moment  --  ( Looking up and speaking positively . ) It 's Regan . DONALD Now , Emily , we have to talk business , and there is n't much time , so run along , dear , please ! D' you mind ? ( He takes her by her arms and pushes her toward the door . ) EMILY ( Shaking him off . ) Yes , of course I mind . I 'm going to stay and hear what you have to say . DONALD No , you 're not ! ( Goes to table. ) p. 11 EMILY Don , stop contradicting me ! Even though I am a girl , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted whenever anything important is going on ! DONALD This is private , though . D' you hear ? Private ! EMILY ( Obstinately . ) I do n't care if it is or not . DONALD ( Fuming . ) Father , make her go away ! JAMES ( Soothingly . ) Now , dear , please  --  EMILY ( Interrupting suddenly . ) I know what it is ! Will you tell me if I 'm right ? DONALD You do n't know anything about it . EMILY Do n't I , though ? Regan 's trying to steal dad 's contracts with the grain companies ! DONALD Emily , you make me tired ! EMILY ( Turning to GRISWOLD . ) Is n't that right , dear ? JAMES No . DONALD ( To EMILY , approvingly . ) There ! What did I tell you ! JAMES ( In dry emotion . ) He has stolen them . He 's done us , Emily . p. 12 EMILY ( Gasping . ) What ? DONALD ( Sharply . ) Father , d' you think this is wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later ! EMILY ( With parted lips . ) You do n't mean  --  the Western  --  JAMES Yes , the Western went over to him to-day . EMILY But the others ? JAMES They 'll follow like sheep . No , we 're finished this time  --  finished ! ( He turns away quickly . ) EMILY ( Rushing to him . ) But , Dad , you must n't give up ! You must arrange it with him  --  discuss it , come to an understanding . JAMES That 's why we 've asked him here this afternoon , but  --  ( He makes a despairing gesture . ) EMILY ( Imploringly . ) Don , ca n't you manage it somehow ? DONALD I 'll do my best . ( With a smothered exclamation . ) If we could get him to keep those thieving hands off the Western for one month  --  only one month !  --  could n't I make him lie down and take the count ! p. 13 EMILY ( Eagerly . ) How ? DONALD The easiest thing in the world . EMILY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . DONALD I 'd get his men to strike . EMILY Get his men to strike ? Could you do it ? DONALD Could I ? Good Lord ! Why , they 're just like a powder magazine waiting for the match ! All they need is a leader who 's studied law and has a little nerve . JAMES How many of them are there ? DONALD Over eight thousand . And sick to death of being rounded up like Texas steers with a gang of toughs for cow-boys ! I could get after his liquor system , too  --  the public now does n't even realize he has one ! EMILY His liquor system ? JAMES ( Pointing to EMILY . ) There  --  you see ! EMILY What is his liquor system , Don ? DONALD ( Rather impatiently . ) Why , it 's his money that is back of every saloon in the Fourth Ward and each employee who wo n't leave half his wages on a Regan bar before he goes home Saturday night gets his quit notice when the whistle blows on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that true ? DONALD True ? Of course it 's true ! And that 's just one of the little tricks that have made him what he is to-day ! EMILY Then that 's why the men come home drunk , and the children have no food , and the women say I do n't understand . DONALD People say that Shindy 's out for the dollar ! It 's a lie  --  he 's out for the dime . And you can take it from me that every penny he owns he 's ripped out of a human heart ! EMILY Don ! Why did n't you tell me this before ? DONALD What 's the matter ? EMILY I 've met him ! JAMES Regan ? DONALD Where ? EMILY At a dinner the Streeters gave . He rides in the park . Why , we cantered around the bridle-path twice only this morning ! DONALD ( In strong reproof . ) Emily ! JAMES My child ! EMILY ( Apologetic . ) He  --  he was n't at all what I 'd expected . Of course he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( A movement from DONALD and GRISWOLD . ) Really there was  --  something  --  oh , I do n't know , dad , but  --  why , he was just like a little boy ! p. 15 DONALD ( Bitterly . ) " Little boy " ! Rot ! You 're a nice sort of a girl , you are  --  playing around with the crook who 's stolen your father 's business . EMILY ( Interrupting resentfully . ) Well , I did n't know it , did I ? You and dad never open your mouths to me and then when anything happens it 's all my fault ! I suppose I  --  ( MITCHELL enters . ) What do you want , Mitchell ? MITCHELL ( Announcing . ) Mr. Duncan . ( He holds open the door and LAWRENCE DUNCAN comes in . He is a lazy , attractive young man of about twenty-six . ) DUNCAN ( Gaily . ) Well , Emily ! I 'm glad you do n't spend all your time in the Fourth Ward . How-d ' you-do , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello . DUNCAN ( Suspiciously . ) Mr. Griswold , have these two been scrapping again ? ( To EMILY . ) What 's the matter ? EMILY You talk as if this were a Peace Conference . ( Looking at DONALD . ) But it is n't ! ( She sits down at the piano. ) p. 16 DONALD ( Returning the look . ) Not by a long shot ! DUNCAN ( Gaily . ) I believe you ! ( EMILY plays piano . DUNCAN goes towards her , leaning over piano . ) Please let 's have tea . I 'm awfully hungry . ( DONALD looks at watch uneasily . ) EMILY Tea ? DUNCAN Yes , you know you promised . ( Suddenly . ) Oh , if you ' ve forgotten , do n't bother . I 'll come another time . ( He turns to the door . ) EMILY ( Smiling . ) Of course ! I remember now ! ( DONALD signals across to his father that they leave the room . EMILY stops playing . ) Sit down , Laurie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) When that man appears , I 'll tell Mitchell to send him up to the library . JAMES Very well , dear . EMILY ( Stopping him . ) Daddy , listen ! ( Wistfully . ) So long as you and Don and I are well and have each other , I do n't think we ought to worry much , no matter how badly business goes . Do you ? p. 17 JAMES ( Coldly . ) My dear , I 'm afraid you do n't understand these things . ( To DUNCAN . ) Good-bye , my boy . Remember me to your mother . DUNCAN Thanks , Mr. Griswold . Good night . ( GRISWOLD goes out . ) EMILY Don , will you forgive me ? DONALD ( Trying to be stern . ) You do n't deserve it . EMILY ( Coaxingly . ) Not if I promise never , never , never to do it again ? DONALD ( Relaxing into a smile . ) Do n't bother ! I 'll take care of that ! Oh , Laurie , shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old man ! ( DONALD goes out , closing the door . ) EMILY ( Pressting a bell . ) Oh , dear ! I do have such trouble keeping my menfolks in order ! ( DUNCAN . laughs . ) Do n't laugh , Laurie . I 'm depressed today . DUNCAN ( Sympathetically . ) What 's the matter ? EMILY ( Her voice trembling . ) Life . That 's all . Just life . ( MITCHELL comes in with tea tray . ) ( EMILY goes to tea table . ) Here comes your precious tea ! Never say again I do n't keep my word ! ( To MITCHELL . ) Have you put on some of those little biscuits Mr. Duncan 's so fond of ? Oh yes , I see . Thank you . ( MITCHELL has taken the flowers from the table and put them on the piano , replacing them with the tea tray . Then he goes out quietly. ) p. 18 EMILY ( Filling the tea pot . ) Now pull up the big chair , and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ' fessing up , do n't you think ? DUNCAN ( Obeying her . ) What about ? EMILY ( Seated , nodding . ) Those roses . DUNCAN ( Promptly . ) Not guilty ! EMILY Do n't be absurd ! They came just as usual  --  four huge boxes of them . You might admit it , Laurie , when you see me wearing one . DUNCAN I may be a liar , but I have odd moments of telling the truth  --  honestly I have ! And I feel one coming on now . EMILY Well , let it come . DUNCAN I 'm far too hard up to send you American Beauties  --  at twenty-five a dozen-oh , yes , I 've priced them , all right ! ( His tone deepening . ) Although you know , Emily , if I could , I 'd have you walk on rose leaves for the rest of your life . EMILY ( Quickly . ) Rose leaves ! Oh , people irritate me so when they talk like that ! If you 'd seen what I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) How do you like your tea ? Five lumps and cream ? ( He stops , looking at her curiously. ) p. 19 DUNCAN Oh , I do n't want any tea , Emily . EMILY No tea ? Then what did you come for ? You said  --  DUNCAN ( Very nervously and obviously bracing himself . ) I came because I wanted to ask you something . I 've been trying to get up courage for weeks , but  --  but  --  why , there 's something about you that frightens me  --  it always has ! For heaven 's sake , stop thinking a moment , ca n't you ? Emily , do n't look at me like that  --  it 's horrible ! ( In an outburst . ) Emily , will you marry me ? Yes , that 's it  --  I want you to marry me ! Now I 've done it ! ( He wipes his forehead . ) EMILY ( In mild reproof . ) Oh , my dear boy ! DUNCAN Well ? What about it ? EMILY I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DUNCAN Must n't talk to you that way ? Why not ? EMILY I could n't , that 's all . Now let 's talk about something else . DUNCAN No , we wo n't  --  not till we 've finished this ! I think I 've known you long enough , Emily , to say a few things you ought to hear , so I 'm going to light right in . You have n't treated me squarely . p. 20 EMILY Why not ? DUNCAN Just because you 're clever and beautiful and know five times as much as most men that 's no reason for leading them on . EMILY ( Interrupting indignantly . ) I do n't lead them on ! DUNCAN ( Positively . ) Yes , you do ! You do lead them on ! And then when you 've got them all tangled up , poor devils , you take delight in turning them down ! EMILY Oh , that 's not fair ! DUNCAN What if they were n't up on philanthropy , economics , civic responsibility and all that short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ! And that counts a whole lot . No , Emily , I 'm afraid now I believe what I used to think I never could  --  that you have n't any heart , after all ! EMILY ( Impatiently holding out plate . ) Oh , take a biscuit and stop being silly . DUNCAN ( Refusing the plate . ) No , thanks . No biscuit . Everybody said you had n't , but I 've been fool enough to think I knew better . Well , I do n't  --  any more ! So good-bye . ( He rises and goes towards door . ) EMILY ( Simply and seriously . ) No , wait . Laurie , you must n't go like that . You may be right about me  --  I do n't know . I feel that way myself lots of times ! And yet I do believe  --  way down  --  deep down  --  I believe there is a man waiting for me somewhere , and that I 'll know him when he comes along ! p. 21 DUNCAN ( Wistfully . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't you manage to mistake us in the dark ? EMILY ( Smiling . ) I 'm afraid not , Laurie . ( He turns silently away . ) Oh , please do n't be hurt ! You 've been my best friend for so long I  --  I do n't think I could get on without you now . DUNCAN Emily ! EMILY You know the way I mean . But I wish  --  d ' you mind if I say it ? It 's only because I 'm so fond of you ! DUNCAN ( Grimly . ) No , go ahead . I can stand anything now . EMILY ( Wistfully . ) I wish you 'd wake up , Laurie ! You 've been asleep all your life . Oh , I know you 've had a good time , and I like good times so much myself that I feel I ought n't to say a word . But  --  but there is something more . I wish when you walk down the street , everybody would turn and say : " There goes Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . He 's a fine man and I 'm proud of him ! " ( Breaking off . ) I suppose I 'm talking nonsense , Laurie , but you know what I mean . DUNCAN Yes , of course , I do . You mean why do n't I go down there and start basket-ball teams and boxing classes for those kids in the Fourth Ward . Well , I do n't know how . p. 22 EMILY ( Wistfully . ) But you could learn . DUNCAN I tell you , Emily , it 's not in my line . EMILY People said that to me , but I went right ahead . DUNCAN But I 'd just make a fool of myself  --  everybody I know would be laughing at me . EMILY They used to laugh at me  --  perhaps they still do . The only difference is , I never hear them any more . They seem so far away . ( She is lost in a sort of dreamy enthusiasm . ) DUNCAN ( Uncomfortably . ) Emily , you 've been working too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that subject  --  you 're morbid , really you are ! Now listen , dear . Leave all those dirty people for a little while and come up here where you belong . EMILY Do you mean that ? DUNCAN Of course I mean it . EMILY ( After a slight pause . ) Then there 's no use talking any more . ( Enter MITCHELL . ) MITCHELL Mr. Regan , madam . He says Mr. Griswold is expecting him . EMILY Mr. Regan ? Oh , yes . Put him in the reception-room , Mitchell , until I go upstairs . Then bring him in here . I 'll tell Mr. Griswold . ( MITCHELL bows . ) And Mr. Duncan is going . ( MITCHELL holds open the door , hesitates . Then , seeing that DUNCAN is not going , he disappears. ) p. 23 DUNCAN " Shindy Mike " ? EMILY ( Nodding . ) Yes , it 's business . That 's why I 'm so worried . DUNCAN ( Smiling . ) When he walks down the street everybody turns and looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Be quiet ! He 's out there in the hall ! Good-bye . Come to dinner Thursday . Will you ? DUNCAN If you want me ? EMILY I do ! DUNCAN Then of course I shall . ( He kisses her hands lightly before she can take them away . ) God bless you , dear ! ( He goes out . EMILY , with a sigh , goes to the piano , takes up her furs and gloves , and turns to the door . Just as she reaches it there is the sound of voices outside in the hall . ) REGAN ( Outside . ) That 's O. K. ! Here 's a dollar fer ye  --  g'wan and take it ! Ye wo n't ? All right , I 'm goin ' in anyway . ( REGAN walks in , putting a bill back in his pocket . On seeing EMILY he stops in sudden embarrassment , and smiles . ) REGAN Pardon me , Miss Griswold . I thought I 'd just step in an ' ask ye how ye was feelin ' after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expecting you , Mr. Regan . If you 'll wait I 'll send him down . REGAN ( Shyly stopping her . ) Say , Miss Griswold , would you mind sittin ' here while I talk to ye fer a minute ? I wo n't keep ye long . EMILY I 'm afraid I ca n't , Mr. Regan . Good afternoon . REGAN Good afternoon , Miss . ( She goes out at the back of the stage without looking at him or smiling . REGAN is left to himself . He is a man of about 38 , the Irish-American bull-dog type , talks and looks like the tough who has risen to a great position and is not yet at home in it . He is apt to be too polite and ceremonious , but when he is moved or excited this drops easily away . He is elaborately dressed in a morning coat , with a gardenia in his buttonhole . He wears a diamond scarfpin , and is very conscious of his clothes . After EMILY goes he begins looking about the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looks at himself in the mirror , straightens his tie , and then glances suddenly at the door to see if he has been detected . He consults his watch , just as the door opens and GRISWOLD and DONALD come in . ) JAMES Mr. Regan . REGAN ( Shaking hands effusively . ) Glad t ' see ye , sir . An ' the young man , too  --  ( shakes hands with DONALD ) glad t ' see ye ! p. 25 JAMES ( Coldly . ) Sit down , Mr. Regan . I do n't want to take too much of your valuable time . REGAN ( Genially . ) Aw , there 's no rush ! I got all day ! ( There is a silence , GRISWOLD and DONALD exchange glances . REGAN realizes that he is being criticized . He turns ugly in a moment . ) Well , if you two gents is so strong for business , let 's get at it . Ye asked me t ' come . Here I am . What d ' ye want ? JAMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point . I 've been handling all the grain that 's landed in this city for nearly twenty-five years . Since ' 95 you 've managed to get hold of the freight contracts . You were on the inside of dock-life . You knew how to manage those men . You could make them work for an impossible wage . Well , you 've succeeded and now you naturally want the grain contracts , too . I 've done my best , but I 'm afraid I 've been too conservative to fight the conditions you 've created . ( During this speech REGAN has lighted a huge cigar , which he puffs arrogantly . ) REGAN You mean I 'm a grafter an ' a thief , but ye 'll be damned if yer one , too . That it ? JAMES ( Smiling . ) You have a clear way of putting things , Mr. Regan . Well , I heard to-day from the Western Amalgamated that you 've offered them terms I ca n't possibly meet . All the smaller companies will follow the Western , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You control the grain-handling business of this country . p. 26 REGAN ( Leaning back . ) Well , what are ye goin ' t ' do about it ? JAMES Wait just a moment ! I want to make the situation perfectly clear . For a good many years I 've been rather prominent in the direction of three very important savings-banks  --  REGAN ( Interrupting . ) The People 's Trust , the Union Deposit , and the Farmers ' Loan . An ' they put up the money you 've been fightin ' me with . Ye got in securities that wo n't be worth the paper they 're wrote on  --  ( GRISWOLD and DONALD exchange a quick look ) if ye lose that fight . An ' ye have lost it , Griswold ! I 've smashed ye an ' ye know it ! Ye 'll file yer petition within a week  --  they 'll be a run on those banks an ' they 'll go t ' hell so quick they 'll never know what 's struck ' em . That it ? JAMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find out ? REGAN How do I find out anythin ' ? I pound an ' pay until they cough it up  --  see ? JAMES If you take over my credit now you 'll shake the credit of the whole state . REGAN I do n't give a Bronx cocktail fer the credit o ' the state . The wheat 's got t ' be handled an ' s ' long 's I got that I can hang on through any run that ever happened . An ' what 's more , I 'll make good money doin ' it ! p. 27 JAMES Mr. Regan  --  REGAN ( Leaning forward . ) But you ca n't . Say , d'ye know where a run would land you ? In state 's prison , with a steady job as laundry-man a-washin ' underwear . JAMES But my securities  --  REGAN Aw hell ! D ' ye think a jury o ' reformed porch climbers is goin ' t ' believe them securities was any better when ye gave ' em than they are now ? Hear me laugh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' ye used the bank 's funds to float yer own business an ' ye got left . That 's how it 'll look on the front page o ' the one-cent daily ! Remember that Omaha man  --  what was his name ? Kimball  --  Kendall ? He got twenty fer a deal enough like yours t ' be its long-lost brother ! An ' that was before the days o ' Collier 's Weekly , too  --  Gawd bless its little soul ! JAMES ( Sternly . ) I was inside the law . If anything happens it was only a set of circumstances  --  why , I 'd have cut off my hand before I  --  DONALD ( Warningly . ) Father ! ( GRISWOLD subsides . ) REGAN ( Contemptuously . ) Aw , go tell that t ' the birdies in the park ! ' T ai n't what ye do that counts in this world . It 's what folks think ye done ! p. 28 JAMES Look here , Regan , give me six months before taking over the Western . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then . Six months ! REGAN Nixy  --  too long . JAMES ( Quickly . ) Four ! REGAN ( Briskly . ) Not on yer gay young life ! JAMES One  --  only one ! It ca n't hurt you ! At the end you 'll get the business just the same ! REGAN ( Enjoying himself . ) Yeah , but I think I ought t ' be makin ' a moral example of ye . Guy with swell position , born with a silk hat , looks down on Irish up-starts , turns the whole block into an ice house when he meets ' em on the street  --  JAMES ( Protesting . ) Mr. Regan  --  DONALD Let him go on , father . REGAN What d ' ye think the depositors in them banks are going t ' think about yer principles when they find that all their savin 's have gone bla-a-h ? Why , th ' Fourth Ward alone 's got over two thousand accounts in the People 's Trust ! Sure , they 're only Irish hooligans that would n't know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' t ' tell ' em , Mr. Griswold , when they up and smash yer beak off on yer way to jail ? p. 29 JAMES That 'll do ! DONALD ( To REGAN . ) Yes , Regan , I guess we 've had enough . REGAN Aw gee , the trouble with you patent-leather slobs is ye ca n't tell a joke when ye get it in th ' eye ! Now I 'm not tryin ' t ' do ye  --  I 'm not , s ' ' elp me Gawd ! Wot d ' ye say to a  --  a compromise ? JAMES ( Eagerly . ) Compromise ? REGAN Wot d ' ye say t ' a bunch-up o ' the two firms ! JAMES Bunch-up ? REGAN Sure ! Take hold good an ' hard , spit on ' em , squeeze ' em t'gether , an ' out she comes  --  " Regan , Griswold &amp; Co . " !

JAMES Amalgamation ? REGAN That 's it , but my mouth 's too full o ' teeth t ' say it . Gee , could n't we give this town a hunch , you an ' me ? I wonder ! You 'd supply the polish an ' the style , talk it up big with the church members an ' first families , an ' meanwhile I ' d be round in the back yard with my coat off , a-doin ' the work ! p. 30 JAMES You mean the new firm would be run by you according to your present successful standards , while I 'd be in front to keep the people from examining too closely into what we were doing ? That it ? REGAN Straight in the bull 's eye . Well ? DONALD You ca n't do it , father ! JAMES I know all about that , but I must think of those small depositors . DONALD That 's beyond us , father . We ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to come down from the principles on which you based your life and brought us up  --  to come down to his own dirty tricks . There 's only one answer to a man like that , father , and that 's the door ! REGAN ( Angrily . ) Oh , that 's yer line o ' talk , is it ? ( Controls himself with difficulty . ) No , I wo n't let ye get a rise out o ' me  --  we got too much t ' settle . Griswold , if ye come in with me on this I 'll let ye manage the business any way ye like  --  I do n't care how honest ye make it ! Oh , we 'll lose money , o ' course , but Gawd above us ! Money ai n't everythin ' . ' Specially when ye got a nice bunch o ' real estate up-town , a-ripenin ' away like bananas in a dago 's bed . JAMES ( Suspiciously . ) D ' you mean you 'll be willing to take the lead from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ' give morality a good fair show . After all , times is changin ' , an ' it may pay now better ' n it used to ! JAMES In that case , I 'm inclined to say I  --  REGAN ( Quickly . ) Ye 'll take me up ? Good ! Shake on it ! ( Enthusiastically seizing his hand . ) This is a great day for Mike Regan all right , all right ! DONALD Wait a second , father . What 's he letting us down so easy for ? ( Looking at REGAN . ) Why , he 's got us nailed and he knows it ! JAMES Donald , I do n't think you quite appreciate all Mr. Regan is offering  --  DONALD ( Interrupting . ) Yes , I do , and I do n't like it  --  not one little bit ! ( Turning to REGAN . ) There 's something else . Why do n't you lay it on the table and be done with it ? ( A pause . ) REGAN ( Ill at ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ai n't ye ?

Ye see , Mr. Griswold , I did n't care nothin ' about squarin ' things this way when I started in t ' grab yer business . DONALD I believe you . Go on . REGAN But I 've been thinkin ' now I 'd like t ' make up good an ' close t ' ye , ' cause  --  ( He stops . ) DONALD ( Sharply . ) Well ? Because what ? REGAN ' Cause I want t ' ask yer daughter if by any chance she 'd mind bein '  --  Mrs. R. JAMES What ? REGAN Marry me  --  that 's wot !

REGAN I 'll learn ye , ye bunch o ' stuck-up high-brows ! I 'll learn ye that I 'm it an ' yer nit ! DONALD Oh , we all know what you can do and we do n't care , but if you 're not gone in one minute I 'll call the butler and have him kick you down the front steps !

DONALD and GRISWOLD are amazed . ) REGAN ( Hesitatingly . ) I ai n't seen ye more'n four times , but I 'm no horse-car when it comes t ' makin ' up my mind . I 'm thirty-eight years old , an ' never had a sick day in my life , ' cept when some guy laid me out scrappin ' an ' mostly I can say it 's been the other way round .

DONALD To get a social position for his dirty politics ! REGAN ( Sternly . ) Young feller , I can put this through without no buttin ' in  --  understan ' ? ( To EMITY . ) Ye could help me , Miss Griswold , an ' I ai n't ashamed t ' say it . But that ai n't the reason why I want ye . EMILY ( Calmly . ) Is n't it , Mr. Regan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REGAN I love ye  --  ( Controlling himself . ) Well , that 's why . ( She shrinks a little and looks at him fixedly until DONALD speaks . ) DONALD Yes , and he 's offered to buy you . He 's got us right against the wall and he says he 'll let us off . He 's offered father a partnership , promised to back him up in everything . EMILY What ? DONALD And it 's all on the condition that we pass you over like a Van Dyck portrait , for that man to hang in his drawing-room . EMILY ( With a little smile . ) Dear old dad ! Don ! If we 're going to the poor-house , then at least we 'll make it a family party ! p. 36 DONALD ( Triumphantly . ) Ah , I knew you 'd say that ! We ca n't help a smash-up ! It 's not our fault if the banks go under ! EMILY Banks go under ? DONALD And anyway , Regan , there 's no use your staying here now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EMILY Banks go under ?

I intend to . DONALD Drop it , dear  --  please . EMILY Dad  --  ? DONALD ( Warningly . ) Now , father ! JAMES Wait until later , Emily . EMILY Mr. Regan , do you know anything about this ? REGAN ( Briskly . ) I know the whole blamed thing . EMILY Then tell me , please . DONALD Do n't listen to him , dear ! He 's got it all wrong , and  --  p. 37 REGAN ( Grimly . ) Oh , have I ? I do n't know ' bout that ! ( To EMILY . ) Your father 's borrowed money from three big savin's-banks . He just happens t ' be a d'rector in ' em all ! When he goes bankrupt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  EMILY Stop payment ? REGAN Yeah , an ' all them scoopers o ' mine that yer so stuck on  --  they 'll lose ev'ry bit o ' dough they 've managed t ' scrape t'gether . EMILY You do n't mean  --  REGAN Sure . They got their cash in the People 's Trust  --  the steady ones , I mean . It 's the only savin 's bank the Fourth Ward patronizes . Well , it 's just that very cash yer pa here borrowed , an ' if he ca n't pay it back  --  why , they get left . See ? ( Pause . ) EMILY ( Turning to GRISWOLD . ) Dad , is this true ? JAMES In a measure , yes . EMILY And all those men down there are going to lose their money ? JAMES ( Hesitating . ) There may be  --  some difficulty . I do n't deny that , but  --  EMILY ( Gently interrupting . ) But , daddy , dear , they have so little . It means everything to them . And we  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 38 JAMES ( Defending himself . ) It 's a tremendous misfortune as far as they go , but I acted with the strictest honesty and I do n't see  --  EMILY ( Interrupting him and turning to REGAN . ) Is n't there anything else you 'll take ? Wo n't you offer that partnership on any other basis ? REGAN I guess not . What would I be gettin ' ? DONALD Partnership ? D' you think father would consider for a minute any  --  EMILY ( Interrupting , speaking to REGAN . ) He 's right . Father wo n't do it now . But would you be satisfied with half the grain companies , putting the other half entirely in his hands ? Would you promise to go ahead under that arrangement and leave him absolutely alone ? REGAN Yeah , but what about me ? Will him and that young feller promise t ' leave me alone ? EMILY ( Haughtily . ) Mr. Regan , I think you can rely on my family 's doing the honest thing . REGAN ( After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give ' em half , that 's square . Is it a deal now ? Take me up ? EMILY ( A little wildly . ) I 've got to ! There 's nothing else for me to do ! p. 39 DONALD ( Appalled . ) Emily , do n't be a fool ! JAMES D' you know what you 're saying , my child ? REGAN ( Deeply mored , holding out his hand . ) Put it there , Miss ! Put it there , an ' shake ! JAMES ( Strongly . ) My dear ! DONALD For heaven 's sake , Emily , think who you are ! EMILY I ca n't ! All I can think of are the men who have their hard earned little accounts in those banks ! You have'nt seen their wives and children . You do n't know the misery they 're struggling under . But I 've seen it . I know ! And anything I can do to keep those pitiful little families from giving up and going all to pieces , why I intend to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say is going to stop me !

DONALD ( Beside himself . ) You  --  JAMES Donald ! Keep quiet ! The servants ! p. 40 DONALD ( Lowering his voice . ) I can see now ! You 've cooked this whole thing up ! You 've been meeting on the sly , trying to carry on an affair ! You know we 'd never let you marry him , so you make him get a strangle-hold on father 's business and then you think you 've got us gagged and bound ! REGAN ( Flaming . ) You cut that now ! DONALD You think I 'm afraid of you , Regan , but I 'm not . And I tell you , right between the eye 's , if you go on with this dirty scheme to get hold of my sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , wot 'll ye do ? DONALD ( Ominously . ) Wait and see . EMILY ( Warningly . ) Remember , Don . If Mr. Regan does n't interfere with you , you have no right to interfere with him . That 's settled . DONALD ( Desperately . ) You 're crazy ! Give it up ! Emily ! Darling ! EMILY I ca n't . DONALD D' you realize what you 're doing ? You 're choosing between us ,  --  yes you , are ! It 's dad and I against this man ! EMILY ( Passionately . ) I 'm not choosing ! Oh , Don , dear , ca n't you see ? p. 41 DONALD I can see you 're a base , disloyal , little  --  REGAN ( Interrupting . ) Quit pickin ' on her now !

No , I have several things to talk over with Mr. Regan . JAMES ( Quietly . ) Then I 'll stay . EMILY ( With difficulty . ) Please do n't .

They always do , an '  --  EMILY ( Interrupting him . ) Before we go further I must make you understand one thing . I do n't care for you . I feel quite sure I never can . We 've got to face that fact together , you and I. REGAN Well ? EMILY ( Bravely . ) I 'll keep my word . I 'll  --  I 'll marry you . But if I do , it 's with the understanding that everything stops at the church door . I wo n't really be your wife . I ca n't . That 's all there is to it , I  --  I ca n't  --  ( He comes towards her . ) No , wait till I 've finished . You were perfectly right when you called it a deal . I 'll help you with my position .

( As she speaks he goes out , softly closing the door behind him . She throws the rose on tea table. ) @x REGAN 'S library , the evening of April 29th . It is a new , elaborate , and obviously expensive room , controlled , however , by good taste , On right three long windows with heavy brocaded curtains . At right , above the windows and facing down-stage , a door leading to REGAN 'S office . At back a recessed fireplace and seats on both sides of it . At left , a dor leading to the hall and the rest of the house reached by a step and landing . The wall space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled by expensive bindings . At right-centre , half facing the audience , a long library table , with lamps , papers , and writing materials , also a desk telephone and a tray containing whiskey glasses and a syphon . Behind it stands a large chair and in front of it a wide comfortable couch . Near the windows is another smaller table with a lamp . The lighting is soft and restful . As the curtain rises , DAVIS , REGAN 'S secretary ,  --  a small , worn , little man ,  --  is discovered hunting about among the papers on the desk .  --  From the left comes the sound of people laughing and talking . Then the door opens , showing brilliant lights and increased noise of talk and laughter , and REGAN enters furtively , closing the door behind him . He is in evening dress . REGAN Say ! That guy ai n't come in with the ultimatum ? p. 46 DAVIS No , sir , not yet . I  --  I 'm afraid I 'm in the way here . REGAN Aw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis . I 'm gettin ' better every day .

( Looking at book shelves . ) I 've read from there to there . Wot are ye after ? DAVIS I 'm hunting for that interview with young Griswold in the Record-Times . REGAN The one tellin ' how he organized his Labor Union an ' got our men t'strike ? DAVIS Yes , sir . REGAN G'wan ! I used that t ' light a cigar . DAVIS All right , sir . Then I 've finished for to-night ? REGAN Go home and get some sleep . Ye need sleep when we got a big scrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , too . REGAN Say , how are the kids ? p. 47 DAVIS Fine , sir . The new school 's exactly what they needed . ( Nerrously . ) We  --  we never can thank you as you ought to be thanked for  --  REGAN ( Interrupting . ) Aw , rats ! Now do n't begin on that again .

REGAN Well , ye see , Mrs. Cuyler , I 'm expectin ' a visit from one o ' them strikers . They 're sendin ' me wot they call their Union Ultimatum ! ( To DAVIS . ) Good-night , son . DAVIS ( Going out . ) Good-night , sir . MRS . CUYLER The strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Europe , but I hear it 's been the talk of the town for two months ! REGAN ( Proudly . ) Yeah . We 've kept things going at quite a clip . MRS . CUYLER Tell me  --  how 's it all going to end ? Will you up and crush your brother-in-law or will your brother-in-law up and crush you ? Oh , I do hope somebody 's crushed ! p. 48 REGAN ( Opening humidor . ) Then ye 'd better get out yer handkerchief fer him ! They did n't call me " Shindy Mike " for nothin .

Tell him he can go t ' the meetin ' later on and yell " T ' hell with Regan ! " all the louder fer havin ' lapped up my champagne . ( At sofa . ) MRS . CUYLER And your old friend , the Archbishop . Emily said he was taken ill at the last moment , so he could n't come . But I do n't believe it , Mr. Regan , do you ?

Then , with distant carelessness ) : EMILY Oh , I beg your pardon . I thought you were in your office . Is that you , Mr. McCoy ? How d ' you do ?

I 'm not at home . GATES It 's Mr. Griswold , madam . EMILY Who ? GATES Mr. Donald Griswold . EMILY ( Faintly . ) Why  --  why  --  GATES And he said I was to tell you it 's most important . EMILY Then I think you 'd better show him in . GATES Very good , madam . ( He goes out . She crosses to the other door , opens it , listens . Then , satisfied , closes it and returns to the middle of the room as GATES shows in DONALD . ) DONALD ( Constrained . ) Hello , Emily . EMILY ( To GATES . ) That ' ll do , Gates . Will you shut the door ? ( GATES bows and does so . When they are alone EMILY throws her arms about DONALD 'S neck with a smothered cry . ) Don , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ve come ! p. 61 DONALD ( Rather stiffly . ) Are you ? I thought  --  it might be the other way round , after all that 's happened . EMILY Do n't be foolish , dear ! I have n't seen you for so long ! It 's five months now ! Oh , Don ! Come along  --  sit down here and tell me about everything ! How 's dad ? DONALD Very well . His rheumatism came back in January , but nothing serious . EMILY Did he have old Cortlandt ? DONALD Yes . EMILY I wish he ' d change . They say this new man , Winters , is awfully good . DONALD Imagine father changing doctors after all these years ! EMILY Don ! DONALD Yes ? EMILY How 's the business ? DONALD All right . Though do n't you think it 's rather rough on dad and me to ask ? EMILY Don , why would n't either of you answer my letters ? DONALD ( Gravely . ) We both took your marriage pretty hard , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give in and try to make up  --  even though I wanted to so often ! But now  --  my dear , I never realized before how much I love you ! p. 62 DONALD ( Uncomfortably . ) I 'm chairman of that big strikers ' mass-meeting to-night , and I 've got to be at St. Mary 's Hall by nine-thirty , so you see I have n't got much time . I  --  Emily , where 's Regan ? EMILY Oh , I do n't know . In there , I think . Don , you 're looking thin , and awfully tired ! Ca n't you get off for a week and  --  DONALD ( Interrupting her . ) Excuse me , but I 'm in an awful rush , and what I want to know is  --  EMILY ( Fiddling with his tie . ) Why , that 's the very last tie I knitted for you ! How well it 's worn ! DONALD ( Impatietly pulling away from her . ) Do listen . Emily ! I want to know what side you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DONALD Yes . How do you feel about the strike , for instance ? EMILY ( Vaguely . ) Strike ? DONALD Yes , strike . The Union strike we 're running against him . Where do you stand ? EMILY I do n't know . DONALD You do n't know ? p. 63 EMILY I 've never meddled in his business . I ' ve just done all I could to help the wives and children of the men he employs and let it go at that . I 've been cowardly about facing things . I know . But to-night  --  the Archibshop wrote me a note . He would n't dine here . He told me such dreadful things . They killed a saloon-keeper this afternoon . DONALD I know  --  Dave Hurley . EMILY ( Breaking down . ) Oh , Don , I 've been having a terrible time ! It just seems sometimes as if I could n't keep it up a minute longer ! Be good to me , dear  --  please  --  I need it  --  I need some one to be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a child . ) DONALD ( Melting for the first time and petting her tenderly . ) Poor little girl ! There now  --  do n't cry ! I ' m right here ! Your big brother 's right here and he 'll take care of you exactly the way he used to ! EMILY ( Trying to control herself . ) I  --  I ca n't help it ! It 's just too  --  splendid to have you back  --  again  --  DONALD Is it ? Then you 'll try to help me , wo n't you ? EMILY ( Drying her eyes . ) Help you ? p. 64 DONALD Yes . It 's like this . We  --  EMILY ( Interrupting . ) Don , give me your hand . DONALD ( Doing so . ) They 're getting Regan 's men to strike and join the Union at the rate of a hundred day . something happens we 'll make him shut down business by Monday at the latest . Why , even now the Western companies are getting scared  --  EMILY ( Interrupting . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . They say he ca n't stand up much longer and he wo n't ! He ca n't ! No matter how many dirty tricks he 's carrying up his sleeve ! EMILY Dirty tricks ? ( Looking at him intently . ) What d' you mean ? DONALD ( Confidentially . ) Why , Gleason  --  he 's our attorney  --  Gleason thinks that Regan 's just lying low until he can get a couple of thousand niggers up from Georgia or Alabama , and start ' em working at the docks at a quarter a white man 's wage . He could do it , too . Damn him , he 's the only man I know who could ! EMILY Ssh ! Don ! Be careful ! He 'll hear you ! DONALD ( Lowering his voice . ) But before I get after the railroads and head him off , I ' ve got to be dead sure of the whole proposition , and that 's why I 've come to you . p. 65 EMILY To me ? DONALD ( Eagerly . ) Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMILY ( After a slight pause , withdrawing her hand . ) I do n't know . I ' ve told you I never interfere in his business . DONALD Well , I want you to do a little interfering now  --  for me . I want you to find out whether this is true , and I want you to find out what road he ' s going to bring ' em over . Then we 'll wait and nab him in the act . I 'm glad he ' s in . You can get it out of him to-night . EMILY Don , dear , it  --  DONALD ( Interrupting . ) I 'll ring you up to-morrow about eleven and  --  EMILY ( Interrupting . ) Don , I could n't do that . DONALD ( Impatiently . ) Why , of course you could . Just tell him you 're interested ! Get him talking , you know how  --  he 'll take care of the rest . EMILY I mean  --  I would n't do it . DONALD What ? EMILY ( Uncomfortably . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DONALD But you ' re on our side ! . You 're one of us ! I 'm your brother , when it comes to that . EMILY I  --  I could n't , dear . That 's all . DONALD You must ! It 's your only chance to show dad and me you 're sorry for what you did  --  that you 're fond of us still ! EMILY ( Rising . ) I wo n't , I tell you ! I ca n't ! DONALD ( Rising . ) You 'd better look out , Emily , or you 'll make me think you approve of everything that man is doing  --  killing saloon-keepers and all the rest ! EMILY ( Indignantly turns on him . ) I do n't approve of it ! You know I do n't ! You know I hate it from the bottom of my soul ! DONALD ( Instantly . ) Then why do n't you help us stop it ? You can . You hold the chance right there in your two hands ! Good Lord , do n't you realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but I just know it 's impossible . DONALD It is n't ! EMILY ( Her temper rising . ) It is ! And what 's more you have no right to come and ask me ! p. 67 DONALD ( Angrily . ) Oh , very well , then . One thing 's sure  --  I ' ll never come again . EMILY If that 's the only sort of reason that brings you , I hope you never do ! DONALD Emily ! EMILY What do you mean by stirring up all this trouble anyway ? Did n't my husband help you just about as generously as any man could ? Did n't he pull you up and get you on your feet and give you half his business exactly as he said he would ? He 's kept his word , Michael has . He promised he ' d leave you alone and he 's done it , too ! And that , I believe , is more than you can say ! DONALD ( Turning angrily . ) I never gave my word ! EMILY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need of asking for it . But now  --  oh , Don , you 've made me feel ashamed of you ! I 'm ashamed of my family for the very first time ! DONALD ( Amazed . ) Do you mean that ? EMILY Yes , I do . DONALD You 're sure ? EMILY Quite sure . DONALD ( Between his teeth . ) Good night , then . p. 68 EMILY Good  --  ( She stops short as the door opens ana REGAN appears . A pause . ) REGAN ( To DONALD . ) Get out o ' my house , ye dam ' , sneakin ' little son-of-a-gun , before I  --  EMILY ( Flaming . ) Stop that ! REGAN ( Turning to her . ) Wot ? EMILY He 's my brother , and he can come when he pleases and go when he pleases , so long as I choose to let him . REGAN ( Sternly . ) See here , Emily , I 've never got my back up before t ' night , but now you ' re gettin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wot ye are before yer anyone else  --  I do n't care if it 's sister or daughter or life-long friend ? Yer Mrs. Regan  --  got it ? Mrs. R. ! An ' if ye think yer goi n't sit on my parlor sofa , in the middle o ' my house , an ' tell the guy I 'm scrappin to a finish how t ' land me on the jaw  --  EMILY ( Interrupting . ) I did n't say a word ! You can ask him if I did ! ( Appealing to her brother . ) Don ! REGAN Then I did ring the bell ! That was the reason why ye come in here t'night ! Gee , fer a good boy , yer getting on great  --  you are ! First ye let me help ye when yer down and out . Then , by way o ' thankin ' me , ye sneak around an ' get me men t ' strike . An ' now I find ye tryi n't ' make me own wife welch on me ! This may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the other thing ! p. 69 DONALD Do n't worry , you 've got that already . REGAN Now beat it , ye rubber-soled porch-climber ye ! Beat it , an ' if I ever catch ye in my house again , ye wo n't get out alive ! DONALD ( Coolly . ) All right . Keep an eye on St. Mary 's Hall to-night , Regan , if you want to know how things are going . There 'll be a few live wires you do n't expect . ( Telephone rings . ) EMILY ( Impulsively . ) Don ! DONALD No , I 'm through with you . ( He goes out . EMILY stands by door with head bowed . REGAN has gone to answer telephone , leaning over desk with one knee on sofa . ) REGAN ( At the telephone . ) Hello . That you , Porky ? Yeah . Yer at the Hall ? Well ? Have they got a full house ? Speak up , there 's such a damn lot o ' noise ! What about the street outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  --  ( He smothers a furious exclamation . ) Naw , go on . I did n't say nothin ' , Has the Mayor come ? I ca n't hear , they got a band playin ' , ai n't they ? Waitin ' fer young Griswold ? Yeah . He 's comin ' in his auto . I wish ' t was in his hearse . Wot ? ( GATES enters ) p. 70 GATES Is Mr. Regan there ? EMILY He 's telephoning , Gates . REGAN ( Hanging up receiver and turning about angrily . ) Well , wot d'ye want ? ( Irritably . ) Come on ! I wo n't have no foolin't'night ! GATES A man from the Labor Union . He said you  --  REGAN ( Interrupting . ) Bring him in . ( GATES turns to go . REGAN suddenly roars . ) Say , get a move on there , ye knock-kneed Britisher , or I 'll take the crease out the back o ' yer neck with the toe o ' my boot ! GATES ( Outraged . ) Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now an ' bring him in ! ( GATES goes out quickly . ) EMILY ( Trembling . ) You must not talk to the servants that way while I 'm in the room ! I ca n't stand it ! I just ca n't ! ( A pause . ) REGAN ( Shamefacedly at last . ) Aw , say , I did n't mean all that . I 'm sorry . ( GATES opens the door and shows in the Union delegate , a rather poorly-dressed , defiant-looking , slouchy laborer , wearing his Sunday clothes . ) You from the Union ? p. 71 SCANLAN Yeah . REGAN Wot 's yer name ? SCANLAN Scanlan . REGAN Sixth Division ? SCANLAN Yeah . REGAN I 'm on . I fired ye one day when ye got too flip . Remember that ? EMILY How d ' you do , Mr. Scanlan ? SCANLAN ( Startled ) Why , ma'am , I  --  ( He pauses , embarrassed . ) EMILY I hope that Mrs. Scanlan is feeling better than when I saw her yesterday SCANLAN Thanks , ma'am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . EMILY ( Brightly . ) Well , we ought to be thankful she 's no worse ! ( To REGAN . ) Excuse us , Michael , Mrs. Scanlan 's an old friend of mine , and she has bronchitis . REGAN Oh , is that so ? ( To SCANLAN , uncomfortably . ) Well , come on ! Wot d'ye want ? Choke it up ! I ai n't got much time ! SCANLAN ( Beginning his speech . ) At the meetin ' o'the board last night we passed a resolution  --  p. 72 REGAN ( Impatiently . ) AW , damn yer resolution ! Wot 's the least ye 'll take ? SCANLAN ( Briefly . ) Ten hour day , two shifts , an ' a general superintendent elected by the Union . REGAN ( Grimly . ) Anythin ' more ? SCANLAN Yeah .

SCANLAN Twenty-five percent raise on wages , an ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't ye want me watch an ' chain ? SCANLAN ( Doggedly . ) We do n't want nothin , Mr. Regan , that ai n't ours by rights . REGAN ( With sudden and ominous calm . ) Who framed up that resolution ? SCANLAN Wot 's the diff , s ' long as it was carried ? REGAN Was it Griswold ? SCANLAN ( Defiantly . ) I ai n't a-sayin ' REGAN ( Softly . ) Griswold ! I thought so ! p. 73 SCANLAN ( More defiantly . ) Well , wot 's the answer ? REGAN Oh ! Ye want me answer , do ye ? SCANLAN ( Insolently . ) Yeah . An ' if it ai n't the kind we like , we 'll soak ye all the harder later on . REGAN ( Ominously still . ) Oh , ye 'll soak me all the harder later on !

REGAN ( Suddenly springing on him like a wild animal . ) Ai n't there ? ( He strikes the man with tremendous force , EMILY shrieks , the man falls and lies quivering on the floor . REGAN draws back to kick him in the side . ) EMILY ( Coming between them , pale and very firm . ) Michael ! REGAN ( Thickly . ) Wot 's that  --  ? EMILY ( Looking at him firmly . ) Michael , it ' s I. ( He looks at her as if seeing her for the first time . There is a pause . Her gaze subdues him . At last she speaks quietly . ) Get some Whiskey . ( She turns and kneels by the wounded man , examining him. ) p. 74 REGAN ( Returning with the glass . ) Is he out ? EMILY ( Pouring whiskey between his lips . ) He 's stunned , that 's all . ( Looking up at REGAN . ) It 's a fine thing to send a man back this way to his dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said  --  EMILY ( Interrupting . ) It is n't bronchitis . It 's pneumonia , and it was brought on from cold and hunger . The doctor says she wo n't last out the week She made him promise not to tell her husband until the end . REGAN Why ? EMILY Because she did n't wish to stand between him and his striker 's work . ( REGAN gives a muttered exclamation and sits on couch , his face in hands . ) That 's what you 're fighting , Michael , and you 'll never beat that spirit in a thousand years . REGAN Has she  --  got any kids ? EMILY Four . The youngest boy was born last summer . ( REGAN has taken a roll of bills from his pocket hastily . He comes to where SCANLAN lies . ) What are you doing now ? REGAN ( Bending over and slipping the money in SCANLAN 'S pocket . ) Just a couple o ' bills that 's all . He 'll find ' em in the mornin ' . p. 75 EMILY ( Bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lying here , stunned and helpless , you think you can make up by putting money in his pocket ! Oh , what 's the use ?

Do n't ye know he ai n't had no wages since this strike was on ? His wife needs medicine t ' pull her through an ' them growin ' kids ought t ' stoke up three times a day on meat an ' pertaters ? ( Door bell is heard . ) Say , wot 's the matter with ye anyway ? Why  --  ( He interrupts himself suddenly and turns to listen . A pause . He goes over to the window and looks out . SCANLAN moves and groans aloud . REGAN turns quickly back . ) It 's His Grace ? EMILY The Archbishop ? REGAN Yeah ! He 's comin ' here to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the way . EMILY ( Busy with SCANLAN . ) Wait ! I think he 's coming to . ( To SCANLAN . ) Mr. Scanlan  --  ( SCANLAN makes another movement and tries to sit up . She helps him . ) There ! You 're feeling better , are n't you ? ( SCANLAN sees REGAN and guards himself . ) It 's all right  --  all right ! Nobody 's going to hurt you , Mr. Scanlan ! ( To REGAN , quickly . ) Help him up , Michael . p. 76 REGAN ( Doing so . ) Where 'll I stick him ? EMILY I do n't know . In your office , I suppose . ( REGAN half drags , half carries him towards door . ) I hear Gates . Can you manage him alone ? REGAN Sure . EMILY ( Whispering . ) Put him in the big chair . REGAN ( As he is dragging SCANLAN through the door . ) An ' the Bish ? EMILY I 'll talk to him . ( RAGAN and SCANLAN disappear . She closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opens and GATES appears . ) GATES ( Announcing . ) His Grace , the Archbishop . ( There is an instant 's pause , then the ARCHBISHOP enters . He is a big-jowled Irishman , of much the same physical type aS REGAN . He is dressed in clerical frock coat . ) EMILY ( Coming forward cordially , her hand outstretched . ) Your Grace ! ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN ( In his deep , rich voice , to which the traces of a former accent stillcling . ) Mrs. Regan , this is indeed a great pleasure . p. 77 EMILY Michael will be here directly . Wo n't you sit down ? He 's just attending to a little business for a  --  a friend . ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN I hope ye did n't take offense at my refusi n't ' come t ' yer party t'night , but after what I 'd heard  --  EMILY I understand . Oh , I understand perfectly .

I remember once his old mother tellin ' me how she kept him off the streets for a week just by askin him t ' help her with the dishes after supper . An ' he did it ! EMILY ( Bitterly . ) For a week . ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN ( Smiling wisely . ) Well , she was only his mother . EMILY I 'm only his wife . ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN I know . An ' I thought when he came t ' me that day an ' said , " Father , " says he , " I 'm goin't'get married ! "  --  I thought our Lady from Heaven had dropped a smile right down into his heart . But now  --  p. 78 EMILY ( Interrupting . ) Please ! Please . not any more !

ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN So I just stopped in on me way down  --  just for the sake o ' old times , Mickey  --  to ask if ye wo n't give in before it 's all too late . REGAN ( Between his teeth . ) Give in an ' take a lickin ' ! ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN ( With a troubled smile . ) A lickin ' ! Ah , it 's true you never were much good at that from the day yer family moved into Dugan 's bar an ' my old father  --  God rest his soul !  --  came over from the old country to run my uncle 's grocery down the block !

An ' feelin ' that way I 'd like t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor fellows in the past . p. 83 ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN ( Still doubtfully . ) How long have ye been feelin ' this way , Mickey ?

REGAN I du n no nothin ' about this afternoon . ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN Ye mean ye have n't heard ? REGAN I swear I ai n't heard nothin ' ! G'wan , wot is it ?

ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN ( Significantly . ) Yer quite sure no orders came from you this afternoon t ' do this thing ? REGAN I swear t ' Gawd I never heard a word about it up t ' now ! ( Pause . The telephone on desk rings . ) That 's McCoy now . He 's at the meetin ' , tellin me how it 's goin ' . ( Answering the call . ) Hello , Porky . Yeah .

Now listen to me please  --  ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN ( Pushing REGAN out of the way . ) Get out o ' me way ! ( He goes across the room , opens the door , and disappears into REGAN 'S office . REGAN drops his mask for a moment and has an animal spasm of rage , keeping perfectly silent the while . EMILY stands with her breast heaving . After a moment their looks meet . A pause . Then the ARCHBISHOP reappears , a stern , commanding figure. ) p. 87 REGAN ( Attempting to detain him . ) Say , it was an accident ! He fell down by himself ! I never meant to hurt him ! Why , he 's one o ' me very best friends ! I would n't a-had this happen fer  --  aw , Father , wait now ! Say , where are ye goin ?

ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN Down on your knees , Michael Regan ! Fall down on yer knees an ' pray fergiveness fer those blasphemies ! Rebellious child , have ye forgotten that the armies of the Lord protect His servants ? Have ye forgotten the great Church standin ' like a mighty rock against the waves o ' sin ? D'ye think a wretched straw like you can break its power or change its end from what was written in the Angel 's Book , a million years ago ? REGAN ( Muttering . ) Aw g'wan  --  I did n't mean nothin '  --  ARCHBISHOP SULLIVAN D ' you think a fool can stand alone and shake the deep foundations o ' the world ? Out o ' my way , presumptuous man ! ( REGAN , cowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real majesty and strength . As soon as the door shuts on him , REGAN turns fiercely and bitterly to EMILY . ) REGAN ( In an outburst . ) That 's a swell turn ye just done me , ai n't it ? Goin ' back on yer husband , tryin ' t ' soak him ev'ry way ye could ! p. 89 EMILY Please , Michael  --  REGAN Say , ai n't I treated ye well ? Ai n't I done ev'rythin ' I thought ye wanted ? Ai n't I given up half me business t ' yer old man ? Ai n't I put ye in a swell house an ' deposited a cool million to yer credit in the First National ? EMILY Do n't , Michael ! REGAN Ai n't I kept out o ' yer way as much as I could  --  a-sneakin ' in the back door , beatin ' it to my room whenever I heard ye comin ' ?

Michael , listen ! It 's your chance ! REGAN Chance ! With him on his way down there t ' talk against me ? I ai n't got no chance ! All I got is a finish ! p. 90 EMILY Do n't let him do it for you ! Give in of your own accord , before anyone can make you ! REGAN Give in ? EMILY Yes , call up the mass meeting ! Tell them you 've heard their ultimatum ! Tell them you accept it ! Then when the Archbishop comes , he 'll find out what you 've done , and oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quit while I got the life still in me ! EMILY You must ! Oh , Michael , I do n't want you to do this just to help those men or to please the Archbishop or to make me happy ! I want you to do it for yourself ! REGAN Naw !

Say , wot d ' ye think I am ? ( Telephone rings. ) p. 91 EMILY ( Hopelessly . ) Oh ! I do n't know ! I do n't know ! REGAN ( At telephone . ) Hello ? Who is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name o ' the Holy Catholic Church ? Wot ? Never t ' work fer me again ? Wot 's all that noise ? Cheerin ' ? ( Suddenly he dashes the instrument to the desk without ringing off and glares at EMILY . ) Well , ye 've done the trick , d ' ye hear ? Ye done the trick ! Now go on ! Tell me yer glad ! Spit it out ! Get it off your chest , an ' laugh ! Say , why do n't ye laugh ? I 'm just waitin ' fer that laugh ! Ye think I 'm smashed ! Ye think I 'm finished ! Ye think I 'm knocked t ' hell ! Well , I ai n't D'ye hear ? I ai n't ! I 'll beat ' em yet ! By Gawd , I 'll beat ' em yet ! ( His fist crashes on the desk as the curtain falls. ) @x SCENE . The scene is the same as in Act Second , the next morning about nine o'clock . The room is in slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and clippings . Newspapers with glaring headlines are tumbled all about the floor . Chairs have been moved from their regular positions . REGAN is sitting behind the desk , thus half facing the audience . He still wears his dress trousers , silk socks and pumps , with a jersey . He is chewing the end of an unlighted cigar  --  a pile of ashes and butts lies near the whiskey tray , near at hand . He is pale and unshaven . As the curtain rises he is running through the morning papers , one after the other . DAVIS , his secretary , is seated at the other end of the table , his stenographic books before him , awaiting REGAN 'S next orders . REGAN ( Muttering as he glances at the headlines . ) " Boss Regan falls at last  --  Repudiated by grain companies  --  Long fight ends in complete defeat  --  " ( Throws it aside . ) Gim me the Tribune . DAVIS Here it is , sir . REGAN ( Reading . ) " Mass-meeting at St. Mary's-Interference o ' Archbishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me in the oven , too !

( Reading . ) " Regan 's finish  --  City 's free at last  --  " ( GATES enters , carrying a breakfast tray with coffee and toast . REGAN shakes his head at him in disgusted disapproval . ) Say , you get out o ' here ! I wo n't have no dumb-waiter in here this mornin ' . GATES Mrs. Regan told me to bring you some coffee , sir . She heard you 'd been down-town all night and had no breakfast when you came in . REGAN ( Almost to himself . ) Well , wot d ' you think o ' that ? GATES ( Doubtfully . ) I beg pardon , sir , I  --  REGAN ( Irritably . ) Say , wot 's bitin ' ye ? Ca n't ye stick it down ? Yeah  --  here on the table ! D'ye think I 'm goin ' t ' feed standin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to the desk beside REGAN and puts down the tray . ) Got any eggs ? GATES No , sir , I  --  ( Starting to go . ) REGAN Well , move along and lay a couple  --  quick ! ( GATES looks bewildered . ) Two fried eggs ! Grasp it ? p. 94 GATES Very well , sir . ( He goes out . ) REGAN Read the Leader editorial . DAVIS Yes , sir . REGAN There it is . ( He kicks it toward DAVIS , then half sits down on end of desk . ) DAVIS ( Picking it up and reading it rapidly . ) " We take off our hats to the men who have raised the present issue against Mr. Regan 's methods . " ( He hesitates . ) REGAN Well ? Got a cramp ? DAVIS ( Resuming hastily . ) " We congratulate our citizens upon their enthusiastic support of the strike which has just ended . Thanks to Mr. Donald Griswold and his union , Shindy Mike no longer holds this city in his grip . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use going on , Mr. Regan ?

GATES More wires , sir , sent up from the office by special messenger . p. 95 REGAN ( Sitting down . ) Read ' em , Davis , quick ! DAVIS ( Reading them . ) United Transport  --  Chicago Freight  --  Erie Navigation  --  REGAN That all ? DAVIS Yes , sir . REGAN ( Sinking back disappointed . ) Well , wot have they got to say ? All gone back on me ? That it ? Speak up , ca n't ye ? DAVIS ( Reading the telegrams . ) Yes , they 've all cancelled their contracts . They 're all negotiating a return to Griswold . REGAN I knew they would ! Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and taking up his stenographic notebook . ) Yes , sir ? REGAN ( Walking up and down . ) Freight  --  Navigation  --  Transport  --  all the same messages  --  ( Dictating . ) Fail t ' understand yer attitude . My position in this town never better . Will have situation controlled within a week . Urge no action until you see my representative  --  DAVIS ( Timidly . ) But , Mr. Regan  --  ? p. 96 REGAN Well , choke it up ! DAVIS ( Desperately . ) They can read in any paper in the country that the strike 's broken  --  that we 're beaten  --  REGAN ( Interrupting savagely . ) Aw , dry up ! ( Noticing the butler , who has all the time been standing at the door . ) Say , come out that trance an ' tell us wot yer waitin ' fer ?

GATES Yes , sir , but  --  REGAN ( Suddenly . ) Now you get a move on before I catch ye on the nut with  --  ( He seizes the whiskey bottle with a threatening gesture , half real , half mocking . GATES goes out quickly . The telephone rings on the desk . REGAN answers it . ) Hello ? Porky ? Where are ye ? Down in the Ward ? Yeah . G'wan  --  who ? Young Griswold ? Wot 's he doin ' down there ? Speakin ' t ' my own men ? Tryin ' t ' make ' em join the Union ? I  --  wot 's that ? ( Exploding . ) Yeah , choke him off , sure , stop him ! But say , Porky , none o ' that Hurley business now ! No , take care o ' him . Do n't hurt him , just hustle him out quick , see ? ( He rings off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right in the middle o ' the Ward , tryin ' t ' show my own gang how to bust me ! The damn fool , he do n't know wot he 's doin ' . As sure as me name 's Regan , that guy do n't know wot he 's doin ' ! ( He rises furiously. ) p. 97 DAVIS ( Alarmed . ) Mr. Regan , do n't go on so . Remember , you 've been up all night ! REGAN ( Controlling himself with an effort . ) An ' I got a long , hard day ahead . Yer right , me son . Now sit down an ' we 'll get t ' work . I 'll tell ye wot I 'm goin ' to ' do . I 'm  --  ( The door opens , and EMILY appears , very fresh and charming , carrying a covered plate . ) EMILY ( Brightly . ) Good morning . DAVIS AND REGAN Good morning .

EMILY ( Embarrased . ) Why , that 's all right , Michael . ( Assuming authority . ) Go on ! Sit down now ! Everything 'll get cold if you wait ! REGAN ( Timidly . ) Ye do n't feel like a fried egg yerself , do ye ? EMILY ( Smiling . ) Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour your coffee , if you like . REGAN ( Eagerly . ) I wish ye would . EMILY ( Sitting at the desk . ) How many lumps do you take ? REGAN Four . ( EMILY laughs . ) I like things awful sweet . EMILY ( Smiling . ) That 's not very grown-up , is it ? REGAN ( Looking at her . ) Perhaps I 'm not as grown-up as ye think . ( Slight pause . ) Gee , but this seems natural ! EMILY ( Busy . ) What seems natural ? p. 99 REGAN ( Slowly . ) Aw , I du n no . Just t ' have you sittin ' in the sunshine , pour-in ' out me coffee . That 's all . EMILY ( Looking up innocently . ) Why , I never did it before to-day .

Everybody who accepted for dinner to-morrow night has sent in a  --  a more or less polite lie . They wo n't come , Michael . p. 100 REGAN ( Eating his eggs . ) Well , I guess I can stand that . Gee , I 'd rather beat up three heavyweights any day than talk polite t ' one o ' yer lady friends ! EMILY ( Almost to herself . ) Even Lucy Darrow and the Gilmores ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she is . ) So if you want to , you can make another engagement . That 's all . I just thought I 'd tell you .

Why , do you know there ai n't ten people in this town 'd let me eat out their ashcans  --  free o ' charge ? EMILY ( With a sudden impulse of pity . ) Michael , I want to  --  REGAN Well ?

EMILY ( Stammering . ) But  --  but , Michael  --  REGAN ( Interrupting . ) I sent the Western a wire last night , offerin ' ' em half rates if they 'd unload at Montreal . As soon as I got time t ' build me own elevators , that is . An ' here 's their answer  --  ( Picking it from the desk . ) Come in half an hour ago .

REGAN , left alone , looks about , then quickly and awkwardly begins tidying up the room , fixing the napkin to cover the tray . He makes the desk a little more orderly , throwing cigar ends and ashes in waste basket . He picks up the cuspidor and drops it behind the washstand . He pours water in the basin , washes his hands , wipes them on the towel , throws the towel behind the washstand , sets the pitcher back in the bowl in the water . While brushing his coat , he sees his pajamas and throws them under the pillow , thumps the pillow , and is covering the red blanket with the counterpane when EMILY softly opens the door and pauses , watching him . He does not see her. ) p. 143 EMILY ( At last . ) Michael . REGAN ( Starting suddenly and turning . ) Is that you ? I did n't hear ye .

( Pause . ) REGAN and EMILY ( Simultaneously . ) Yer lookin '  --  You look  --  ( They both stop . ) REGAN ( Politely . ) I beg yer pardon . After you ! EMILY ( Glancing about uneasily . ) You look  --  fairly comfortable here . Somehow I did n't expect to find things as  --  as comfortable . p. 144 REGAN ( Embarrassed , looking about too . ) Yeah , they been real good t ' me  --  the boys have . Davis comes here ev'ry day , an ' I got a telephone in the hall , an ' they send in me grub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't so bad  --  when  --  when ye get used to it .

I want to deed ' em over t ' you , if ye do n't mind . EMILY Deed them over to me ? How do you mean ? REGAN Put ' em in yer name . Let ye work ' em the way you want , give ' em t ' ye  --  understand ? EMILY But  --  I thought you were going to foreclose ? REGAN I changed me mind . EMILY Why ?

I had Hodges frame up an acceptance of the assignment . ( Taking it from envelope . ) Will ye look at it ? It 's very short , ye see , but it covers the ground . ( She looks at him , but when he holds out the paper she takes it and bends her head . ) Is there anythin ' ye do n't understand ? I know them legal words is apt t ' mix a lady up . EMILY ( Turning away to wipe her eyes without letting him see her . ) No , it 's quite clear  --  quite  --  REGAN Then would ye mind signin ' it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mornin ' . EMILY Where do I sign ? REGAN There under my name  --  ( Gives her a pen . ) Look out , it 's sort of inky . EMILY It 's all right . ( She takes the pen and signs the paper . ) REGAN There ! You 're the boss now . You 're the boss o ' the Fourth Ward ! P'raps ye 'll be a better one than me ! p. 146 EMILY ( Simply . ) Thank you , Michael . ( A pause . He waves the paper to dry it . ) I  --  I suppose you 'll be going to Montreal very soon ? REGAN Naw . EMILY Why not ? REGAN ( Thumb towards window . ) Look at them bars . Ai n't they a good reason ?

I 'm awful glad ! EMILY ( Looking away . ) Yes , it means a lot to you , too , does n't it ? REGAN ( Suddenly shy . ) Well , I  --  I was n't thinkin ' of meself just then . EMILY ( Still looking away . ) So you can probably go North , after all . REGAN Yeah . I s'pose I can . ( He has the package of papers DAVIS left . ) I s'pose I can . But  --  somehow I guess I wo n't . ( He tears up the papers , carefully , methodically , and drops them in the basket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

REGAN ( Sourly . ) Well , I ai n't doin ' it fer anyone else , am I ? ( A pause . ) EMILY ( With growing emotion . ) Michael , I sided against you yesterday . REGAN ( Under his breath . ) I know that . EMILY Well , you 'd done so many dreadful things , and I knew how you felt about Don . When you told me , it all seemed to go together .
