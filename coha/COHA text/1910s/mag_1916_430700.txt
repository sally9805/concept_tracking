 |p637  IN 1901 a competition at Washington called for a design for a memorial to General Grant , to be placed at the head of the Mall , and to cost $250 , - 000 ; the judges were Charles F. McKim , Augustus Saint Gaudens , and Daniel C. French , and the winner of the commission in April , 1902 , was a young sculptor , almost entirely unknown , named Henry Mervin Shrady . Today this monument is so well under way ? lacking only the central figure of General Grant and two bas reliefs ? that it seems a fitting time to draw attention to a work of art that is particularly sincere , particularly graphic , and thoroughly American . It is , we say , thoroughly American , mainly perhaps because its author is thoroughly American in heritage , sentiments , and convictions . Mr. Shrady comes from a long line of American professional men who have done their share of public service ; an ancestor was one of the founders of King 's College , now Columbia ; and his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he attended Grant during his last illness , and was long editor of The Medical Record. )  |p638  Mr. Shrady was graduated from Columbia in 1894 , and studied for the bar , though he never practised ; he engaged in business for some five years , when an attack of typhoid fever necessitated a year 's rest , and it was then , to occupy his mind , that he interested himself in art . At first he painted some animal pictures ; these his wife , unknown to him , took to the Academy of Design ? they were accepted and hung . His wife brought him to the opening day exhibition . He had not known her purpose till he stood before his own paintings . Encouraged by this approval of his ability by the Academy fury he began to look upon art as a serious profession , and he next interested himself in sculpture . He modeled some small figures , mostly animals . These found a ready sale in the galleries of a wellknown jewelry firm , and someone who saw one of his small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue for the Williamsburg Bridge Plaza , Brooklyn . This he did with a figure of General Washington at Valley Forge . He won the commission , and that gave him further confidence in his ability to succeed in art . Indeed , it gave him so much confidence that , when a little later an elevator that lifted his horse model up to his studio broke down and a few weeks waiting for it to be repaired gave him some forced leisure , he determined to enter a much more important contest of which he had just heard , namely , the Grant Memorial in Washington . In this he associated himself with Edward Pearce Casey , who designed the pedestal . It was a Herculean task for so inexperienced a youth ? one wholly self-taught ? to undertake ; a daring venture in view of the prominence of the judges ? McKim , Saint Gaudens , and French ? and in view of the national appeal that the monument must make . II In order to obtain some information at first hand in regard to the aims and methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio in Westchester County . The country of Westchester is particularly concrete ; it is so made up of little hills and valleys , streams and lakes , that it looks as though the Creator had fashioned it to teach physical geography to children . All the " Primary Highlands , " the " Secondary ,  |p639  Highlands , " and " Great Central Plains " known to text books are to be seen on a small scale , as one sees in miniature on the mirror eyepiece of a telescope , no larger than a half-dollar , the craters and mountains of the moon . One could not help but feel that this spot , where all of nature 's characteristics are epitomized in a single square mile , was the ideal place for the work-shop of the sculptor who purposed to epitomize the whole of Grant 's career in a single monument 265 feet long . Here , on a hilltop back of his residence , part of which is over 200 years old , we found Mr. Shrady 's studio ; and knowing of his self-reliance , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own hands , casting the concrete blocks for its walls . The outside is frankly rectangular , like the Italian villas of Raphael 's time . Inside everything indicates the practical workman , not the dilettante ; There are no tapestries on the wall , no rugs on the floor ; but bags of plaster-of-Paris , for making molds , are stacked up near a great stove , while the skeleton of a horse rests against the wall , and on stands , at every turn , are models of statues in various degrees of completion . Mr. Shrady gave us the information we sought with the modesty and frankness of a boy . In regard to the final aspect of the monument , we asked what the big form would be ? He replied , , that as a big decorative unit the monument would be pyramidal in outline . At the apex would be the equestrian figure of General Grant ; then the eye would fall down a step to four lions , frankly decorative , representing the guardians of the national and of the army flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rest on two large groups , one a cavalry charge , the other the charge of a battery of artillery . In his very first conception Mr. Shrady planned to avoid the conventional allegorical figures of " Victory , " " War , " " Courage , " " Peace , " and so forth , that are found on such memorials . He intended , rather , to be ultra realistic , and portray the actual occurrences of General Grant 's career in facsimile , as it were . The final impression of the monument is to be that it commemorates a period in our history when there was a great upheaval . Troops are being rushed to the front ; the young men of the country have answered the call to arms , and every effort is being made  |p640  to save the Union . It needed a great man to control these seething forces . Such a leader was Generale Grant , and he is seen at the apogee of the monument seated , calm and impassible , the very embodiment of confidence . It was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit upon his horse whittling a stick . He felt quite certain as to what the outcome of the fight would be , and so he always kept his poise . Grant required that his mount should be a thoroughbred , well groomed , and its accoutrements perfect ; but he cared very little about his own dress , and never wore a sabre during an engagement . As Mr. Shrady advanced in his studies , while he still wished to be accurate in every particular , he cared less and less to have the actual details . assert themselves , striving rather to eliminate all unessential details , and to reduce all forms to a few big planes and decorative masses . He also cared less about portraying the actual occurrences of General Grant 's career . He felt he would rather b , decorative than pictorial He wanted to get the spiri of Grant 's time , rather that be strictly correct about an . one battle . He eliminated all sugges tion of the gruesome inci dents of war ? no man o horse is dying ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen ? he i sliding forward , his ride prone beside him ? but tha is as far as the sculptor ha gone to make one shudder He felt that incident neces sary to accentuate the rust of conflict . It was easy to see , as MI Shrady talked , that he ha , made this commission his lif work ; that he was develor ing as a man and an artist a it progressed ; and that th final result was going to " b something more than an er largement of t h e sketc which obtained the prize fo him in 1902 . III If a piece of sculpture i to be a proper public mom ment and not a mere museum piece , it mus speak to the passerby . To test the validity of Mr. , Shrady groups we visited Washington on a golde day in November , and , witha sentinel 's gai paced up and down in front-of the . mom . ment watching the visitors who stopped IN fore it , and now and again approached then asking them for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chang cross-examined the people , he was it troduced to . " Does it seem real to you ? we asked . " Does it seem quite true ? " What do you see in each group ? " The proof of the pudding is in the eating and the answers we received proved beyon the shadow of a doubt that this sculptor who is untaught as regards his art , ha learned how to speak to the people throug sculptural forms . " Does it look real ? " we asked two arti lery boys , who had stopped over in Was ington on their way home from the Mexica border , as they stood before the field batter  |p641  group . " Indeed it does , " was the prompt reply . " That man with the flag , he 's the guidon ; he rides an extra horse next to the leaders ; behind are the wheelers , or the pole team ; they 've come to the edge of a precipice or a river , or something , and he 's bringing the horses up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day the leaders are a little lighter in build , but we have heavy wheelers in the pole team . Those horses are good and sturdy , just the ones for that work . The cannoneers sitting on the limber are holding on just as I 've seen them do many a time when there came a sudden jolt . The captain will give the order to unlimber in a minute , and then the cannoneers will jump down and load the piece . It 's a different kind from what we have to-day . They used a ramrod and fired with a fuse or cap . I 've fired that kind of a gun in a moving picture of a Civil War battle I was in . It would kick a bit . Our field pieces to-day have about a 44-inch recoil only . " He would like to get a snapshot of that group , so took his camera around to the other side , where the lighting was better . Here many new details interested him : " See the slack traces ; that 's true ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that 's a leather collar ; we have steel collars . Also the toggles ? where the traces are hitched to the collar ? these are leather ; we have steel cables fastened to the collar . Here there are no saddles on the off horses ; with us saddles are on both horses . The men have sabres here . We do n't wear sabres ; we carry pistols , they are more effective . " The cavalry group he did n't know so much about , but , of course , had " seen them often ; as the cavalry always supported a battery on one side . It looked like a skirmish charge . The captain of the troop was raising his sword and urging them on . " Two Grand Army men , veterans of Vicksburg , were equally impressed , but owing , perhaps to failing eyesight ? they were between  |p642  seventy and eighty-they did not grasp the significance of the groups so quickly . But , by our pointing out some of the details , there was soon an awakened enthusiasm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Vicksburg , only the horses seemed a bit mixed up " ? they evidently looked for line formation in the cavalry charge ? and in the artillery scene they felt that the cannon could not get on much farther if the horses were in such a tangle . But after a little explanation they admitted that , as regards the cavalry , why , after the first formal charge there would be apt to be little side skirmishes over the battlefield , and in such cases the ranks would be broken . Then it dawned upon the veterans that there were possibilities they had not thought of , and they began to figure out what might have happened . " The fellow with the sword , he 's the captain ; he does n't need the sword much , but he must have some emblem of authority . The trumpeter keeps near him , and the captain calls out his orders sc he can hear , and he sounds Charge ' and Retreat ' on his bugle . " Yes , he had seen horse and rider fall just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too dark for them to see plainly , and they turned to go with a farewell " thanks ' for our having directed their at tention to something they fell was " great . " The afternoon had advanced the light began to fade ; the peo ple ceased to come into the park In the dusk the figures of thi statues seemed to nestle close : together , so that the groups be came , as the sculptor would wish they might , perfect silhouetted units of decorativ ( contour . The twittering sparrows hopped lighth under the feet of the rearing horses , and the gray squirrels chased one another about thi marbled base as though they considered th huge bronze masses as much a part of th park as the trees and shrubs . War effigie had no terrors for them .
