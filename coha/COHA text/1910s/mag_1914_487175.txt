- When a history of the Great War as it affected the United States is written fifty years hence , the hysteria of the organizers if safety leagues to prevent our being invaded by the victors in the European struggle will doubtless afford one of the most entertaining chapters . Last week eloquent appeals were made to do something or other to forestall the unloading of 150,000 soldiers on our shores within a week or so after the declaration of war . There were visions of the conquest of Canada by the Germans , from which they would , of course , having disposed of the British and American fleets , calmly walk down the Hudson to Albany and New York . No nation could possibly land 100,000 men here , save - after weeks and months of preparation . Probably only England , with her great sea-power , could accomplish this at all . It was shown by a prominent British writer in the war scare of 1909 that to move a force of 200,000 German soldiers to , England , with all their guns , ammunition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three weeks , would take every ship in the German merchant marine , including all those in service in Asian and Australian waters , and that the speed of this impossible fleet could not be much over twelve miles an hour . What such an undertaking would be across 2,000 miles of water , any one can figure out from the weeks it took the Japanese to transport their army to Manchuria and for us to send a few thousand men to the Philippines . In his speech at the opening of the Reichstag , the German Chancellor not only gets miles away from his famous confession of wrong in the violation of Belgium 's neutrality , but gets out a brand-new view of the responsibility for the war . He puts the blame upon England , not in the usual way , but because she failed to declare to Russia that she would not allow her to bring on a Continental war in consequence of Austria 's ultimatum to Servia . But if this is a valid argument against England  --  and in our judgment it is not  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question : Why did not the Kaiser notify his subservient ally that he would not permit a Continental war to arise out of her ultimatum to Servia ? If there was any responsibility on England whatever to hold Russia in check , there was ten thousand times more responsibility upon Germany to prevent the original firing of the fatal train . The only point , it seems to us , where von Bethmann-Hollweg scores ever so slightly is in his parallel between England 's concern for Belgian neutrality and her connivance at Japan 's violation of Chinese neutrality . Highly significant in the proceedings in the Reichstag was the solitary vote cast against the new war loan by Dr. Karl Liebknecht . For some time it has been plain that there was no such unity in Socialist ranks with regard to the war as would be indicated by the unanimous vote of that party in favor of the first war budget last August . Through the press the revolutionary wing of the German Social-Democracy , as represented by Karl Liebknecht , Franz Mailbag , Rosa Luxemburg , and Clara Zetkin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the active propaganda carried on in favor of the war and Germany 's cause by Socialists like Scheidemann and Siidekum . It has been brought out that , while the 110 Socialist votes were cast as a unit last August , this was the result of caucus action . Within the Socialist caucus there was a large faction opposed to voting for the budget . Last year similar caucus action dictated the Socialist vote in favor of the quarter-billion war contribution . Mr. W. E. Walling states in the Outlook that in the 1913 caucus there were 51 votes in favor of supporting the war loan and 37 against , so that an actual minority of the Socialist party representation of 110 dictated the party policy . It is now apparent that Dr. Liebknecht has broken with the party leadership and has made himself the spokesman of a discontent with the war which has always existed in Germany , and is now becoming articulate , even as it is becoming articulate among Socialists in England and in Russia . " The Belgian Government , " says M. Havenith , its Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be published in full . Three months have passed since this alleged discovery , but noth ing has appeared . " What he refers to is , of course , the documents found in Brussels which the Germans assert are proof that Belgium had surrendered her neutrality to Lag land . That they do show anything of ' the kind . there is not the faintest reason to believe ; even according to the German account of their contents , all that the documents prove is that the Belgians had prepared , in consultation with English officers , a scheme of defence against German violation of their territory . Whether this was so or not , M. Havenith does not know ; but , he says , " events have shown too clearly , alas ! how much such a precaution against Germany 's projects would have been timely . " It ought to be remembered , in all this , that the plea made by Germany  --  last reiterated by the imperial Chancellor in his speech a few days ago  --  is not only a plea in defence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disgraceful bad faith . To make such a charge without at least a respectable pietence of proving it is monstrous , and really but intensifies the feeling of Germany 's guilt in the whole matter . In the revelation by ex-Premier Giolittl that Austria in 1913 was proposing to make war on Servia , and asked Italy if she would stand by the Triple Alliance , there is great suggestiveness in several different ways . We see clearly , for example , that the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand merely gave the Austrian Government a good excuse for proceeding with a war-like policy against Servia which it had long cherished . It is plain , too , that Italy was already studying carefully the nature of her obligations under the Triple Alliance . She was bound to join Austria and Germany only in case they  --  or either of them  --  were attacked . There could be no casus lcsderis in a deliberate move of Austria against Servia . Italy 's straightforward refusal to lend herself to the Austrian plans of 1913 should have been a sufficient notice to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1914 . The attitude of the Italian Government this year is , by the way , as good a proof as one could ask that Austria and Germany were not , as they alleged , beginning a " defensive " war . Italy located the aggression in Vienna and Berlin . Finally , in the light on the troubled year 1913 which is cast back by Giolitti 's statement , we see how fully justified was the continued apprehension of financial Europe . It did not believe that the apparent settlement of the Balkan War meant assured peace ; and we can now perceive that it was right . The French Parliament is to meet in extraordinary session at Paris on the twenty-second . This is not tantamount to a return of the Government from Bordeaux . It is a sign , however , of growing hopefulness and undiminished determination on the part of the French nation . Though France may be Justly regarded as the focus of the great conflict , we know less of what is going on in France than in any other of the combatant nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judging the losses she has suffered , in the absence of casualty lists . Only hints come out as to the way the very important problem of dealing with the enormous number of refugees is being confronted . It is certain , of course , that France 's losses have been very great and that her resources are being taxed to the utmost . But enough has come out to show also that the French are facing the situation with a pluck , a tightlipped resolution , which is not usually associated with their national character . Uninterrupted preparations for marking the centenary of the signiiig of the Treaty of Ghent show that the event will be observed with dignity . The war now sweeping Europe , far from diminishing the notice it will attract , gives it clearer relief . Could anything better emphasize the difference between the Canadian-American frontier , along whose 3,800 miles a celebration will be held in every city from Vancouver to the Atlantic , than the smoke and carnage on the Belgian and Polish frontiers ? On the 24th of this month the feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but be uppermost in every heart . It will not be possible for the appointed delegates to meet that day in Ghent , or for Belgium to take any part in the celebration ; but the cataclysm abroad will not interrupt the ceremonies in London , Quebec , Montreal , and Ottawa , nor , we hope , any of those planned in this country . New York has voted $10,000 , and the Governor has appointed a commission ; Virginia has passed a law that the event shall be celebrated by the cessation at noon for five minutes of all traffic , labor , and business ; Pennsylvania , the Carolinas , and other States have appointed official commissions ; Louisiana is to hold a great celebration at New Orleans on the 8th , 9th , and 10th of next month . When we remember that the War of 1812 was connected with the Napoleonic conflicts , to which the present war offers a parallel , there is special point in calling to mind what Premier Borden of Canada calls " the excellent way these two great Powers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Government during the next fiscal year , sent to Congress on Monday , carry with them a warning to the country that Washington must still be made to feel the necessity for economy . They have been drawn up under departmental injunctions to save on every possible head , and are hailed as expressing the general desire for retrenchment ; yet their total of $1,090,775,134 is but $3,392 , - 962 less than the appropriations for the cur-. rent fiscal year , and about $17,500,000 less than the Treasury estimates for 1915 . So recently as 1913 we were spending but $963 , - 738,000 , and in 1912 but $965,273,677 . Attention will doubtless be centred on the rivers and harbors appropriations , for which an outlay of over $53,000,000 is recommended . Senator Ransdell and his associates have announced their purpose of fighting for at least $45,000,000 , to be spent in the same wasteful way as formerly . Public sentiment in this matter is to-day unequivocal , and it is probable that attempts at " log-rolling " will only intensify the demand for minimum appropriations until some such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is promise that everywhere President Wilson will use his influence for economy  --  for genuine economy , that is , and not for the false economy that cuts into needed expenditures . The Colonel must be delighted with his latest recruit . Senator Penrose gives his warmest approval to Mr. Roosevelt 's violent assault upon the Mexican policy of President Wilson . The Pennsylvania Senator states that he has not been able to agree with Roosevelt in many positions , but that in this business the Colonel is a man after his own heart . The reason is plain . Political reforms and chatter about social justice only fill Penrose with disgust ; but since many Pennsylvanians have " large interests " in Mexico , which might be enhanced in value if we were to seize Mexican territory , he is naturally for as vigorous and aggressive steps as any that the Colonel advocates . The significant event , however , is this getting together of Penrose and Roosevelt on the issue of intervention in Mexico . May we not soon see them locking arms under the banner of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely unison " Onward , Christian Soldiers " ? Gifford Pinchot 's voice is still for war . Others may debate the desirability of going into the campaign of 1916 , but he does not propose to " abandon the 270,000 voters who gave me their suffrages in the last election . " In this respect he is different from most of his fellow-Progressive candidates , who found themselves abandoned by their quondam supporters . Nor can many candidates afford to go on spending fifty thousand dollars per campaign , as Mr. Pinchot confesses to having done . Penrose , as he says , doubtless spent more than that . These expenditures were in spite of the law limiting Senatorialcandidates to ten thousand dollars for expenses , but as the law excepts " necessary Personal expenses , " which include travelling and printing , money is still able to talk loudly in a fight ostensibly at least between principles . There have been murmurings that the Progressive General Staff was too much of a millionaires ' club ; certainly , the party has failed to capture the labor vote , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent social workers . But what could it hope to do without its Pinchots and its Perkinses ? If only for the sake of the picturesque element they bring to our politics , one hopes that they will decide to keep the mimic war going a while longer . A bulletin issued by the Census Bureau on the Chinese and Japanese in the United States supplies for the analysis of the yellow menace some wholly new figures regarding the agricultural situation . It appears that in 1910 the total number of farms operated by the Chinese was 760 , and by the Japanese 2,502 ? the land in the Chinese farms totalling 52,041 acres , and that in the Japanese 157,259 acres . It is further stated that " only 57 of the Chinese farms and only 257 of the Japanese farms were operated by owners , the majority of the Chinese and Japanese engaged in agriculture being cash tenants . " Figures of this same purport were made public by various authorities in 1912 and 1913 , but the Federal Government has heretofore published only the total number of Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these farms are scattered through eleven States , it is plain that the dangers of alien land-ownership are not great . The Bureau 's figures on the marital condition of the two races also suggest that most of the land is held by single men , and that the amount of land whose tenure will be kept in Chinese or Japanese handssby inheritance might be limited by that fact . There are fourteen times as many Chinese men as women in the United States , seven times as many Japanese ; and of the 72,000 Japanese in this country , considerably less than one-third the adults are married . The New York World 's statement of the base against Minister Sullivan in ' Santo Domingo is bound to raise anew the question of his fitness . It seems incredible that these details of the Minister 's relationships could have been known and considered in the State Department , prior to the Minister 's recent whitewashing . By this we do not mean to pass judgment upon the World'a particular charges . We merely point out again that the appointment of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of service were being turned out of the diplomatic corps , was a wrong to the service and the grossest injustice to the Santo Domingans . Surely , we owed them something better than a press-agent for a prize-fighter and counsel for the notorious " Jack " Rose , a man all of whose associations and relationships in New York city stamp him as the last one who should be put into a position to represent the United States . There are plenty of men here a hundred-fold more competent and worthy , and it is much to be regretted that Mr. Bryan did not send a fit representative to deal with the extremely delicate situation in Santo Domingo . Besides its opinion on the Jim Crow question , the Supreme Court last week gave another that seriously concerns the civil rights of negroes in some of the Southern States . The particular case arose out of that peculiar System under which , in lieu of the ordinary form of punishment for a criminal offence , by fine or imprisonment , the offender is virtually placed in a state of peonage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surety for a negro condemned to pay a fine for some petty offence , the negro contracting to reimburse the planter by a long term of service , the breaking of this contract being itself treated as a crime and subjecting him to fresh arrest and punishment . Justice Day , in handing down the opinion of the Court , drew a clear distinction between the " involuntary servitude " imposed by the State as " a punishment for crime " which is contemplated in the Thirteenth Amendment , and this kind of involuntary servitude of which the duration and character are practically beyond the State 's control . " This system , " says the Court , " is in violation of rights intended to be secured by the Thirteenth Amendment , " and of laws enacted by Congress in pursuance of that amendment . There is , moreover , in this matter , no reason why any intelligent Southerner should desire to countenance an evasion of the Constitution . Quite apart from any question of right , the thing is sordid , barbarous , and demoralizing . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week in Ohio , might be supposed to emphasize the parent-andchild relation between the commission and the city-manager forms . If it has done so , it is in no filial way . There was more than a hint in its three days ' session that the city manager was often a product of inherent defects in the older plan . It was shown that in six months , April to November , the number of city managers in the United States has increased from 13 to 22 ; and that in many cases the office was created by cities previously under a commission . The trouble was the failure of the commissioners to cooperate , and the inability of the city to get centralized administration and responsibility out of a five-member or seven-member board . Thus Houston , Texas , has recently made the Mayor a virtual city manager , vastly increasing his powers at the expense of the city commissioners . The dissatisfaction of Cadillac , Mich. , with a jangling board recently led , as the city manager explained , to the board 's recall . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extreme terms by the director of the Texas Bureau of Municipal Reference and Research , who concludes that " the superiority of the city-manager plan " over the commission form must be as quickly recognized as was the latter 's superiority " over the old mayor and council form . " Evidently , cities contemplating the first innovation should look before they leap to see whether the second is not involved in it . Summing up the most salient results of an extensive tabulation of suicide statistics for 100 American cities , in the New York insurance journal , the Spectator , Frederick L. Hoffman says that the maximum rate per 100,000 inhabitants was reached in 1908 , since which time there has been a steady decline each year . The rate for 1913 , which was 18.7 , is the lowest since 1903 , with the exception of the year 1906 . As one is accustomed to think of the suicide rate as increasing , the world over , this is a welcome showing . When Mr. Hoffman proceeds to draw a conclusion from it in regard to general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his basis warrants : A diminishing suicide rate may be safely assumed to reflect in a general way an im-provement in the social and economic condi-tion of the country , and in this respect the evidence available is quite conclusive that one of widely diffused things upon which alone , so far as specific data are concerned , he relied for confirmation of his sweepnig conclusion that mankind has made no moral progress since the days of the pyramid-builders . President Hadley 's " less obvious , but more fundamental " objection to the suggestion of an additional college at Yale is , we fear , reactionary . " We want , " he asserts , " a more intellectual atmosphere among the students as an immediate essential for making Yale what it should be . " And again : " We are not offered anything " in the new plan " that will give intellectual stimulus . " It will strike persons of progressive leanings that President Hadley is a bit fond of the word " intellectual . " Even a university , of course , will not be injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our colleges , perhaps , might be able to stand more of this element . But upon the attitude of others , we fear , President Hadley 's " intellectual stimulus " would have very much the effect of the introduction of a foreign substance in the eye . There is one standpoint from whiCh his policy is defensible . We have too little respect for relics in this country .. Progress means with us , not only proceeding , but also obliterating the past as we proceed . For the sake of the museums of the future , any university with an " intellectual atmosphere " ought to be preserved . Of course , if it can be preserved alive , as President Hadley is so hopeful as to think , by all means let this be done . South America was no doubt badly hit by the war . Scattered items have been published , such as the fact that 14,000,000 of Brazil 's 17,000,000 bags of coffee must be stored at home A comprehensive statement that came last week from Argentina in President de la Plaza 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , the financial storm can easily be weathered . The estimated deficit is nearly 27,000,00 pesos . This can be taken care of by careful economy . New offices created last year will not be filled ; all public works not urgent will be postponed . A special commission has for some time been studying administration in Argentina , and its work can be utilized . The fact that the republic has a large income from state industries , railways , and leased lands decreases the . mportance of customs duties in the budget .. As the total yearly expenditure of Argentina has been about 420,000,000 pesos , a saving of 30,000,000 would be equal to one of nearly $50,000,000 in the United States .
