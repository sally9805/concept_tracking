How much of a " mandate " will the Democrats have behind them for tariff reform ? Doubtless a great deal will be made in protection quarters of the fact that both Roosevelt and Taft stood for high protection , and that if we added their votes in every State , leaving Wilson 's as it stands , Wilson would be found badly beaten . But , apart from the fundamental unsoundness of any such might-have-been calculations , there are two circumstances that destroy this contention as related to the tariff question . In the first place , the great bulk of the Roosevelt vote was given to him without any reference to the tariff issue ; it was a " We Want Teddy " vote , Teddy being wanted by his followers either because he was personally their idol or because he stood for the distinctive programme of the new party=the " social justice " programme . Thus Jane Addams expressly stated that she espoused Roosevelt 's cause in spite of her intense opposition to protectionism . And in the second place , whatever may bp said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " mandate " of 1910 . It was on the tariff issue that the Republican Party was then overwhelmed , and everything that happened between the Congressional elections of 1910 and the Presidential election the other day only confirmed the showing then made of the state of the public mind on the subject . permanent , the provisional term Insurgent gave way to the almost official name Progressive . To the five survivors of the original Progressive Senators ? Bristow , Clapp , Cummins , La Follette , and Nelson  --  there have been added three others , Gronna , Poindexter , and Works . But of these eight men , only two ? Clapp and Poindexter  --  are Roosevelt men Now that the Progressive name has become so closely associated with the fortunes of the Colonel , what will Mr. La Follette do , or Mr. Nelson , or Mr. Works ? Will they retain a label which morally is theirs but in practice would stamp them as followers of one they decidedly do not love ? Or are we to have something like a four-party system in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and National Progressives ? A marked feature of the election was the widespread embarrassment caused by the " big " ballot . Voters from the Atlantic to the Pacific were confused and impeded in the registration of their choice by ballots both unwieldy and puzzling . In Pennsylvania eleven party tickets helped to swell the ballot to proportions which gorged the boxes long before the polls closed . Mayor Blankenburg of Philadelphia , who voted about midday , was forced to " stuff " the box by the judicious used of a poker . In Chicago , the ballot was said to be the largest ever voted anywhere . In the State of Washington the official paper measured no less than thirty by forty inches ; and the fact that thirty-eight measures were presented for the ratification of the people of Oregon , in addition to the names of national , State , and local candidates , necessitated a huge ballot in that commonwealth also . Indeed , it was but n slight exaggeration for one of our Chicago contemporaries to remark that the problem of the voter was - to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The evils of such a condition are manifest . There is ground for hope , however , that the extent of the annoyance this year may prove an ef ? fective argument for the short ballot in the future . ' Of the made the campaign of Armageddon , it is difficult to say which has proved the more complete failure . He- declared for Woman suffrage , and five of the six snf ? frage States refused to follow his ban- ner . His cool throwing over of ? the Southern eoloTed-delegates was an , act of deliberat- Calculation , and that calculation has been absolutely falsified . Hardly so much as the faintest echo to his bid for Southern white support was heard from any quarter during the campaign ; and the figures of the election confirm the - tale of- flat failure . Is it not ' qiiite possible , too , that both the sudden access of fervor in the woman-suffrage cause and the hasty adoption of a policy to-Wards- the negroes which was in diametrical contrast with his actions while President , hurt the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands in his sincerity ? A professor of - history has - doubtless as milaa right-as , anybody else to state just what would have happened- in an election if things had been other " than as they were ; and Prof. Albert Bushnell Hart , in a long and elaborate letter in the New York Times , makes abundant use of that privilege . His hipubratiOns , however , are alaiagtrniiircliilify- inno-cent ; and he furtherrelleve 'S us of any impulse We might neVerthereas-haVe telt to analyze ' his speculations r. into - what would have happened . ' , 133iniaking a ridiculous blunder as to , what actually did happen . He- 1 , yr.s ' great stress on ' the S matter of the Southern vote , which " the name Republican repels " ; and this is what he says about the figures of that vote : - The scanty returns show Roosevelt votes in every ' powtilei'n State , - iyit4 a total ? of between 5.00,500 and , 13 accapp js a sPiaildid start in thc South , but , the greatei part of that ' cote ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ? / i ? ' ? Now , taking the returns as given-bY Professor Hart himself in the table appended to his letter , the total Roosevqlt vote in the eleven Southern States was not " between 500,000 and 600,000 , r lint just 271,006 ; . and- , the- , aggregate- of the votes for Taft and Roosevelt together in these States Wa-s 4'i , 000 . But this is not the-worst of- it ;  - -  for , - so far-from befull burden of the repellent name Republican on him , polled 504,000 votes in these same States , or 31,000 more than Roosevelt and Taft together polled this year . So gross a blunder  --  due to no mere arithmetical slip , for Mr. Hart simply did not think it necessary to look up the figures of 1908 in order to assert that the figures of 1912 were something new and wonderful  --  ought to suffice for one exhibition by a professor of history ; but Professor Hart gives us a delightful logical error for good measure . He asserts that the figures of the election show that the Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " Texas , with 38,000 to 36,000 . " The decision of the Committee on Credentials , he says , " has been ' recalled ' by the voters . " We have no desire to go into the facts of the case ; but it would be interesting to know by what newly invented mental process Mr Hart is able to regard the 38,000 Texas votes for the Progressive candidate in November as having been Republican votes in June , in the face of his own statement that " the greater part " of those who voted for Roosevelt in the South last Tuesday are men whom " the name Republican repels " and whose votes " can not be had for the Republican party . " This is unquestionably , and in some sense preeminently , an age of discussion . The multitude reached by the printed word is incomparably greater than that which , in any previous age of the world , was seriously addressed by the exponents of varying views on the great questions of the time . Equally striking is the range of topics which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , there is an enormous mass of problems occupying the attention of specialists in the various sciences ; and on the other hand , in the domain of politics , of ethics , of economics , of social customs and ideals , of human interests generally , old-established convictions and traditions are constantly challenged in the forum of general popular discussion . And finally , the instrumentalities of discussion have been multiplied - with almost . bewildering rapidity . Congresses , conventions , conferences , societies , " academies , " clubs , organizations of every conceivable nature , and dealing with every conceivable in-terest , abound in a degree that a few decades ago was wholly unknown . In. spite of this vast extension of the function of discussion in our modern life  --  perhaps indeed because of it  --  there is one important aspect of discussion in which we seemed to have retrograded rather than progressed . It must often impress the lover of keen and solid debate that , in the very places where this might most be looked for , we find it almost wholly absent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidential campaign just closed : it furnished no such crop of genuine debate , debate with backbone , as the older political contests of our country used to supply . The combatants seldom came to grapples , and when they did the discussion was confined to the very largest outlines of their respective positions . One can hardly help feeling , in this and in other instances , that with the spreading out of the field , the enlargement of the audience , and the multiplication of the quantity of argumentative matter fed to the public , there has gone a certain softening of the metal , a certain blunting of the edge , of the sword of debate . The programme of the annual meeting of the American Economic Association , to be held in Boston December 27 to 31 , is of exceptional interest . This is owing not to the mere timeliness of the subjects , for this may well be an objection rather than a recommendation in the case of a body which should be regarded as primarily scientific ; but the topics to be discussed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them of such character as to demand for their proper treatment the resources of minds thoroughly trained in the methods of economic thought . The four main subjects are " The Minimum Wage , " " The Rising Cost of Living , " " Banking Reform , " and " Economics of Governmental Price Regulation . " We would suggest to the management of the Association that special arrangements be made to obtain such means of reporting the meetings as will encourage the publication by the daily press of fairly adequate accounts of the papers and discussions ; full reports are of course printed in the Proceedings of the Association some months later , but these do not reach the general public . We notewith interest the statement , in the announcement , that " it is the aim to give less than the usual time to the reading of formal papers and more time to discussion . " Signs of a rush for the cyclone cellar are still exasperatingly absent . During the campaign , this strange insensitiveness in the presence of great peril might have been ascribed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great business men of the country that , in spite of all signs to the contrary , the nation would at the last moment rally to the defence of that protective system on which its prosperity has been built . But there is n.e longer any way out of the conclusion that the business world is simply deaf , dumb , and blind . With the Democrats actually sweeping not only the Presidency and the House , but  --  what few thought possible up co a very little while ago  --  also the Senate , ruin stares the country squarely in the face , and yet the business world goes on smiling as if nothing had happened . It is not content even with a besotted silence on the situation ; here is a group of financiers and business men of national prominence meeting in Philadelphia and talking of the prospect of brilliantly good times before the country . One of the most regrettable of Mr. Taft 's preelection acts was his coming out in favor of the Militia Pay bill , just two or three days before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance to this measure , which is , on its face , one of the most dangerous that have been . before Con-gress in many a year . Ever since the foundation of our government the mi-litia service of the country has been per-formed by volunteers , who are unpaid except when actually in camp or in the field . This bill provides payment for every drill participated in by a militia-man in the armories , at the rate of from fifty cents per man upward . Now , it can not be maintained that this is nec-essary because of a failure to obtain good and sufficient recruits for the Guard . It has always been possible to enough for regiments which administered . In New York State , for instance , we have seen within a year the organization of three new cavalry and artillery regiments , while the colored people are begging for the opportunity to form still another . It is estimated that the bill will cost the Government eight million dollars to begin with . This is probably just about as trustworthy a guess as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills . If the history of our Government shows anything , it is that this eight millions will rapidly be doubled and trebled ; it would be a false step that , once taken , could not be retraced , and it would lead to one raid after another upon the Treasury . Another world 's record is brought to the attention of a proud and happy nation by the secretary of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce , who writes You no doubt will be interested in knowing that Go-v . Joseph M Brown has just measured an acre in his Cherokee County farm , which produced 158 bushels of corn This breaks the world 's record for corn raised by a Governor . The new world 's record is duly noted and accepted . It immediately takes its place beside the recently established world 's record for the highest altitude ever attained by a Hard-shell Baptist minister in a one-hundred-horsepower Bleriot monoplane , Hying between 2 and 4 P. M. in a non-mountainous country ; the world 's record for the quickest time ever made by a one-legged Irish newsboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weehawken , and other similar world 's records which cause the breast of every true American to swell with pride . As a people , we suppose ourselves to be liberally endowed with the sense of humor . An important contribution to the psychology of salesmanship has just been made in a trial in London . An art adviser and an art collector , both well known , combined their forces for the purpose of making a concerted attack upon American millionaires . The attack was so far successful in one case as to result in the sale of several hundred thousand dollars ' worth of pictures . The commissions upon this amount would be quite attractive , and the plaintiff sued to get them . During the cross-examination of the defendant the following colloquy occurred : When you offered Mr. Temple only $10 , - 000 , was it so that you might get another bit for yourself ? No , not at all . It was because I had discovered his incapacity and unworthiness . The fact remains that , having discovered his incapacity and unworthiness , you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not for selling Then his unworthiness did not affect him as a buyer 9 No I held and hold to-day the impression that his " highfalutin " manner and habit of flattering people to the top of their bent has a disturbing effect , and is not calculated to inspire a buyer to buy . But it is calculated to inspire a seller to sell ' Yes Mr. Temple is a past master in that Our correspondence schools in the science of salesmanship should not Overlook this " tip " from a country whose business methods we are too apt to undervalue . The report of the Royal Commission . on Divorce recommends marked liberalizing of the existing laws . In the present conspicuous position of questions of women 's rights in general , the recommendation that husband and wife be placed upon an absolutely equal footing is naturally raised to prominence in the newspaper headlines ; but this measure is only one of several changes of the highest importance recommended by the Commission . On the question of equality there seems to have been complete unanimity in the Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of enlarging the grounds for divorce , a minority of three is recorded in opposition to the majority of nine . If the recommendations of the majority shall be embodied in law , divorce will hereafter be obtainable in England on five grounds other than adultery  --  wilful desertion for three years and upward , cruelty , incurable insanity after five years ' confinement , habitual drunkenness found incurable after three years , and imprisonment under a commuted death sentence . In this country there will be few to doubt the wisdom of these provisions for relief from the marriage tie when it entails cruel and needless hardship . The term Holy War , when used of the Mohammedan world , still connotes something awful and menacing to the Western imagination . In the last half-dozen years the Holy War , in connection with that other indefinite thing , Pan-Islamism , has been spoken of as a possible event which the European nations must guard themselves against . But there have been Holy Wars in Mohammedancountries in this period , and they have shown no apparent difference in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French in the name of the Prophet . The Turks in Tripoli gave to their fight against Italy a religious cast . But the French and the Italians have made their way just as if it were an every-day , secular war they were engaged in . A Holy War is no more effective than any other kind of war if there are no men and guns to fight it with . In Morocco , in Tripoli , Persia , and now in Turkey , the Mohammedan world has come into conflict with European ambitions and has had to give way . The only thing the proclamation of a Holy War can lead to is the massacre of Christians . But experience has shown again and again that massacre , whether in Turkey or in Russia , has been brought about by orders from above . We doubt whether the Ottoman Government will run the risk of utter destruction by instigating slaughter which can do nothing to change the fortunes of the present war . In French military circles much comfort is taken over one supposed lesson of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turkish army was for years under the expert guidance of a German officer of high rank , and that the Turkish fortifications were erected under German supervision , is regarded in Paris as disastrous to the legend of German invincibility . In addition , there is the fact that the Bulgarian forces have been equipped with the same type of artillery that has been lately introduced in the French army , and have amply demonstrated its effectiveness . But it seems that the Balkans have repeated the lesson of Manchuria ; the chances of war can not be forecast by the mere weighing of population masses . Preparation , courage , dash , will enable a nation to defeat one twice it 's size . To that extent France , with her forty millions , need not lose heart at the thought of Germany 's sixty-odd millions . But it is absurd to imagine that the parallel between Germany on the one hand and Russia or Turkey on the other can go any further . There are some who maintain that the famous German military discipline has gone stale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as vigorous as it ever has been .
