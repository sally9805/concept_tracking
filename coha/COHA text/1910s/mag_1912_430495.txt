I THE other day a clergyman who de scribed himself as a preacher of th gospel of Christ wrote , asking me to com and talk to his people on the gospel of na ture . The request set me to thinkin whether or not nature has any gospel i the sense the clergyman had in mind , an message that is likely to be specially corn forting to the average orthodox religiou person . I suppose the parson wished m to tell his flock what I had found in na ture that was a strength or a solace to my self . What had all my many years of jour neyings to nature yielded me that woul supplement or reinforce the gospel he wa preaching ? Had the birds taught me an valuable lessons ? Had the four-foote beasts ? Had the insects ? Had the flow ers , the trees , the soil , the coming and th going of the seasons ? Had I really foun sermons in stones and books in runnin brooks and good in everything ? Had th lilies of the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more royally clad tha Solomon in all his glory , helped me in an way to clothe myself with humility , wit justice , with truthfulness ? It is not easy for one to say just wha he owes to all these things . Natural in fluences work indirectly as well as di rectly ; they work upon the subconscious , as well as upon the conscious , self . That I am a saner , healthier , more contented man , with truer standards of life , for all my loiterings in the fields and woods , I am fully convinced . That I am less social , less interested in my neighbors and in the body politic , more inclined to shirk civic and social responsibilities and to stop my ears against the brawling of the reformers , is perhaps equally true . One thing is certain , in a hygienic way I owe much to my excursions to nature . They have helped to clothe me with health , if not with humility ; they have helped sharpen and attune all my senses ; they have kept my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for one moment during all the seventy-five years I have had them ; they have made my sense of smell so keen that I have much pleasure in the wild , open-air perfumes , especially in the spring ? the delicate breath of the blooming elms and maples and willows , the breath of the woods , of the pastures , of the shore . This keen , healthy sense of smell has made me abhor tobacco and flee from close rooms , and put the stench of cities behind me . I fancy that this whole world of wild , natural perfumes is lost to the tobacco-user and to the city-dweller . Senses trained in the open air are in tune  | with open-air objects ; they are quick , deli cate , and discriminating . When I go to town , my ear suffers as well as my nose the impact of the city upon my senses i hard and dissonant ; the ear is stunned , the nose is outraged , and the eye is confused When I come back , I go to nature to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tune once more . I know that , as a rule , country or farming folk are not re markable for the delicacy of their senses but this is owing mainly to the benumbing and brutalizing effect of continued hard labor . It is their minds more than their bodies that suffer . When I have dwelt in cities the country was always near by , and I used to get a bite of country soil at least once a week to keep my system normal . Emerson says that " the day does not seem wholly profane in which we have given heed to some natural object . " If Emerson had stopped to qualify his remark , he would have added , if we give heed to it in the right spirit , if we give heed to it as a nature-lover and truthseeker . Nature love as Emerson knew it , and as Wordsworth knew it , and as many of the choicer spirits of our time have known it , has distinctly a religious value . It does not come to a man or a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends . Except ye become in a measure as little children , ye can not enter the kingdom of nature ? as Audubon entered it , as Thoreau entered it , as Bryant and Amiel entered it , and as all those enter it who make it a resource in their lives and an instrument of their culture . The forms and creeds of religion change , but the sentiment of religion ? the wonder and reverence and love we feel in the presence of the inscrutable universe ? persists . Indeed , these seem to be renewing their life to-day in this growing love for all natural objects and in this increasing tenderness toward all forms of life . If we do not go to church so much as did our fathers , we go to the woods much more , and are much more inclined to make a temple of them than they were . We now use the word nature very much as our fathers used the word God , and I suppose that back of all it means the power that is everywhere present and active , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourished . It is a power that we can see and touch and hear , and realize every moment of our lives how absolutely we are dependent upon it . There are no atheists or skeptics in regard to this power . All men see how literally we are its children , and all men learn hqw swift and sure is the penalty of disobedience to its commands . Our associations with nature vulgarize it and rob it of its divinity . When we come to see that the celestial and the terrestrial are one , that time and eternity are one , that mind and matter are one- , that death and life are one , that there is and can be nothing not inherent in nature , then we no longer look for or expect a far-off , unknown God . Nature teaches more than she preaches . There are no sermons in stones . It is easier to get a spark out of a stone than a moral . Even when it contains a fossil , it teaches ? history rather than morals . It comes down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maw of time , and can tell you many things if you have the eye to read them . The soil upon which it lies or in which it is imbedded was rock , too , back in geologic time , but the mill that ground it up passed the fragment of stone through without entirely reducing it . Very likely it is made up of the minute remains of innumerable tiny creatures that lived and died in the ancient seas . Very likely it was torn from its parent rock and brought to the place where it now lies by the great ice-flood that many thousands of years ago crept slowly but irresistibly down out of the North over all the Northern continents . But all this appeals to the intellect , and contains no lesson for the moral nature . If we are to find sermons in stones , we are to look for them in the relations of the ; tones to other things ? when they are out of place , when they press down the grass Dr the flowers , or impede the plow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shelter vermin , as do old institutions and old usages that have had their day . A stone that is much knocked about gets its sharp angles worn off , as do men . " A rolling ; tone gathers no moss , " which is not bad For the stone , as moss hastens decay . ' Killing two birds with one stone " is a Dad saying , because it reminds boys to ; tone the birds , which is bad for both boys Ind birds . But " People who live in glass  | houses should not throw stones " is on the right side of the account , as it discourages stone-throwing and reminds us that we are no better than our neighbors . The lesson in running brooks is that motion is a great purifier and health-producer . When the brook ceases to run , it soon stagnates . It keeps in touch with the great vital currents when it is in motion , and unites with other brooks to help make the river . In motion it soon leaves all mud and sediment behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power have the same effect upon our lives ? The other day in my walk I came upon a sap bucket that had been left standing by the maple-tree all the spring and summer . What a bucketful of corruption was that , a mixture of sap and rain-water that had rotted , and smelled to heaven . Mice and birds and insects had been drowned in it , and added to its unsavory character . It was a bit of nature cut off from the vitalizing and purifying chemistry of the whole . With what satisfaction I emptied it upon the ground while I held my nose , and saw it filter into the turf , where I knew it was dying to go and where I knew every particle of the reeking , fetid fluid would soon be made sweet and wholesome again by the chemistry of the soil ! II I AM not always in sympathy with nature-study as pursued in the schools , as if this kingdom could be carried by assault . Such study is too cold , too special , too mechanical ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul and emotion ; it misses the accessories of the open air and its exhilarations , the sky , the clouds , the landscape , and the currents of life that pulse everywhere . I myself have never made a dead set at studying nature with note-book and fieldglass in hand . I have rather visited with her . We have walked together or sat down together , and our intimacy grows with the seasons . What I have learned about her ways I have learned easily , almost unconsciously , while fishing or camping or idling about . My desultory habit have their disadvantages , no doubt , but they have their advantages also . A too strenuous pursuit defeats itself . In the fields and woods more than anywhere else all things come to those who wait , because all things are on the move , and are sure sooner or later to come your way . To absorb a thing is better than to learn it , and we absorb what we enjoy . We learn things at school , we absorb them in the fields and woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fondness and appreciation she meets us half-way and takes a deeper hold upon us than when studiously conned . Hence I say the way of knowledge of nature is the way of love and enjoyment , and is more surely found in the open air than in the schoolroom or the laboratory . The other day I saw a lot of college girls dissecting cats and making diagrams of the circulation , muscle attachments , etc. , and I thought it pretty poor business unless the girls were taking a course in comparative anatomy with a view to some occupation in life . What is the moral and intellectual value of this kind of knowledge to those girls ? Biology is no doubt a great science in the hands of great men , but it is not for all . I myself have gotten along very well without it . I am sure I can learn more of what I want to know from a kitten on my knee than from the carcass of a cat in the laboratory . Darwin spent eight years dissecting barnacles ; but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these college girls are pretty sure to stop at cats . He dissected and put together again in his mental laboratory the whole system of animal life , and the upshot of his work was a tremendous gain to our understanding of the universe . I would rather see the girls in the fields and woods studying and enjoying living nature , training their eyes to see correctly and their hearts to respond intelligently . What is knowledge without enjoyment , without love ? It is sympathy , appreciation , emotional experience , which refine and elevate and breathe into exact knowledge the breath of life . My own interest is in living nature as it moves and flourishes about me winter and summer . I know it is one thing to go forth as a nature-lover , and quite another to go forth in a spirit of cold , calculating , exact science . I call myself a nature-lover and not a scientific naturalist . All that science has to tell me is welcome , is , indeed , eagerly sought for . I must know as well  | as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's poet , to enjoy what others understand . I must understand , also ; but above all things I must enjoy . How much of my enjoyment springs from my knowledge I do not know . The joy of knowing is very great ; the delight of picking up the threads of meaning here and there , and following them through the maze of confusing facts , I know well . When I hear the woodpecker drumming on a dry limb in spring or the grouse drumming in the woods , and know what it is all for , why , that knowledge , I suppose , is part of my enjoyment . The other part is the associations that those sounds call up as voicing the arrival of spring : they are the drums that lead the joyous procession . To enjoy understandingly , that , I fancy , is the great thing to be desired . When I see the large ichneumon-fly , Thalessa , making a loop over her back with her long ovipositor and drilling a hole in the trunk of a tree , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling for the burrow of a tree-borer , Tremex , upon the larva of which her own young feed . She must survey her territory like an oil-digger and calculate where she is likely to strike oil , which in her case is the burrow of her host Tremex . There is a vast series of facts in natural history like this that are of little interest until we understand them . They are like the outside of a book which may attract us , but which can mean little to us until we have opened and perused its pages . The nature-lover is not looking for mere facts , but for meanings , for something he can translate into the terms of his own life . He wants facts , but significant facts ? luminous facts that throw light upon the ways of animate and inanimate nature . A bird picking up crumbs from my window-sill does not mean much to me . It is a pleasing sight and touches a tender cord , but it does not add much to my knowledge of bird-life . But when I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I now and then do in spring , apparently under violent pressure to get in , I am witnessing a significant comedy in bird-life , one that illustrates the limits of animal instinct . The bird takes its own reflected image in the glass for a hated rival , and is bent on demolishing it . Let the assaulting bird get a glimpse of the inside of the empty room through a broken pane , and it is none the wiser ; it returns to the assault as vigorously as ever . The fossils in the rocks did not mean much to the earlier geologists . They looked upon them as freaks of nature , whims of the creative energy , or vestiges of Noah 's flood . You see they were blinded by the preconceived notions of the six-day theory of creation . III I DO not know that the bird has taught me any valuable lesson . Indeed , I do not go to nature to be taught . I go for enjoyment and companionship . I go to bathe in her as in a sea ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses a free , clean field and to tone up my spirits by her " primal sanities . " If the bird has not preached to me , it has added to the resources of my life , it has widened the field of my interests , it has afforded me another beautiful object to love , and has helped make me feel more at home in this world . To take the birds out of my life were like lopping off so many branches from the tree : there is that less surface of leafage to absorb the sunlight and bring my spirits in contact with the vital currents . We can not pursue any natural study with love and enthusiasm without the object of it becoming a part of our lives . The birds , the flowers , the trees , the rocks , all become linked with our lives and hold the key to our thoughts and emotions . Not till the bird becomes a part of your life can its coming and its going mean much to you . And it becomes a part of your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection , when you have established associations with it , when it voices the spring or the summer to you , when it calls up the spirit of the woods or the fields or the shore . When year after year you have heard the veery in the beech and birch woods along the trout streams , or the wood-thrush May after May in the groves where you have walked or sat , and the bobolink summer after summer ' in the home meadows , or the vesper-sparrow in the upland pastures where you have loitered as a boy or mused as a man , these birds will really be woven into the texture of your life .  | What lessons the birds have taught me I can not recall ; what a joy they have been to me I know well . In a new place , amid strange scenes , theirs are the voices and the faces of old friends . In Bermuda the bluebirds and the catbirds and the cardinals seemed to make American territory of it . Our birds had annexed the island despite the Britishers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-poll warbler , perhaps for only a single day , flitting about as I walked or worked . It is usually my first warbler , and my associations with it are very pleasing . But I really did not know how pleasing until one March day , when I was convalescing from a serious illness in one of our sea-coast towns , I chanced to spy the little traveler in a vacant lot along the street , now upon the ground , now upon a bush , nervous and hurried as usual , uttering its sharp chip , and showing the white in its tail . The sight gave me a real home feeling . It did me more good than the medicine I was taking . It instantly made a living link with many past springs . Anything that calls up a happy past , how it warms the present ! There , too , that same day I saw my first meadowlark of the season in a vacant lot , flashing out the white quills in her tail , and walking over the turf in the old , erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter from home , and better : it had a flavor of the wild and of my boyhood days on the old farm that no letter could ever have . The spring birds always awaken a thrill wherever I am . The first bobolink I hear flying over northward and bursting out in song now and then , full of anticipation o those broad meadows where he will soon be with his mate ; or the first swallow twittering joyously overhead , borne on a warm southern breeze ; or the first high hole sounding out his long , iterated cal from the orchard or field ? how all thes things send a wave of emotion over me ! A pleasure of another kind is to see new bird or a new bird in an old place as I did recently in the old sugar-bus where I used to help gather and boil sa as a boy . It was the log-cock , or pileate woodpecker , a rare bird anywhere , an one I had never seen before on the ol farm . I heard his loud cackle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branc for a few moments , and then launch ou and fly toward a distant wood . But he left an impression with me that I should be sorry to have missed . Nature stimulates our esthetic and our intellectual life and to a certain extent our religious emotions , but I fear we can not find much support for our ethical system in the ways of wild nature . I know my friend Thompson-Seton claims to find what we may call the biological value of the Ten Commandments in the lives of the wild animals ; but I can not make his reasoning hold water , at least not much of it . Of course the Ten Commandments are not arbitrary laws . They are largely founded upon the needs of the social organism ; but whether they have the same foundation in the needs of animal life apart from man , apart from the world of moral obligation , is another question . The animals are neither moral nor immoral : they are unmoral ; their needs are all physical . It is true that the command against murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely kill their own kind : hawks do not prey upon hawks , nor foxes prey upon foxes , nor weasels upon weasels ; but lower down this does not hold . Trout eat trout , and pickerel eat pickerel , and among the insects young spiders eat one another , and the female spider eats her mate , if she can get him . There is but little , if any , neighborly love among even the higher animals . They treat one another as rivals , or associate for mutual protection . One cow will lick and comb another in the most affectionate manner , and the next moment savagely gore her . Hate and cruelty for the most part rule in the animal world . A few of the higher animals are monogamous , but by far the greater number of species are polygamous or promiscuous . There is no mating or pairing in the great bovine tribe , and none among the rodents that I know of , or among the bear family , or the cat family , or among the seals . When we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairing for life , as with the ostrich and perhaps the eagle . As for the rights of property among the animals , I do not see how we can know just how far those rights are respected among individuals of the same species . We know that bees will rob bees , and that ants will rob ants ; but whether or not one chipmunk or one flying-squirrel  | or one wood-mouse will plunder the store of another I do not know . Probably not as the owner of such stores is usually on hand to protect it . Moreover , these provi dent little creatures all lay up stores in the autumn , before the season of scarcity sets in , and so have no need to plunde one another . In case the stores of one squirrel were destroyed by some means and it were able to dispossess another o its hoard , would it not in that case be a survival of the fittest , and so conducive to the well-being of the race of squir rels ? I have never known any of our wild birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same kind , but I have known birds to try to carry off the material of other nests . But usually the rule of might is the rule of right among the animals . As to most of the other commandments , ? of coveting , of bearing false witness , of honoring the father and the mother , and so forth , ? how can these apply to the animals or have any biological value to them ? Parental obedience among them is not a very definite thing . There is neither obedience nor disobedience , because there are no commands . The alarm-cries of the parents are quickly understood by the young , and their actions imitated in the presence of danger , all of which of course has a biological value . The instances which Mr. Seton cites of animals fleeing to man for protection from their enemies prove to my mind only how the greater fear drives out the lesser . The hotly pursued animal sees a possible cover in a group of men and horses or in an unoccupied house , and rushes there to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunted deer or sheep will leap from a precipice which , under ordinary circumstances , it would avoid . So would a man . Fear makes bold in such cases . I certainly have found " good in everything , " ? in all natural processes and products , ? not the " good " of the Sundayschool books , but the good of natural law and order , the good of that system of things out of which we came and which is the source of our health and strength . It is good that fire should burn , even if it consumes your house ; it is good that force should crush , even if it crushes you ; it is good that rain should fall , even if it destroys your crops or floods your land . Plagues and pestilences attest the constancy of natural law . They set us to cleaning our streets and houses and to readjusting our relations to outward nature . Only in a live universe could disease and death prevail . Death is a phase of life , a redistributing of the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in everything , because law in everything , truth in everything , the sequence of cause and effect in everything , and it may all be good to me if , on the right principles , I relate my life to it . I can make the heat and the cold serve me , the winds and the floods , gravity and all the chemical and dynamical forces , serve me , if I take hold of them by the right handle . The bad in things arises from our abuse or misuse of them or from our wrong relations to them . A thing is good or bad according as it stands related to my constitution . We say the order of nature is rational ; but is it not because our reason is the outcome of that order ? Our well-being consists in learning it and in adjusting our lives to it . When we cross it or seek to contravene it , we are destroved . But nature in her universal procedures is not rational , as I am rational when I weed my garden , prune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or arm myself with tools or weapons . In such matters I take a short cut to that which nature reaches by a slow , roundabout , and wasteful process . How does she weed her garden ? By the survival of the fittest . How does she select her breeding-stock ? By the law of battle ; the strongest rules . Hers , I repeat , is a slow and wasteful process . She fertilizes the soil by plowing in the crop . She can not take a short cut . She assorts and arranges her goods by the law of the winds and the tides . She builds up with one hand and pulls down with the other . Man changes the conditions to suit the things . Nature changes the things to suit the conditions . She adapts the plant or the animal to its environment . She does not drain hor marshes ; she fills them up . Hers is the larger reason ? the reason of the All . Man 's reason introduces a new method ; it cuts across , modifies , or abridges the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature in the old teleological sense ; but I see everything  | working to its own proper end , and that end is foretold in the means . Things are not designed ; things are begotten . It is as if the final plan of a man 's house , after he had begun to build it , should be determined by the winds and the rains and the shape of the ground upon which it stands . The eye is begotten by those vibrations in the ether called light , the ear by those vibrations in the air called sound , the sense of smell by those emanations called odors . There are probably other vibrations and emanations that we have no senses for because our well-being does not demand them . We think it reasonable that a stone should fall and that smoke should rise because we have never known either of them to do the contrary . We think it reasonable that fire should burn and that frost should freeze , because this accords with universal experience . Thus , there is a large order of facts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always follows the same cause . Our reason is developed and disciplined by observing the order of nature ; and yet human rationality is of another order from the rationality of nature . Man learns from nature how to master and control her . He turns her currents into new channels ; he spurs her in directions of his own . Nature has no economic or scientific rationality . She progresses by the method of trial and error . Her advance is symbolized by that of the child learning to walk . She experiments endlessly . Evolution has worked all around the horizon . In feeling her way to man she has produced thousands of other forms of life . The globe is peopled as it is because the creative energy was blind and did not at once find the single straight road to man . Had the law of variation worked only in one direction , man might have found himself the sole occupant of the universe . Behold the varieties of trees , of shrubs , of grasses , of birds , of insects , because nature does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one particular end . She scatters , she sows her seed upon the wind , she commits her germs to the waves and the floods . Nature is indifferent to waste , because what goes out of one pocket goes into another . She is indifferent to failure , because failure on one line means success on some other . Iv BuT I am not preaching much of a gospel , am I ? Only the gospel of contentment , of appreciation , of heeding simple near-by things ? a gospel the burden of which still is love , but love that goes hand in hand with understanding . There is so much in nature that is lovely and lovable , and so much that gives us pause . But here it is , and here we are , and we must make the most of it . If the ways of the Eternal as revealed in His works are past finding out , we must still unflinchingly face what our reason reveals to us . " Red in tooth and claw . " Nature does not preach ; she enforces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yea , or nay , nay . Of the virtues and beatitudes of which the gospel of Christ makes so much ? meekness , forgiveness , self-denial , charity , love , holiness ? she knows nothing . Put yourself in her way , and she crushes you ; she burns you , freezes you , stings you , bites you , or devours you . Yet I would not say that the study of nature did not favor meekness or sobriety or gentleness or forgiveness or charity , because the great nature-students and prophets , like Darwin , would rise up and confound me . Certainly it favors seriousness , truthfulness , and simplicity of life ; or , are only the serious and single-minded drawn to the study of nature ? I doubt very much if it favors devoutness or holiness , as those qualities are inculcated by the church , or any form of religious enthusiasm . Devoutness and holiness come of an attitude toward the universe that is in many ways incompatible with that implied by the pursuit of natural science . The joy of the nature-student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out the reason of things and the meaning of things , to trace the footsteps of the creative energy ; while the religious devotee is intent only upon losing himself in infinite being . True , there have been devout naturalists and men of science ; but their devoutness did not date from their naturestudies , but from their training , or from the times in which they lived . Theology and science , it must be said , will not mingle much better than oil and water , and your devout scientist or devout naturestudent lives in two separate compartments of his being at different times . In- tercourse with nature ? I mean intellectual intercourse , not merely the emotional intercourse of the sailor or explorer or farmer ? tends to beget a habit of mind the farthest possible removed from the myth-making , the vision-seeing , the voicehearing habit and temper . In all matters relating to the visible concrete universe it substitutes broad daylight for twilight ; it supplants fear with curiosity ; it overthrows superstition with fact ; it blights credulity with the frost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skepticism is a much more healthful and robust habit of mind than the limp , paleblooded , non-resisting habit that we call credulity . In intercourse with nature you are dealing with things at first hand , and you get a rule , a standard , that serves you through life . You are dealing with primal sanities , primal honesties , primal attraction ; you are touching at least the hem of the garment with which the infinite is clothed , and virtue goes out from it to you . It must be added that you are dealing with primal cruelty , primal blindness , primal wastefulness , also . Nature works with reference to no measure of time , no bounds of space , and no limits of material . Her economies are not our economies . She is prodigal , she is careless , she is indifferent ; yet nothing is lost . What she lavishes with one hand , she gathers in with the other . She is blind , yet she hits the mark because she shoots in all direcLions . Her germs fill the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you think you have defeated her , your triumph is hers ; it is still by her laws that you reach your end . ' We make ready our garden in a season , and plant our seeds and hoe our crops by some sort of system . Can any one tell how many hundreds of millions of years nature has been making ready her garden and planting her seeds ? There can be little doubt , I think , but that intercourse with nature and a knowledge of her ways tends to simplicity ' of life . We come more and more to see through the follies and vanities of the world and to appreciate the real values . We load ourselves up with so many false burdens , our complex civilization breeds in us so many false or artificial wants , that we become separated from the real sources of our strength and health as by a gulf . For my part , as I grow older I am more and more inclined to reduce my baggage , to lop off superfluities . I become more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small house , a hut in the woods , a tent on the shore . The show and splendor of great houses , elaborate furnishings , stately halls , oppress me , impose upon me .

A man needs a good roof over his head winter and summer , and a good chimney and a big woodpile in winter . The more open his four walls are , the more fresh air he will get , and the longer he will live . How the contemplation of nature as a whole does take the conceit out of us ! How we dwindle to mere specks and our little lives to the span of a moment in the presence of the cosmic bodies and the interstellar spaces ! How we hurry ! How we husband our time . - A year , a month , a day , an hour may mean so much to us . Behold the infinite- leisure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what matters it to the Eternal ? Jupiter and Saturn must be billions of years older than the earth . They are evidently yet passing through that condition of cloud and vapor and heat that the earth passed through untold eons ago , and they will not reach the stage of life till eons to come . But what matters it ? Only man hurries . Only the Eternal has infinite time . When life-comes to Jupiter , the earth will doubtless long have been a dead world . It may continue a-dead world for eons longer before it is melted up in the eternal crucible and recast , and set on its career of life again . v I was struck by this passage in one of the recently published letters of SaintGaudens : " The principal thought in my life is that we are on a planet going no one knows where , probably to something higher ( on the Darwinian principle of evolution ) ; that , whatever it is , the passage is terribly sad and tragic , and to bear up at times against what seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice  | of love , charity , and courage are the great things . " The " Great Power " that is over us does seem unmindful of us as individuals , if it does not seem positively against us , as Saint-Gaudens seemed to think it was . Surely the ways of : the Eternal are not as our ways . Our standards of prudence , of economy , of usefulness , of waste , of delay , of failure ? how far off they seem from the scale upon which the universe is managed or deports itself ! If the earth should be blown to pieces to-day , and all life instantly blotted out , would it not be just like what we know of the cosmic prodigality and indifference ? Such appalling disregard of all human motives and ends bewilders us . Of all the planets of our system probably only two or three are in a condition to sustain life .

Some force which no adjective can describe or qualify blew it into fragments , and there , in its stead , is this swarm of huge rocks making their useless rounds in the light of the sun forever and ever . What matters it ? Who cares ? Bodies larger than our sun collide in the depths of space before our eyes with results so terrific that words can not even hint them . The last of these collisions ? of this " wreck of matter and crush of worlds " ? that has reported itself to our planet occurred in February , 1901 , when a star of the twelfth magnitude suddenly blazed out as a star of the first magnitude and then slowly faded . It was the grand finale of the independent existence of two enormous celestial bodies . They apparently ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siderial space , blown by the winds upon which suns and systems drift as autumn leaves . It would be quite in keeping with the observed ways of the Eternal , if these bodies had had worlds in their train , teeming with life , which met the same fate as the central colliding bodies . Does not force as we know it in this world go its own way with the same disregard to the precious thing we call life ? Such long and patient preparations for it , ? apparently the whole stellar system in labor pains to bring it forth , ? and yet held so cheaply and indifferently in the end ! The small insect that just now alighted in front of my jack-plane as I was dressing a timber , and was reduced to a faint yellow stain upon the wood , is typical of the fate of man before the unregarding and unswerving terrestrial and celestial forces . The great wheels go around just the same whether they are crushing the man or crushing the corn for his bread . It is all one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are for us or against us indifferently . And yet the earth is here garlanded with the seasons and riding in the celestial currents like a ship in calm summer seas , and man is here with all things under his feet . All is well in our corner of the universe . The great mill has made meal of our grist and not of the miller . We have taken our chances and have won . More has been for us than against us . During the little segment of time that man has been upon the earth , only one great calamity that might be called cosmical has befallen it . The ice age of one , or two hundred thousand years was such a calamity . But man survived it . The spring came again , and life , the traveler , picked itself up and made a new start . But if he had not survived it , if nothing had survived it , the great procession would have gone on just the same ; the gods would have been just as well pleased . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleet . This is the order of nature . No matter for the rest , for the weak , the slow , the unlucky , so that the fight is won , so that the race of man continues . You and I may fail and fall before our time ; the end may be a tragedy or a comedy . Who cares ? Only some one must succeed , will succeed . We are here , I say , because , in the conflict of forces , the influences that made for life have been in the ascendant . This conflict of forces has been a part of the process of our development . We have been ground out as between an upper and a nether millstone , but we have squeezed through , we have actually arrived , and are all the better for the grinding ? all those who have survived . But , alas ! for  | those whose lives went out in the crush ! Maybe they often broke the force of the blow for us . Nature is not benevolent ; nature is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes no exceptions , never ternpers her decrees with mercy , or winks at any infringement of her laws . And in the end is not this best ? Could the universe be run as a charity or a benevolent institution , or as a poorhouse of the most approved pattern ? Without this merciless justice , this irrefragible law , where would we have brought up long ago ? It is a hard gospel ; but rocks are hard , too , yet they form the foundations of the hills . Man introduces benevolence , mercy , altruism , into the world , and he pays the price in his added burdens ; and he reaps his reward in the vast social and civic organizations that were impossible without these things . I have no doubt that the life of man upon this planet will end , as all other forms of life will end . But the potential man will continue and does continue on other spheres . One can not think of one part of the universe as producing man , and no other part as capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as its material constituents are concerned , that we know . Can there be any doubt that it is all of a piece so far as its invisible and intangible forces and capabilities are concerned ? Can we believe that the earth is an alien and a stranger in the universe ; that it has no near kin ; that there is no tie of blood , so to speak , between it and the other planets and systems ? Are the planets not all of one family , sitting around the same central source of warmth and life ? And is not our system a member of a still larger family or tribe , and it of a still larger , all bound together by ties of consanguinity ? Size is nothing , space is nothing . The worlds are only red corpuscles in the arteries of the infinite . If man has not yet appeared on the other planets , he will in time appear , and when he has disappeared from this globe , he will still continue elsewhere . I do not say that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical , I think , to expect a still higher form . Man has been man but a little while comparatively , less than one hour of the twenty-four of the vast geologic day ; a few hours more and he will be gone ; less than another geologic day like the past , and no doubt all life from the earth will be gone . What then ? The game will be played over and over again in other worlds , without approaching any nearer the final end than we are now . There is no final end , as there was no absolute beginning , and can be none with the infinite .  |
