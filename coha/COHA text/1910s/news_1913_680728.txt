txt Football at Polo Grounds . In conneotion with the recent decision to play the Army and Navy football game at the Polo Grounds , in this city , I believe it would be an excellent move for all concerned if all the large football games could be played here . There Is no other point so centrally located and so available from a railroad Point of view . For example , if the YalePrinceton and Yale-Harvard games were Played here , Instead of the traveling public being compelled to use only one road to get to the game , they could use the Pennsylvania , New Haven , New York Central , Reading , Long Island , Lehigh Valley , Central Railroad of New Jersey , Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western , West Shore , &c.; This , to my mind , would greatly minimize the danger to the public in handling the large crowds which attend these games each year , and would naturally do away with a. great deal of the inconvenience and delay which always occur when one road Is called upon to shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the games in question .
