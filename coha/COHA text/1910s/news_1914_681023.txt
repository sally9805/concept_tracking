txt Charles Becker walked out of Sing Sing Prison shortly before 5 o'clock Yesterday afternoon and two hours later was locked up in the Tombs to await a. second trial for the murder on July 16 , 1912 , of Herman Rosenthal . District Attorney Whitman said positively yesterday that he would move for this second trial either in April or in May . While Becker was preparing to leave Sing Sing the members of the Court of Appeals were signing the death warrants of the four men whom Becker was accused of having instigated to kill Rosenthal . The warrants doom " Lefty Louie , " " Gyp the Blood , " " Whitey Lewis , " and " Dago Frank , " who have been in the death house with Becker for more than a year : to die in the electric chair in the week beginning with April 13 . Only Gov . Glynn can save them now , and no applications for their pardon have yet been made to him . Becker 's departure from Sing Sing- was a sort of triumphal march . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arm with his wife a score of cameras and two moving picture machines were aimed at him by photographers standing on the stone steps a the prison , Becker shoved back his hat and posed with his wife , who was unveiled , for about five minutes , changing his position as often as the camera men desired him to do so . Two Sheriff 's Deputies stood near him , but they did not think it necessary to put handruffs on their prisoner . Prison Waifs Doleful Farewell , With Aire " titereeteriers DepuBes ; WO , counsel , Joseph A. Shay , and his brother , Police Lieut . Jcein Becker , the ' prisoner , and Mrs. Becker entered a sleigh and , with the bets jingling merrily , started off in the pleasant sunshine down the hill to-the railway station . As the sleigh started off a mournful commingling of voices inside the prison was heard . The inmates of the outside cells of the main building could see from their narrow barred windows that Becker was off , and they joined in the deep wail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' yell . " In a second the chorus was taken up by all the prisoners in the building . Next the men from the prison workdhops , who were being led to their cella , Joined in the yell . Before Becker 's sleigh had gone 100 feet practically all of the prisoners , who ' number between 1,400 and 1,500 , were adding their voices to swell the volume of sound . The prisoners ' yell is mournful , piercing , uncanny , a thing to chill the blood . It had not been given at Sing Sing with so much zest since last July , when the prisoners revolted after the incendiary fire which burned the prison mattress factory . On this occasion , however , it was probably , intended as a congratulatory hail and farewell to Becker . At any rate , he interpreted it so , for , turning in the sleigh , he waved his black derby hat at the granite walls . Pictured En Route by the Movies . Six other sleighs started out with Becker 's . Half a length in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode with their machine . They kept the crank turning , with the lens a mean dlbtance of ten feet from Becker 's sleigh , all the way during the Quarter-mile ride to the station . A large part of the village of Ossining had turned out to witness the departure of Sing Sing 's most noted prisoner . A couple of hundred men and women collected in front of the prison , and they waved hats and handkerchiefs at him . Children in colored jerseys and woolen hats had drawn their sleds to one side of the road to look on . " Good luck to you I " was shouted at intervals along the road , and Becker would turn from his conversation with his wife to laugfh and wave his hat . Ossining reflects the general opinion of the Sing Sing keepers. nearly all of whom like Becker because he has " taken his medicine without a word of complaint " during his sixteen months ' imprisonment . - Practically everybody here is glad of the decision of the Court of Appeals , " Warden Clancy explained . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seldom think about their past life or the nature of the crimes they are charged with . Becker is popular , and everybody wishes him luck because he has been a good prisoner . " His Coming and Going ' Contrasted . In the downtown part of Ossining groups of people stood in front of the places of business looking curiously at the procession of sleighs and waved farewells . When Becker came in sight of Hirschfeld 's Hotel , opposite the railway station , a crowd led by the whiteaproned bald-headed bartender greeted him with a , cheer . After Becker had crossed over to the platform for trains bound for New York he and ' his wife posed for more pictures , and some one commented on tile contrast with their conduct when they came to Sing Sing together ireOctober of 1912 . Mrs. Becker then was heavily veiled , Becker wore his hat " pulled down over his face , and both seemed anxious to defeat attempts to photograph them . On that occasion it was only through the intervention or ex-Sheriff Julius Efarburger who was handcuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // BECKER IN TOMBS ; GUNMEN DOOMED // taken . Harburger lifted the prisoner 's hat long enough for a few snapshots . In the train Under Sheriff Frank K. Bowers and Deputy Sheriff Joseph A. Miller permitted Becker to sit beside his wife , who was in mourning for her mother , who had been buried the day before . Under Sheriff Bowers and Mr. Shay sat opposite the prisoner . Becker was In the high spirits which came to him with the news on Tuesday that he had been granted a new trial . He lost his jovial look only when he was being formally posed for photographs . While he waited for a time exposure his expression gradually became very sober . Mrs. Becker seemed happy enough , but she never entirely lost her serious expression . Holds a Levee on the Train . " I am confident that I will soon be a free man , " Becker said . " I am willing to leave my case to District Attorney Whitman . I know that he is a fair man , and if he thinks it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for it .. The only thing that I am anxious about is to have it take place as soon as possible . " If there Is another trial I will take the stand in my own behalf . I wanted to do so at the last trial , but I took the advise of my lawyers and did not . The District Attorney can go all over my past life without asking one question that I am afraid of . " Half the passengers in the train moved to the car in which Becker rode in order to get a ? look at him . Probably the only person on the car who did not know what their crowding in meant was a young woman , who asked when her escort pointed Becker out : " Becker ? Who 's Becker ? " For five minutes after the train start ed the former leader , of the Strong Arm Squad was kept busy shaking hands and replying to congratulations . After nearly all the passengers had seen him , they went to other cars for seats and Becker was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took time , however , to say to some reporters : Does n't Want His Police Job'Back . " There is one thing that I want you to publish , and that is , that I am not going to try to get my job back . 1 do n't want it . I want to get as far away from New York as possible . " Becker had said the day before that he would be a policeman again if the Police Commissioner ' would appoint himwith the promise that he would get the assignment to drive all the gunmen into graves , the river , and Sing Sing . At the 125th Street Station Becker and his guards , accompanied by Mrs. Becker and Mr. Shay , left the train , and the party drove to the Tombs in Sheriff Grifenhagen 's limousine . Thies disappointed a crowd of about 300 which had collected at 6 o'clook at the Grand Central Station . Half a dozen policemen made a path through the crowd for the passengers from the train on which Becker had been riding . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , but many of the others were just as well satisfied , because they pointed out to one another a big man among the passengers who was walking between two friends and said " There goes Becker . " At 6:50 the massive gates of the entrance for vehicles on the Lafayette Street side of the Tombs swung open and the automobile bearing the Becker party shot through . There was a series of explosions of flashlight powders and several cameras snapped the rear of the limousine . The gates were swung shut as soon as the machine was within . Sheriff Lets Him See Broadway . Sheriff Grifenhagen explained that the party had arrived/late because the machine was driven . owly in order to let Becker see a ** of the sights of the town . From the 125th Street station the machine was dr5ven directly over to Broadway , and along Broadway , until it turned on Franklin Street to the Tombs . On his ride down Broadway Becker kept his gaze out the windows , noticing every . change , commenting on the new doubledeck street cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , and other things . Near Times Square he pointed outNa brightly lighted cafe , and said : " Is that place running again ? I raided it a couple of times and put it out of business . ' As they passed Forty  --  third Street Mr. Shay pointed out the huilding which was formerly the Hotel Metropole , in front of which Herman Rosenthal was murdered . " The place closed up a couple of months after Rosenthal was , killed , ' said Mr. Shay . " It started up under another name and had to close again , and has been closed ever since . " Becker offered no comment on that subject . One block further along , though , at the corner of Forty-second Street and Broadway , he pointed out of the window and said : " I used to be a policeman there of the department for making arrests and getting convictions . I made more than 5,000 arrests while I was on the force . But my services have n't been appreciated , and that is why I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a resurrection to get out of the death house and see Broadway again . " Not Put in His Old Cell . On his arrival at the Tombs Becker was taken in charge by Warden John Hanley and two keepers . He was permitted to talk for a while with his brother , his lawyer , and his wife , and was then led to cell 117 on the first tier , three cells away from the one which he had occupied while awaiting trial . Mrs. Becker had not expected that her husband would be taken away from Sing Sing yesterday , and she left for Ossining on a morning train , thinking that he could not leave the prison until to-day . Shortly afterward , however , Mr. Shay received by express the remittitur , signed by all the Justices of the Court of Appeals , ordering the Warden of Sing Sing to deliver into the hands of the Sheriff of New York County the body of Charles Becker . After the order had been signed by Supreme Court Justice Bijur , Mr. Shay took it to Sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to spectacular methods in the conduct of that office , tried to steal a march on the reporters by sending two members of his staff to Ossining some time before he anounced that Becker would be brought to New York yesterday . His plan miscarried , however , and the reporters went up on the same train with the Sheriffs men . Becker Says He 's Broke . Meantime Mr. Shay had telephoned to Sing Sing to get Becker ready for a trip to New York in the afternoon . When Mrs. Becker was told of this she said it was the happiest day in her life . Mrs. Becker met her husband in the prison council room . It was the first time they had been alone together since Becker was locked up in the death house . The prisoners in the death house may interview visitors only through two screen doors about two feet apart . Mrs. Becker had taken up a suitcase full of clothing for her husband , and when he appeared later in the Warden 's office he wore a brown suit and a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Becker talked to some of them about his case . " The report that they may try me for extortion does not bother me , " he said to Chief Clerk Mallow , ' and I am as good as acquitted now of the charge of murder . I can easily explain about the bank accounts that were made so much or . My wife and I each had a little money , and we had changed our banks saveral times . As a matter of fact , the money totaled a small amount , nothing like $90,000 . To-day I am broke . It took all the money-I had to pay the expenses of my trial , and my wife had to-return to school teaching last September . Wanted to Say Good-bye to Gunmen . Becker remained chatting in the Warden 's office until it was nearly train time . Then he asked permission to go back to the death house and say goodbye to the others . Warden Clancy said , however , that If he did he would miss his train . Before leaving the death house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order had been given that he was not to lake any kind of leave of " , Gyp the Blood , ' Y " Lefty Louie , " " Whitey Lewis , " and " Dago " Frank , for the reason , apparently , that it would be - needless. - cruelty for ' them to ... see Becker leaving with a chance of freedom while their own doom seemed to be certain . Becker said that he had not exchanged a word with any of the gunmen since they received word late on Tuesday afternoon that the Court of Appeals had affirmed the verdict in their ease . Since that time , Becker said , the four had talked to each other In Yiddish and had held no conversation with any one else in the death house . Mr. Shay seemed to be surprised last night when he was told that District Attorney Whitman had definitely announced that he would move for a second trial , but he said : ' I will be ready by April or May if Mr. Whitman is ready then . It is a certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance . I have new evidence that will clear him completely . Becker will take the stand if there is another trial and be his best witness . " At the first trial I do not think it would have made a bit of difference whether he took the , stand or not . The Court was so hard on him and the prejudice against him was so strong that he bad no chance . " Charles G. F. liVahle , counsel for the four gunmen , was asked last night if he would make an application for pardon for his clients . He said that no plans had thbeeneir ' made cases . for future pro-c TO TRY BECKER IN THE SPRING Whitman Says He ' Will Move the Case Either in April or May . District Attorney Whitman yesterday confirmed the relSort that Becker would ' be tried again for the murder of Herman Rosenthal . He was , he said , prePSIIIng the peoples case against the exPolice Lieutenant and would move for a new trial either in April or May , but was unable to fix the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of work involved in rounding up witnesses and getting the evidence in shape for legal presentation . Mr. Whitman said he would not ask for the appointment of a Special Term Justice , as he had done for the first trial , and would not make his motion for a new trial until after the assignments for the Criminal Term of the Supreme ' Court had been made for the months desi " nated . In the Criminal Courts Building yesterday it was thought that either Justice Seabury or Justice Davis would hear the motion , depending on whether the former jurist is assigned or the latter is continued . As to whether he had any new evidence or new witnesses to produce at the second trial the District Attorney maintained silence . The question of the need of new evidence must be decided by the trial Justice . If he decides that no new evidence is needed , the trial can proceed in spite of the Court of Appeals ' reversal , and Mr. Whitman can produce the same witnesses who appeared at the first trial ; but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sufficient weight because of the reversal , he can quash the indictment against Becker , who will then be a free man . It was suggested yesterday that the witnesses against Becker at the first trial might produce more testimony than was brought forth at that time , but the admissibility of this testimony must also be ruled upon by the trial Justice . Still another point that it was thought yesterday might hurt Becker 's chances of having the indictment against hint quashed was the failure of the Court of Appeals to decide definitely as to whether Schepps was an accomplice . The decision intimated that he was , but this intimation should not have any effect on the second trial , because the higher court did not rule on the question . Justice Goff left the status of Schepps to the jury . The second trial Justice will barb to rule on the admissibility of the Schepps testimony . It was reported yesterday that " Bridgie " Webber had made a statement to the effect that he would never allow Becker to be sent to the electric chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving him insane . When Mr. Whitman was told of this report he said that he had a sworn document from Webber in his safe stating that he had never changed his opinion regarding Becker 's guilt , and that every word of testimony he had given at the first trial was absolutely true . Locked in the safe with Zebber ' s statement is a sworn document from Webber 's wife in confirmation of the first . Asked if he would take the stand himself against Becker , Mr. Whitman replied that if he did so he would have to he called by the defense : that he would not be called by the prosecution . Mr. Whitman met Becker in the West Forty-seventh Street Police Station an hour or so after the murder of Rosenthal occurred . What happened when they met has never been told , but Mr. Whitman said yesterday that an account of the meeting would not help the defense any If he were placed on the stand . BECKER DECISION QUOTED . J. F. Uses It to Try to Ob . taro Release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of Charles Becker was cited in the Supreme Court yesterday by John F. , who asked Justice Cohalan for certificates of reasonable doubt for Max Swersky and David Kalhofer , convicted horse poisoners. whose cases . lie said , were similar to Becker 's . Swersky and Kalhofer. ice cream manufacturers in Brooklyn , were convicted of hiring gangsters to poison the horses of rival ice cream manufacturers . The conviction , Mr. said , was obtained on testimony given by Samuel Erlichman , also an ice cream manufacturer , who Mr. said corresponded to Sam Schepps in the Becker case . " Erlichman had taken part in the conference preceding the poisoning of horses , " said Mr. " just as Schepps had taken part in the conference preceding the murder of Rosenthal . Justice Goff refused to Instruct the jury to regard Schepps 's testimony as that of an accomplice , and the Court of Appeals held that Justice Goff erred grievously in refusing to put the question of Schepps 's status as a witness up to the jury . This case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Justice Davis , at my client 's trial , refused to instruct the jury that Erlichman was an accomplice . I can not conceive how the Justice so erred . I will ask Your Honor to read the Becker case decision and also respectfully refer Your Honor to the case of Cassidy , the Queens Countypolitician , who has also obtained a certificate of reasonable doubt upon the grounds similar to those I urge here . " Deputy Assistant District Attorney Weller said that the Becker case did not apply to the cases before the court . " Just a guilty knowledge of what is going to happen , " he said , " is not a test of an accomplice 's status . And this is where the Becker case has no bearing upon this case . Schepps actually took part in the conferences that preceded the murder of Rosenthal , whereas Erlichman had no actual knowledge of what was going to be done by the conspirators . " Justice Cohalan asked both sides to submit briefs and reserved decision . RILEY WITNESSES TAKEN . One of Them Hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shea , said to be a clairvoyant , and " Paper-Collar Toe " Gray , known as a confidence man , both- of whom were to be witnesses next month against exPolice Captain Dominick Riley , who was indicted for bribery , were arrested yesterday by the Philadelphia police in the Criminal Court Building . Shea was taken to Philadelphia on a surrender piece obtained by the National Surety Company , which was on a bond for $1,000 in Philadelphia . Gray was held forty-eight hours , pending extradition proceedings . The arrest of the two men , who have been of assistance to Assistant District Attorney Groehl in the preparation of the case against Riley- and in the investigation of collusion between the police and members of the wire tappersclairvoyant syndicate , was a surprise . Both asserted that the real reason for it was to get them out of the State so that they could not testify against Riley . Mr. Groehl was inclined to think that arrangements could be made so that the two men might be brought back to help him in the Riley case .
