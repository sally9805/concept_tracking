 |p571  AN ordinary American Legislature sat down in Springfield , Ill. , January 19 , 1909 , to the task of electing a United States Senator for the seat to be refilled or vacated by Albert J. Hopkins March 4 . It was known in advance that it . would be difficult ; it was feared that it might be dangerous , and its importance to the state politically needed no emphasizing . It was an ordinary American Legislature . That is partly an assumption , but it is so sustained by probabilities as to be acceptable as a fact . It may not square with the pious hopes of reputable citizens in other states , but well-informed observers of American political conditons will fear that it is only too true . May 26 , 1909 , this ordinary Legislature completed its task of electing a Senator by giving 108 votes ? 73 Republicans and J3 Democrats ? to William Lorimer , then Congressman , defeating Mr. Hopkins , . the choice of the Republican party in the primaries , and all other candidates , avowed or merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative by a member of the joint assembly which elected Mr. Lorimer was placed in the hands of State 's Attorney John E. W. Wayman , of Cook County , by James Keeley , then managing editor , now general manager , of the Chicago Tribune . The activities of the prosecuting authorities in Cook and Sangamon counties and of the committee on privileges and election of the United States Senate since then have testified abundantly to the character of this story ? the confession of a man who had been bribed ? and to the results Keeley secured with it . To repeat : this was an ordinary American Legislature in composition , intelligence , standards of honesty and methods of operation . It had its proportion of lawyers and farmers , its seasoning of saloon-keepers and its sprinkling of doctors , bankers , business men , realestate agents , etc. , its pro rata of pious men and of professional drunkards . A great many played poker and a few read the Bible ? one , as was learned later , " from cover to cover . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the ordinary legislative thing ? except that there were two accidents . One was Representative Charles A. White . The other was James Keeley . There was also a third accident . White met Keeley . As a result , this plain ordinary session of a plain ordinary Legislature has been given the aspect of an extraordinary event in American political life . It would be more reasonable to say that the Illinois assembly was caught with its guard down . It slipped on White . To give this Legislature credit , it did not expect a great deal financially out of the senatorial election . It hoped to do very well on general legislation and had many promising measures in the hatchery . Except to statesmen important enough to be concerned in  |p572  higher politics the deadlock which ensued was regarded as involving merely a waste of time . It was a pleasant surprise later when it became remunerative . Prior to January 19 , 1909 , many interesting things happened in Illinois , and inasmuch as most of them led into the Legislature later they are important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the people of the state of Illinois , the three being William Lorimer , then Congressman representing the Sixth Illinois District , Governor Charles S. Deneen and Albert J. Hopkins , then United States Senator . Mr. Lorimer now sits uneasy in his scat . It would be valuable to understand Mr. Lorimer , but that is impossible . It is easy to put a tag on him and assign him to a classification , but in the end it is not satisfactory . Some of his shrewder or more intelligent enemies are puzzled to know whether he is self-hypnotized or monstrously hypocritical . He is spotlessly moral socially . He is religious , but without particular ostentation . Sunday-school superintendents might ? and sometimes do ? point to his life as one to shed a peaceful and beneficent light over the young aspirations of their charges . He is benign of appearance and restrained of temper . He works partly with a saloon gang of politicians , but liquor does not touch his lips . Until he was betrayed into speaking harshly of Medill McCormick , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might send a squad of thick-necked , low-browed plug uglies out to beat an enemy 's political head off , but he would breathe a benediction as they went . He could think all manner of gunpowder plots and preserve the appearance of an innocent country gentleman walking in a country lane by the village graveyard in holy meditation while the village church bells tolled the hour . He is the most amiable , carnation-bedecked Guy Fawkes known to politics in the Middle West . His friends would die for him in the last trench in the face of an overwhelming force of the enemy and his enemies never cease to fear him . He was a street-car conductor and he dragged his education out of the world . He is a great organizer and his political success started when he saw the possibility of applying scientific methods to politics in Chicago . That was in the Blaine campaign . He had been allied with public-utility grabs and public contracts ever since he became powerful in politics . He was associated with Charles T. Yerkes when that street-railway promoter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Council of Chicago .

He is probably genuinely religious . He has never had a faint conception of public service , unless it be his deep waterway proposal , for which he has worked hard . That may or may not be untarnished . It has suspicious angles , but some of his enemies credit him with one public-spirited impulse . Charles S. Deneen is the second person of importance in the preliminaries . For the purposes of this narrative he may be dismissed with the statement that he applies the gray matter of a statesman to the methods of a machine politician and in spite of the former may never arise above the level of the latter . He is cold , unerring , intelligent , working out of sight in the basement . He has , however , what Mr. Lorimer has not ? the sense of public service . He does work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was important and is not . If he ever had one thought which was not ninety-nine per cent . concerned with Albert J. Hopkins no one has yet discovered it . Mr. Lorimer , seeking to defeat Governor Deneen for renomination in 1908 , became convinced that Mr. Hopkins , whom he had made Senator in 1903 , had betrayed him , and vowed that the Aurora man , although the choice of the Republican party in the primaries , never again as a Senator would see Washington . It was at that moment that the plans for the unveiling of the statue of corruption in the Illinois Legislature were laid ? all unwittingly . When the Assembly met in regular session in January it was filled with no other ambition than to continue its successful assaults against the strong boxes of the wealthy . It began in the House of Representatives with an unusual procedure which startled the state . Four years before Governor Deneen , then new in office , had made Edward D. Shurtleff Speaker . Shurtleff , an iron-nerved , pokerfaced little man , was popular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after he had the gavel in his hands for a second time he broke with the Governor . In 1909 they were bitter enemies . Shurtleff , a candidate for reelection , had the backing of the inner organization which he had formed in the previous sessions . Deneen secured a majority of the Republican members , but not enough to make a majority of  |p573  the House . The Shurtleff Republicans refused to enter the speakership caucus . They turned to the Democrats . The minority members broke down the barrier between the two parties , struck a bargain for committeeships with Shurtleff , elected him , defeated Deneen , and laid the groundwork for the second bipartisan movement which five months later elected Lorimer . The time for the election of a United States Senator came . The two Houses balloted separately on January 19 . Mr. Hopkins was given the necessary-votes in the Senate , but failed in the House . The joint session the following day left him a few votes short of the necessary majority . Shurtleff was aligned with Lorimer . The Shurtleff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few Deneen Republicans who were antiHopkins . Without them Hopkins could not be elected . The deadlock , which lasted from January 19 to May 26 , was firmly fastened on the Illinois Legislature 's back like a little old man of the sea . It was a tempting situation to money-hun- gry statesmen , but the difficulties of converting it into cash were great . The first opportunity came early and from supporters of Mr. Hopkins . It is doubtful if a candidate more unpopular with a Legislature ever went before it as the choice of the people . The voice of the freemen of Illinois had declared in favor of Albert J. Hopkins , but its echoes were not disturbing the Legislature of the state to any perceptible extent . His failure to obtain his seat on the first ballot was a disappointment , although he bore up under it , turning a smiling face to the world , but as the deadlock assumed its formidable proportions and disclosed its frightful possibilities some of his friends and political dependents ( possibly the " friends " is surplusage ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not assumed that Mr. Hopkins knew anything of this . It is assumed that he did not . The men responsible for the success of the opposition to Hopkins had been in watch for just such an attempt as was made , and , being  |p574  in control of the machinery of the House organization with Speaker Shurtleff at its head , they were prepared to frustrate it . The negotiations for the delivery of a block of fifteen Democratic votes had been carried on with two Democrats of minor importance . The price , according to credible report , was to be $30,000 . An indiscreet member of the block , growing foolhardy and boastful in his cups , let it be known that plans had been made for the handing over of enough Democratic votes to Hopkins to elect him . Word of this impending disaster was carried speedily to Lorimer and Shurtleff and their subordinates in the House organization and to Roger C. Sullivan , of the Democratic National Committee from Illinois and titular head of a successful faction in the state Democracy . Sullivan was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His interest in the situation was not acute , but he had announced his intention of doing everything in his power to keep eager Democrats out of any senatorial keg of dollars which might be opened in the legislative halls . His influence in the Assembly was limited to one faction of Democrats , and they were in the minority on the minority side , but he was summoned and he appeared in Springfield as quickly as he could get there . Meanwhile Shurtleff had called the two Democrats through whom the negotiations had been conducted to his room , where he made a frank statement of facts and possibilities . He told the two men that a plan to deliver Democratic votes to Hopkins had been discovered and that the Republican organization was prepared to deal with any situation which might be uncovered the following day . He informed his now startled guests that the first Democratic vote delivered to the junior Senator would be the signal for a peremptory stopping of the roll-call and that thereupon he would make a complete statement of the case to the joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to vote for Mr. Hopkins and the price they were to receive . He said that his advice to them would be not to proceed further with the plan but to drop it . He said he would be sorry to bring grief in anyway to men who had honored him by departing from the narrow confines of partisanship and electing him , but that he did not believe it advisable to attempt another bipartisan movement at that precise time in the balloting for the election of a Uri'ited States Senator . He asked them to think it over and , whatever might be the result on the morrow , always to regard him as their friend . They did think it over . The conversation with the Speaker was held in the afternoon . By five o'clock one of the men had thought it over so frequently that he had made himself ill and had retired to his bed to rest his bewildered head and restore his shaking nerves . There were no Democratic votes for Mr. Hopkins on the ballot in the following day 's joint session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that the proceedings of the deadlock grew monotonous . The sanctified face of William Lorimer , surmounting a modest black double-breasted coat , his benevolent chin snuggling into a white cravat and the perfume of a red carnation mounting into his sensitive nose , was the most self-effacing thing in the picture during the ensuing months and it masked the shrewdest thoughts . He and Speaker Shurtleff were playing a hard game against a Republican majority which remained true to the instructions given in the p 575 primaries . Shurtleff habitually wears a mask , as does Lorimer , but his is best described as the mask of a poker face ; Mr. Lorimer luxuriates in childlike innocence . These two men are disagreeable hunters to have on one 's trail , and they were hunting Mr. Hopkins with all the bitterness known to politics . At first they were on the defensive ? merely trying to prevent . Gradually they took the offensive . They tried to elect . Lorimer , who had struggled to exterminate Deneen , made friends again with him . The Governor was willing and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming as chummy as two old knitting women . It was no surprise later when Mr. Lorimer tried to elect Mr. Deneen Senator . He almost succeeded . It would have been an almost perfect arrangement from the Lorimer standpoint , but he failed . Deneen had to be reckoned with if there were to be an election . Results could not be obtained on the Republican side without him . He blocked his own election . He refused to sanction the election of any compromise candidates . Gradually it became apparent that only two things could prevent an adjournment of the Legislature without an election . One was the election of Edward D. Shurtleff by a Republican-Democratic combination . The other was the election of William Lorimer by a Republican-Democratic combination . The deadlock was proof against all other assaults . With this understanding of the situation Mr. Lorimer became a candidate . He was frank to announce that his name would not he brought seriously to the attention of the legislators until he knew that he had enough votes . Finally that time came . On May 26 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Representative " Manny " Abrahams , a Democrat , who was in the saloon Lbusiness , arose to vote for Lorimer , he having the alphabetical importance on the r o l I of the House which enabled him to start for the Democrats . Fifty-two other Democrats added their vote to that of Mr. Abrahams and fifty-five Republicans joined them . The result was the election of the blond , bland , childlike and innocent Mr. Lorimer , who forthwith , after proper formalities , mounted the platform and returned thanks . The thing was not without its stench then , but it remained for the following year to find the rat in the rafters . One of the inconspicuous Democrats who voted for Lorimer was the man over whom the legislature tripped , Representative White , of O'Fallon , a small town in St. Clair County , in the southern part of the state . He had been a street-car conductor , and in 1907 was in Springfield during the legislative session as a member of the labor lobby . In 19o$ he was elected to the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little known except on the minority side of the House . He was  |p576  successful in getting a position for a friend on the outrageously inflated house pay rolls . He voted and attended committee meetings , loafed in the corridors of the St. Nicholas Hotel , in barrooms and in his room , and endured the unutterable tedium of the small-fry legislator who has no part in the shaping of legislation , makes no attempt to understand the majority of measures on which he will vote , and merely follows a leader blindly when he gets the word . He asserted himself once . That was early in the session when he refused to join the Democrats in electing Shurtleff Speaker . Labor h e l d Shurtleff responsible f o r the failure of certain bills in the previous session and White refused to join the delivery to the Republican Speaker . His leader on the Democratic side was Representative Lee O'Neil Browne , of Ottawa , La Salle County , a lawyer who was serving his fifth term in the House of Representatives . Browne was minority leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He had defeated the faction in the minority which was directly under the influence of Roger C. Sullivan and had been selected in caucus as the Democratic candidate for Speaker , an empty honor in itself , but carrying the minority leadership with it . The Sullivan Democrats ignored him and formed their own organization , dealing directly with the Speaker for committeeships . The bipartisan character of the movement which reelected Shurtleff had resulted in a hodgepodge of committee appointments in which all semblance of party responsibility was destroyed . White had joined the Browne faction and received his legislative tutelage at Browne 's hands . In March , 1909 , a man who said that his name was White and that he was a member of the Legislature went to the office of the Chicago Tribune and , after a number of fruitless visits , finally met Keeley . He had a manuscript of which he nourished the most extravagant ideas . Its monetary value to him was about $2 a word . He was seeking a publisher . He had told his experiences as a legislator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as known to one of the Democrats who voted for him . After much argument Keeley persuaded him to leave the manuscript for examination , and later , at his leisure , opened it , only mildly interested , to see what sort of a narrative White had produced . Within two days detectives employed by the Tribune were hunting out small towns in southern and central Illinois where members of the Legislature mentioned by White lived . White had told the story of the Lorimer election ; not a great deal of it , only so much as affected himself or what was known to him from conversation with other members . He also told the story of the " jack-pot , " the general corruption fund from which payments were made to the legislators whose votes had been used in the killing of bills and in the attempts to pass others . Again his narrative had its limits at his own personal experiences . White confessed in his story , which he called " The Jack-pot , " that he had been paid $r , 000 by Lee O'Neil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been paid in addition 8900 as his share of the jack-pot fund , the second payment being made in St. Louis by Representative Robert E. Wilson of the Sixth District , Chicago .  |p577  His story was told in great detail . His character has interested the defense a great deal since the cases have been in court . It is spread out remorselessly in the pages of his narrative . Consciously or unconsciously , he did not spare himself , although , to give a proper color to his new role of reformer , he explained that , having done great wrong , confession w a s the only reparation he could make . Whit e made himself perfectly apparent , so apparent that a discussion of his motives and his nature would be a waste of time . In brief detail here is his story as it affects bribery in t h e Legislature : He was in his room in the St. Nicholas Hotel with two friends two nights before the clay of ' the Lorimer election when Browne called him on the telephone saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments . Shortly afterward the minority leader presented himself at the room , spoke to White 's two friends , whom he knew , and asked White to go with him to his room . There he closed the transom . White said afterward that he observed the windows were closed . Browne 's first question went directly to his subject . " Can you vote for a Republican ? " It was quite unnecessary to specify for what , White answered promptly that he could . " I can vote for anything , " he said . " Can you vote for Lorimer for Senator ? " Browne asked . White said he could . Browne cautioned him against discussing the matter with anyone , adding , " I 'm damn suspicious of that place above they call Joliet " White said he would be cautious . " I can depend on you , can I , Charley , old boy ? " Browne asked . " Lee , I never go back on my word , " White replied . Nothing was said of the price for his vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark by Browne : " It wo n't be any chicken feed . " Later that night White met Representative H. J. C. Beckemeyer , a Democrat from Carlyle , in the fourth floor corridor of the hotel . It was about midnight . Neither man was fully dressed . Beckemeyer asked White what he thought " of the Lorimer deal . " White replied that he had heard nothing of it . Browne came through the hall as they were talking . " He came up to Us with a worried and tired none- " expression on his face , " said White in his narrative , " and requested us in a low voice to go to bed . " The following day White , who says that he was without money , having drawn and spent his $2,000 legislative pay and having borrowed of friends , wanted something more definite than the " it would n't be any chicken feed . " He went to Browne , who wanted to know what was worrying him and , on being told , asked if he were afraid to trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it would be pleasant to learn how much he would get . Browne accepted this as a reasonable request and told him he would get $1,000 " in ready cash " and that the jack-pot distribution , which would not be made until some weeks after adjournment , would yield him nearly as much . White was one of the fifty-three Democrats who , the next day , May 26 , added their votes to those of fifty-five Republicans  |p578  and elected William Lorimer United States Senator . Frightened by the possibilities of his act , he was afraid to go to his home in O'Fallon over Sunday that week , but went to Chicago . The following week he asked Browne for money and was given $100 . Later , after the Legislature had adjourned , he met Browne , at the latter 's request , in the Briggs House in Chicago and was paid $50 . The following morning he was given $850 . Browne , as described in White 's narrative , then carried $30,000 in a belt of heavy blue cloth which he wore about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the O'Fallon man for the careless way in which he had attempted to put it in his pocket and , taking an envelope and a safety pin , fastened the bills securely in his friend 's inside coat pocket , warning him not to make a foolish display of money in barrooms or elsewhere . Still later came the distribution of jack-pot money . White was telegraphed by Representative Wilson in Chicago , to meet him in the Southern Hotel , St. Louis . The telegram , the original of the one received by him being preserved by White , was dated July 14 . The meeting was set for July 15 , 1909 . White made the short trip across St. Clair County to St. Louis the next morning . There on the street he met Beckemeyer , who said he was in the city " on business . " In the lobby of the Southern Hotel he found Representative Joseph S. Clark of Fayette County , Representative Henry A. Shephard of Jersey County , and another Democratic Representative who since has died . Wilson , with Representative Michael S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hotel lobby from the street . Link and Wilson took the elevator . Shephard and Clark soon followed . White and the other Representative went up later . While White was in Wilson 's room , to which all had gone , the Chicago Representative called Shephard into the bathroom . White said that he could hear them talking in a low tone . When they came out Wilson called White into the bathroom and counted nine $100 bills into his hands , saying : " That 's all of it and I am glad to be relieved of the burden . " He then explained , according to White , that . Browne was ill and had asked him to make the trip to St. Louis . That , in substance , was the story which White placed in Keeley 's hands . It was the story which Keeley and the prosecuting authorities of Cook County had as a basis for the inquiry which followed . In the following three weeks each of the men mentioned in White 's narrative was visited three times ? twice by detectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were asked to answer categorically a series of questions based on the confession which then was in the Tribune office . The first visit found them unprepared , the second alarmed and evasive , the third panic-stricken . The reports of the investigators furnished a mass of conflicting and incriminating statements . On the first visit to each of the men the detectives prepared a pleasant little surprise for the victim . White did not make his appearance until a number of astounding questions had been asked and a number of indignant answers recorded . Then the confessing member of the Legislature walked composedly in on the scene as Nemesis and the legislator undergoing the inquisition suddenly realized the inestimable value of rectitude in public life . When all the reports were in Keeley 's hands he called into consultation the chief of the detective bureau handling the work and one of the Tribune lawyers . They took a final survey of results and Keeley declared his determination to publish . It required nerve . The case was not a secure one as it stood . The admissions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not sufficient for a criminal action . Principally there was White 's uncorroborated confession , but Keeley published . That was April 30 . Journalistically it was a success . From Chicago to southern Illinois the state was filled with the yelps of denial . State 's Attorney Wayman was prepared . A special grand jury , summoned for another purpose , was in waiting . White was taken directly before it and he was followed by the men implicated by him . Beckemeyer , a rather clean , decent young man of an excellent German family , stood the inquisition but a short time . He relieved his conscience by a confession . He had been paid $1,000 by Lee O'Neil Browne-for his vote for Lorimer . There had been no bargain . He said he did not need one . He knew when he was asked to vote for Lorimer that he would be paid . It was " in the air , " he said , that money was being used to elect . His first confession was incomplete . He said that after the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he had been handed an envelope containing $1,000 . He corrected that later . " I want to tell the whole truth , " he told State 's Attorney Wayman . " Browne asked  |p579  me to go to St. Louis after the session adjourned and there paid me $1,000 , saying : There 's your Lorimer money . ' " Shephard , a respectable banker , maintained his innocence and did not waver . Clark , a timid little fellow , pulled through the inquisition , frightened to death but still on his feet . Wilson had a short shift and was indicted for perjury . " Mike " Link , a ponderous , red-faced farmer with a couple hundred acres of land in Madison County , also was indicted for perjury . " Mike " rested under that indictment overnight and wilted like an abandoned cauliflower . Mike wanted to tell the truth and he was permitted to do so . His was a sorrowful story of a misunderstood nature . Ten days before Lorimer 's election he had been approached by two men in Springfield . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not know them or that he has forgotten them . They asked him if he would take a ride . He said that he would be pleased to do so . While on this pleasure trip he was asked if he could vote for a Republican . It was almost like a text-book question . He said that he could vote for either Lorimer or Shurtleff . He was taken back to the St. Nicholas Hotel and ushered into Mr. Lorimer 's presence . The Congressman asked the question which had been asked him already and he repeated his answer . Mr. Lorimer said that it would be entirely satisfactory to him to rely on a gentleman who could vote either for him or for Mr. Shurtleff and that time would tell which one of the two would be offered to him . Mr. Lorimer also asked Mr. Link whether he had any influence with Lee O'Neil Browne , but Mr. Link was modest . Later , on the eve of the election , Browne came to Link with the famous question : " Mike , could you vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his face . " I beat you to it , Lee , " he said . " I 've promised to vote for Lorimer . " Still later , Mr. Link confesses with the tearful fear of a man who is about to be misunderstood , Mr. Browne summoned him to St. Louis and gave him $r , 000 without com-  |p580  ment . Mr. Link 's theory is that this was a reward , and to do him justice Mr. Lorimer 's friends hold the same view . When all the evidence had been heard and after Browne had been indicted for bribery and Wilson for perjury , Wayman was at the end of his rope . Venue lay in Cook County only for the crime committed in the payment of the $900 which White said Browne had handed him at the Briggs House in Chicago . Otherwise it was in Sangamon County , of which Springfield , the state capital , is the county seat . Edmund Burke , states attorney of that county , had taken immediate cognizance of the White narrative . At first he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by correspondents who represented him as intending to indict and convict White . Nothing more pleasing to the LorimerBrowne end of the dispute could be imagined and the consternation of the persons interested in a full disclosure of the corruption was natural . An effort was made to stay the action of tho Sangamon grand jury . Judge Robert B. Shirley of the Sangamon County circuit refused to order a cessation of activities and Mr. Burke , an energetic young prosecutor , proceeded in his inquiry . The pressure on Senator Lorimer had been terrific . He took several weeks in the preparation of a speech which he made Saturday , May 28 , before the Senators at Washington . In it he defended the character of Lee O'Neil Browne , attacked his enemies , assigned financial and political reasons to explain their attitude toward him , charged that a conspiracy had been formed to destroy him and gave in detail the history of the deadlock in the Illinois Legislature . Of Mr. Browne he said that he had found in him an honorable , upright , God-fearing man , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , low creature White . " He referred to one incident in his association with Mr. Browne which he recalled with great pleasure . That was a conversation in which Mr. Browne said that he believed in the Bible from cover to cover . The Senator expressed himself as of the firm opinion that White had not written a line of his alleged confession , but that it had been written by a trained newspaper hand . White testified later , under cross-examination by counsel for the defense , that he had made several attempts to sell his manuscript to publishers before he carried it to the Tribune . When the speech had been delivered Mr. Lorimer took a train for Chicago . At Harrisburg he was reached with the information that while he was addressing the Senate in defense of his election and in denunciation of his enemies , State Senator D. W. Holtslaw of Marion County , a respected hanker of Iuka , a Democrat , had confessed before the Sangamon County grand jury that he had been paid S2,500 for his vote for Lorimer and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a saloon-keeper in a West Side Chicago district . Holtslaw 's confession was a severe blow to the Lorimer defense . Burke is a Democrat . The charge that he was acting in a political plot intended to destroy Lorimer could not be made ; the character of Holtslaw could not be attacked as could that of White , and his confession , although brief , was complete . He was tripped over a bit of petty jobbery in connection with the purchase of new desks and chairs for the hall of the House and the Senate chamber . A committee of five , of which he was a member , let a contract for new furniture to a firm which was not the lowest bidder . Burke took the evidence he was able to get on this deal , had the members of the committee before the grand jury and indicted Holtslaw for perjury . Under this indictment , or at the prompting of a sick conscience , the Senator wilted and confessed . His statement in writing was as follows : " In making the statement to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure the contract for furniture and for the purpose of electing William Lorimer United States Senator I have been governed by the firm belief that this is the only honest course I can pursue . " I appreciate that my actions in this matter have been reprehensible and in this connection I offer no defense . I have , however , determined to make such reparation as is within my power , and the only means by which this could be done , it seems to me , is by fully and honestly stating what I know about these transactions . " I voted for William Lorimer for United States Senator and received therefor $2,500 . Senator John Broderick offered me the money the day before Lorimer was elected . I had voted previously for Stringer . Then I voted for Lorimer and a few days later Broderick , in his saloon in Chicago , paid me the money in $100 bills . " I also received S700 , which was given to me without explanation , with the statement that it was coming to me . ' I was promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture contract . " This brief statement reveals a broken man , and Holtslaw was . He had been taken to the grand-jury room almost directly from a religious convention which he had been attending in the East . He went home to a broken family . The cry of his daughter still has a pitiful echo in the state : " How could he do it : " His bank was taken over by other bankers to save it , and Holtslaw , respected man of responsibility and power in a small town , is now waste . Wayman , with his limited opportunities in Chicago , had just two men whom he could bring to trial , Browne charged with bribery and Wilson charged with perjury , the latter having led himself into lies regarding the trip he made to St. Louis . Browne went to trial at once before Judge William H. McSurely , who had been a member of the Forty-fourth General Assembly and who there had known the indicted minority leader . The prosecution offered-White with his full confession ; Beckemeyer with his testimony that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , " and Representative George W. Myers , an honest Democrat of Edgar County , who testified that Browne had urged him to vote for Lorimer and had said that there were plenty of state appointments to be had and also " plenty of the ready necessary . " Wayman succeeded in having the tearful Mr. Link called as a court witness . He testified that he had not been promised money for his vote ; that he had no expectation of getting any and that Browne handed him $1,000 without comment . Mr. Link said that he regarded this as a " reward . " He was indignant because of the unjust assumptions which had been based on this innocent fact . The defense did not put Browne on the stand . It merely introduced character witnesses for him and assailed White , who under cross-examination produced his contract with the Tribune company showing that he had  |p582  been given 83,200 for the use of his manuscript and that his expenses were paid while he was aiding the Tribune detectives . Details of his personal history were supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorimer informing him that he was writing the narrative of his experience as a legislator were introduced to show an intent to blackmail . The jury broke all Cook County records f o r stubbornness , remaining out 115 hours . Then Judge McSurely sent for them , ascertained that there was no possibility of a verdict , and dismissed them . The defense had been successful in securing a mistrial . Evidently the four who stood out for acquittal were unable to find any corrobora tive evidence in the testimony of the other mem-bers of the Legislature who confessed that they had received money or had been offered it . Eight to four the jury was divided . The result did little to relieve the defense , but it had its value to them . There were credible reports that Broderick , the West Side saloon-keeper charged by Holtslaw , was weakening , and that a verdict of guilty for Browne would send him hastening to State 's Attorney Burke with a confession which might reach to the " higher-ups . " In Cook and Sangamon counties the prosecutors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who might have told who supplied the money , both in the senatorial election and for the jack-pot , were silent as the tombs . If Broderick knew and if he were wavering , the mistrial served to steady him for the time being . In Sangamon County Burke was developing evidence which revealed the machinery of the Legislature . It was as if with a dark lantern he were exploring the interior of a great dark barn . As the rays of light struck here and there , the scampering and squeaking disclosed the panic of the rats and elsewhere the ominous darkness quivered with apprehension . The session has been called an ordinary session . Burke 's menacing light proved it . He found that in the Illinois river towns , such as Beardstown and Havana , the fishermen had been paying tribute to the Assembly for so many years that they regarded it as a part of the expense of their business . These fishing towns do a large business in carp , and many of the fishing firms have expensive outfits . Their product goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who like carp . There are such . They say it needs merely proper cooking . At every session of the Legislature new bills for the protection of fish are introduced . They escape general attention , but they are the most important measures in the Legislature to these fishing towns . Sometimes they threaten the fishers with complete destruction of their business . The river men seem to be men of good business morals , presumably upright and honest . They wanted nothing out of the Legislature ? so it appears from the evidence 11 Ir . Burke uncovered . They wanted to be let alone . Occasionally they would be offered a bill which might improve their business . That would be more costly than to secure merely the killing of a bill which would injure them . Apparently they preferred to  |p583  pay the price for the stopping of legislation rather than attempt to get beneficial laws . In 1909 they collected over $3,000 and sent it to Springfield . The bill , the death of which they were buying , was well along on the calendar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , but it was typical . Few interests were too small to escape the thumbscrew of the Legislature . From each a tribute would be taken according to its means . The furniture deal also was small , but inasmuch as the distribution was to be restricted to a few members it was financially valuable . Three men on a committee of five conducted the negotiations and the other two did not know what was going on . The system was not developed in a year , or in ten . It had been perfected by experience until it would be difficult to say what the small individual Vote had been bribed to do or by whom he had been bribed . He merely obeyed orders , unless he became ambitious to set up in business for himself . In the jackpot distribution the small Vote did not know who had contributed to it , how much had been contributed or for what purpose , although if he were wise he could make a respectable guess at the identity of at least some of the unwilling donors . The small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger game . This honor was the more dependable because it rested on political and business expediency . The manipulators of the jack-pot could do nothing without votes and they were forced to regard every little fellow as one with whom they might have to deal in the succeeding session . His district might send him back . In that case he must be used again . No doubt much injustice frequently has been done the small Vote . He is entirely helpless if he be given only a part of what in all fairness he ought to have been paid . Frequently there is much complaining . White related that some of his fellow members who like himself were given $900 were bitterly disappointed and accused the larger Votes and Brains of " holding out . " Several threatened to make it warm for the Brains . A session of the Legislature might be worth S5oo or $20,000 . It depended on the man . Brains came higher than Votes . The latter frequently , if not always , acted blindly . They learned to trust and to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good boys were rewarded . The evidence brought out regarding the Forty-sixth General Assembly of Illinois shows that $900 was the dividend on general legislation declared for the smaller Votes on the Democratic side of the House of Representatives . Important Democratic Votes got more ; Important Democratic Brains still more , and undoubtedly the Republican dividend was larger . Contributors to the jack-pot can be identified by the use of a little imagination . They include nearly every big association of interests and nearly every large corporation authorized to do business in the state . Many corporations , like the fishermen , regard the legislative toll as a regular biennial expense . There have been rebellions , but never serious ones . The manipulators in the Legislature are equipped to deal with insurrections and insubordination . There are too many beneficent laws which might be passed and which might earn the legislators the gratitude of a grateful state but which would interfere with business . In case of rebellion the Brains of the jack-pot would not threaten commercial and manufacturing interests with outrageously bad bills . The corporations would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veto the measures . It is a meritorious bill which the corporation fears the most and which can be turned into the most powerful weapon for the collection of tribute . Such a bill , if passed , must be signed by the Governor . " Paying " measures , ones which in the hands of pirates will yield revenue , may be illustrated by the following list made up by selection at random from the measures introduced in the last regular session of the Illinois House of Representatives : To establish uniform text-books for the public schools and to fix a maximum price for the same . To regulate the financial liability of hotel proprietors in case of loss of property of guests . Including within the operation of the medical-practice act persons who test eyes and prescribe glasses . Making it a felony for any person or corporation to furnish by telephone or telegraph any market quotations for the pretended buying of stocks , bonds or commodities . Making it unlawful for electric-light companies to charge more than seven cents per hour per kilowatt for electricity . To compel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population to place their trolley wires underground . Prohibiting the storing of undrawn poultry . Prohibiting express companies from engaging in the business of selling money orders . Compelling all telephone companies to provide interchangeable service .  |p584  Some of these bills were good , some of them were bad and some were outrageous . Some of them , as can be seen at a glance , were introduced as " hold-up " measures , but were so . brazen as to compel even the introducer to laugh . Some of them were merely jokes . Some of them may have had no bad intent , but all of them ? and there were several hundred like them -- could be used by unscrupulous manipulators to obtain money , either to pass or defeat them as the case might be . The distribution of the jack-pot was not always made so openly as was that in the Southern Hotel at St. Louis described by White . On one occasion it is said that timid manipulators required the contributor of a large sum to pack the money in a grip , take a train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit the grip in a corn field and return to Chicago without satisfying his curiosity as to who got it . The collector followed in his footsteps . The grip was not long in the corn , but the man who paid did not know the man who took it and the Votes who were handed their share of the money did not know either the contributor or the collector . This sounds unreasonably imaginative but it has certain apparent advantages . They have done a great deal in Illinois , but they have not done all . The prosecution has been blocked in every attempt it has made to discover who furnished the money that corrupted the legislators . State Senator Stanton C. Pemberton , Republican of Coles County , and Representative Joseph S. Clark , the two men implicated by Holtslaw in the furniture deal , were indicted in Sangamon County . Broderick was indicted there . Browne and Wilson were indicted in Cook County . White , Beckemeyer , Holtslaw and Link ? if one may call Link 's statement a confession ? have confessed , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " men higher up " could be based has been uncovered . If Browne gave $r , 000 to White , Beckemeyer and Link and offered money to Myers it is inconceivable that he used his own money or that these four were the only ones to receive it or be offered it . Broderick , if he gave $2,500 to Holtslaw , did not take it out of his own pocket . Browne did not . Who furnished the money ? It is assumed that Senator Lorimer does not know . It is assumed he did not know money was used to secure his election . It is possible to examine the list of commercial interests which were concerned in getting an additional vote into the United States Senate at a critical time in the passage of the tariff bill , but such an examination leads merely to suspicions and does not furnish proof . The Chicago Tribune exhausted every effort to find a path to the business offices of these unknown philanthropists , but without satisfactory discoveries . In one respect the disclosures which began with the visit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Tribune office will have complete results . A chastened and renovated Assembly will meet in Springfield next January . What is not new in its composition will be disciplined . The people of the state are attending to that even now . They will attend to it September Is , when the statewide primaries are held . They will attend to it still further in the general elections in November . A new , clean Assembly will meet to undertake the consideration of legislation needed by the state . There will be spots in it , but what is not scoured will be scared . That can be counted on for the next Legislature , but , without a permanent change in the conditions which have produced assemblies in the past , there will be a reversion to type soon enough . If honest corporations continue to yield to cowardly impulses toward self-protection , if dishonest corporations continue in efforts to obtain unfair legislation by corrupt methods , and if the people lapse again into unintelligent disregard of legislative elections , the state again will have its jack-pots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just and the unjust . In the old days the legislative highwaymen held up the fingers of one hand to indicate a $5,000 session and the fingers of both hands to indicate a $ro , 000 one . They will be holding their hands out and their fingers up again soon enough unless the people of the state continue to hold thumbs down .
