 | THE Secretary of the Navy , having appointed a so-called Naval " Advisory " or " Inventions " Board of twenty-two members nominated by eleven technical societies , with Mr. Edison as chairman , summarizes its functions as follows : 1 . To give your expert advice when called upon in the big problems the Navy is always trying to solve . 2 . To initiate suggestions which will add to the efficiency of any unit of the Navy . Mr. Edison takes a somewhat different view , and announces " We 're not inventing and we 're not even going to develop inventive ideas submitted . . . . The civilian board members . . . will give expert advice to the Navy whenever the Navy desires it . " The foregoing denial seems to apply only to future activities . A storage battery which has been extensively advertised in the service journals for quite a long time and of which Mr. Edison is said to be the inventor , is being actively urged upon the Government for submarine use and is now under trial in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after announcing that he knew nothing about submarines , has proceeded with much publicity to the Brooklyn Navy Yard , and there for the first time examined one . He is at present reported as unwilling for philanthropic reasons to turn his inventive talent to war material , and is not known to have claimed any war inventions since his name was hyphenated in that of the Edison-Sims dirigible torpedo which was prest upon the Government some thirty years ago and then asserted to be the most frightfully formidable weapon of its class . So far , the sole outcome of the board 's deliberations is a proposition that the United States shall build and equip a gigantic " Iaboratory " at a construction cost of $5,000,000 and an operating cost of about $3,000,000 per year . It is to include , we are told , pattern shops , brass foundries , cast iron and cast steel foundries , machine shops , sheet metal shops , forge shops , woodworking shops , a chemical Iaboratory , a physical laboratory , an optical laboratory , an electrical Iaboratory , a mechanical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two , and possibly three , shifts of men . " It is to be under the control , not of the Advisory Board , but of " a naval officer of rank , " under whom will be " naval heads of broad experience in laboratory methods and science in general , besides staffs of civilian experimenters , chemists , physicists , etc . " The whole is to be " surrounded by a high fence and guard maintained at all hours . No visitors allowed . " WHY THE LABORATORY ? There being no necessary or even apparent relation between board and Iaboratory , the precise object and purpose of the latter is somewhat obscure ; but there seems to be a public idea that , like Mr. Edison 's visit to the submarine , in some way it will cause or stimulate inventions . Inventors , however , like poets , are born and not made . The divine afflatus can not be pumped . No one has ever invented anything to order , and altho there have been cases where after accumulating many jars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them together , hit or miss , with the hope that something likely to pay might come out of it , no one today , despite the prospective help of a $5,000,000 laboratory , can announce that he is " going to invent " without provoking general derision . Some forty years ago that sort of prophesy was quite common , and much corporate stock was sold on the strength of it . But as the inventions , if they ever materialized , generally came from wholly unexpected sources , " going to invent " nowadays has lost its efficacy even as a promotion asset . This renders the proposed laboratory difficult to distinguish from a bureau to be filled with place-holders under the patronage of the Navy Department , or from part and parcel of Secretary Daniels ' well known scheme of substituting governmentowned plants for those privately controlled . Of course , like every present project having its objective in the national treasury , this one is to contribute to our " preparedness " ? but precisely how and against what is yet to be explained . Whatever arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more and still more " laboratories " thruout the public service . The Army , which has " big problems " of its own , will likely enough demand , not a five , but a ten million dollar establishment . The Patent Office , which really needs something of the kind , is used to poverty and might be contented with something less . The Food Commission , the people studying the Mississippi levees , forest conservation , mosquitoes , the hookworm and Culebra slides , could no doubt all demonstrate to their  | own satisfaction a crying need for laboratories of the most comprehensive character . It even seems illogical to stop with the Navy , when we might have a grand composite hundred million dollar laboratory for finding out everything about everything , and incidentally providing a promised land flowing with milk and honey for " deserving Democrats . " WHO ARE THE ADVISERS ? Leaving aside the laboratory , and accepting the denied intention on the part of the Advisory Board to invent or develop the inventions of others , that organization sems to reduce itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever somebody in the Navy wants it to advise . But why should somebody so desire ? Is it because of the superior qualifications of the Board for grappling with the Navy 's " big problems " ? If so , where do they appear ? It includes some gentlemen of high professional eminence and it has been chosen , not from the whole country , but from the narrowly restricted membership of 1 . The American Aeronautical Society . 2 . The American Society of Aeronautic Engineers . 3 . The American Society of Automobile Engineers . 4 . The Inventors ' Guild . 5 . The American Chemical Society . 6 . The American Institute of Electrical Engineers . 7 . The American Mathematical Society . 8 . The American Society of Civil Engineers . 9 . The American Institute of Mining Engineers . 10 . The American Electro-Chemical Society , and 11 . The American Society of Mechanical Engineers . How membership in some of these concerns implies in any sense superior ability to solve " big naval problems , " how distinction as an automobile engineer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so is not clear . If general technical attainments are a sufficient qualification , why exclude the thousands of engineers and scientists outside of those selected by the eleven societies ? If special attainments relative to naval problems are a proper criterion , then altho hygiene afloat is of great importance and naval surgeons now exercize military command , no medical society figures on the list . Accounting and storekeeping in the Navy have of late been the subject of much discussion and study , but no organization of the Accountants is represented . And oddly enough the one society of all others which deals directly with the problems of naval construction ? the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers ? is conspicuous by its absence . MEN WHO ARE MISSING And as for individuals , the contrast between the names of some that are included in the board and of some that are not is probably best accounted for by the internal politics of the contributing organizations . To mention but a few of the missing , where are such aviators as Orville Wright and Glen Curtiss ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard H. Robinson and ( for submarines ) Lawrence Y. Spear ? all four exnaval officers , graduates of Annapolis , and famous for their ability long before they left the Navy ; where are such experts in wireless telegraphy and telephony as Michael I. Pupin and J. J. Carty ; and , most singular of all omissions , where is the name of John Forsyth Meigs , easily the first of American ordnance engineers , another Annapolis graduate and ex-naval officer of long service ? Why are there four representatives of aeronautics and none in the fields of ship or gun building ? While an Advisory Board is as unable to produce inventions as a university is to bear children , it can not , of course , impede or prevent the exercize of inventive genius by its members ? and many of them are inventors of distinction . This raises questions . Can the Board properly advise upon the inventions of its own members ? Does membership in the Board deprive the country of such inventions ? Will outside inventors submit their inventions to a body of other inventors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same field ? As the affection of an inventor for his invention is proverbially like that of a tigress for her whelps , is he any more likely to submit its merits to the adjudication of his rivals than a mother is to submit to a jury of other mothers , whether or not her offspring is good looking ? Are members of the Board to be permitted to hold patents for their inventions made during their term of office , or to exploit them as against the Government ? If so , where is the line to be drawn between inventions of general utility and those specially adapted for naval use ? The regions in which the wayward inventive faculty may happen to stray can not be circumscribed . Suppose Mr. Hudson Maxim , distinguished as an explosive inventor , but appearing on the Board as an aviation expert ( he was nominated by one of the Aeronautic Societies ) should invent a shirt-ironer expressly suited to the steam laundry which Secretary Daniels now thinks no battleship should be without . Is it not conceivable that the Secretary might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and losing a highly efficient shirtironer , or sticking to the shirt-ironer and losing Mr. Maxim ? The case is , of course , imaginary , but similar conditions might perhaps arise regarding the storage battery already noted as invented by the Chairman of the Board . Power for submarines during submersion is one of the " big problems of the Navy . " Does the Board propose to pass on the merits of its Chairman 's already offered battery ? If not , why not ? And people are already asking how all these busy chemists , engineers , electricians , automobile makers , and the like , acquired education in the " big problems of the Navy , " or whether they have still to get it ? Barring the professional biographies of four ex-naval officers who resigned many years ago and went into other callings , the published " who 's whos " afford no illuminating information on the subject . A New York newspaper remarked the other day that anybody could open any one of twenty doors in the Navy Department corridors and find an officer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these distinguished scientists . SHOULD CIVILIANS ADVISE EXPERTS ? But most anomalous of all , here is a body of men chosen from other pursuits in order to give advice to the undisputed experts of another profession , in the most important matters of that profession . And not only this , but advice calculated to influence the professional judgment of experts upon whose skill , efficiency and independently trained judgment the safety of the nation depends . Is it not astonishing that any one ? even the Secretary of the Navy ? should conceive of such a proceeding ; or should seriously believe that the naval officers charged with such terrible responsibilities would submit themselves to such counsel ? Yet either it must be heeded or not heeded . If not , why the Board ? If it must be , is the country prepared to shift the responsibility involved in its " big naval problems " from the men whom it has educated since childhood to meet them , and who are bound by every tie of discipline and devotion , to an irresponsible body of civilians created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom vocal about the affairs of the Navy , partly because they are muzzled by regulations , and partly because indiscreet utterances are apt to result  | in long seclusion at distant stations ; but so far as the writer has been able to judge , their opinions on the present subject range all the way from silent disapproval to questioning whether this scheme is another of the Secretary 's original ideas for exalting the civil above the military power , or a new sample of his peculiar brand of socialism which wants to " down the gold-laced aristocracy of the navy . " Others grimly object to amateur efforts " to teach them their business . " And indeed of all men this last they least need . From the moment that they enter the service until they retire from it , their education is incessant . No more pitiless self-critics and task-masters exist than they . From generation to generation they teach one another ? the elders , the younger . They abolished scholastic control by civilians in the United States Naval Academy , fifty years ago . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they learn its needs under practical conditions . Is it likely that civilians with no similar knowledge or experience are competent to instruct them concerning the problems at which they are always working ? The Secretary of the Navy seems to regard himself as the originator of making civilian counsel available to the naval officers . If he holds that idea he is misled . The subject is one which has been under discussion for many years . It was suggested to him by his former Aide for Operations and urged during the latter 's entire term of office . It has been discussed in the columns of The Independent for upward of seventeen years . A BETTER PLAN IN ENGLAND A very much more logical and better plan than that of Mr. Daniels has already been carried into effect by Great Britain . It comprizes a Central Committee under the presidency of Admiral Lord Fisher ? " the father of the modern British Navy " ? naval head of the Admiralty for years prior to his retirement for age , and recalled to it again during the present war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to his speedy withdrawal . With him are associated Sir Charles A. Parsons , an engineer of the highest eminence , inventor of the steam turbine which bears his name , and its principal developer , Sir Joseph Thomson , long Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge and now Professor of Physics at the Royal Institution of London and a physicist of worldwide fame , and Dr. G. T. Beilby , an inventor of many industrial processes and a chemist who has made a special study of fuel economy . In other words , here is , a small executive group managed by a famous naval officer , and including an engineer , a physicist and a chemist of the highest rank . Associated with this Committee is the Royal Society and twelve consultants which advises ( not the Navy , but ) the Committee on matters specifically referred to them . The Royal Society investigates and develops proposals provisionally accepted from inventors . The examination of new suggestions and plans is confided to committees of naval officers " in order that technical knowledge and experience shall be brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And between the naval officers on the one hand and the consultants and the Royal Society on the other , logically stands the coordinating Central Committee , with a consummate seaman at its head . No one has announced that he is going to invent anything , no one has suggested any " laboratory , " and no member is known to be engaged in selling anything to the Government . The object is not to teach the naval officers their business , nor to build up the political fences of the Admiralty 's First Lord , but to assist the admiralty in coordinating and encouraging scientific effort in relation to the requirements of the naval service . ENCOURAGING INVENTION It is questionable , however , whether any permanent organization of civilian advisers is suited to our naval needs . Intelligent as American naval officers are , the fact that their profession removes them from close contact with the business world and involves much engrossing detail and routine renders them cautious ? and sometimes over-cautious ? in accepting innovations . When the individual is translated from active service afloat to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lawyers , promoters , contractors , and the like , his caution increases , and is apt to take the form of imposing counsels of perfection upon newly proposed ideas . He tends less to give credit for what has been accomplished than to reject the improvement altogether , because it has not attained some arbitrary standard of his own fixing . Conditions such as this delayed our adoption of the submarine , the telescope-sight and many other inventions which , altho originating here , found their first utilization abroad . This sort of supercaution militates against the advantage which this country possesses in being the most inventive nation in the world . What we need and have long needed is a more progressive spirit , a greater toleration among the naval officers who are called upon to judge , and more direct official encouragement for those seeking judgment . It is believed that this can be secured by the assistance of civilian experts , not to supplant the naval officers ' judgment , but to enlarge the horizon within which he exercizes it . The problem of which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the inventors of the country . They should be assured that counsels of perfection will no longer be insisted upon , and that whatever a man may be found to have actually done in the way of progress will be credited to him . Each solution should be passed upon by experts conversant with the subject-matter of the particular problem involved ; and each group of judges should include a majority of naval officers and a minority of civilians , the function of the latter being to bring in the views of the world outside of that bounded by the naval circle . The point is not that these outside views shall prevail , but that they shall be considered . It will be immaterial , therefore , if a given group should on any question divide with the naval officers on one side and the minority of civilians on the other . The former would have had the benefit of the latter 's views , and the final and deciding authority in such case might also have them in the form of a minority dissenting report . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gives them the means of seeing and approaching their problems from standpoints different from their own . There is no lack of such civilian experts , and surely no lack of the patriotism which would render them willing to serve . Such service would be an honor to be prized , and unlike that of the present Board it should be made legal by compensation . Where an idea has been found to be practical and useful so far as it goes , the Government may properly undertake its further development . This may be done by its direct employment in the fleet or in a reserve or obsolete vessel or vessels specially set apart for trial purposes , or in private establishments or Navy Yards where facilities for the particular trials needed are available . Based upon a study of naval needs and naval invention extending now over a period of half a century , the present writer is unable to avoid the conclusion that the Naval Advisory Board as now created is not adapted to rendering useful assistance to the Navy .
