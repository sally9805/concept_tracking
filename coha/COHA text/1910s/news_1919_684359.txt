txt INTERVENTION IN RUSSIA , Action by the Allies Urged in the Interest of Our Own Safety . To the Editor of The New York Times : Is intervention In Russian affairs de-sirable ? ? From the purely objective historical point of view the answer is obviously " No . " First of all , the very necessity of foreign aid for the solution of a national problem is humiliating for any nation , and a nation which has undergone such a humiliation will undoubtedly be deficient in so serious a factor for her regeneration as self-respect . ' Secondly , a Bolshevism which is not outlived , but merely suppressed , is like a contagious disease which is cured only superficially , . leaving the organism permeated with the poison . If the country suffers from this plague to the end , then , though many die , those who survive will be cured forever . The nation will fully realize that happiness and well-being can be based only on work and production , never on robbery , whatever names this latter may assume , Bolshevism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia even before the war was very poor . Her national income was er , timated at bbtween 12,000,000,000 and 15,000,000,000 rubles , ( as against $120,000,000,000 yearly income of the United States . ) All Russian industrial and banking stock amounted in value to $3,000,000,000 . The amount oft wealth ' , that could be stolen was evidently small . Nevertheless , Bolshevism in Russia , found it possible to exist for more than a year . It is true that in many parts of the country the starvation of the masses has already begun , but in other parts , such as the Ukraine and Siberia , . the stores of food are still abundant , and if regained by the Boisheviki these districts can furnish enough new fuel to the dying-out furnace of Bolshevism in Russia . If the Russian national army does not get the promised support from the Bolshevism has every opportunity to infect Russian life perhaps for a whole year more . But if the reserves put away by the productive part of the population were sufficient for the maintenance of Bolshevistic idling for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many yearn would this plague last In rich . countries : when the latter are affected , which seems quite inevitable ? There can be little doubt that Russia ! will have plenty of time to recover and be regenerated before the wealthy countries liquidate their own Bolshevist experiments , the Russian losses and sufferings will be comparatively Insignificant , and a " new Life " will be begun by Russians under far better conditions . Summarizing , we can say that a Russian statesman , following a purely national egotistic view , may never preach intervention in Russian affairs . But , besides national egotism , a Russian statesman has ever in mind his duties toward humanity as a whole and toward the other allied nations . We can never forget that in Russia already thousands and thousands of innocent women and children are dying , and if Bolshevism is not stopped immediately millions will die with terrible suffering . Such a hecatomb seems to the Russian statesman too high a price even for the perfect convalescence of the Russian people from the awful social disease through which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that peoples after their temptations in some direction and disappointment in sonic extreme theory , always turn to a directly opposite point of view . Left alone , Russia quite undoubtedly will fall into reaction , and even monarchical restoration . Only the aid of allied democracies can save the democratic idea in Russia . Think of the various dictatorships now rising there ; it is indicative of the near future . Then every true Russian , suffering in his self-esteem from the Brest-Litovsk betrayal , cherishes the hope of having at least this great merit before the whole human race , that he has made at his own expense this terrific experiment , which alas ! is so tempting for too many people in the world . We have this right and feel it our duty to cry aloud : " Mankind , pay attention to Russian events : They are not purely Russian , it is an international danger . The e.esults of Bolshevism in Russia show too clearly what it means . not for the rich people , but for the masses . Per the sake of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he destroyed . The Boisheviki preach brute force , and by force must they be annihilated . " Russia Incurred Bolshevist rule because of her great mistake in assuming that the Bolsheviki are a political party , and could be fought in another way except by force . Do not repeat this blunder ! Every Russian knows by heart the words of President Woodrow Wilson , ' T will stand by Russia . ' We are sure that American support will finally COMP . " We ask not for support , but for attention to our unspeakable sufferings . Let us feel that this suffering is not in vain , but that the whole of Mankind has been saved by it in the same manner that we saved Europe from the Tertars at the dawn of our history . Do not repeat our blunder , which consisted of light-minded disdain of the Bolshevist danger . No country is assured against this plague , and it is easier to fight it in Russia than at home . Save yourself , trot us ! And help us before all to regain our self-esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Duma . New York , Jan. 3 , 1918.
