( Suddenly putting down the magazine ) Mother . MRS . BURKE Yes , dear ? ROBERT I 'm expecting Genevieve presently . MRS . BURKE ( Interested ) Oh , how lovely ! ROBERT ( Annoyed ) I wish , Mother , that you would overcome your habit of making inappropriate and irrelevant ejaculations . MRS .

BURKE Robert dear  --   --  ROBERT ( Interrupting her ) What I wanted to say is , that as Genevieve ca n't stay very long and as there 's something I want to talk with her about , I wish you 'd clear out as soon as she comes .

All the members of Genevieve 's family are in perfect health ; the weather is mild and promises to continue so ; she bought her new hat at Madame Dupont 's and they have n't succeeded yet in getting a cook .

Still  --   --  p. 4 ROBERT Still what ? MRS . BURKE I ca n't help feeling that it 's not quite right for you to talk to Genevieve about things that dare n't be discussed in my presence . ROBERT Dare n't ? It is n't a question of dare n't . It 's a question of psychology . MRS . BURKE ( Dubiously ) Oh ! ROBERT I realize that owing partly to inherited characteristics and partly to your faulty education  --   --  MRS . BURKE ( Sighing ) Yes ; I know , dear . ROBERT Oh , it is n't your fault . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BURKE I 'm afraid you 're right , dear . I 've tried so hard to learn , but I was brought up with the idea that duty is the most important thing in life .

ROBERT But the fact remains that you are a little  --  a little  --  well , let us say , old-fashioned . Consequently , there are certain topics which I refrain from discussing in your presence , because I understand that your somewhat unfortunate hereditary and environmental background has rendered you incapable of agreeing with me. p. 5 MRS . BURKE That 's sweet and dear of you , Robert . Still , Genevieve is a young girl  --   --  ROBERT ( Proudly ) Genevieve is a New Woman . And it is I who have made her a New Woman . MRS . BURKE Yes , that 's just it . It 's because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older  --   --  ROBERT I ca n't listen to any more of this , Mother . I 've been very patient with you , but , really , these objections are an unwarranted intrusion upon my liberty . As Father says , " This household is founded upon the principle of unqualified freedom  --  freedom of thought , freedom of speech and freedom of conduct . " MRS . BURKE I know , dear , and I try to live up to it . But , sometimes , it makes it so difficult for one to say and do what one would like to . ROBERT ( Magnanimously ) Well , we 'll say no more about it . ( He goes back to the " Masses . " ) MRS . BURKE ( After a pause ) Robert , dear . ROBERT ( Ostensibly annoyed , but secretly pleased by the interruption ) Well ? MRS . BURKE Have you ever thought of marrying Genevieve ? p. 6 ROBERT ( Very much provoked ) Marrying Genevieve ! What put that into your head ? MRS . BURKE Nothing . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ROBERT ( Disgusted ) Match ! You talk like Queen Victoria at her worst . MRS . BURKE Well , you know what I mean . She 's a nice , quiet girl , and you 've known each other since infancy . It 's almost like a family affair . ROBERT Do I understand that you 're deliberately trying to inveigle me into a marriage with Genevieve ? MRS . BURKE Of course not , dear . But you seem so fond of each other , that I thought  --   --  ROBERT What has that to do with it ? Do you think I 'd allow myself to be influenced by a mere sentimental attachment ? MRS . BURKE Not altogether , of course . You 've too much common sense for that . But Genevieve 's parents are well-to-do , and  --   --  ROBERT Oh , Mother ! MRS . BURKE I 'm sorry , dear . ROBERT ( Angrily ) This is really inexcusable  --  your attempting to force Genevieve upon me . It 's an unwarrantable infringement of my liberty . p. 7 MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your good  --   --  ROBERT ( Pacing the room ) You 've upset all my plans . MRS . BURKE ( Rather alarmed ) What plans ? ROBERT You 've endangered my whole future . MRS . BURKE ( Anxiously ) What is it , dear ? ROBERT ( Facing her ) The reason I wanted to speak to Genevieve alone this afternon is that I might have an opportunity to ask her to marry me . MRS . BURKE ( Greatly relieved ) Oh , I 'm so glad ! ROBERT Now I sha n't do it . MRS . BURKE ( Amazed ) Why not ? ROBERT Because I feel that it is no longer a free choice . The whole thing has degenerated into a romance . MRS . BURKE Nonsense , Robert ; no one would ever accuse you of being romantic . ROBERT ( Brightening somewhat ) You think not ? MRS . BURKE I 'm sure of it . Just you go on and propose to Genevieve without paying the slightest attention to my wishes in the matter . p. 8 ROBERT I 'll think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have forced me to the conclusion that domestic life is incompatible with the principle of freedom . ( Shaking his head gravely ) Yes , I 'm afraid that the family must go . MRS . BURKE ( Gently reproachful ) I 've promised to go , dear , as soon as Genevieve arrives . ROBERT ( Pityingly ) Poor Mother , I 'm afraid we shall never make a New Woman of you . ( The DOORBELL rings . ) There 's Genevieve . MRS . BURKE I 'll just pass the time of day and then I 'll slip out . ROBERT ( Generously ) Very well . ( GENEVIEVE enters R.C. from the street , carrying several books . She is about twenty and looks like the kind of a girl who reads Henry James and likes him . ) GENEVIEVE Good afternoon . MRS .

GENEVIEVE Yes . ( She hands him a book ) I 've just finished it . ROBERT ( Looks at the book and grunts ) Is it any good ? GENEVIEVE ( Enthusiastically ) It 's charming ! I enjoyed every word of it . MRS . BURKE What is it , dear ? GENEVIEVE " Survivals of Cannibalism in Tasmania . " MRS . BURKE ( Resignedly ) Oh !

Where did you  --   --  ( Rather pettishly as she remembers ) Oh , yes , of course . This freedom is getting stricter all the time .

ROBERT ( With determination ) Genevieve , there 's something I want to ask you  --   --  GENEVIEVE ( Interested at once ) Yes . ROBERT Something I 've been wanting to ask you for a long time . ( He stops . ) GENEVIEVE ( After a pause ) Well  --  what is it , Robert ? ROBERT Ca n't you guess ? GENEVIEVE Why , no !  --  I have n't the slightest idea .

GENEVIEVE When shall we be married ? ROBERT There 's no hurry about that . GENEVIEVE No , of course not ; three or four weeks from now will be soon enough . This is all so unexpected . Oh , you dear boy ! ( She goes to him impulsively and is about to kiss him . ) ROBERT ( Stopping her ) Genevieve ! Remember what you told me about the transmission of pulmonary diseases . GENEVIEVE ( Dejectedly ) Yes , of course ! How stupid of me to have forgotten .

They both seem to enjoy it . ROBERT , drawing away at length ) We must n't become sentimental , Genevieve . GENEVIEVE There 's no danger of that . ROBERT We must n't descend to mere vulgar love-making . GENEVIEVE You do love me , do n't you ? ROBERT I ca n't say that I do  --   --  GENEVIEVE ( Alarmed ) Robert !

But there 's no danger of Father 's objecting . He 's all for freedom . Are you going to tell your parents ? GENEVIEVE Oh , I 've told them already . ( Hastily ) That is  --  of course , I 'll tell them ! I must go now . It 's late . ROBERT There 's just one point . I do n't want to be consulted about  --  about whatever arrangements are to be made . I regard my consent to any ceremony at all as a sufficient surrender of my liberty to relieve me from the annoyance of planning the details . GENEVIEVE ( Sighing ) Very well . I suppose I 'll have to do it , then . Let me see , there was something I wanted to ask you . Oh , yes , I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GENEVIEVE You said something about  --  about children . ROBERT Of course . p. 15 GENEVIEVE Had you thought of them at all  --  in the way of numbers ? ROBERT Well , I should say five . GENEVIEVE Five ? ROBERT As a maximum . GENEVIEVE Oh ! Yes , five will be all right as a maximum . Well , I must really go . ( Expectantly ) Good-bye . ROBERT ( Kissing her ) We must n't make a practice of this sort of thing . GENEVIEVE ( Kissing him ) Certainly not . BURKE ( Enters R.C. ) Oh , I beg your pardon ! ( He is about to withdraw . ) GENEVIEVE ( Stopping him ) I 'm just going . Good afternoon . BURKE Good afternoon , my dear . ( He looks after her thoughtfully as she exits R.C. ) ROBERT ( Bursting out ) Well , Father , I 'd like to know what you mean by tearing in here like that .

BURKE And I have the right to refrain from discussing it . There is  --   --  ROBERT What ? BURKE Will you do me the kindness of holding your tongue for a moment ?

But I insist upon my right to freedom of speech . BURKE I concede you that right . Is there anything else ? ROBERT Nothing . And now that you have conceded my right , I am willing to permit you to exercise yours . Proceed . ( Sits R. of table L. ) BURKE Thank you . I want to talk to you about Genevieve . ROBERT ( Displeased ) Genevieve ? BURKE ( After a moment 's hesitation ) Yes . I thought that as I came in I saw you kissing Genevieve . ( He stops . ) ROBERT Well ? BURKE Did I ? p. 18 ROBERT That is a question which it is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ROBERT How do I know whether or not you saw me kissing Genevieve ? BURKE Well , were you kissing her ? ROBERT I decline either to challenge or to corroborate the testimony of your senses . BURKE Robert , I want to know whether there is anything between you and Genevieve . ROBERT By what right do you ask that question ? BURKE By no right ; but  --   --  ROBERT Very well . As a mere matter of courtesy , then , I do n't mind telling you that Genevieve has consented to become my mate . BURKE Do you mean your wife ? ROBERT ( Annoyed ) Well , I suppose it will come to the same thing . BURKE I was afraid of it ! ROBERT Afraid ? BURKE Yes . Robert , you must make up your mind to relinquish Genevieve . ROBERT I 'm afraid I do n't understand . p. 19 BURKE You must give her up . Marriage between you is out of the question . ROBERT I really do n't follow . BURKE I ca n't explain . It 's impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a long shot . How do you mean impossible ? BURKE I mean simply that you ca n't marry Genevieve . ROBERT Why ? BURKE Because  --  because  --  well , because I forbid it . ROBERT ( Outraged ) Forbid ? BURKE Yes . ROBERT If this is a joke , I consider it very illtimed . BURKE It 's not a joke . I never was more in earnest in my life . ( As ROBERT is about to explode ) Listen to me for a moment . Have I ever , within your memory , forbidden you to do anything ? ROBERT ( Belligerently ) I should think not . BURKE Exactly . You were brought up on the principle that a human being is a free agent ; that the aim of human life is unrestricted self-expression and that unqualified freedom of thought , speech and conduct is the sine qua non of an endurable existence . I have never in the least degree attempted to curtail your liberty . Even when you were an infant , I insisted , at the cost of interminable colloquies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry whenever you elected to do so . p. 20 ROBERT Well , what 's the good of going into all that ? BURKE Merely to convince you that I would not lightly oppose or attempt to restrain any wish or desire of yours . But , in this instance , I regard the obstacle to your marriage to Genevieve as of sufficient importance to override , for once , my principles , and to justify my arbitrary refusal to permit the marriage to be consummated . ROBERT Father , I 've listened to you with a great deal of patience  --  with more patience than I would have given myself credit for possessing  --  because I have observed from time to time that , misguided and deplorable as your conduct usually is , it is always actuated by praiseworthy motives . But if you think that any attempt upon your part to oppose my marriage to Genevieve will meet with anything but a militant response , you do my self-respect an injustice . BURKE Then you refuse to break your engagement to Genevieve ? ROBERT Not only do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrying her three weeks from now , as was my original intention , I shall marry her tomorrow . ( Looking at his watch ) By thunder , I 'll do it tonight ! BURKE ( With determination ) Very well . There is nothing left for me , then , but to tell the truth . p. 21 ROBERT Well , go ahead . But I assure you that whatever it is , it wo n't have the slightest effect upon me . BURKE ( Clearing his throat ) Robert , freedom has always been the keynote of your life . You were suckled at the sacred fount of  --   --  ROBERT But why go over all that again ? BURKE So that you will not allow your judgment to be colored by your passions when you hear what I have to tell you . In your life , respect for tradition has played no part . You have been taught , and rightly , to scoff at laws , at regulations , at social conventions , at antiquated codes of morality . These things are but chains which bind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free we must strike off these shackles  --   --  ROBERT ( Interrupting ) For the love of Haeckel , why do you always talk as though you were in Cooper Union ? BURKE I 'm simply trying to remind you that while I was inculcating this spirit of liberty in you , I , of course , reserved to myself the right of freedom of conduct  --  the right of self-expression  --   --  ROBERT For pity 's sake , get to the point ! BURKE You can not , therefore , be very greatly surprised to learn that Genevieve is your half-sister . p. 22 ROBERT ( Thunderstruck ) My  --   --  ! BURKE Yes . ROBERT ( Furious ) You  --  you  --   --  BURKE ( Rising , holding up a warning hand ) Robert , remember ! ROBERT ( Trying to control himself ) Of course . It 's rather sudden , you know . BURKE ( After a moment ) Well , what have you to say ? ROBERT ( Gulping hard ) Nothing . Except that it 's damned unfortunate that your self-expression had to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out of the question . ROBERT Of course . ( Querulously ) It seems to me , Father , that you might have considered me just a little more . BURKE ( Apologetically ) You were very young at the time . I 'm genuinely sorry about it , but  --   --  ROBERT Well , there 's no use talking about it . It should be a lesson for you for the future , though . Are you going to tell Mother ? p. 23 BURKE Well  --  er  --  I was n't exactly planning to . ROBERT She 's got to know . BURKE Why ? ROBERT Because I told her that I was going to ask Genevieve to marry me . BURKE Ca n't you say that Genevieve refused you ? ROBERT ( Haughtily ) Do you think that even a credulous woman would believe that Genevieve refused me ? BURKE Tell her I 'm opposed to the marriage . ROBERT She knows that would n't have the slightest effect upon me . BURKE ( Rubbing his chin ) This makes it very awkward . ROBERT Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Certainly not . But your mother is  --  well  --  just a little old-fashioned , and she may not see things just as you and I do . ROBERT Do you think  --   --  ( The door L. opens . ) BURKE ' Sh ! Here she is now . ( Sits on sofa. ) p. 24 MRS . BURKE ( Enters ) Good evening , John . May I come in ? BURKE Just wait a few minutes , Felicia . ( She is about to go out again . ) ROBERT No , come in , Mother . BURKE No , wait ! ROBERT Come in , I tell you . MRS . BURKE ( Who has been bobbing back and forth ) Well , what am I to do ? I 'd like to get those socks , if it 's possible . ROBERT There 's no use putting things off , Father . BURKE ( With a sigh ) Very well . ROBERT Come in , Mother . MRS . BURKE Thank you , dear . ( She goes to the table and resumes her darning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll talk to Mother . I 'm more tactful than you . Just leave us alone together . BURKE ( Rising ) Thank you , my boy . ( He is about to go . ) MRS . BURKE Dinner is at seven , John . Try to be ready . ( Holding up a sock ) And I wish , dear , that you would n't insist upon giving your toes so much liberty . It 's awfully hard on your socks . p. 25 BURKE Yes , of course . ( He throws a last look at ROBERT and goes out L. ) ROBERT ( After a moment ) Mother , there 's something I want to talk to you about . MRS . BURKE Yes , dear . Is it about Genevieve ? ROBERT Yes . MRS . BURKE Did you ask her ? ROBERT Yes . MRS . BURKE And she  --   --  ? ROBERT Accepted , of course . MRS . BURKE ( Effusively ) Oh , how lovely ! I congratulate you , dear . She 's just the girl for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stopping her ) I have just learned that it is impossible for me to marry her . MRS . BURKE Why , what do you mean ? ROBERT I 'm going to tell you . It 's a little difficult for me to explain  --   --  MRS . BURKE I 'm completely bewildered , Robert . ROBERT As you know , Mother , Father and I are very liberal in our views . We believe in absolute and unqualified freedom . To us , society 's taboos and restrictions are but so many barriers between the individual and the expression of his will . It is our belief that all mob-imposed standards of conduct and codes of morality should be swept aside . p. 26 MRS . BURKE Yes , but I do n't see  --   --  ROBERT I 'm coming to that . Father and I have from time to time endeavored to convert you from your  --  well , let us say , old-fashioned way of thinking to our own broader views . But without success . MRS . BURKE I 'm so sorry , dear . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not blaming you . But the point I want to make is that you should not be surprised or shocked to learn of conduct on our part which you would regard as  --  shall we say  --  unconventional . MRS . BURKE ( Worried ) Why , Robert , what have you been doing ? ROBERT It does n't concern me . It 's Father . MRS . BURKE ( Relieved ) Oh , I 'm glad of that . ROBERT It is natural , in view of what I have been saying , that Father has now and then overstepped what your conservative mind regards as the limits of propriety . MRS . BURKE I suppose so . ROBERT So that it need n't be a matter of great surprise to you to learn that the reason that I ca n't marry Genevieve is that  --  that  --  that  --   --  p. 27 MRS . BURKE Yes . ROBERT That she  --  that is to say , that Father  --  because I  --  I  --  Father  --   --  MRS . BURKE Whatever is it , dear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genevieve is my half-sister . There ! I 've told you ! MRS . BURKE You mean  --  - ? ROBERT Exactly . MRS . BURKE Oh ! ( She darns thoughtfully . ) ROBERT You must n't be too hard on Father  --  - MRS . BURKE No , no . ( After a pause ) About your marriage with Genevieve , dear . ROBERT That 's out of the question , of course . MRS . BURKE Not at all . ( WARN Curtain . ) ROBERT What ? MRS . BURKE Go on with your plans just the same . ROBERT But Mother , you do n't seem to understand . Genevieve is Father 's daughter . MRS . BURKE I understand , dear . But that does n't matter . p. 28 ROBERT Does n't matter ? Why , it makes me her half-brother ! MRS . BURKE ( Quietly ) No , it does n't . ROBERT What ? MRS . BURKE It 's quite all right , dear . I assure you that there is no relationship whatever between you and Genevieve . ROBERT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . BURKE Just so . ROBERT Well ! ! ! ! ! ( He sinks into a chair , completely overcome . ) MRS . BURKE ( Darning quietly ) You see , dear , it was the fault of my education . I had always been taught that it is a wife 's duty to live up to her husband 's principles . ( She sighs ) Oh , dear , I wonder if I shall ever finish these socks . ( A pause )
