txt Those who lived in the time of Jesus Christ had no idea of how the history of humanity was to be affected by the coming of Christianity . During the barbaric invasions nobody took into account what transformations they involved . Nobody knew that therefrom might result the death of civilization for a thousand years . If people had realized the meaning of these things they would have made better defense against them . At the time of the French Revolution people had no idea of the tremendous consequences it was to : bring ; of the far distance they would reach . Today , gentlemen , I think we are confronted , not with an ordinary War which will simply involve a certain changing of frontiers , with things after that very ? much as they were before . We are faced by a catastrophe involving the whole of the human race ; ' we have before our eyes the declining twilight of one world , preceding the dawn of another and a new . And note , gentlemen , how grave is the problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of accepting a gratuitous increase of territory , throwing herself of her own free will into the horrors of war . And it is not alone the people of Europe who are throbbing with excitement today . Have you never asked yourselves what these new nations are doing in the great conflict  --  the young republics founded by the Anglo-Saxons across the ocean ? Why is it that we see Canada , Australia , New Zealand enrolling from 7 to 8 per cent . of their populations as volunteers for the front ? Is it for love of the Motherland ? Sentiment does not move humanity to such a degree as that . How is it the conscience of the United States of America has become uneasy ? Out of love for England ? Nothing of the sort , gentlemen . To attack Great Britain has always been recognized as a safe and popular note by orators in the United States ; it is known as " twisting the British lion 's tall . " Why , then , is it disturbed , this democracy of a hundred million souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation of a civilization without prejudices , with no class distinctions , with no monarchy , no militarism , no hindrance of any sort  --  a civilization based solely on the nationalist sovereignty carried . to its extremist limits ? This entire movement can have but one explanation , namely , that we are confronted with a transformation of the human race , a transformation which expresses itself in the form of a general massacre . It is a. struggle between two worlds , and we shall see which of the two shall succeed in obtaining the mastery . Were it otherwise this , war would not be possible , and it would not be waged with the fury that distinguishes it from all others . Gentlemen , the truth is that in this war , which was most certainly provoked by the Germans , we see the last attempt made by a single people to secure for itself a universal hegemony . If the German soldier were to win today the first result would be that the same military force , which is the greatest in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no more independence , no more liberty for any one in the world , not even for the great American democracy . If ever the day should come when one and the same State had domination not only on land but also on sea  --  the day on which the Roman Empire should be reconstituted in conformity with the affirmation once made by the Emperor William that the time would come when all men would be happy to call themselves German . just as formerly one exclaimed joyously , " Civis Romanus sum , " then the free life of each one of us would be at an end . Well , and what is the basis of this attempt that Is being made ? Is it found-ed on some higher state of civilization ? Is it justified by a superiority of such a nature that it should have the right to dominate the whole world , with the rest of us content to run behind the conqueror in his triumphal car ? You ' will have noticed that M. Stere. who was compelled , of course , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way  --  in his speech could do no more than declare that it would be an injustice to deny , the Germans credit for their contribution to the common treasure of human civilization . But who ever dreamed of denying them their due share of credit ? And what , after all , is this contribution of Germany 's ? Is it of finer quality than that produced by France , for instance , or than that of Italy . or than that furnished by the Anglo-Saxon races ? Is there a single hypothesis among ail the hypotheses forming the basis and the poetry of science ; is there one of all the discoveries which have contributed to the progress  --  the material progress  --  of modern life ; is there one among all the ideas that have roused the world to enthusiasm ; is there one of all the creations of art ' which would be lost it we were to remove Germany 's contribution ? No. gentlemen , the treasure possessed by the human race would remain intact , a little reduced , to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remain as it was before . What is there in the assets of Germany to set against the extraordinary productions of our neo-Latin civilization ? One thing alone there is that is characterIstic in Germanic culture , and that is its political organization , which to us . is a puzzle . How is it possible to reconcile an ultra-modern economic organization with a political organization dating from the Middle Ages ? How reconcile a teaching so generalized , a material well-being so highly developed , with a. cal system which enables one man to declare , " My will is the highest law , " or , " I owe my power not to the assent of the German people , but solely to the Divine mission with which I have been Intrusted - on earth " ? Such are the characteristics of German civilization , of the far-famed Rultur . And , gentlemen , that springs , unhappily , from the , manner in which the unity of Germany has been formed. * If this German uniby had sprung from the Liberal movement of 1548 , a great new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe . But German unification is the product of Prussian " caporalism , " with regard to which a very intelligent Teuton holding a high position remarked to me five or six months ago : " You are right , all You say Is true ; there is nothing more antipathetic than Prussian ' caporalism , ' but it is invincible , and we are forced to accept it just as we accept the Deluge or the locust , just as we accept , in fact , all the ills that Fate may send us . " But , gentlemen , that is not the fact . While M. Diamandy was speaking of the battle of the Marne some one replied that it was just an engagement like any other . To which I retort : It was not a battle , it was an historic moment , it was the proof that even the brute force of " caporalism , " in a State in which one man can proclaim that the highest law is his own will , may be vanquished by the armies of a democratic republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline and loss of virtue . And if such is the meaning of the war now raging , how can it be supposed that it can end with the customary - peace , the sort of peace in which so many gold-laced , decorated plenipotentiaries will discuss a lot of nothings , around green cloth ? Can one imagine that it will end like a duel with button-tipped foils , in which the swordsman hit exclaims , " Touche ! " and after shaking hands and putting the weapons in their case the two adversaries go off and drink to each other 's health ' : No , gentlemen . today it is a war of nations rather than a war of armies ; the conscience of all the races is awakened ; this war must and will go on until one of the two sides shall have been 11 crushed in such a manner that the victor shall be able to impose his rule . upon the vanquished . No other peace will be acceptable to the nations . If Germany is victorious her rule wilt be the rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen by God ; if the others win  --  Ad they will  --  the law they will impose will be the law of justice , in order that the whole world may enjoy the benefits of civilization . ' Such is the problem . But you will ask me : " What ! Is Germany to disappear ? " Who can imagine any such thing ? It Is Austria that might and should vanish away . Austria ought to have disappeared long ago . When she has vanished-from sight a general sigh of relief will be heard ; every one will be glad that at last she has paid the price of centuries of wickedness , for you may search the pages of her history through and through and you shall not find that she has done good to any one of any sort , while many and many have been the sufferers from her treachery and her brutality . What would I not give to any one who should point out to me a single good action ever done by this monarchy ? And things being as they are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest ? I forget who it was said just new that it was childish to introduce the idea of morality into International politics . How slight must be his acquaintance with the philosophy of history . Individuals , like peoples , pay the price of the offenses they commit against morality . In the one case punishment follows immediately , in the other case it is delayed , but there would be no order in the universe , life would be without value were it not that we have the conviction of the existence of moral law above us . And if , gentlemen , the problem is as I see it ; if the events through which we are passing are as I have attempted to describe them , how can one talk of neutrality ? Is there a single State throughout the world which will not be affected , which will not be transformed by the results of this war ? No , gentlemen , there is not one . But note this difference : There are some States which will suffer from the consequences of the war without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword rust in its scabbard ; others there are which , while suffering no less severely from the effects of the conflict , will at least have a hearing ; their utterance will either be that of the conqueror , who decides , or that of the vanquished , who , having done his duty , may rightly claim the respect of the victor .
