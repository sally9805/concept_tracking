txt Very few passengers are allowed on the bridge of trans-Atlantic liners . That bridge has become expandal in the modern vessel until it is now one vast workshop as well as officers ' hotel . It was first expanded to a steering , room , then by chartroom , then by captain 's quarters and now it embraces extended officers ' quarters an I the most important adjunct to a ship , wireless with rooms of machinery and duplicate machinery . The bridge has practically become a deck . There have been wonderful inventions during the war in wireless work and wireless mechanics and most of them arc still held as war secrets . THE WIRELESS High land towers for wireless operations are probably a thing of the past . No longer do you note : ; parks on a mass of wires over the ships . You can now receive N.-ireless messages in a wooden or brick house with the windows closed and no outside connection . The Tesla theory is being adopted that the vibrations , go through the earth and not through the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the world has apparatus to receive , and it requires only a $200 wireless receiver to hear everything around the world on any wave . A wireless operator told me that he was once in Argentina with a wireless receiver concealed in a bed of flowers on the mantel and he was able to read everything passing around the world . Working stations in England can hear the sending from California stations . There are three big Marconi stations already set up for world-around service after the war . In March this year the Marconi people were successful in crossing the North Atlantic with wireless telephone , but that department is still in the experimental stage . No MORE CABLES It is highly probable that there will never be another eccan cable built ; but for some time there will be weak enough for all cables . The necessity for international law and international agreement is now greater than ever . It took many generations to snake the law of the sea . Now there must be international law for the atmosphere . international agreement is being rapidly formulated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship work and give *hips their turn in sending . From shore wireless operators on certain ships are told to stop and others arc given their turn . Ocean liners have three wireless operators working in relays of four hours each , but in active wartime the relays run in two hours as a man can not be relied upon for more than two hours ' steady wireless work . WIRELESS MAY BECOME COMMON The danger in wireless operation is that it may become too common . An outfit it not expensive and a wireless machine that can take or send anything up to ten thousand meter waves costs only a few thousand dollars . Some apparatus can go as high as 25,000 meter . waves , tut the ncnnal working wave on the ocean is one of six hundred meters . The lowest working wave is that used by airplanes and runs between 50 and 100 mete:s . If the apparatus is rightly attuned , 600-meter waves will not interfere with 700 ? meter waves and so on up , making hundreds of new additional zones for wireless telegraphy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the atmosphere or earth itself will new permit more than two hundred different beds , wave lengths or electric zones in which wireless operations may be simultaneously conducted ! While during the war the ears and voice of the ship have been so mightily improved , down in the bottom of the ship another pair of cars has been expanded by the submarine signal development so that movements may be heard of approaching ships , submarines or distant shores . CLEARING TICE SHIP 'S VISION Has anything been done for the eye of a ship ? Certainly , in front of the big chartroom is a big wheelhouse where the steersman knows nothing concerning where the ship is going except as a voice gives him the direction from the bridge and he follows with his eye on the illuminated compass by the wheel . The safety of the ship is with the lookout and as the center of the bridge is now glass encased , it is quite important that the glass front show clear at all times . Now in rain , sleet or snow or freezing or foggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window or wipe a pane of glass . If he doubts the clearness of his vision he touches a switch by the window frame ant a circle of glass in the center of the window revolves at meat speed and ensures him vision , perfectly free and clear . Later you will probably see the same invention in the glass fronts of touring automobiles . HEROISM ON THE SEA Abroad , or crossing the ocean one hears many tales of individual heroism and hardship both on land and sea . Only those are worth noting that are record  --  bleaker &; I have heard people boast of their ability to stay up all night and do good work the next day . Some have kept their post in hospital , war or political warfare ' for two nights and days without sleep . But , crossing the ocean , I got a record that I think will stand for a long time without parallel . Captain Wolfe , staff captain of the ' Aquitania , told me at luncheon one day as follows when I asked him if he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , 1917 , five hundred miles off the west coast of Ireland . There were S9 in the crew and 47 were saved . Two boats capsized and two reached the Irish coast . There were 27 with me in my beat and for five days and night ? ; I had to hold the tiller and ride the waves with a gale behind and only a few feet of sail . A WORLD RECORD " I never before thought people could go five days and nights without sleep , but nobody would take the helm from mo and I had to steer that boat straight through ever ; rave emit . Of course , we were all drenched through and through . Five days later we were picked up off the Lizar'l in the English Channel . It took me two months in the hospital to recover my nerve and get back into the sleep habit . The hospital was more terrible than the fight for life on the ocean . At first , I would wake up in bed in drippiqg perspiration and with such horrible nightmare= that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed again . " Only one who has bobbed up and down on wave crests in a good blow can realize the strain on the nerves of : uch a rack as Captain Wolfe passed through probably in duraCon unprecedented in the history of the world .
