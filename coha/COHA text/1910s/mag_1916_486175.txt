0 . G. ' Sonneck , who has charge of the musical department in the Library of Congress , in his volume of essays on music , " Suum Cuique , " just published by G. Schirmer , discusses the " New Uplift in Italy 's Musical Life . " The almost exclusive devotion of the Italians to the opera has been chiefly responsible for the degradation that called for a " new uplift . " The Catalogo generale of the mammoth publishing house of G. Ricordi included , in the year 1900 , 320 composers of operas , with 1,165 works , and only 24 composers of string quartets , with 47 works . Nearly all of the operas are as ephemeral as newspapers . " We really do not know , " writes the famous Italian critic , G. Ferrero , " whether we ought to believe in an artistic future for this nation , once so abounding in men of genius . " The hopes based on lVfascagni and Leoncavallo have proved futile . Their complete works , so far as the public is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " I Pagliacci , " and even this combination depends for its audience largely on a cast ineluding Caruso . Puccini has done much better ; but even he ceased being a genius after he had composed " Madams , Butterfly . " Among the younger men the most prominent are Giordano , Montemezzi , and Zandonai ; but none of these has as yet produced a masterwork or one giving promise of a successor to Verdi and Puccini . The latest to find a- place in the big Ricordi catalogue is Riccardo Zandonai , whose " Conchita " was sung in 1913 in Chicago and New York ; it is interesting chiefly because of its Spanish coloring . An earlier work by the same composer , " The Cricket on the Hearth , " was staged at Turin in 1908 , while its successor , " Francesca da Rimini , " was first heard in 1914 , also in Turin . After being produced in LOndon , with considerable success , it was selected by Mr. Gatti-Casazza as the principal novelty of the season at the Metropolitan Opera House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large audience to hear it and a great deal of applause , led by a vigorous claque , after each act ; but it is doubtful if the opera will prove a more lasting success than any of the other new Italian operas produced by the present manager . It is fascinating in spots , but there is no trace of the melodic genius which made Italy famous . The story of the guilty love and sad fate of Francesca and Paolo is most widely known through Dante 's allusion to it . Gabriele d'Annunzio expanded it into a tragedy , which was heard in this country some years ago with Mme. Duse as the heroine . Tito Riccordi made a libretto of it by simply condensing the play , and the opera book prepared by the publishers for London and New York is , fortunately , not the usual hackwork , but follo'ws Arthur Symons 's excellent translation . As expanded by d'Annunzio , the story set to music by Zandonai shows in the first act how Francesca is snared into a political marriage with the deformed Giovanni Malatesta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's handsome younger brother , Paolo , whom she has seen but once , long enough , in the impulse of love at first sight , to give him a rose , but without exchanging a word . In the second act the stage presents a realistic picture of medieval warfare between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines . Francesca follows Paolo , and when he is seemingly injured by a shaft passing through his hair , the touch of her hand fans the flame of his love to fierce passion . He is appointed Captain of the Commune of Florence , but the longing to be with Francesca brings him back soon . Alone in her apartment they read together about love in the story of Launcelot and Guinivere , and their lips meet . There is a third brother , who has also made love to Francesca . Spurned by her , he turns spy and tells Giovanni of their secret meetings . In the last scene the husband surprises them , and both are pierced by his sword . For operatic purposes this is a good plot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made good use of his opportunities , especially in the war music of the second act , which , to be sure , is modern ( without being ultra modern ) , while the warfare itself is medieval , with flying arrows and stones and molten lead poured clowri on the enemy instead of guns . In the interspersed idyllic scenes , however , the music also has a mediaeval coloring , imparted to the score by the use of obsolete instruments like the lute , the viola pomposa , the piffero ( a small oboe used by Italian mountaineers ) , besides the old Roman buccina in the turbulent scenes . The effect is charming , making one wonder why Richard Strauss and other seekers of local color do not make more frequent use of such devices . In the love scenes , unfortunately , Zandonai is much less satisfactory . Here the voice must dominate over the orchestra , and for voice this composer does not write as interestingly as for the instruments . The old Italian style has indeed been topsy-turvied ! There are no striking melodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without striking melodies no opera can win lasting success . It used to be said that Wagner , in his later operas , provided no melodies for the singers ; but dramatic bet canto artists like Lehmann , Nordica , Jean de Reszke exposed the error of that notion . With artists of their rank Zandonai 's opera might live some years . As sung by Mme. Alda , Martinelli , and Amato it gives pleasure  --  in spots  --  but without promise of a future . The orchestral score , which is as difficult as it is praiseworthy , was interpreted by Giorgio Polacco in masterful style . FIENRY T. Firma . Art THE COMPLETION OF A GREAT WORK . A History of Architecture . Vols . I and II by Russell Sturgis . Vols . III and IV by A. L. Frothingham . Vol . III : Gothic in Italy , France , and Northern Europe . Vol . IV : Gothic in Great Britain ? Renaissance ? Modern Architecture . New York : Doubleday , Page &; Co. $5 each . I. The important " History of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the first two volumes appeared in 1907 and 1910 , respectively , has lately , been completed by Prof. A. L. Frothingham , of Princeton , in two additional volumes from the publishing house of Doubleday , Page &; Co. , who took over the enterprise from the Baker &; Taylor Company after Mr. Sturgis 's death . Professor Frothingham is to be congratulated upon the distinguished success with which he has discharged his responsible and delicate task . The original intention was to complete the work in three volumes , for the last of which , however , Mr. Sturgis had prepared little or no material . It was felt by many that , owing to the discursive amplitude of treatment of the matter covered by the first two volumes , a complete change of plan and method would be necessary if all the remaining periods and styles were to be compressed into a single volume , and that this would be to sacrifice many of the merits and advantages signalized in the two that had been published . Professor Frothinghbm evidently shared this feeling , and the delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a sacrifice on the one hand and a change of plan on the other . He wisely decided in favor of the latter course , and expanded the proposed volume into two . In the matter of method , however , he resolved to subordinate his own preference for a more historical treatment of the subject to the more analytical method of the first two volumes . He has thus preserved a general unity of treatment throughout the four volumes at the cost of a sacrifice which many will regret , while commending the author 's self-denial . The second volume brought the history of architecture down to the close of the Romanesque period . The new volumes carry that history through thb Middle Ages and Renaissance and the modern developments . Volume III treats of the Gothic styles exclusive of Great Britain . Volume IV devotes 88 pages to the British Gothic , 230 to the Renaissance , and 13 to modern architecture . In all we have 490 pages assigned to the Gothic styles , less than half that space to the Renaissance , and only 13 pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not spare the space for a more adequate treatment of this last period , it would have been better to omit these scanty pages . To the architect , at least , there is in the work of these two centuries and in the modern movements much that is of profound interest and value . But to the archmologist , to the non-professional student , especially to one who has , like Mr. Frothingham , devoted almost a lifetime to the study of the art of the Middle Ages , this work makes a less cogent appeal . In Volume IV our own Colonial architecture and the interesting Greek revival which followed it , are not even mentioned . The proportioning of space in these volumes evidently represents the relative degrees of the author 's personal interest in the styles he describes rather than an ideal distribution . The preponderance of space devoted to the Gothic styles is perhaps defensible ; and yet how can one justify the omission of even passing reference to such Renaissance monuments as the superb Library of St. Mark at Venice and the palaces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the works of James Gibbs and Somerset House in England , with a mere slurring allusion to the London Houses of Parliament ? Such omissions are the more noticeable because of the considerable space , relatively , devoted to works of the earlier Renaissance of much less intrinsic importance . The author is plainly much more interested in the picturesque , formative phases of the Renaissance than in the more formal , stately , and monumental architecture of its later development : he has no sympathy with the cold " grand manner " of the age of Louis XIV . He reveals himself as fundamentally a Gothicist in his predilections ; not , indeed , a Gothic fanatic , by any means , for he nowhere indulges in those hostile and sweeping condemnations of Rbnaissance design which vitiate the writings of more than one of the English and American critics . But his appreciations of Renaissance works are sympathetic in proportion as these display qualities which ally them in a measure with Gothic design . It is instructive to compare his treatment of the French Renaissance with that , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reginald Blomfield . II . Having made these reservations , one may turn with almost unmixed satisfaction the 490 pages which deal with the Gothic styles . The Introduction to Volume III ( pp. xxvii to xxxii ) deserves to be read by every student of architecture . Book X , with which the volume opens , treats of the rise and evolution of " Gothic " in France . ( Why will writers persist in using the adjective as a noun without the article in this barbarous fashion ? ) Its six chapters discuss the origins of the style ; its development ; figured sculpture and stained glass ; local schools and " later Gothic " ; civil , military , and monastic Gothic ; and the development of architectural detail . Book XI discusses the Gothic styles of southern Europe , in three chapters devoted to Spain , Portugal , and Italy ; the three chapters of Book XII deal with northern Europe ? Germany , the Netherlands , Scandinavia , Switzerland , and Russia . The two chapters on the rise and development of the French Gothic styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membering , and historical development are all adequately and clearly set forth , gathering together what is best and most essential from the works of Viollet-le-Duc , Choisy , and Moore , and shaping this and other material in the light of the author 's own studies and investigations . Capter vi is also worthy of special commendation ; and , indeed , Book X as a whole merits very high praise . Spain and Portugal , in Book XI , . receive more attention and illustration than has been customary in English and American works , and for this we should be grateful . To the Gothic architecture of Italy fifty-five pages are assigned , and it is none too many . The author is a recognized authority on the Cistercian beginnings of the style in Italy , ' and his admiration for the French structural logic does not blind him to the splendor , however illogical from the structural standpoint , of the Italian monuments . Very satisfactory also is his presentation of the German Gothic style , with abundant illustration of monuments too seldom discussed in other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ( Book XIII ) of the fourth volume . To those who have long resented Professor Moore 's unsympathetic and depreciatory treatment of this splendid phase of Gothic architecture , Professor Frothingham 's handling of the subject will make a most welcome appeal . In the opening paragraph of this volume the author declares that England " is a splendid second to France in the race for honor " ; that she " made an independent application of Gothic principles and developed its artistic forms under different norms " ; and " contributed original elements to the common stock . " Dissenting from Moore 's contention that English multiple-ribbed vaulting was a violation of true Gothic principles , he recognizes it as a distinct national contribution to the Gothic system . As in most of the discussions , both in this and in the other volumes of the work , the treatment is rather analytical than historical . But a consecutive historical treatment is peculiarly difficult with the English monuments , each of Which exhibits work of several periods . Especially commendable is the devotion of a section to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic structural design . One might wish fuller accounts of the " open-timber " roofs , of the parish churches , and of towers and spires . But where so much is excellent , it would be invidious to dwell heavily on such minor deficiencies . In the discussion of Gothic architecture in general in these volumes one notes a praiseworthy breadth of view , a general sanity of critical estimates , and the accuracy of trained scholarship . The treatment of vaulting and of buttressing might have been more detailed ; so far as it goes it is sound . Mr. Frothingham distinguishes the Gothic style from all others as the one preiiminently dynamic style , and insists frequently but not too dogmatically on its logic . He repeats what a strict scientist must consider the common error of designating the Gothic system as one of " balanced " thrusts , and refers repeatedly to the " opposed thrust " of the flying buttresses . Some of the thrusts are , indeed , balanced by opposed thrusts ; but the function of the flying arch is to transmit the vault-thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own counter-thrust is almost negligible . III . Turning now from the portions of Professor Frothingham 's work which deal with the Gothic styles to the chapters on the Renaissance , which occupy most of Volume IV , we recognize many of the same merits that make Volume III the best general treatise on Gothic architecture in one volume that has so far appeared in English , at least on this side of the ocean . The first chapter of Book XIV on the origin and evolution of the Italian Renaissance is an analysis at once keen , profound , and broad . Chapters ii on Italian palaces and iii on church architecture are almost as good . In a penetrating observation  --  one of many scattered through both volumes  --  the author remarks that " while it is true the Italians were the least constructive nation in Europe , it is also by a strange contrariety true that in the history of Renaissance architecture it was only the Italians who were called upon to face big constructive problems and facts . " In this , as in many other passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , matter for controversy , or at least discussion ; but at least these passages reveal originality and independence of thought , and an insight very different from the superficial way in which ' , so many writers have been accustomed to follow beaten tracks to trite conclusions . The author sees in the early Renaissance work in Italy , particularly Brunelleschi 's , n natural and gradual transition from the Gothic ; he fully recognizes the persistence-of classic traditions in Italian medieval architecture as the originating source of the classic details of the early Renaissance ; there is in his text no echo of Fergusson 's condemnation of all post-Gothic styles as " imitative or copying styles , " or of Moore 's equally destructive criticism of them for not conforming to the structural logic of the French Gothic . As already observed , however , the treatment of the post-Gothic styles in this volume is not equal in thoroughness or comprehensiveness to that of the Gothic styles . The limited space the author has allowed for the enormous mass of material available precludes the detailed criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to even the most important , and excludes entirely from notice many that might well have been mentioned and illustrated . The preference is given to the earlier phases of the style ; the author 's interest appears to dwindle with every decade after 1525 in Italy and 1600 in France , and many a really notable building of the later Renaissance is left out altogether . The value of What the author has given us is so real and so great that we regret the more that he has not covered with equal or at least proportionate fulness these later as well as the earlier phases . To sum up our estimate of these two volumes : they follow the general plan and scope of the first two , as laid out by Mr. Sturgis . In reviewing the second volume of the series we observed that " Mr. Sturgis is the examiner , the analyzer , the critic . rather than the historian . " Mr. Frothing-ham in his two volumes is more of an historian than was Mr. Sturgis ; but it is still the analytical idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian Renaissance are treated under the heads of Palaces and Churches , after the chapter on Origins and Evolution ; the same period of time is gone over twice , in some cases thrice . The historical march of architectural progress is lost sight of , broken up by these constant retracings of its steps . To some extent , however , a general historical view is presented in the introductions to each book . These surveys are in themselves admirable , and offer some compensation for what seem to the reviewer the deficiencies inherent in the plan adopted in the earlier volumes and followed by Mr. Sturgis 's successor . While the pagination begins anew in each volume , the illustrations are consecutively numbered from No. 1 in Volume III to 855 in Volume IV , which is a bit confusing at first . They are nearly all half-tone prints of excellent quality , so distributed as to be truly illustrative of the text . The architectural diagrams are chiefly taken from Choisy and Viollet-le-Duc . Architects will wish there were more of the diagrams , and especially of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect with Simpson 's " History of Architectural Development " is instructive by the contrast . A most unfortunate oversight by the publishers deserves to be noticed here . They have failed to include a very important full-page plate of the model of St. Maclou at Rouen , referred to in the text in three places as " Plate I , opposite page 122 . " As this model and its importance in exemplifying the methods of architectural practice in the fifteenth century were Mr. Frothingham 's own personal discovery , the omission of the plate appears as an injustice to him , as well as an annoyance to the reader . In other respects the make- up of the volumes is excellent ; the clear printing and broad margins , the excellence of the illustrations , and the fulness of the table of contents and indexes , are highly creditable to the author and publishers . The proofreading , careful in the main , is not wholly impeccable , especially in the index , where , for example , Xanthus is printed Janthus , Labrouste is Labrauste ( also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes S. Georgic ) , SS . Giovanni e Paolo is SS . Giovanie Paolo , Scuola is Scoula , Sarvistan is Sarvistau , Vecchio appears as Veccio , Haarlem as Heerlen , and so on . But such slips are rare in the text . The great weight of these volumes , printed on the heaviest of well-loaded plate-paper , is a physical inconvenience which one will gladly bear with in view of the value of their contents , their thorough scholarship , breadth of view , and sanity of criticism . A new monthly magazine , the Art World , visibly announces its conservative tendency by a cover design of a triumphal arch enclosing a bust of Zeus . It promises championship of all forms of ideal art , and war to the knife on decadence . It offers rather little illustration for an art magazine , but that little of high quality . Every month there will be a wood-cut by Timothy Cole after an American painting . This month the choice falls on Thomas Cole , the father of American landscape . The most notable article is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What Is Painting ? " Dr. Theo . B. Hyslop deals with " Post-illusionism and the Insane . " Glen Brown discusses Paul Bartlett 's new pediment for the Capitol . August Thomas contributes an " Inquiry Concerning the Drama , " Daniel Chester French " A Sculptor 's Reminiscences of Emerson , " and there is a poem by George Sterling . There is nothing startling in the number except intermittent abuse of the radical modern movements by the editor , F. Wellington Ruckstuhl . Sympathizing as we do in the main with his point of view , we are distressed at a kind of tasteless vehemence in his method , for it must certainly incite the unregenerate rather to mirth than to repentance . A pseudonymous contributor , " Petromus Arbiter , " distinguishes among great , clever , and degenerate art , apropos of Raphael , Velazquez , and Degas , with an indiscretion recalling the real Petronius , but without his wit . The journal is well made and of promising scope , if it can present a united front of that academic decorum which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further issues with a mixture of expectation and concern . The price is $3.50 a year , for which the wood-cuts of Cole alone are more than a money 's worth .
