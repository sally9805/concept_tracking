The dooryard on the Illinois farm of MILTON SHANKS . At the stage , right , is a porch raised six inches from ground attached to the lean-to kitchen of SHANKS ' house , the roof of which disappears to the right . Under the porch down stage is a window with a door in second entrance . Behind the porch a rail or other rough fence straggles across stage . The back drop shows a half hilly country with the wet stubbly earth of early spring . Painted on the center of this drop is a sycamore tree sufficiently distinctive to help identify the same drop under July color and vegetation in Act Two . On the stage at the corner of the house up right is a small lilac bush which shows three years advance in Act Two , and is a good lilac tree of forty odd years of age in the last two acts . To the left of stage in second plane is rough log curb to well fitted with bucket on a long sweep with a fulcrum at the side of well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above this well is a young apple tree , bare , to be in foliage and fruit in Act Two , and to be a stalwart , old , gnarly apple tree in the last two acts . The wings at the left are bushes . The whole dooryard is filled with a litter of neglected farm material , such as grindstones , plow , bits of harness , a broken wheel , the running gear of a wagon , and the like . DISCOVERED JOEY , a boy of sixteen . He is dressed like the son of a poor farmer of 1861 . Joey is molding minnie balls over a charcoal fire , using one mold as a second one cools , and dropping the finished product into a bucket . He is impatient and fretful.After a mold or two , GRANDMA PERLEY enters from the road . GRANDMA is seventy-six  --  a farmer 's woman of the time . She smokes a crock pipe with a reed stem .

And the ring holds mutton taller that turns into verdy grease  --  an ' you ca n't volunteer unless ye got front teeth ter tear the cottridge paper to let the powder out when you ram the cottridge home . JOEY That 's right , grandma . GRANDMA In 1812 every man had a powder-horn . This idear of the powder fastened right on the bullet is twice as quick . JOEY And the sharp nose on the bullet makes ' em go further . GRANDMA Let a Yankee alone for inventions . Go on and drill , my boy . JOEY Thank you , grandma . Enter MA .

MANNING Her old father 's one of my objections to Mrs. Simpson . I 'm a great believer in heredity myself . SHANKS We got a little heredity ourselves . Madeline 's Uncle Joey was in Hardy 's company . Ef he 'd a lived he 'd a been a Gran ' Army hisself . PHILIP That 's a good point for Hardy . SHANKS Oh , he ai n't forgot it .

Renter MADELINE . MADELINE laughing . It 's a very sentimental selection , but  --  slows down as she sees the strangerPhilip is rather partial to it . MRS .

Extends hand . MRS . MANNING Philip and I will walk with you a ways and elaborate the gossip . HARDY Delighted . PHILIP I 'll follow , mother , and relieve you in a few minutes . I 'm a terrible muff at gossip . p. 71 HARDY He 's boasting . PHILIP And the sidewalks in your man 's town , Colonel , are n't organized for three . HARDY at gate . My dear Philip  --  that 's what recommends them  --  Come , Mrs. Manning . Exeunt MRS . MANNING and COLONEL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADELINE I think your mother 's wonderful . PHILIP Father was all right , too  --  pause and smileand the further back you go the better we get  --  MADELINE smiling . I was n't thinking in that direction . PHILIP Fine ! Let 's talk about me . Sits . MADELINE You should hear grandpa . He thinks he put you into the legislature . PHILIP I think so , too . MADELINE And in his mind and heart he 's got you all nominated next fall for Congress . PHILIP seriously . Really ! MADELINE nods and smiles . Funny , but Hardy 's been putting that congressional bee into my bonnet , too . p. 72 MADELINE Why not ? PHILIP Oh , I 'm in favor of it  --  but I might get a glorious licking and be assigned to go on in very private and depressing obscurity here . MADELINE reproving . One does n't win by feeling that way , Mr. Candidate . PHILIP I got in the legislature feeling that way . MADELINE pause . You said " depressing obscurity ! " PHILIP Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PHILIP Principally . MADELINE I do n't call it depressing . I think it 's beautiful . I love every minute that I can stay here . PHILIP You 're not a man  --  with ambition . MADELINE Lincoln was . He lived only a few miles over that way . PHILIP But Lincoln wanted to go to Washington . MADELINE I do n't believe he did  --  very much . Grandpa says he did n't . And just a few miles further over that way is Whitcomb Riley . " ' Long the banks of Deer Crick 's good enough for him . " PHILIP I 'm not a poet . p. 73 MADELINE Grandpa says you are . PHILIP Does he ? MADELINE Yes . PHILIP Did he mean it for a knock or a boost  --  ? MADELINE Boost , I hope . PHILIP Good  --  Pause . Earnestly . I 've got a notion to tell you something , Madeline King . MADELINE Poetry ? PHILIP nods . The first day I saw you  --  after you came back from Boston  --  this same time two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech at the soldiers ' monument next day and I was scared blue  --  I did n't have a single idea  --  but I drifted by here on the other side of the road  --  You were standing near the gate  --  MADELINE nods  --  that big lilac bush behind you  --  There 'd been a shower and " the sun had come out with a flagon of amber and drenched the whole world in ambrosial wine . " MADELINE in real appreciation . Oh , that 's wonderful . PHILIP It seemed a vision . A symbol of the beauty that must be eternal  --  and  --  I  --  had  --  my  --  speech  --  Smiles  --  relaxes. p. 74 MADELINE We heard you make it . That 's when grandpa decided you were a poet . You said something about the sadness of the flowers fading , but the unbearable thing would be if the Spirit of Spring itself should pass from the world  --  Then about those young people there growing old , but there would always be on earth the spirit of youth  --  and from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  living  --  and so on  --  did n't you ? PHILIP Yes  --  but all the time I was thinking of you and that lilac and the golden sunlight over you and , dog-gone it , Madeline , it 's haunted me in committee rooms and courts and railroad trains . Do you know , I jumped up to Chicago from Springfield last session and went to church just to look at you singing . MADELINE When ? PHILIP In February . MADELINE Why did n't you speak to me ? PHILIP When it was over the aisle was crowded and before I could get to you  --  you went out the stage entrance . MADELINE solemnly , shaking head . That is n't what we call the side door of a church . PHILIP I want you to get this teacher job if you want it  --  but whether you do or do n't  --  I 've just got to have you with me , Madeline  --  p. 75 MADELINE pause . Of course  --  Pause . Any woman would be complimented , Mr. Manning  --  PHILIP Would she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nods solemnly . Complimented by your  --  your  --  attention  --  PHILIP I 'm asking you to marry me , you know . MADELINE pause . I could n't  --  pausequite leave grandpa  --  now . PHILIP Do n't leave him  --  if the place is good enough for Lincoln and Whitcomb Riley , I 'll stand for it . Say yes . MADELINE regarding him . You 're a funny  --  creature . PHILIP Well , I 'll throw that in along with the poetry  --  but principally I want you to think about my law position and my general health . You 're just playing the mischief with both of ' em . Pause . He puts out his hand . MADELINE studies him ; then quietly lays her hand in his . It 's a bet , is it ? MADELINE hushed . Yes  --  it 's a bet ! He kisses her hand . Then with a better idea , goes to fence and looks right and left  --  returns . Rising . No. p. 76 PHILIP Not a God 's soul in sight but one stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses her . MADELINE Do n't any more  --  do n't breaks away  --  but I 'm awfully happy . PHILIP pause . I can think of about a million things in my life I wish I had n't done . MADELINE Stage doors ? PHILIP No  --  mostly stupid things , like thinking there was n't a God . Laughs tenderly . Enter , from right back , DOCTOR RANDALL . RANDALL looks over the fence as though to identify the place  --  sees MADELINE . RANDALL Why ! Miss King ! MADELINE goes to gate . MADELINE Doctor Randall  --  this is wonderful . Shakes hands . RANDALL Yes . She brings him through the gate . MADELINE Mr. Manning  --  let me introduce Doctor Randall , of Chicago . PHILIP Pleased to meet you , sir . RANDALL Mr. Manning . Shaking hands . Have n't we met before ? p. 77 MADELINE Mr. Manning is our member of the legislature . RANDALL Judiciary Committee ? PHILIP Yes . RANDALL That 's it  --  I 'm on the Pardon Board . PHILIP Of course . Stupid not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow mother , you know . To RANDALL . Honoring our metropolis by any lengthy visit , Doctor ? RANDALL Leaving to-night . PHILIP Oh  --  may see you later at that . Smiles to MADELINE . Good-by . Exit right . MADELINE Awfully good of you to think of me . RANDALL I had a professional call at Moline this forenoon  --  seemed a crime to be so near and not see you  --  and this amusing coincidence of your address . MADELINE What ? RANDALL The name  --  " care of Mr. Milton Shanks "  --  MADELINE My grandfather . RANDALL I thought likely  --  we 're old acquaintances . p. 78 MADELINE Grandpa and you ? RANDALL Yes . Had half a dozen conferences at Springfield  --  since I 've been on the Pardon Board . MADELINE What about ? RANDALL Some old fellow he 's interested in . But is n't it strange that in all our talks about him you never mentioned his name ? MADELINE I do n't know . He 's gone to the station now to meet someone . RANDALL That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same mail . MADELINE Yes ? RANDALL I got off at the crossing . Brakeman said I 'd save time . Indicates bag . Nothing to carry . MADELINE Then your visit is n't mine , after all ? RANDALL Entirely yours  --  grandfather is just an excuse . MADELINE Did you need an excuse ? RANDALL A man 's self-respect needs one , when a girl 's turned him down annually for years . MADELINE smiles . I 've known you only two years , Doctor . RANDALL pause . Really ? She nods . Those refusals seemed a year apart . p. 79 MADELINE That 's better . RANDALL How 's the voice ? MADELINE Fine , thank you . RANDALL You know , I do n't want to talk physiology to you , but even a great voice is sometimes improved by marriage . MADELINE That 's the most expensive treatment you 've ever recommended . RANDALL I offer it free . MADELINE shaking head . ' Twould n't be fair . RANDALL To you ? MADELINE To either of us . RANDALL I would n't ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things by halves . RANDALL Not even  --  better halves ? MADELINE Not even better halves . I love the Church work and the City now , but when I marry I 'll want something more like  --  this stretches out her arms  --  the sky to the ground all about me . RANDALL in coaxing cadence . Suburbs  --  MADELINE shuddering . Ugh ! p. 80 RANDALL pause . The lake front would give us an horizon view half way round . MADELINE pause . Shakes head . I 'm  --  sorry . Pause . Maternally . Dear Doctor puts hand on his arm  --  I have n't told anyone about it  --  not even grandpa  --  but I 'm engaged to be married now  --  RANDALL pause . Afraid to tell grandpa ? MADELINE No . Pause . I have n't seen him since it happened . RANDALL looks at her  --  looks off  --  looks at her  --  pause  --  nods off inquiringly after PHILIP  --  MADELINE slowly nods " yes . " RANDALL Ten minutes too late . MADELINE No , dear Doctor ; I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause . RANDALL gets a railroad yellow timetable from his pocket and begins to consult it . MADELINE covers the time-table . Please wait and see grandpa . I do want your opinion about him . RANDALL ' Tis n't my specialty  --  but  --  I get a bit of it . MADELINE It seems to be only the Civil War  --  and that 's all right , too , except the siege of Vicksburg. p. 81 RANDALL Was he at Vicksburg ? MADELINE shakes head . His boy  --  my uncle on my mother 's side  --  was killed there . RANDALL Union army ? MADELINE Yes ; and some of the explanation may be there . Grandpa was n't in the Confederate army but a sympathizer . Folks  --  well , not so much now  --  but they used to blame him for it  --  kinda cruelly . RANDALL I see . Pause . Renter SHANKS . MADELINE going to him . Grandpa , I 'm glad you 're back . This is my good friend , Doctor Randall , of Chicago . SHANKS When you had your sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name , or I 'd known it . How 'd I miss you ? RANDALL I got off at the crossing . SHANKS Sit down , Doctor . How do you think Madeline 's looking ? RANDALL Looking ? Why , heart-breakingly happy , sir . SHANKS Heart-breaking ? MADELINE He 's laughing at me , grandpa , because I 've been foolish enough to tell him a secret  --  but I 'll not let him laugh at you , too . I 'm engaged , grandpa . p. 82 SHANKS unhappy at the idea that the man is RANDALL . Why  --  MADELINE To Philip Manning . SHANKS To Philip  --  well , I 'm happy , too . That to RANDALL  --  that 'll keep her here to MADELINEunless you go to Washington . To RANDALL . The young man 's in the legislature . ' Fact , you 've heard him talk at your commission . RANDALL nodding . We met here to-day . SHANKS Engaged . So you do n't care anything about the teacher 's position , then ? MADELINE Oh , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly independent  --  so that Philip sha n't feel too sure about it . All laugh . SHANKS I reckon you 've seen her more'n her grandfather has  --  livin ' in Chicago . MADELINE Not quite , grandpa . RANDALL It must be fairly lonely by yourself . What do you do here , Mr. Shanks , when she 's away ? SHANKS Well  --  I read . Pause . An ' I think considerable  --  an ' I cook some  --  besides , a good deal of it 's habit . p. 83 RANDALL Yes ; these machines of ours are very adjustable things . SHANKS Machines ? RANDALL Our bodies . SHANKS Yes , but I cahilate it 's more a man 's ideas  --  how he thinks . Automobiles go along that road now , but I 've seen cavalry ridin ' by in the sixties  --  an ' cannons  --  four horses to ' em . General Logan  --  " Fightin ' John , " they called him , rested hisself in that chair yer sittin ' in  --  Madeline 's grandmother give him a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by here now , but sometimes I kin see Logan and the cavalry plainer . How do you account for that ? RANDALL Deeper impressions . SHANKS Madeline 's mother played roun ' under them lilac bushes  --  Madeline played under ' em . Somehow I see the mother cl'arest  --  an ' along in May , when the smell of ' em comes in the winder  --  ' bout sundown  --  why , I ca n't say it makes me downhearted ' xactly  --  but if I was a woman , by thunder , I 'd jes ' cry , I reckon . Smiles . MADELINE going to him . Dear grandpa  --  I wo n't leave you alone so much any more . SHANKS Nonsense  --  why , she 's spent years in Boston preparin ' herself . To MADELINE . Do n't you fret about me. p. 84 RANDALL You say Logan sat in this chair ? SHANKS Yes ; Fightin ' John . RANDALL Was your son with Logan ? SHANKS With Grant . RANDALL Killed at Vicksburg . SHANKS You heared of Joey ? RANDALL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh  --  Muses . Yes , Vicksburg . In low undertone . RANDALL A hard siege , I believe . SHANKS annoyed . Grant did n't push it . RANDALL Did n't , eh ? SHANKS No . RANDALL Tell me about it . SHANKS It 's all as fresh as yesterday . You see , the country 'd been waitin ' for Grant ter do sumpin ' . As the glint of madness comes in SHANKS ' eyes MADELINE puts her hands together in distress . RANDALL gestures silence . RANDALL Waiting for Grant  --  SHANKS Yes . So I went down there myself . I sez to him , " What 's the delay , General ? " I recollec ' he was settin ' on a camp stool smokin ' , and  --  p. 85 MADELINE goes to him . Grandpa . SHANKS feeling her touch . Yes , dear . MADELINE You were here when they brought Uncle Joey 's body home , were n't you ? Here with gramma . SHANKS Yes , here .

Takes hold o ' you perfect  --  till sumpin ' brings you out of it . RANDALL I know about them , a little . Yes . SHANKS It 's all right , dearie . Excuse me ; I 'll be all right in a minute . Goes up left fence . MADELINE I had to interrupt him . It hurts me so when that delusion comes over him . RANDALL Ever violent with it ? MADELINE Never  --  excited a little in telling it  --  I used to believe him when I was a child . RANDALL The son 's death was a blow , of course , but  --  p. 86 MADELINE And his wife at the same time . RANDALL Wife died ? MADELINE nods . Oh ! MADELINE And neighbors hostile because of his politics . RANDALL I see . MADELINE Joey  --  his son  --  enlisted on the Union side and would n't even speak to grandpa . RANDALL Well , that was pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . SHANKS returns . RANDALL Yes  --  if you wish it . MADELINE I 'll get a hat . Exit to house . SHANKS And yer letter , Doctor  --  kind o ' excited me some  --  brought back old times . RANDALL Made you happy , I hope . SHANKS I ca n't tell you how much . The pore feller 's been in there thirty-eight long years  --  and night and day I 've thought about him  --  been workin ' on his case thirty years  --  fifteen different legislatures . RANDALL Still  --  his first sentence was death . SHANKS War times , Doctor  --  and war-time hate . If he 'd just had on a different suit of clothes when we got inter that fight  --  he 'd a been a prisoner o ' war and set free in two years  --  jist as Philip Manning said ter yer board . p. 87 RANDALL Does Tollard find any of his old friends living ?

SHANKS She knows the folks here have been aginst me purty hard  --  but I 've kept all that prison talk and  --  sentence o ' death business out of her life  --  and I 'm gon na see him first an ' tell him not ter talk , ' cause if he ai n't got any place else to go , I plan ter take him in here  --  yes , sir . RANDALL gives hand . You 're a Christian gentleman , Mr. Shanks . SHANKS shakes hand . Some back-slidin '  --  I used horrible language durin ' the war .

Grover Cleveland 's been president twict  --  an ' I ai n't aimin ' ter dig up the bloody shirt agin , but when little children air under a teacher 's influence murder ai n't a nice subject to have in their minds . This 'll be my argument ter the school board to-night if you compel me. p. 90 SHANKS pause . I respect that coat ye got on , Newt , and that cord round yer hat  --  Them are naytional  --  but it 's a mystery ter me sometimes how the war ever was won with souls as little as yours is behind the guns .

Why , as I remember it , Mr. Manning behaved rather sympathetically . MADELINE His mother did n't . RANDALL Well pause  --  it 's hard for me to be an enthusiastic advocate , but maybe it 's just as unfair to blame him for mother as it would be to blame you for grandfather . MADELINE She 's never liked grandpa . I was only twelve when she took me away from him . RANDALL She took you ? MADELINE Well , sent me . RANDALL Why ? MADELINE School  --  and music lessons in Boston . Their family comes from there . RANDALL What was her reason ? MADELINE She heard me singing in here as I was washing dishes one day . I must have been bawling , because she stopped her carriage and turned back and then came in. p. 101 RANDALL Did she have her son with her ? MADELINE No . RANDALL Carriage ? MADELINE nods . By taking you away from your grandfather , you mean that she financed your school period ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to repay .

This  --  this indebtedness you imply to Mrs. Manning  --  was that  --  did that influence you in entering into this engagement with her son ? MADELINE Rather the other way  --  but that 's over now . She 's been against the other woman who is applying for the teacher 's place  --  against her because her father , Mr. Gillespie , is  --  rather ordinary  --  but grandpa 's education is n't any better  --  and I could n't shakes head  --  with this  --  this new talk about him  --  No , it 's over  --  over  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to be so gauche as to urge my interest again  --  at a moment like this  --  but I want you to be conscious of me as a kind of rainy day proposition  --  one of those consolation backgrounds  --  like an accident policy when one feels the automobile skidding . MADELINE Dear Doctor , your proposals are all so  --  so  --  RANDALL Indefinite ?

MANNING That man said the penitentiary . GILLESPIE An ' I said so , too . p. 106 MRS . MANNING I hate to add a moment to your unhappiness , Mr. Shanks . Pause , during which SHANKS suffers quietly . I 'm perfectly willing to concede that there was some mistake about it  --  that you were probably innocent of the charge , but  --  SHANKS shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some other fellers workin ' for the South . Them was war times , recollec ' , an ' they wanted the horses fur John Moseby in Kentucky . ' F I 'd been in the army , it 'd been all right , but I was  --  I was n't in the army . Pause .

He  --  he used to put his hands on my shoulders . I wish Hardy 'd come  --  but there 's somethin ' we kin do while we 're waitin ' . He goes to desk  --  gets old revolver in paper , unwraps it .

SHANKS You kin have this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corkscrew for me . MADELINE goes for old folding corkscrew in buffet . Philip . PHILIP Mr. Shanks . SHANKS At my trial , this was marked Exhibit B. Two barrels fired . The rest are just as we left ' em . Take that corkscrew , Philip , and pull out the wads and the powder , ' cause they never was any bullets in ' em .
