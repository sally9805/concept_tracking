txt To the Greeks , all existence was a unity , and all knowledge . A philosopher , in the golden days of Ionia , had to be able to philosophize as readily and as convincingly upon the nature and origin of the material universe as upon the principles of righteous conduct or the laws of accurate reasoning . A modern Ph . D. who knows nothing outside his specialty would have been unthinkable ; even self-made men who knew nothing about anything had to pretend to a smattering of everything . To be sure , the Greeks lived in a smaller universe and were simpler men . Cosmogony was more easily grasped when the universe was limited , roughly , by Gibraltar and the Indian Ocean , and was perhaps two or three miles deep ; and the science of morals was somewhat simpler when an adequate supply of labor depended only upon success in war , and when the whole duty of woman was to obey her father or her husband . Our universe may not yet be so complicated , as HENRY ADAMS seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse because nobody could understand the machinery ; but already it is evident that hardly anybody understands the invisible machinery governing the men who govern the wheels and levers . Life is entirely too real and entirely too earnest ; nevertheless , we must try to understand it , and it would pay to try to understand it as a whole . The various scientists who have wrung their hands over the collapse of human knowledge following the somewhat vague but undoubtedly demoralizing discoveries of the eminent Dr. EINSTEIN would be less pessimistic a 's to the future of human thought if they tried to look over the walls of their own compartments . Dr. EINSTEIN himself , so far as can be gleaned from his statements by those who are admittedly not among the " twelve superior persons " fitted to understand his theory , is not so greatly alarmed . His " theory of relativity , " he holds , ' requires some modifications of fundamental conceptions in the science of mechanics , but he does not say , as sOrn2. of his admirers have come near to doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imminence of the Last Judgment . The old theory that time and space were absolute entities on which the moving systems of the universe depended was the basis of celestial mechanics , he says , but it was satisfactory only up to a certain point . Beyond that it did not explain ; it was apparent that the absolute was absolute only in simple matters .. So EINSTEIN has not destroyed the absolute ; he has merely furnished another explanation when it appeared that the absolute was not there . " Till now , " he says , " it was believed " that time and space existed by them " selves , even if there was nothing else " no sun , no stars  --  while now we know " that time and space are not the vessel " for the universe , but could not exist at " all if there were more contents . " To what is called the " scientific " mind this ? may perhaps be a terrible announcement , but even in it is the germ of hope . EINSTEIN has annihilated absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and space which depend on the moving celestial bodies . The absolute is gone , but the celestial bodies remain to provide the starting point for ' a new theory . But to the metaphysician all this will seem a tempest , if not in a teapot , at most in a telescope . " It was believed " that time and space existed by them " selves "  --  but believed by whom ? By astronomers , perhaps , but not by ontologists . " Whatever time and space may be , the notion of their objective existence will not find many defenders among the metaphysically minded . And , indeed , the apostles of subjectivity may point out that EINSTEIN 'S time and space depend on the moving celestial bodies , which seem to be regarded as absolute entities for the purposes of his theory . But who is to prove the absolute existence of the sun and the stars ? The raising of such questions as this seems to appall the astronomers ; they have to have an absolute . The raising of blasphemous voices against time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they seemed to feel , for the first few days at least , that the foundations of all human thought had been undermined . There were those who when confronted with the impious Einstein doctrine could do nothing but cry out , " Great is Diana of the Ephesians ! " They could have endured it with more fortitude if they had studied met physics and learned to survive ' attacks on any and all fundamentals . Time and space , after all , are mere conveniences ; the human mind does nut stand and fall with them . " Canst thou bind the sweet in " fluences of Pleiades , or loose the bands " of Orion ? Canst thou bring forth " nazzaroth in his season , or canst thou " guide Arcturus with his sons ? Know " est thou the ordinances of heaven ? " Canst thou set the dominion thereof in " the earth ? " It has been argued that inability to answer these questions is a disqualification for independent judgment on the problems of life , but the whole history of thought is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study metaphysics , they might be less likely to think that inability to draw out Leviathan with a hook necessitates the rejection of all the accomplishments of the intellect .
