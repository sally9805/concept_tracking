Why should n't we ? They are fine things . But the only real demand for them comes through stockholders hungry for dividends and from ' corporation officials eager to draw traffic from other lines . We in our ignorance may have insisted , as the Atlantic writer says , in cluttering the decks of ocean steamships with boats that would be worse than useless in an emergency , but for the Roman baths and the gymnasiums we accept no responsibility whatever , and we resent the attempt to put it on us . A feminine reader of Maine Men Tug TIMES revealed Much in a letter printed on Like Others , this page yesterday how deeply her apprehensions had been excited by the tale , previously recorded here , of a Saco man who violently objected when his wife were out shoes purchased by himself by walking with another man . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is " engaged " ti , a son of Maine , and she evidently inclines to break her promise if its keeping is going to involve loss of ownership in shoes and other property which she has been wont to consider her own . Her fears are groundless , or at any rate they are exaggerated , Of course , she will be taking numerous and grave chances in marrying a Maine man , but probably not many more or much bigger ones than in marrying a man from any other State . Just how Idiosyncratic were the Saco husband 's notions as to his proprietary rights we are not prepared to say . But even if , as . is possible , his views on the subject are rather widely shared by men in or from Maine , that is a masculine more than a State peculiarity , and there as elsewhere most of the men have yielded to the spirit of the age and can suffer in silence . The typical Maine man would admit ? in argument ? that his wife 's shoes were hers , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary belief , if he entertained it , he would have the sense or grace or caution to restrict to communings with himself when alone . Ownership passes with gift no less than with sale , everywhere , and even in Saco , which is as Maine as a town can be , the husband who forgot that fact was first beaten and then arrested . Our troubled correspondent can go ahead safely enough . TO , IGS of - CH E ES . An apparently in- I A Criminal soluble problem , which Victim Is , nevertheless , deof Crime . mending solution on many and important grounds , has been presented anew by the refusal of young LUSTIG to give the police any help toward finding the four men who attempted to kill him Monday night and so nearly succeeded in doing it . There can be no reasonable doubt that be knows who they were and why they scught his life . He takes , however , the ' Impudent gangster attitude  --  the attitude of one having no respect for the law and desiring no protection from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds , he says , in effect , he has simply been beaten in a desperate game and has no complaint to make , whila : . , if he recovers , as seems to be probable , he will square the now unbalanced account with his own dagger or pistol . This is , of course , a return to plain barbarism and ' in a civilized community it is tolerable only from absolute necessity . LUSTIG has forfeited any sympathy he may have earned as the victim of as ' sassins , for he has deliberately proved that between them and himself there is no difference except that on a particular occasion he happened to be in front of a revolver instead of behind it . The difficulty is to discover or even to imagine how a man so lost to all sense of civic obligation can be made to talk when he prefers to keep silence . If it were demonstrable in court that he is withholding evidence and so protecting criminals he might be punished for contempt , but that would be glory rather than humiliation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not easy to decide . The explanation that he is following a code of honor would be plausible if it were not a fact that " honor . among thieves "  --  and all gangsters are thieves  --  exists only in the proverb and is unknown In reality . Two other theories a LusTIG 's reticence have each some credibility . One of them is that he is , afraid to do any talking , lest he be led into revelation of his own crimes , and the other is that he dreads the vengeance which the " squealer " so rarely escapes in gangster circles . The first motive has the support of our law 's absurdly exaggerated disinclination to ask or expect self-Incrimination ; the other discloses the law 's often illustrated inability to protect those whom it uses as the instruments of justice . Secretary ELLIOTT The Public of the International Makes Travel Club did . Demands O well to call attenN tion , yesterday , to the fact that when several railways lengthened the running time of their exceptionally fast trains they received only commendation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on of such trains has so often been ascribed . The truth is that there never was and never will be a public demand for the sacrifice of safety to speed . Travelers do , indeed , prefer fast to slow trains , but they invariably assume that the managers of railways know at what sate danger begins , and that they Will not exceed or even approach It closely . ' The only way that the public influences railway speeds is by showing a general willingness to take  --  when reasons of purse do not forbid  --  the faster of the trains which the companies in their competitions with each other and in their supposed good judgment see fit to provide . An otherwise admirable and impressive article in this month 's Atlantic on the lesson of the Titanic is marred by a repetition of a like mistake as to the " demands " of travelers by sea . The Writer of the article puts . on the public much if not all ' blame for the devotion , in the building of the , new liners , to magnificence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better employed in facilitating the navigation and increasing the:safety of these enormous vessels . Thin , too , ignores the assuinption by the public that the shipbuilders know their business and its seriousness , and that when they add Roman baths and gymnasiums and restaurants of stately expanse and gorgeous decoration to the simpler equipments or otherfdays they-keep the ultt-
