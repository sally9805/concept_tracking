Fort five decades the Presbyterian Church in America has maintained a mission on the West Coast of Africa . From its original occupancy along the coast of what became , with the partition of Africa , the French Congo , Spanish Guinea , and the German colony of Kamerun , this mission has gone inland from the coast of southern Kamerun . The station in Gaboon , of which mention is made in these letters , is now under the care of the French Protestant . Society at work in the French Congo . The ten years preceding the present war were . a season of great activity and success in African missions . The Presbyterian mission in Southern Kamerun shared with its French neighbors to the south and its German neighbors to the north in the encouragements of this epoch . There was a tumult of development . The forest tribes and the tribes by the sea crowded into the tribe of Cod , ? and under black leaders : in the past decade the black men with whom the white missionary shares his burdens have increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thatched roofs of the churches gat her , here and there in the forest , Sabbath congregations of six thousand , of eight thousand . Self-support is a major intention , and in the year before the war t he thirty I boa-sand adherents of this mission gave , out of their primitive circumstance , nearly fifteen thousand dollars to the treasury . There was a large industrial plant at Elat ; then , were ! imre than ten thousand pupils in the schools : there was a beneficent medical orb at four stations . l'hc clamor of the drums at unnumbered villages called the young to school of a week ; lay . and broke the dark before the drumn of a Sunday with the call to ' gat her : So much for the days before the war in a neighborhood which has been , since the war began , ti hal t 1.1 EI , P .1. , it ? I Ili ' : la Now surely you would know that I am off to West Africa . My circumstance reeks of it . My room sna:lls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIy shining tin trunks and my traveling bed mark me missionary or government . S.S. SOKOTO , July 10 . It is late afternoon of one of our monotonous bright days . We sail always south toward a horizon of summer clouds that we never overtake ; sometimes we pass dreary-looking steamers making their journey north , and sometimes lovely lady ships . One to-day , a four-masted bark with every sail set and as white in the sun as Hubert 's stag in the forest , made us feel the mean vessel that we are . Near by , but where he can not see me , the chief engineer leans his long young body over the rail and talks to the stewardess in tones of the utmost cynicism about missionaries . July 15 . Yesterday we called at Monrovia and this morning at another town . MonrOvia makes quite a showing of clustered European houses , but the town at which we called to-day showed only native huts , gray and squat . We lie off shore ; this is all open sea beach . All day we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on the eastern rim of the bright circumference of the sea . Sometimes our course lies well in shore ; then we feel the land-swell , we see the white line of the inevitable surf , and back of this , the wall of the forest with its higher trees rising on bare trunks , a scanty and fernlike foliage . There is a level light of afternoon that picks out to an extraordinary degree the detail of this forest and drenches it in green . The coast line is for the most part low . The water hereabouts varies in color , ? . gray , sometimes green , once emerald with amber in the lights . Once we came to anchor in jade . To-day the Kroos came about the ship in their canoes , brown bodies in brown canoes , all wet with the sea and struck with violet lights . They came up the ship 's side and took passage as crew boys ; it is they who will handle the cargo when we come to discharge it . July 19 . Past Axim , Secondi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the eye . From every settlement there come out to the ship boats manned by strapping black men who sit on the gunwales as a woman rides a horse , six on a side , each with a short paddle that is a trident , my dears , like Neptune 's . They lean to the water in unison . In the stern stands the helmsman , his loin cloth blowing about him , and the effect of all this is not just primitive , it is classic . Many of the Africans wear a garment like the toga . I look at a row of them leaning over the rail ( for our lower decks fore and aft are crowded with black passengers now ) ? I see them leaning looking out to sea with so much about them , in dress and gesture , of the Romans . Among them are others : Mohammedans , effeminate-looking young fellows as easily distinguished by their hauteur as by their dress ; and their dress is fine , ? handwoven stuffs in stripes , lemon yellows striped in lavender , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got off the ship and walked in Africa , my friends , and it smelt like a hothouse . This is Old Calabar . The government building and the mission building are on a hill that slopes to the river ; the native town falls into a hollow and climbs half way up the next hill . I took a photograph , but you will never see from that how the mammoth trees father the little brown huts . July 23 . We had tea with some Scotch missionaries , all set about with Rossetti on ' the shelves and on the walls , and we had good things to eat . But the little girl-wife thinks Old Calabar a pretty severe field , for here , she says , the natives are semi-civilized and vicious . She envies us going into the bush . And indeed so do I. I mean I would n't change with her for anything . BATANGA , KAMERITN , July 81 . This is the receiving port for our mission , and we landed yesterday at sunset . Here the ship lies about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore in a surf-boat . I never went anywhere in a surf-boat , and I must say , when I saw them begin to hand the babies from the ladder to that intoxicated surf-boat , I felt sick of the sea . You get into the boat any way you can . Presently we were all sitting where we had dropped , and we pulled away from the ship . The evening was golden , but the sea was pretty rough , and no one looked much at the scenery . There were five rowers on a side , and they were , it seems , very skillful in their management of the boat . But this was lost on me , and on my word of honor , when I saw the tremendous surf , and the boat came broadside to wait the next wave , I began to take off my mackintosh . I thought we would end in the sea . But before I could get free of my coat the boat headed for shore , ran up a mountain and down , and hard on the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turmoil ; but when the next wave carried us ashore again , natives ran into the surf to her prow and held her against the return , while others picked agitated missionaries off the sides . Mrs. Lehman had said to me , ' Do n't fight the native when he comes for you as we land . ' Fight him ! I literally fell on his neck and embraced him all the way to dry land . I never saw anything more tragic than the faces of the mothers watching their little ones being carried through the surf . Yesterday our people ? fifty carriers ? came in from the bush . They came to shake hands with the new mis sionary , and looked at her gravely . There is at first something disquieting about their unsmiling regard , but presently one knows it to be friendly . Four of these men will carry my hammock , in relays of two ; we shall be four nights on the road . LOLODORF , KAMERDN , Friday , August le . We left Batanga Monday morning at seven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . This means that we walked twenty miles each day and twenty-two the last day . I do n't mean that I walked all the way : I had four hammock-carriers , but hammock-carriers reach their limit , and there are many steep places along the road ; so I walked perhaps half the way , and yesterday I must have pegged along fourteen miles . There are different sensations for different hours of the day on the road . There is the miserable 4.30 A.M. sensation . You are asked to get up , and the cot is snatched from under you . You start to wash and the basin is whisked off . Presently yon sit down to breakfast by the light of a lantern , and as you eat , clay breaks ; well , you feel better . And when at six o'clock you take the road , in the dawn and the dew , it is heavenly . And so it is heavenly all day , in and out of the hammock , swaying along a level path , or panting up an incline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a valley with your road suspended behind you and before , or on some hilltop , with the mountains for your betters . In four days I saw more beauty than in all my life before . So the morning passes gloriously . And at noon in the palaver house of some town you sit on a pole bed , or a sort of bamboo couch , with your knees up to your chin , and eat what your native cook has brought in the chop-box , and it is good . You are ready for the road again . But by three o'clock you droop . At four you limp and drag . When you come to the native town where the tent is to be pitched , you sit on the ground until your men set up the camp-chairs , and after that , too , for you are too weary to move . Somehow you get to bed , and then it is 4.30 A.M. All your meals , your uprisings and your downsittings , are witnessed and commented upon by all the natives in the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us breathe . The tent is always pitched in the centre of the town . In the morning Dr. Lehman paid our debts for water and vegetables when any had been bought , and our currency is matches or fishhooks or needles , ? needles are especially acceptable . The forest is not lonely . There is a continual line of carriers coming from the east with ivory and rubber , ? big men from Yaunde or Bene , fine physically , and just as untutored as you can conceive ; indeed more so than I could have conceived . Happily they speak Bulu , so I shall he able to talk to them some day . The last day on the road it poured rain , the beginning of the rainy season . You can imagine struggling up hills and sliding down , ' and when we came to greasy ground we split ourselves in two . ' At four o'clock we arrived at . Lolodorf . The native pastor , Ndenga , who had been left in charge of the station , had opened the house for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see a detached hill that is a young mountain and every little mountain is dressed in tropical opulence . Lolodorf is a military post ; the fortifications are on an abrupt hill near by . The mission itself is on the land that rises from the river and is bounded by the river on the west and north . South of us runs the road . The station consists of two dwelling-houses , a church in which school meets as well , and between six and eight workhouses , toolhouses , or what not . The houses are all built bush-fashion ? saplings set up for stanchions about three feet apart . The walls , of bark , ? great sheets of brown bark , slatted horizontally with strips of bamboo , ? are sewed to the stanchions with a rattan thread . No nails are used in the entire house ; everything is sewed or tied with bush rope ' as I tell you . You can see daylight through the punctures and sometimes through the splits in the bark . The roof is a thatch of palm leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosy and look Elizabethan . At this station there are the Leh-mans ; Ndenga , a native pastor from the beach , who has done very well by the work during the Lehmans ' absence ; myself , and the Rev. Mr. Heminger , who is due from Elat any day . The regular school work has not been taken up as yet ; we are just getting the station in order . The people here are largely Ngumba and Yaunde . These latter have been brought up by the government from the interior ; the Yaunde are the carrier tribe , they and the Bene . In carrying to the beach , hundreds of carriers in the week sleep here . The mission has a palaver house for their benefit , and one of the most interesting opportunities is offered by this transient audience , a people absolutely virgin . There are dwarfs in this neighborhood , too , serfs of the Ngumba . Dr. Lehman journeys among them and we get them in the school . I am to learn Bulu ; the Ngumba and the Yaunde understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and it is the best thing to learn , since my ultimate station is uncertain . August it . High above us looms the government hill , where three Germans live . The senior officer , a lieutenant , came to make his call on Sunday , and told me that he already felt well acquainted with me , as indeed I should think he might , since he had informed himself by document as to the age and condition , intent , and station of Missionar Schwester Mackenzie . After making this hopeful statement he became terribly embarrassed and went away . I was so sorry , for I had some impertinent questions to ask him , with a view to acquaintance . There is a strange beauty about these people , especially the Yaunde and the Bene , ? a beauty of body and of posture , of color and of draping . A thousand things would remind you of the art of the Renaissance . The way they dress their heads is so often like Botticelli . They have a surprising instinct for decoration ; often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face , and their hair is dressed with no superstitious regard for the middle of their foreheads . LOLODORF , August 26 . Oh , you dears , to write me so ! Some belated carriers have brought mail . I feel as lavish as Ahasuerus when Esther entertained him ? you shall have half of my kingdom . Dear me , I see your embarrassment when my retainer makes good . My kingdom is Bitum , in the trousers I helped him make , and in no shirt at all if you insist on immediate delivery , for he is washing his shirt to-day . Which half will you have ? I suppose you will be selfish and take the dressed half . He came to me this morning with a most virtuous air ; he was going to wash his shirt ! ' Good , ' cried I , with enthusiasm . But where , he begged to know , was he going to get soap ? I suppose this appears to you fair enough , but there is a root of evil . I asked of Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Well , if you do , tell him that he is not to have soap again ; that he is to buy it out of his wages . ' I looked at Mrs. Lehman and wondered . Did she forget her first struggle with the Bulu lan-guage ? September 1 . There is no organized church here , but the people are moving that way . On a Sunday there will be some four hundred of an , audience , ? more brown arms and legs , closer packed , than the church was built to hold . Every day people come to make confession of faith and to be received into the class for instruction . This initial step is a long one ; you step out of your tribe and its custom into the tribe of God and its custom . But you clean up your record before the transfer is effected ; you pay your debts , you settle your quarrels , you confess your misdeeds to your husband , and you suffer , often enough , your beatings . There are Macedonian signals from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he is the headman . Nshicko is middle-aged . He , with several men like himself , well-to-do , was converted . Each put away all his wives but one , ? and superfluous wives mean property ; they formed the bulk of these men 's possessions , ? and they entered school here . This was before the Lehmans ' furlough . This last year the men have spent in their town , where they have told their people ' the news . ' Now they come to us for help ; sixty of their townspeople believe . I wish you might have been with us the night this deputation waited on us as we sat about the lamp , ? three middle-aged men , two of them with loin cloths , the other in a white nightshirt . This last was an old man , silent and mild , with a droop half patient and half sad , and a sort of austere mysticism that quite awed me . We are short-handed here , but we have sent Ndenga to Nshicko 's town , where he will start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach the primary class in a school . Some of you smile at this and so do I , but not all the time . I have over seventy pupils , some young ones and some grown men and women , ? poor long-legged men who sit patiently through the morning while I explain with a chart and a pointer the difference between e with an accent and without . It is my aim and my passion to keep the grown people up with the children . I ca n't tell whether this is the fruit of compassion or of the natural enmity between one generation and the next . There is a man called Zambe , and I mean that he shall read if it is to be done by sheer will . LOLOD0111 , , September 8 . I realized the other day that I am not giVing you much sense of the externals of ' Life in Africa . ' Too bad , for they are understood to be so thrilling . Truly I could write you a thriller if I saw things in a certain light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we agreed that we could get up a very moving account of our affairs . It would read like this : A missionary , his wife , and two children live in one room of a three-roomed house . They eat , read , and work in one room , in company with a single woman missionary , who occupies the third room . The walls of the house are made of sheets of bark , which are split here and there so that the sun 's rays penetrate in swaths of light which threaten the life and reason of the missionaries . Moreover , the roof , which is made of palm-leaf thatch , has given way here and there , so that in the rainy season the water falls into the soup and on the . heads of the missionaries . ( On the head of the little single missionary ? think of it , she who never liked to get her head wet ! ) When it rains , the sheep and the goats take refuge under the house , and at night these heathen beasts clamor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall pocket to pull out a handkerchief ( an innocent luxury which she allows herself ) , she pulls out a cockroach as big as a mouse ? and so on , horrors upon horrors . But I spare you . This is the wet season , one of them . Every afternoon it rains terrifically . Long before the rain booms upon the roof the rush of it may be heard in the forest , and there , among the great trees , the gray army advances . When it has passed and the sun comes out , the heat is pretty severe . Sunday , September 11 . Yesterday I took to myself and went for a long walk . I meant to say to Biturn , ' I will walk presently . ' I said something in Bulu , very proudly . Afterwards Mrs. Lehman explained to me , between her laughs , that I had asked to walk in hell . ( Dear Margaret , it was their own hades , that they manufactured for their primitive uses before ever the missionary appeared on the scene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking his head . I suppose he thought it was time to call a halt . September 12 . Already these hills are less strange and this forest ? I know the secret of many paths and shall soon know all . A country and a circumstance are soon familiar ; only people are perpetually mysterious . I thought about this so much to-day when I was plodding along in the mud , the hills about me blue with evening , and we passed some carriers , ? Yaunde women , nude but for leaves , and beautifully formed , as so many Yaunde women are . The carrying of loads does not encourage sightseeing , and by the day 's end the eyes of a carrier do n't wander far from the path ; so these women were passing me , heads clown . But I spoke the word of greeting and they looked up . Their eyes met mine . Ah , how far away the dim islands of their entity , and bet wren us what expanse of unplumbed , salt , estranging sea ' ! Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word has passed between us . They go on , I believe from my heart , not ungreeted . But our intercourse is hardly what might be called genial . It is very oppressively sad ; there never was one that smiled at me . And truly youth seems most desolate ; the younger the girl the more morose her gaze . Perhaps the capacity for pain is the essential jewel of Yaunde youth . The Ngumba people seem much less tragic . September 15 . To-night I was reading about Stanley 's search for Livingston , when suddenly I asked myself , ' Am I really in the country of which he writes ? ' I went to the window to look out , to see , my clears , if I were . It was raining heavily , but for all that the moonlight penetrated the clouds and fell with a most impartial ray and no glamour . There were the wan paths leading from little gray huts to little gray huts ; there were the innumerable banners of the plantain trees , and the slim , upstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees of the forest , all patient under the vehement rain . And I knew perfectly , and for the first time , that I am in Africa . Nowadays during half of the school hours I teach several classes in the primer . Zambe has graduated to the primer and reads , with inexplicable pauses and with strange agitations of his arms and legs , sentences of three words each . Always his eyes plead with me not to desert him in this adventurous country of learning . Do you know , I am happy in this : that all these people are real and individual . One is clever , another is stupid ; another 's lips , when he recites , tremble with trepidation ; another , bless her little heart , has a little frightened pulse that throbs in her neck when she grapples with the chart . Who could resist such allurements , such weaknesses , such eagerness ? October 3 . To-day on the road I saw a woman so small , so perfect , so black , and so comely that I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before a big carrier . She wore a leaf bandage supported by a crimson strap which held in place low on her back one of those curious bustles which are the pride of the people from the interior , ? a thick even glossy bunch of dried grass that looks like black horsehair , and is jaunty to a degree . Her dark skin was in perfect condition ; her beautiful slender limbs moved with elastic decision ; above her slim shoulders her head was poised with a sort of nervous pride ; and her hair was charmingly and elaborately dressed . Fairly she seemed to glitter in the sunlight . LOLODORF , October 4 . The other evening as I sat writing there came from outside a sound of vehement voices . So I went out into the night , where the moonlight lay broad and even on the paths and on the banners of the plantain trees and on the little thatched church . The noise came from the dark interior of the church , through its doors and windows , which are never closed , lacking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house that Ngya , one of the early converts , was in the church talking to a company of carriers ; and then I could distinguish his voice , urgent and rapid in the languid night , and the occasional unanimous response of the carriers . ' You have understood ? ' he would ask . ' We have under- stood ! ' they would roar in concert . Standing there , listening , I wished that you might hear too . On Sunday , at the women 's meeting , some twenty carriers strolled in and sat back against the bark wall , where they presented a great array of arms and legs . Mrs. Lehman told the women of that illuminating quarrel between Abraham and Lot , ? we were sure of the carriers ? luring that time , for these people respond readily to the Old Testament . At the close of the service the rain hindered our return to the house , and while we waited for the storm to pass , Mrs. Lehman played on the little organ . Presently there was about her a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the keys , and with the brightness of her hair , that they looked at one and the other smiling . They had never heard the word of God before , and they turned their faces on Mrs. Lehman with a sort of animal innocence , ? such an unwinking , amazed interest as I could hardly have imagined as human , though I have seen horses look so before they were broken . Then such huddlings together , such linkings of arms , such leanings of friend against friend , such exclamations one to the other in their virile ungoverned voices , such sudden laughs of jocund wonder . " Lambe , he who created us is not one to endure fetish ! Is that a true word ? ' ? and they laughed . SO Mrs. Lehman talked to them and I looked at them till the rain had moderated ? and we were going . But one thing they must know what was that fruit ? pointing to the revolving globe . Then they were told how the earth is round , and all the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we left them , and they went on their way in that new world which is round , and was made by a God who rejects medicine ( fetish ) . They may pass this way again . It will be Thanksgiving season at home , when you read this , and so it will be with us . The other Sunday Mrs. Lehman held a Thanksgiving service with the women ; they were to tell of the mercies they had enjoyed during the past year . So they assembled on Sunday afternoon in their motley garments . At one service I saw a woman with pink corsets over a very proper dress ; but there was no such indiscretion on this particular Sunday . These were some of the reasons given as cause for thanksgiving , and from among all I have taken one of every kind : One woman said that her child had died , and that she had found comfort in the House of God . Another that , in answer to prayer , the animals no longer molest her garden . Another , that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things of God , and was taunted by them for her belief , she had been given strength to withstand their taunts . Another , that while she used to have to work hard and had none to help her , now God had sent her some one from the beach . There is an insult in vogue here which gives rise to the most deadly quarrel , ? it is to ta . I am sure I ca n't say why it is so effective ; it is all a matter of words ; but several women gave thanks for this : that they had suffered without retaliation when told that their husbands or their mothers were laed . Pretty smiling Malinga , wife of Ze , was thankful that she and her husband had been given grace to carry loads for the governor , and that God had put it into the heart of the governor to allow them to rest on the Sundays . There is one old woman who has held my attention from my first sight of her , so unhappy and so poor does she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rose in her bits of rags to say that she had ten children , five of them were dead and five Of them scorned her , ? God helped her bear it . Her name is Wawa ; I go often to see her since , to make up for her children . Of course , we do not converse very much , since she speaks only Ngumba , and I speak three words ' of Bulu , but in spite of such limitations we seem to be in a fair way to make friends . She told me yesterday that we were one person , ' which I thought a rather extreme inference ; but Mrs. Lehman said not to be frightened , that it was a not uncommon expression and entailed no responsibilities . Well , these were some of the reasons why the women thanked God ; and some of them , you will agree , went deep . If many were quaint and fantastic , and if some were grossly material , why , so must many of our own appreciations seem to God . November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have a great deal . They greet one , and take leave ; they clasp hands ; they appreciate by facial expression and by little formal ejaculations the conversation of the missionary even when it is not understood by them , or , being understood , bores them ; and all this in a very finished fashion . They have , I think , a real courtesy of the heart . But their conventions are so unlike ours that we often have mutual misgivings , and they infer , I fancy , that we have been badly brought up . I take lessons wherever I may , and hope to be able , eventually , to enter and to leave a town , having properly saluted the inhabitants and having announced my departure in form . A town in this neighborhood consists of two rows of houses with a street between . The houses differ very little . They are all low huts of a room each , say , a matter of eighteen feet by seven , with two openings like windows in the centre of each long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of plates of a bark which is yellow when newly cut but which soon tones to a silver brown , as do the leaf-mats which form the roof and make a thatch in appearance very like a straw thatch . The eaves project beyond the walls some two feet , and hang low ; it is almost always necessary to stoop in passing under them . Certainly you must stoop to enter the door of the house , and at the same time must step over the sill , which will be anywhere from one to two feet from the ground . Inside you find yourself on a mud floor in an interior persistently brown . For furniture there will be several beds made of split poles laid in rows on two logs which serve as legs ; another serves as pillow , and all these are brown and polished with use . From the roof will be hanging mysterious bundles done up in plantain leaves brown with smoke ; gourds , brown by nature , I suppose ; brown baskets for peanuts and corn . On the ground will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there will be no chimney in the roof , which explains a go'bd many things , and why the unseasoned visitor presently makes for the street . An average street will be from fifty to sixty feet wide , perfectly clean and generally barren , necessarily so when it is a section of the excellent government road . There is , now that I think of it , quite a difference in character between such a travel-worn town and one where the little forest path , which has wandered into the street at one end , makes out at the other into the green shade . In such a town there may be oil-palm trees ; there will he , back of the houses or near them , little groves of plantain trees , their great banner-like leaves murmuring in the wind or drooping , green like the inner curve of a wave , in the still air . But most gardens are at a distance from the town . Thus , if you pass at eleven of a morning there will be no life stirring more than the silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every house will give you a greeting . December Any one passing through Benzork 's village the other clay would have witnessed a nice civilized scene . A white man going about the country in the interest of rubber culture , laboring with the natives not to cut the vines down but to tap them , had pitched his tent in the middle of this village and so , white-man fashion , owned the place . Here he might be seen of an evening sitting outside his admirable little tent , playing pleasant airs on a cornet , ? an accomplishment which might have endeared him to the entire community ; but that he set little store by popularity , you will agree when his deeds come to light . One night he could not sleep for the noise of rats in a neighboring house . The house was empty , and the stranger found the rats among the fetishes of poor Benzork , who is off in Buhl . There is a flourish to the effect that he found some of his food hidden away by the rats in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man brought the skulls out of the house and arranged them in a line beside the path , sixteen poor skulls amazed at the stars . Behind these he set up two mingunemelon ? small wooden idols ? sitting passive among these ruins . So I saw them next morning , and so they were seen of common eyes , both of men and women . Who shall say what thoughts burned in the hearts of the men of Benzork 's town , or with what emotions the Christians looked at this shame of the past ? For myself , I could not look at these things of darkness under the morning sun with any lightness of heart . Mr. Heminger saw Benzork 's little daughter step off the path to walk directly in front of the line , ? a very bold , bad action indeed and entirely inkeeping with the little girl 's reputation , for had not she once slapped the faces of the unwinking mingunemelan , the very same that watched her from behind the skulls ? And did she not , for this offense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fetishes were gathered up by black soldiers , who took them up the government hill , and from there , by order of authority , they were thrown into the river ; which is a reason , if another were needed , why one had best not drink river water . One evening after these events I saw the white man sitting in front of his tent playing a pleasing air , in which he paused to bow to me with mild courtesy . Benzork has not yet returned to his desecrated hearth ; but one of his little daughters , three years of age , has been sent to him that she may be turned over to a man who has bought her . Benzhuli is a young Ngumba who assists in the school and has many talents . He is the dressmaker of this region . He is very kind and gentle with stupid little children . For a long time he has been paying goods on a girl , ? guns and goats and many hundreds of little iron objects called nsuba , that are currency for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a big , bad headman , is in the running and likely to win out , for all that Benzhuli has the start of him in goods . Benzhuli takes a vacation to talk this palaver , and finds that the people of the girl 's village- favor the other man . And when the girl says she will have Benzhuli or none , they tie her up with bush rope , and make off with her into the forest . You can think if Benzhuli is happy . He comes back to Lolodorf , and an account of the affair goes upon the hill , ' that is , to the government post . And one day along the road comes a file of people , the giti with her people and Minko with his , pretty well laden with goods , ? Benzhuli 's goods , which they expect to pay back , as they certainly expect to stand ' in the palaver . But not so . The governor listens to them and he listens to Benzhuli , and then , for all he is German , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Placing two sticks on the ground , he names them for the rivals , and ' Which will you have ? ' he asks the girl . She , in ( Dr. Lehman had heard him talking the day before to Minko about ' our woman ' ) . So they come down the hill together . Presently they appear at the station , Benzhuli a very smiling school-teacher and dressmaker , but poor Mvunga sad and shrinking and timid , as how could she be else ? It is no light matter to break through the custom of a country , and women are sorry pioneers . Since then her husband the dressmaker has made her a garment , and her husband the teacher has taught her the alphabet , and she quite blooms in school , for she is a pretty girl with more than average poise .
