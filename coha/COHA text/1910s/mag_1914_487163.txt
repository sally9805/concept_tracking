But Professor Miller And so race friction grows apace , South looks forward to a wonderful change in this and North ; in the South economic presrespect during the next fifty years His is a cheerful , hopeful note throughout , whether dealing with the negro in politics , or his education , or the present-day weakness of his clergy . He has vision and faith and what few white writers possess  --  an appreciation of the fact that fifty years of liberty is too short a time in which to pass any final verdict upon a people : " in the economy of racial life a half-century is scarce more than a single year in the experience of an individual . " More than that , in his own detachment and his grasp of principles , he shows a breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for counsel if the dominant forces in our political life should ever realize that the initial step towards solving the negro problem is to call into partnership the colored leaders themselves . Mr. John Daniels 's study of the Boston negroes , like Miss Ovington 's similar inquiry among New York 's black people , is precisely the kind of painstaking inquiry into a local problem which must be the basis of sound knowledge of the situation in the North . He has not limited himself wholly to local phenomena , but has given " the national background as well , one chapter , for instance , comprising an admirable summary of the Abolition movement in Massachusetts and of the service of the colored soldiers from that State . If the judicial attitude is sometimes lost , as in his discussion of the split among the colored people over the teachings of Booker Washington , to whose side the author clearly leans , there is a great deal that is informatory as to the actual achievements of the colored people in the home of Abolition . He does not always know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does clearly explain the change in the feeling which has left the Boston public , if not actually hostile , at least indifferent to the colored man . He does not hesitate to set forth the chief weakness of the negro group as a political entity . This is " an inability to subordinate personal and minor differences to an inclusive and effective organization and a general fixed policy " and a tendency " to be jealous and envious of each other 's success , to quarrel and to split into continually changing factions " ? a truth which adequately accounts for the failure of one national political organization of colored men after another . Yet if Mr. Daniels discovers inherent individual weaknesses which in his opinion render the average Boston negro inferior to the average white man , he is none the less certain that the race has genuine contributions to make to the national life , and ends his book with the hopeful note that in Boston , as in the nation , " this people will eventually attain the position at once of self-respect and of worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the white man 's prejudice . The three books from Southern sources in the list are full of encouragement because all are sympathetic and not one of them accepts unreservedly the prevailing Southern opinion . Dr. Bailey , a professor in the University of Mississippi , for instance , realizes the need of scientific inquiry upon which I have touched , and dwells upon it most earnestly in the series of papers he has made into a volume . He complains justly that we have not even analyzed what race prejudice really is , and as to the social problem itself he exclaims : " How few are the first-class men that are making this most baffling , distressing , and imminent of human problems the object of devoted and patient scientific investigation . " From the Southern contention that all is well with the negro in the South when left to the Southern whites and not interfered with by Northern philanthropists , he strips the lamb 's skin to call the negro 's situation " a direful tragedy . " More than that , he admits frankly that fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too much for them . We cry out strenuously , Let us solve our own problem ! But we are not solving it ; indeed , the complication of it is growing . . . . So , while we need not cease talking and writing about the negro problem , let us study it in the light of twentieth-century science and Christianity . " Since the negro is not getting a fair show , colonization seems to Professor Bailey a possible solution from which the cost will not deter the nation , not even , he thinks , if it should take the price of several Panama Canals . But he sees , of course , that this is not possible in short order to-day , any more than it was when first earnestly urged some seventy years ago In the heat of the Abolition struggle . He admits frankly that immediate and wholesale deportation is " a futile dream " for the present . His hope lies , therefore , in a " parallel civilization for the colored folk . " Just what that is to be he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base it ; he can only urge it as a question for that long-continued scientific study for which his book is a brief . If it contains no other practical suggestion than this , his effort is none the less - worth while ; for it is , first , the quiet answer which the thinking South is beginning to make to its own demagogues , and , secondly , it is illuminated by the obvious desire to do justice and by his readiness to state truths unpalatable to his section , as , for instance , that " no human question can be reogarded as permanently settled when one people remains subordinate to another simply on account of racial differences . " Less satisfactory , though written with more of the scientific spirit and much learning , is the " Democracy and Race Friction " of Prof. John Moffat Mecklin , professor of philosophy in the University of Pittsburgh . It is an attempt to support scientifically the prevailing Southern opinion , to explain Southern inconsistencies and cruelties on the familiar ground of group solidarity , race consciousness , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessly immoral and judges them as though their record of fifty years permitted the last word , without a realization , of course , that the negro in the South is precisely what the white man who owned him body and soul in slavery days and now controls him , socially , economically , and politically , has made him . But even he has written a tract which the Southern point of view could hardly have produced fifteen or twenty years ago . Thus , he denounces Mr. Vardaman as the type of demagogue who has made " unscrupulous use " of race antagonism to achieve office and has aggravated conditions so that the races in Mississippi are farther apart than ever . Again , while dwelling always upon the inferiority of the negro race and the theory of group differentiation , and denouncing the intellectual leaders like Du Bois who tell the negro that there is no goal too high for him to aspire to , he none the less writes the following : It is wiser to admit the negro to all the stimulus and inspiration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not endanger the integrity of the social heritage itself , than to encourage an ignorant and debased citizenship by his neglect and repression . It is , of course , entirely obvious that every murder , or lynching bee , or cowardly terrorizing of a weaker race sets free subtle educative sources which react upon both groups . It furnishes " social copy " for the rising generation of blacks and whites which will be built into the fabric of their personalities , brutalizing and barbarizing their own souls and ultimately cheapening the whole tone of the civilization of the future . But to admit the negro to all the stimulus and inspiration of the white 's heritage is surely an extremely dangerous practice for those who believe in having one race up and the other down . In another place he writes that there can not be the same interpretation of equality before the law for whites and blacks . But if you admit the latter to the stimulus and heritage of the white race , how can you prevent their aspiring to equality before the law upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny them everything ; anything else is equal in folly to keeping the Russian peasants illiterate in order that they may not become enemies of the existing monarchical order . Again , at one place Professor Mecklin asserts that there are " fundamental racial differences , " and then declares that these are found " only at the lower level of instinct , impulse , and temperament , and do not , therefore , admit of clear definition . . . . " There are other inconsistencies , and there is plenty to make the knowing smile , as the matter of negro immorality , where , as usual , there is no real appreciation of the guilt of the white man during three centuries . Repeatedly Professor Mecklin shrinks from the logic of his own conclusions ; repeatedly his humanity interferes with his argument . He means to be just and kindly and to write without bitterness ( though the tone is always one of condescension ) , and so he is compelled at the end to the conclusion that the thing to do is " to accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from segregation and race antipathy , and to insist upon a stern , even-handed justice based upon equality of consideration " ? but , marvellously enough , that is to be clone by a varying interpretation of equality before the law ! " This implies , of course , " Professor Meeklin continues , " that each individual , as well as each racial group , is to he free to find a natural level in society . This implies also competition of the most vigorous and comprehensive nature , industrial , moral , cultural , and even ethnic . It means the elimination of the unfit and the preservation of the fit . Most important of all , it means in the end a healthy and permanent progressive civilization . This is the only effective method history has thus far revealed of testing and preserving that which is ultimately and supremely worth while . " With this Professor Mecklin completes his boxing of the compass , for this , together with absolute equality before the law , is all that the most violent Northern partisans of the negro have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from injustice and handicaps due to color , in order that he may find his natural level ; the negroes , too , have insisted that this is the only way to peace and happiness in the republic Aspiring colored people will find nothing in Professor Mecklin 's book to worry them . Indeed , they may well take courage from it . If this is the best presentation of the old-fashioned anti-negro case that can be made , it is evident that it is losing steadily , being weakened both by its lack of logic and by its conflict with the humanitarian tendency of the age . The same fine new humanitarian note that runs through these Southern writings is struck even more clearly by Mrs. L. H. Hammond in her " In Black and White . " No one can peruse the earnest , moving volume from the pen of this Southern woman without understanding why it is that Northern negrophiles are now looking largely to the South for hope and encouragement . She , too , has found , after years of work , that the need is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janies H. Dillard has put it in his introduction to her volume : " The problem of the South to-day is how to find voices and hearings for her best thoughts and sentiments . " Behind all the cant and hypocrisy of the demagogues , behind all the cowardice of legislators , clergy , and public men , and the horrors of the mob , there is a stirring of conscience in the South and a growing realization that the white men and women of that section are not doing justice in their treatment of the colored people . How soon will it find potent voice9 How SO-011 will the terrorism of public opinion cease to dominate the liberal spirits who must in any such undertaking face abuse and ostracism , if needs be , because they can no longer hold back the truth ? Upon the answer to that question depends largely the progress this country will make towards a solution of the problem . One of the leading Southerners in public life to-day , who years ago came North to breathe a freer air , tells of returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old comrades , the leading citizens of the town , in a discussion ? the inevitable discussion  --  of the negro . He found to his satisfaction that they held his own radical , for the South rather revolutionary , views , and as he rose to go he said : " Now , boys , I have got clearly in mind all that you have said , and I shall publish it to-morrow . " There was a wild rush for him . " By heavens , Smith , " they cried in unison , " you shall not leave this room alive unless you swear to do nothing of the kind . " He promised , of course ; and his playmates of boyhood days continue to suppress their real thoughts and bow down to the God of things as they are . How much longer is this padlocking of the lips to continue ? Not long , if we may fudge by Mrs. Hammond 's book , in which one finds , as in the frank and noble utterances of the speakers at the recent Southern Sociological Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they exist , and not as they appear to the eyes of multitudes who think to see what they would have . It is a plain , homely volume , full of happy illustrations and a clear understanding of human nature , breathing a spirit of good will towards everybody , and distinguished by true religious feeling . Her kindliness towards the negro and keen appreciation of what is good in him recalls the philosophy and the rare understanding of negro nature which marks " Ezekiel " ? the sympathetic child creation of a Northern woman , Miss Lucy Pratt , which valuable book , it is pleasant to note , is now being reissued , for a large sale , we hope , to young and old , by Messrs . Houghton Mifflin , of Boston . Mrs. Hammond 's insight and philosophy enable her to say : " The only basis for living between man and man , whether low or high , which is safe for either is justice . " And she is keen to see that where there is less than justice the danger is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The time will soon come when utterances like these will be a commonplace from the South . They are notable now , from a white source , as is this wise and noble sentiment . My only fear for white supremacy is that we should prove unworthy of it If we fail there , we shall pass Supremacy is for service It is suicide to thrust other races back from the good which we hold in trust for humanity . For him who would be the greatest the price is still that he shall be the servant of all . Therein lies much of the philosophy of the problem ; that it is coming to be taught in the section which fifty-six years ago was locking up in penitentiaries white women who dared to instruct negroes how to read and write , is a happening to cheer the most Pessimistic One must be blind indeed not to see , despite surface discouragements and friction in many places , which way the deep , underlying current is setting . If the books that are being put forth leave no doubt about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the necessity for the country 's administrators to busy themselves more about it and to grapple with it as a national problem .
