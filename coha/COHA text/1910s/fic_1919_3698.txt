FOREWORD In collecting , arranging , editing , and preserving the " Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp , " my friend John Lomax has performed a real service to American literature and to America . No verse is closer to the soil than this ; none more realistic in the best sense of that much-abused word ; none more truly interprets and expresses a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should hear Mr. Lomax talk about them and sing them ; for they were made for the voice to pronounce and for the ears to hear , rather than for the lamplit silence of the library . They are as oral as the chants of Vachel Lindsay ; and when one has the pleasure of listening to Mr. Lomax -- who loves these verses and the men who first sang them -- one reconstructs in imagination the appropriate figures and romantic setting . For nothing is so romantic as life itself . None of our illusions about life is so romantic as the truth . Hence the purest realism appeals to the mature imagination more powerfully than any impossible prettiness can do . The more we know of individual and universal life , the more we are excited and stimulated . And the collection of these poems is an addition to American Scholarship as well as to American Literature . It was a wise policy of the Faculty of Harvard University to grant Mr. Lomax a traveling fellowship , that he might have the necessary leisure to discover and to collect these verses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surely as valuable as much that passes under that name ; for it helps every one of us to understand our own country . WM . LYON PHELPS . Yale University , July 27 , 1919 . INTRODUCTION " Look down , look down , that weary road , ' T is the road that the sun goes down . " * * * " ' T was way out West where the antelope roam , And the coyote howls ' round the cowboy 's home , Where the mountains are covered with chaparral frail , And the valleys are checkered with the cattle trail , Where the miner digs for the golden veins , And the cowboy rides o'er the silent plains ,  --  " The " Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp " does not purport to be an anthology of Western verse . As its title indicates , the contents of the book are limited to attempts , more or less poetic , in translating scenes connected with the life of a cowboy . The volume is in reality a by-product of my earlier collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the former book I put together what seemed to me to be the best of the songs created and sung by the cowboys as they went about their work . In making the collection , the cowboys often sang or sent to me songs which I recognized as having already been in print ; although the singer usually said that some other cowboy had sung the song to him and that he did not know where it had originated . For example , one night in New Mexico a cowboy sang to me , in typical cowboy music , Larry Chittenden 's entire " Cowboys ' Christmas Ball " ; since that time the poem has often come to me in manuscript form as an original cowboy song . The changes -- usually , it must be confessed , resulting in bettering the verse -- which have occurred in oral transmission , are most interesting . Of one example , Charles Badger Clark 's " High Chin Bob , " I have printed , following Mr. Clark 's poem , a cowboy version , which I submit to Mr. Clark and his admirers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large mass of material that came into my ballad hopper while hunting cowboy songs as a Traveling Fellow from Harvard University , I have included the best of the verse given me directly by the cowboys ; other selections have come in through repeated recommendation of these men ; others are vagrant verses from Western newspapers ; and still others have been lifted from collections of Western verse written by such men as Charles Badger Clark , Jr. , and Herbert H. Knibbs . To these two authors , as well as others who have permitted me to make use of their work , the grateful thanks of the collector are extended . As will be seen , almost one-half of the selections have no assignable authorship . I am equally grateful to these unknown authors . All those who found " Cowboy Songs " diverting , it is believed , will make welcome " The Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp . " Many of these have this claim to be called songs : they have been set to music by the cowboys , who , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or descriptive verse devoted to cattle scenes . Herein , again , through these quondam songs we may come to appreciate something of the spirit of the big West -- its largeness , its freedom , its wholehearted hospitality , its genuine friendship . Here again , too , we may see the cowboy at work and at play ; hear the jingle of his big bell spurs , the swish of his rope , the creaking of his saddle gear , the thud of thousands of hoofs on the long , long trail winding from Texas to Montana ; and know something of the life that attracted from the East some of its best young blood to a work that was necessary in the winning of the West . The trails are becoming dust covered or grass grown or lost underneath the farmers ' furrow ; but in the selections of this volume , many of them poems by courtesy , men of today and those who are to follow , may sense , at least in some small measure , the service , the glamour , the romance of that knight-errant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Texas , Austin , July 9 , 1919 .

Out where the skies are a trifle bluer , Out where friendship 's a little truer , That 's where the West begins ; Out where a fresher breeze is blowing , Where there 's laughter in every streamlet flowing , Where there 's more of reaping and less of sowing , That 's where the West begins . Out where the world is in the making , Where fewer hearts in despair are aching , That 's where the West begins ; Where there 's more of singing and less of sighing , Where there 's more of giving and less of buying , And a man makes friends without half trying , That 's where the West begins . Arthur Chapman . THE SHALLOWS OF THE FORD DID you ever wait for daylight when the stars along the river Floated thick and white as snowflakes in the water deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current break and shiver As the frosty edge of morning seemed to melt and spread and change ? Once I waited , almost wishing that the dawn would never find me ; Saw the sun roll up the ranges like the glory of the Lord ; Was about to wake my pardner who was sleeping close behind me , When I saw the man we wanted spur his pony to the ford . Saw the ripples of the shallows and the muddy streaks that followed , As the pony stumbled toward me in the narrows of the bend ; Saw the face I used to welcome , wild and watchful , lined and hollowed ; And God knows I wished to warn him , for I once had called him friend . But an oath had come between us -- I was paid by Law and Order ; He was outlaw , rustler , killer -- so the border whisper ran ; Left his word in Caliente that he 'd cross the Rio border --  Call me coward ? But I hailed him --  " Riding close to daylight , Dan ! " Just a hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not the warning , Caught his hand and held him steady ; then he nodded , spoke my name , Reined his pony round and fanned it in the bright and silent morning , Back across the sunlit Rio up the trail on which he came . He had passed his word to cross it -- I had passed my word to get him --  We broke even and we knew it ; ' t was a case of give and take For old times . I could have killed him from the brush ; instead , I let him Ride his trail -- I turned -- my pardner flung his arm and stretched awake ; Saw me standing in the open ; pulled his gun and came beside me ; Asked a question with his shoulder as his left hand pointed toward Muddy streaks that thinned and vanished -- not a word , but hard he eyed me As the water cleared and sparkled in the shallows of the ford . Henry Herbert Knibbs . THE DANCE AT SILVER VALLEY DO N'T you hear the big spurs jingle ? Do n't you feel the red blood tingle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance or be it fight , Broncho Bill has come to town To dance a dance tonight . Chaps , sombrero , handkerchief , silver spurs at heel ; " Hello , Gil ! " and " Hello , Pete ! " " How do you think you feel ? " " Drinks are mine . Come fall in , boys ; crowd up on the right . Here 's happy days and honey joys . I 'm going to dance tonight . " ( On his hip in leathern tube , a case of dark blue steel . ) Bill , the broncho buster , from the ranch at Beaver Bend , Ninety steers and but one life in his hands to spend ; Ready for a fight or spree ; ready for a race ; Going blind with bridle loose every inch of space . Down at Johnny Schaeffer 's place , see them trooping in , Up above the women laugh ; down below is gin . Belle McClure is dressed in blue , ribbon in her hair ; Broncho Bill is shaved and slick , all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whirls a dizzy spin . Jim Kershaw , the gambler , waits , white his hands and slim . Bill whispers , " Belle , you know it well ; it is me or him . Jim Kershaw , so help me God , if you dance with Belle It is either you or me must travel down to hell . " Jim put his arm around her waist , her graceful waist and slim . Do n't you hear the banjo laugh ? Hear the fiddles scream ? Broncho Bill leaned at the door , watched the twirling stream . Twenty fiends were at his heart snarling , " Kill him sure . " ( Out of hell that woman came . ) " I love you , Belle McClure . " Broncho Bill , he laughed and chewed and careless he did seem . The dance is done . Shots crack as one . The crowd shoves for the door . Broncho Bill is lying there and blood upon the floor . " You 've finished me ; you 've gambler 's luck ; you 've won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is passing down to hell . And I must ride the trail alone . Goodbye to Belle McClure . " Downstairs on the billiard cloth , something lying white , Upstairs still the dance goes on , all the lamps are bright . Round and round in merry spin -- on the floor a blot ; Laugh , and chaff and merry spin -- such a little spot . Broncho Bill has come to town and danced his dance tonight . Do n't you hear the fiddle shrieking ? Do n't you hear the banjo speaking ? Do n't you hear the big spurs jingle ? Do n't you feel the red blood tingle ? Faces dyed with desert brown , ( One that 's set and white ) ; Broncho Bill has come to town And danced his dance tonight . William Maxwell . THE LEGEND OF BOASTFUL BILL AT a round-up on the Gila One sweet morning long ago , Ten of us was throwed quite freely By a hoss from Idaho . An ' we ' lowed he 'd go a-beggin ' For a man to break his pride Till , a-hitchin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' cried : " I 'm a ornery proposition for to hurt , I fulfil my earthly mission with a quirt , I can ride the highest liver ' Twixt the Gulf an ' Powder River , An ' I 'll break this thing as easy as I 'd flirt . " So Bill climbed the Northern fury An ' they mangled up the air Till a native of Missouri Would have owned the brag was fair . Though the plunges kept him reelin ' An ' the wind it flapped his shirt , Loud above the hoss 's squealin ' We could hear our friend assert : " I 'm the one to take such rockin 's as a joke ; Someone hand me up the makin 's of a smoke . If you think my fame needs brightnin ' , Why , I 'll rope a streak o ' lightnin ' An ' spur it up an ' quirt it till it 's broke . " Then one caper of repulsion Broke that hoss 's back in two , Cinches snapped in the convulsion , Skyward man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And we watched them through our tears , While this last , thin bit o ' braggin ' Came a-floatin ' to our ears : " If you ever watched my habits very close , You would know I broke such rabbits by the gross . I have kept my talent hidin ' , I 'm too good for earthly ridin ' , So I 'm off to bust the lightnin '  - -  Adios ! " Years have passed since that ascension ; Boastful Bill ai n't never lit ; So we reckon he 's a-wrenchin ' Some celestial outlaw 's bit . When the night wind flaps our slickers , And the rain is cold and stout , And the lightnin ' flares and flickers , We can sometimes hear him shout : " I 'm a ridin ' son o ' thunder o ' the sky , I 'm a broncho twistin ' wonder on the fly . Hey , you earthlin 's , shut your winders , We 're a-rippin ' clouds to flinders . If this blue-eyed darlin ' kicks at you , you die . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jar and jolt , He 'll come back sometime a-straddle Of a bald-faced thunderbolt ; And the thin-skinned generation Of that dim and distant day Sure will stare with admiration When they hear old Boastful say : " I was first , as old raw-hiders all confest , I 'm the last of all rough riders , and the best . Huh ! you soft and dainty floaters With your aeroplanes and motors , Huh ! are you the greatgrandchildren of the West ? " From recitation , original , by Charles Badger Clark , Jr . THE TEXAS COWBOY AND THE MEXICAN GREASER I THINK we can all remember when a Greaser had n't no show In Palo Pinto particular , it ai n't very long ago ; A powerful feelin ' of hatred ag'in the whole Greaser race That murdered bold Crockett and Bowie pervaded all in the place . Why , the boys would draw on a Greaser as quick as they would on a steer ; They was shot down without warnin ' often , in the memory of many here . One day the bark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a Greaser , chased by some ranchmen , tore round here into the square . I do n't know what he 's committed ,  - -  'tai n't likely anyone knew ,  --  But I would n't bet a check on the issue ; if you knew the gang , neither would you . Breathless and bleeding , the Greaser fell down by the side of the wall ; And a man sprang out before him ,  - -  a man both strong and tall ,  --  By his clothes I should say a cowboy ,  - -  a stranger in town , I think ,  --  With his pistol he waved back the gang , who was wild with rage and drink . " I warn ye , get back ! " he said , " or I 'll blow your heads in two ! A dozen on one poor creature , and him wounded and bleeding , too ! " The gang stood back for a minute ; then up spoke Poker Bill : " Young man , yer a stranger , I reckon . We do n't wish yer any ill ; But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as sure as I live , you 'll croak ; " And he drew a bead on the stranger . I 'll tell yer it wa' n't no joke . But the stranger moven ' no muscle as he looked in the bore of Bill 's gun ; He had n't no thought to stir , sir ; he had n't no thought to run ; But he spoke out cool and quiet , " I might live for a thousand year And not die at last so nobly as defendin ' this Greaser here ; For he 's wounded , now , and helpless , and has n't had no fair show ; And the first of ye boys that strikes him , I 'll lay that first one low . " The gang respected the stranger that for another was willing to die ; They respected the look of daring they saw in that cold , blue eye . They saw before them a hero that was glad in the right to fall ; And he was a Texas cowboy ,  - -  never heard of Rome at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge bein ' held by three ; True manhood 's the same in Texas as it was in Rome , d'ye see ? Did the Greaser escape ? Why certain . I saw the hull crowd over thar At the ranch of Bill Simmons , the gopher , with their glasses over the bar . From recitation . Anonymous . BRONCHO VERSUS BICYCLE THE first that we saw of the high-tone tramp War over thar at our Pecos camp ; He war comin ' down the Santa Fe trail Astride of a wheel with a crooked tail , A-skinnin ' along with a merry song An ' a-ringin ' a little warnin ' gong . He looked so outlandish , strange and queer That all of us grinned from ear to ear , And every boy on the round-up swore He never seed sich a hoss before . Wal , up he rode with a sunshine smile An ' a-smokin ' a cigarette , an ' I 'll Be kicked in the neck if I ever seen Sich a saddle as that on his queer machine . Why , it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fer the back of a suckin ' calf . He tuk our fun in a keerless way , A-venturin ' only once to say Thar was n't a broncho about the place Could down that wheel in a ten-mile race . I 'd a lightnin ' broncho out in the herd That could split the air like a flyin ' bird , An ' I hinted round in an off-hand way , That , providin ' the enterprize would pay , I thought as I might jes ' happen to light On a hoss that would leave him out er sight . In less'n a second we seen him yank A roll o ' greenbacks out o ' his flank , An ' he said if we wanted to bet , to name The limit , an ' he would tackle the game . Jes ' a week before we had all been down On a jamboree to the nearest town , An ' the whiskey joints and the faro games An ' a-shakin ' our hoofs with the dance hall dames , Made a wholesale bust ; an ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outfit had any dust . An ' so I explained , but the youth replied That he 'd lay the money matter aside , An ' to show that his back did n't grow no moss He 'd bet his machine against my hoss . I tuk him up , an ' the bet war closed , An ' me a-chucklin ' , fer I supposed I war playin ' in dead-sure , winnin ' luck In the softest snap I had ever struck . An ' the boys chipped in with a knowin ' grin , Fer they thought the fool had no chance to win . An ' so we agreed fer to run that day To the Navajo cross , ten miles away ,  --  As handsome a track as you ever seed Fer testin ' a hosses prettiest speed . Apache Johnson and Texas Ned Saddled up their hosses an ' rode ahead To station themselves ten miles away An ' act as judges an ' see fair play ; While Mexican Bart and big Jim Hart Stayed back fer to give us an even start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came to the scratch an ' got the word ; An ' I laughed till my mouth spread from ear to ear To see that tenderfoot drop to the rear . The first three miles slipped away first-rate ; Then bronc began fer to lose his gait . But I war n't oneasy an ' did n't mind With tenderfoot more'n a mile behind . So I jogged along with a cowboy song Till all of a sudden I heard that gong A-ringin ' a warnin ' in my ear --  Ting , ting , ting , ting ,  - -  too infernal near ; An ' lookin ' backwards I seen that chump Of a tenderfoot gainin ' every jump . I hit old bronc a cut with the quirt An ' once more got him to scratchin ' dirt ; But his wind got weak , an ' I tell you , boss , I seen he was n't no ten-mile hoss . Still , the plucky brute took another shoot An ' pulled away from the wheel galoot . But the animal could n't hold his gait ; An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs did n't lose their grip He 'd own that hoss at the end of the trip . Closer an ' closer come tenderfoot , An ' harder the whip to the hoss I put ; But the Eastern cuss , with a smile on his face Ran up to my side with his easy pace --  Rode up to my side , an ' dern his hide , Remarked ' t were a pleasant day fer a ride ; Then axed , onconcerned , if I had a match , An ' on his britches give it a scratch , Lit a cigarette , said he wished me good-day , An ' as fresh as a daisy scooted away . Ahead he went , that infernal gong A-ringin ' " good-day " as he flew along , An ' the smoke from his cigarette came back Like a vaporous snicker along his track . On an ' on he sped , gettin ' further ahead , His feet keepin ' up that onceaseable tread , Till he faded away in the distance , an ' when I seed the condemned Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the race , That same keerless , onconsarned smile on his face . Now , pard , when a cowboy gits licked he do n't swar Nor kick , if the beatin ' are done on the squar ; So I tuck that Easterner right by the hand An ' told him that broncho awaited his brand . Then I axed him his name , an ' where from he came , An ' how long he 'd practiced that wheel-rollin ' game . Tom Stevens he said war his name , an ' he come From a town they call Bosting , in old Yankeedom . Then he jist paralyzed us by sayin ' he 'd whirled That very identical wheel round the world . Wal , pard , that 's the story of how that smart chap Done me up w'en I thought I had sich a soft snap , Done me up on a race with remarkable ease , An ' lowered my pride a good many degrees . Did I give him the hoss ? W'y o ' course I did , boss , An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He writ me a letter from back in the East , An ' said he presented the neat little beast To a feller named Pope , who stands at the head O ' the ranch where the cussed wheel hosses are bred . Anonymous . RIDERS OF THE STARS TWENTY abreast down the Golden Street ten thousand riders marched ; Bow-legged boys in their swinging chaps , all clumsily keeping time ; And the Angel Host to the lone , last ghost their delicate eyebrows arched As the swaggering sons of the open range drew up to the throne sublime . Gaunt and grizzled , a Texas man from out of the concourse strode , And doffed his hat with a rude , rough grace , then lifted his eagle head ; The sunlit air on his silvered hair and the bronze of his visage glowed ; " Marster , the boys have a talk to make on the things up here , " he said . A hush ran over the waiting throng as the Cherubim replied : " He that readeth the hearts of men He deemeth your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crave your own , that ye would not walk but ride , Oh , restless sons of the ancient earth , ye men of the open range !

" ' Here , we have nothing to do but yarn of the days that have long gone by , And our singing it does n't fit in up here though we tried it for old time 's sake ; Our hands are itching to swing a rope and our legs are stiff ; that 's why We ask you , Marster , to turn us loose -- just give us an even break !

Henry Herbert Knibbs . LASCA I WANT free life , and I want fresh air ; And I sigh for the canter after the cattle , The crack of the whips like shots in battle , The medley of hoofs and horns and heads That wars and wrangles and scatters and spreads ; The green beneath and the blue above , And dash and danger , and life and love --  And Lasca ! Lasca used to ride On a mouse-grey mustang close to my side , With blue serape and bright-belled spur ; I laughed with joy as I looked at her !

She would hunger that I might eat , Would take the bitter and leave me the sweet ; But once , when I made her jealous for fun At something I whispered or looked or done , One Sunday , in San Antonio , To a glorious girl in the Alamo , She drew from her garter a little dagger , And -- sting of a wasp -- it made me stagger !

She was alive in every limb With feeling , to the finger tips ; And when the sun is like a fire , And sky one shining , soft sapphire One does not drink in little sips . . . . . . . .

But never was fox-hunt half so hard , And never was steed so little spared . For we rode for our lives . You shall hear how we fared In Texas , down by the Rio Grande . The mustang flew , and we urged him on ; There was one chance left , and you have but one --  Halt , jump to the ground , and shoot your horse ; Crouch under his carcass , and take your chance ; And if the steers in their frantic course Do n't batter you both to pieces at once , You may thank your star ; if not , goodbye To the quickening kiss and the long-drawn sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Texas , down by the Rio Grande . The cattle gained on us , and , just as I felt For my old six-shooter behind in my belt , Down came the mustang , and down came we , Clinging together -- and , what was the rest ?

I gouged out a grave a few feet deep , And there in the Earth 's arms I laid her to sleep ; And there she is lying , and no one knows ; And the summer shines , and the winter snows ; For many a day the flowers have spread A pall of petals over her head ; And the little grey hawk hangs aloft in the air , And the sly coyote trots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitters and slides Into the rift of a cottonwood tree ; And the buzzard sails on , And comes and is gone , Stately and still , like a ship at sea . And I wonder why I do not care For the things that are , like the things that were . Does half my heart lie buried there In Texas , down by the Rio Grande ? Frank Desprez . THE TRANSFORMATION OF A TEXAS GIRL SHE was a Texas maiden , she came of low degree , Her clothes were worn and faded , her feet from shoes were free ; Her face was tanned and freckled , her hair was sun-burned , too , Her whole darned tout ensemble was painful for to view ! She drove a lop-eared mule team attached unto a plow , The trickling perspiration exuding from her brow ; And often she lamented her cruel , cruel fate , As but a po ' white 's daughter down in the Lone Star State . No courtiers came to woo her , she never had a beau , Her misfit face precluded such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody 's darling , no feller 's solid girl , And poets never called her an uncut Texas pearl . Her only two companions was those two flea-bit mules , And these she but regarded as animated tools To plod along the furrows in patience up and down And pull the ancient wagon when pap 'd go to town . No fires of wild ambition were flaming in her soul , Her eyes with tender passion she 'd never upward roll ; The wondrous world she 'd heard of , to her was but a dream As walked she in the furrows behind that lop-eared team . Born on that small plantation , ' t was there she thought she 'd die ; She never longed for pinions that she might rise and fly To other lands far distant , where breezes fresh and cool Would never shake and tremble from brayings of a mule . . . . . . . . But yesterday we saw her dressed up in gorgeous style ! A half a dozen fellows were basking in her smile ! She 'd jewels on her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliants that hung as frozen tears ! The feet once nude and soil-stained were clad in Frenchy boots , The once tanned face bore tintings of miscellaneous fruits ; The voice that once admonished the mules to move along Was tuned to new-born music , as sweet as Siren 's song ! Her tall and lanky father , one knows as " Sleepy Jim , " Is now addressed as Colonel by men who honor him ; And youths in finest raiment now take him by the paw , Each in the hope that some day he 'll call him dad-in-law . Their days of toil are over , their sun has risen at last , A gold-embroidered curtain now hides their rocky past ; For was it not discovered their little patch of soil Had rested there for ages above a flow of oil ?

TO HEAR HIM TELL IT I WAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I hailed an old time cowman Who was passing by , " Come in , Ole Timer ! have a drink ! Kinda warm today ! " As we leaned across the bar-rail --  " How 's things up your way ? " " Stock is doin ' fairly good , Range is gettin ' fine ; I jes dropped down to meetin ' here To spend a little time . Con'sidable stuff a-movin ' now --  Cows an ' hosses , too , Prices high an ' a big demand --  Now I 'm tellin ' you ! " I 've loaded out my feeders , Got a good price all aroun ' ; Sold ' em in Kansas City To a commission man named Brown . A thousand told o ' mixed stuff , In pretty fair shape , too , " Said the old Texas cowman , " Now I 'm tellin ' you !

" Yessir , trailed ' em up to Wichita , Cross the Kansas line , Made deliveries at Benton As early as fifty-nine . Turned ' em most to soldiers , Some went to Injuns , too , Beef was n't nigh so high then --  Now I 'm tellin ' you ! " Son , I 've fit nigh every Injun That ever roamed the plains , ' N I was one o ' the best hands That ever pulled bridle reins .

" I figger on buyin ' more feeders , From down across the line --  Chihuahua an ' Sonora stuff , An ' hold ' em till they 're prime . So here 's to the steers an ' yearlin 's ! " As we clink our glasses two , " Things ai n't the same as they used to be , Now I 'm tellin ' you ! " I got t ' git out an ' hustle , I ai n't got time t ' stay ; Jes ' want t ' see some uh the boys ' N then I 'm on my way .

" As we drain our glasses two , " Them was good ol ' days an ' good ol ' ways --  Now I 'm tellin ' you ! " He talked and talked and yarned away , He harped on days of yore --  My head it ached and I grew faint ; My legs got tired and sore . Then a woman yelled , " You come here , John ! " And Lordy ! how he flew ! And the last I heard as he broke and ran Was , " Now I 'm tellin ' you ! " I wo n't never hail old timers To have a drink with me , To learn the history of the range As far back as seventy-three . And the next time that I 'm thirsty And feeling kind of blue , I 'll step right up and drink alone --  Now I 'm tellin ' you ! From the Wild Bunch . THE CLOWN 'S BABY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rugged and brown , Were gathered round the posters , The circus had come to town ! The great tent shone in the darkness Like a wonderful palace of light , And rough men crowded the entrance ,  --  Shows did n't come every night ! Not a woman 's face among them ; Many a face that was bad , And some that were only vacant , And some that were very sad . And behind a canvas curtain , In a corner of the place , The clown , with chalk and vermillion , Was " making up " his face . A weary looking woman With a smile that still was sweet , Sewed on a little garment , With a cradle at her feet . Pantaloon stood ready and waiting , It was time for the going on ; But the clown in vain searched wildly ,  --  The " property baby " was gone ! He murmured , impatiently hunting , " It 's strange that I can not find --  There , I 've looked in every corner ; It must have been left behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not patient men ; The clown bent over the cradle ,  --  " I must take you , little Ben . " The mother started and shivered , But trouble and want were near ; She lifted the baby gently , " You 'll be very careful , dear ? " " Careful ? You foolish darling ! " How tenderly it was said ! What a smile shone through the chalk and paint ! " I love each hair of his head ! " The noise rose into an uproar , Misrule for the time was king ; The clown with a foolish chuckle Bolted into the ring . But as , with a squeak and flourish , The fiddles closed their tune " You 'll hold him as if he were made of glass ? " Said the clown to the pantaloon . The jovial fellow nodded , " I 've a couple myself , " he said . " I know how to handle ' em , bless you ! Old fellow , go ahead ! " The fun grew fast and furious , And not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive , When he suddenly laughed aloud . Oh , that baby laugh ! It was echoed From the benches with a ring , And the roughest customer there sprang up With , " Boys , it 's the real thing . " The ring was jammed in a minute , Not a man that did not strive For a " shot at holding the baby , "  --  The baby that was alive ! He was thronged with kneeling suitors In the midst of the dusty ring , And he held his court right royally ,  --  The fair little baby king ,  --  Till one of the shouting courtiers ,  --  A man with a bold , hard face , The talk , for miles , of the country , And the terror of the place , Raised the little king to his shoulder And chuckled , " Look at that ! " As the chubby fingers clutched his hair ; Then , " Boys , hand round the hat ! " There never was such a hatful Of silver and gold and notes ; People are not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Three cheers for the baby ! " I tell you those cheers were meant , And the way that they were given Was enough to raise the tent . And then there was sudden silence And a gruff old miner said , " Come boys , enough of this rumpus ; It 's time it was put to bed . " So , looking a little sheepish , But with faces strangely bright , The audience , somewhat lingering , Flocked out into the night . And the bold-faced leader chuckled , " He was n't a bit afraid ! He 's as game as he 's good-looking ! Boys , that was a show that paid ! " Margaret Vandergrift . THE DRUNKEN DESPERADO I 'M wild and woolly and full of fleas , I 'm hard to curry below the knees , I 'm a she-wolf from Shamon Creek , For I was dropped from a lightning streak And it 's my night to hollow -- Whoo-pee !

Good-eye Jim will serve the crowd ; The rule goes here no sweetnin ' ' lowed . And we 'll drink now the Nixon kid , For I rode to town and lifted the lid And it 's my night to hollow -- Whoo-pee ! You can guess how quick a man must be , For I killed eleven and wounded three ; And brothers and daddies are n't makin ' a sound Though they know where the kid is found And it 's my night to hollow -- Whoo-pee ! When I get old and my aim ai nt true And it 's three to one and wounded , too , I wo n't beg and claw the ground ; For I 'll be dead before I 'm found When it 's my night to hollow -- Whoo-pee ! Baird Boyd . MARTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shot him when the moon arose ; And where he lies the vulture knows Along the Tinto River . In schools of eastern culture pale My cloistered flesh began to fail ; They bore me where the deserts quail To winds from out the sun . I looked upon the land and sky , Nor hoped to live nor feared to die ; And from my hollow breast a sigh Fell o'er the burning waste . But strong I grew and tall I grew ; I drank the region 's balm and dew ,  --  It made me lithe in limb and thew ,  --  How swift I rode and ran ! And oft it was my joy to ride Over the sand-blown ocean wide While , ever smiling at my side , Rode Marta of Milrone . A flood of horned heads before , The trampled thunder , smoke and roar , Of full four thousand hoofs , or more --  A cloud , a sea , a storm ! Oh , wonderful the desert gleamed , As , man and maid , we spoke and dreamed Of love in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes with Love 's great magic shone . " Be mine , O Marta of Milrone ,  --  Your hand , your heart be all my own ! " Her lips made sweet response . " I love you , yes ; for you are he Who from the East should come to me --  And I have waited long ! " Oh , we Were happy as the sun . There came upon a hopeless quest , With hell and hatred in his breast , A stranger , who his love confessed To Marta long in vain . To me she spoke : " Chosen mate , His eyes are terrible with fate ,  --  I fear his love , I fear his hate ,  --  I fear some looming ill ! " Then to the church we twain did ride , I kissed her as she rode beside . How fair -- how passing fair my bride With gold combs in her hair ! Before the Spanish priest we stood Of San Gregorio 's brotherhood --  A shot rang out !  - -  and in her blood My dark-eyed darling lay . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she cried ,  --  Smiling upon me ere she died ,  --  " Adieu , my love , adieu ! " I knelt before St. Mary 's shrine And held my dead one 's hand in mine , " Vengeance , " I cried , " O Lord , be thine , But I thy minister ! " I kissed her thrice and sealed my vow ,  --  Her eyes , her sea-cold lips and brow ,  --  " Farewell , my heart is dying now , O Marta of Milrone ! " Then swift upon my steed I lept ; My streaming eyes the desert swept ; I saw the accursed where he crept Against the blood-red sun . I galloped straight upon his track , And never more my eyes looked back ; The world was barred with red and black ; My heart was flaming coal . Through the delirious twilight dim And the black night I followed him ; Hills did we cross and rivers swim ,  --  My fleet foot horse and I. The morn burst red , a gory wound , O'er iron hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save beat of horses ' hoofs . Unto the murderer 's ear they said , " Thou'rt of the dead ! Thou'rt of the dead ! " Still on his stallion black he sped While death spurred on behind . Fiery dust from the blasted plain Burnt like lava in every vein ; But I rode on with steady rein Though the fierce sand-devils spun . Then to a sullen land we came , Whose earth was brass , whose sky was flame ; I made it balm with her blessed name In the land of Mexico . With gasp and groan my poor horse fell ,  --  Last of all things that loved me well ! I turned my head -- a smoking shell Veiled me his dying throes . But fast on vengeful foot was I ; His steed fell , too , and was left to die ; He fled where a river 's channel dry Made way to the rolling stream . Red as my rage the huge sun sank . My foe bent low on the river 's bank And deep of the kindly flood he drank While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and man to man I fought him where the river ran , While the trembling palm held up its fan And the emerald serpents lay . The mad , remorseless bullets broke From tongues of flame in the sulphur smoke ; The air was rent till the desert spoke To the echoing hills afar . Hot from his lips the curses burst ; He fell ! The sands were slaked of thirst ; A stream in the stream ran dark at first , And the stones grew red as hearts . I shot him where the Rio flows ; I shot him when the moon arose ; And where he lies the vulture knows Along the Tinto River . But where she lies to none is known Save to my poor heart and a lonely stone On which I sit and weep alone Where the cactus stars are white . Where I shall lie , no man can say ; The flowers all are fallen away ; The desert is so drear and grey , O Marta of Milrone ! Herman Scheffauer . JACK DEMPSEY 'S GRAVE FAR out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where Columbia 's mighty waters Roll down to the Ocean 's tide ; Where the giant fir and cedar Are imaged in the wave , O'ergrown with ferns and lichens , I found poor Dempsey 's grave . I found no marble monolith , No broken shaft nor stone , Recording sixty victories This vanquished victor won ; No rose , no shamrock could I find , No mortal here to tell Where sleeps in this forsaken spot The immortal Nonpareil . A winding , wooded canyon road That mortals seldom tread Leads up this lonely mountain To this desert of the dead . And the western sun was sinking In Pacific 's golden wave ; And these solemn pines kept watching Over poor Jack Dempsey 's grave . That man of honor and of iron , That man of heart and steel , That man who far out-classed his class And made mankind to feel That Dempsey 's name and Dempsey 's fame Should live in serried stone , Is now at rest far in the West In the wilds of Oregon . Forgotten by ten thousand throats That thundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his very name ; Oblivion wraps his faded form , But ages hence shall save The memory of that Irish lad That fills poor Dempsey 's grave . O Fame , why sleeps thy favored son In wilds , in woods , in weeds ? And shall he ever thus sleep on --  Interred his valiant deeds ? ' T is strange New York should thus forget Its " bravest of the brave , " And in the wilds of Oregon Unmarked , leave Dempsey 's grave . MacMahon . THE CATTLE ROUND-UP ONCE more are we met for a season of pleasure , That shall smooth from our brows every furrow of care , For the sake of old times shall we each tread a measure And drink to the lees in the eyes of the fair . Once more let the hand-clasp of years past be given ; Let us once more be boys and forget we are men ; Let friendships the chances of fortune have riven Be renewed and the smiling past come back again . The past , when the prairie was big and the cattle Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry a gun , to make our spurs rattle , And to ride a blue streak was the most that we knew ; The past when we headed each year for Dodge City And punched up the drags on the old Chisholm Trail ; When the world was all bright and the girls were all pretty , And a feller could " mav'rick " and stay out of jail . Then here 's to the eyes that like diamonds are gleaming , And make the lamps blush that their duties are o'er ; And here 's to the lips where young love lies a-dreaming ; And here 's to the feet light as air on the floor ; And here 's to the memories -- fun 's sweetest sequel ; And here 's to the night we shall ever recall ; And here 's to the time -- time shall know not its equal When we danced the day in at the Cattlemen 's Ball .

LOVE LYRICS OF A COWBOY IT hai n't no use fer me to say There 's others with a style an ' way That beats hers to a fare-you-well , Fer , on the square , I 'm here to tell I jes ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kin be . Fer any fault I finds excuse --  I 'll tell you , pard , it hai n't no use Fer me to try to raise a hand , When on my heart she 's run her brand . The bunk-house ai n't the same to me ; The bunch jes makes me weary -- Gee ! I never knew they was so coarse --  I warps my face to try to force A smile at each old gag they spring ; Fer I 'd heap ruther hear her sing " Sweet Adeline , " or softly play The " Dream o ' Heaven " that-a-way . Besides this place , most anywhere I 'd ruther be -- so she was there . She called me " dear , " an ' do you know , My heart jes skipped a beat , an ' tho ' I 'm hard to feaze , I 'm free to yip My reason nearly lost its grip . She called me " dear , " jes sweet an ' slow , An ' lookin ' down an ' speakin ' low ; An ' if I had ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd shake ' em all without one fear If ' fore I 'd go she 'd call me " dear . " You wonders why I slicks up so On Sundays , when I gits to go To see her -- well , I 'm free to say She 's like religion that-a-way . Jes sort o ' like some holy thing , As clean as young grass in the spring ; An ' so before I rides to her I looks my best from hat to spur --  But even then I hai n't no right To think I look good in her sight . If she should pass me up -- say , boy , You jes put hobbles on your joy ; First thing you know , you gits so gay Your luck stampedes and gits away . An ' do n't you even start a guess That you 've a cinch on happiness ; Fer few e'er reach the Promised Land If they starts headed by a band . Ride slow an ' quiet , humble , too , Or Fate will slap its brand on you . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a night-hawk 's sudden whir , Or cottonwoods a-whisperin while The red moon smiles a lovin ' smile . An ' there I set an ' hold her hand So glad I jes ca n't understand The reason of it all , or see Why all the world looks good to me ; Or why I sees in it heap more Of beauty than I seen before . Fool talk , perhaps , but it jes seems We 're ridin ' through a range o ' dreams ; Where medder larks the year round sing , An ' it 's jes one eternal spring . An ' time -- why time is gone -- by gee ! There 's no such thing as time to me Until she says , " Here , boy , you know You simply jes have got to go ; It 's nearly twelve . " I rides away , " Dog-gone a clock ! " is what I say . R. V. Carr .

The rancherias on the mountain side , The haciendas of the Llano wide , Are quickened by the matador 's renown . Se corren los toros ! And Juan brings his Pepita into town .

Or else the lumbering carts are brought in play , That jolt and scream and groan along the way , But to their happy tenants cause no frown . Se corren los toros ! And Juan brings his Pepita into town . The Plaza De Los Toros offers seats , Some deep in shade , on some the fierce sun beats ; These for the don , those for the rustic clown . Se corren los toros !

THE COWBOY 'S DANCE SONG YOU ca n't expect a cowboy to agitate his shanks In etiquettish manner in aristocratic ranks When he 's always been accustomed to shake the heel and toe At the rattling rancher dances where much etiquet do n't go .

When I got among the ladies in their frocks of fleecy white , And the dudes togged out in wrappings that were simply out of sight , Tell you what , I was embarrassed , and somehow I could n't keep From feeling like a burro in a pretty flock of sheep . Every step I made was awkward and I blushed a fiery red Like the principal adornment of a turkey gobbler 's head . The ladies said ' t was seldom that they had had the chance To see an old-time puncher at a high-toned dance . I cut me out a heifer from a bunch of pretty girls And yanked her to the center to dance the dreamy whirls . She laid her head upon my bosom in a loving sort of way And we drifted into heaven as the band began to play . I could feel my neck a-burning from her nose 's breathing heat , And she do-ce-doed around me , half the time upon my feet ; She peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pleasures of a high-toned dance . Every nerve just got a-dancing to the music of delight As I hugged the little sagehen uncomfortably tight ; But she never made a bellow and the glances of her eyes Seemed to thank me for the pleasure of a genuine surprise . She snuggled up against me in a loving sort of way , And I hugged her all the tighter for her trustifying play ,  --  Tell you what the joys of heaven ai n't a cussed circumstance To the hug-a-mania pleasures of a high-toned dance . When they struck the old cotillion on the music bill of fare , Every bit of devil in me seemed to burst out on a tear .

" The town was Anson City , old Jones 's county seat , Where they raise Polled Angus cattle , and waving whiskered wheat ; Where the air is soft and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , And the prairies is explodin ' with agricultural wealth ; Where they print the Texas Western , that Hec .

" ' T was there , I say , at Anson , with the lively " Widder Wall , " That I went to that reception , " The Cowboys ' Christmas Ball . " The boys had left the ranches and come to town in piles ; The ladies --  " kinder scatterin ' " had gathered in for miles . And yet the place was crowded , as I remember well , ' T was got for the occasion at " The Morning Star Hotel . " The music was a fiddle and a lively tambourine , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abilene . The room was togged out gorgeous -- with mistletoe and shawls , And candles flickered frescoes around the airy walls . The " wimmin folks " looked lovely -- the boys looked kinder treed , Till their leader commenced yellin ' : " Whoa , fellers , let 's stampede . " The music started sighin ' and a-wailin ' through the hall , As a kind of introduction to " The Cowboys ' Christmas Ball . " The leader was a fellow that came from Swenson 's Ranch , They called him " Windy Billy , " from " little Dead-man 's Branch . " His rig was " kinder keerless , " big spurs and high-heeled boots ; He had the reputation that comes when " fellers shoots . " His voice was like the bugle upon the mountain 's height ; His feet were animated , an ' a mighty movin ' sight , When he commenced to holler , " Neow , fellers , stake yer pen !

That whirl at Anson City just takes the cake with me . I 'm sick of lazy shufflin 's , of them I 've had my fill , Give me a fronteer breakdown , backed up by Windy Bill .

The dashing cowboys , brown of face , sit in their saddle thrones And sing the wild songs of the range in free , uncultured tones , Or ride beside the pretty girls , like gallant cavaliers , And pour the usual fairy tales into their list'ning ears . Within the " best room " of the ranch the jolly gathered throng Buzz like a hive of human bees and lade the air with song ; The maidens tap their sweetest smiles and give their tongues full rein In efforts to entrap the boys in admiration 's chain . The fiddler tunes the strings with pick of thumb and scrape of bow , Finds one string keyed a note too high , another one too low ; Then rosins up the tight-drawn hairs , the young folks in a fret Until their ears are greeted with the warning words , " All set !

PART III COWBOY TYPES DOWN where the Rio Grande ripples --  When there 's water in its bed ; Where no man is ever drunken --  All prefer mescal instead ; Where no lie is ever uttered --  There being nothin ' one can trade ; Where no marriage vows are broken ' Cause the same are never made . THE COWBOY HE wears a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leggins of fancy fringed leather ; He takes pride in his boots and the pistol he shoots , And he 's happy in all kinds of weather ; He 's fond of his horse , it 's a broncho , of course , For oh , he can ride like the devil ; He is old for his years and he always appears Like a fellow who 's lived on the level ; He can sing , he can cook , yet his eyes have the look Of a man that to fear is a stranger ; Yes , his cool , quiet nerve will always subserve For his wild life of duty and danger . He gets little to eat , and he guys tenderfeet , And for fashion , oh well ! he 's not in it ; He can rope a gay steer when he gets on its ear At the rate of two-forty a minute ; His saddle 's the best in the wild , woolly West , Sometimes it will cost sixty dollars ; Ah , he knows all the tricks when he brands mavericks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is loyal as steel , but demands a square deal , And he hates and despises a coward ; Yet the cowboy , you 'll find , to women is kind Though he 'll fight till by death overpowered .

A RANGER HE never made parade of tooth or claw ; He was plain as us that nursed the bawlin ' herds . Though he had a rather meanin ' - lookin ' jaw , He was shy of exercisin ' it with words . As a circus-ridin ' preacher of the law , All his preachin ' was the sort that hit the nail ; He was just a common ranger , just a ridin ' pilgrim stranger , And he labored with the sinners of the trail . Once a Yaqui knifed a woman , jealous mad , Then hit southward with the old , old killer 's plan , And nobody missed the woman very bad , While they 'd just a little rather missed the man . But the ranger crossed his trail and sniffed it glad , And then loped away to bring him back again , For he stood for peace and order on the lonely , sunny border And his business was to hunt for sinful men ! So the trail it led him southward all the day , Through the shinin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat had drove the lizards from their play To the shade of rock and bush and yucca stake . And the mountains heaved and rippled far away And the desert broiled as on the devil 's prong , But he did n't mind the devil if his head kept clear and level And the hoofs beat out their clear and steady song . Came the yellow west , and on a far off rise Something black crawled up and dropped beyond the rim , And he reached his rifle out and rubbed his eyes While he cussed the southern hills for growin ' dim . Down a hazy ' royo came the coyote cries , Like they laughed at him because he 'd lost his mark , And the smile that brands a fighter pulled his mouth a little tighter As he set his spurs and rode on through the dark . Came the moonlight on a trail that wriggled higher Through the mountains that look into Mexico , And the shadows strung his nerves like banjo wire And the miles and minutes dragged unearthly slow . Then a black mesquite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung thunder back again , And he caught himself and fumbled at his rifle while he grumbled That his bridle arm had weight enough for ten . Though his rifle pointed wavy-like and slack And he grabbed for leather at his hawse 's shy , Yet he sent a soft-nosed exhortation back That convinced the sinner -- just above the eye . So the sinner sprawled among the shadows black While the ranger drifted north beneath the moon , Wabblin ' crazy in his saddle , workin ' hard to stay a-straddle While the hoofs beat out a slow and sorry tune . When the sheriff got up early out of bed , How he stared and vowed his soul a total loss , As he saw the droopy thing all blotched with red That came ridin ' in aboard a tremblin ' hawse .

THE DESERT ' T WAS the lean coyote told me , baring his slavish soul , As I counted the ribs of my dead cayuse and cursed at the desert sky , The tale of the Upland Rider 's fate while I dug in the water hole For a drop , a taste of the bitter seep ; but the water hole was dry !

" And thus , " said the lean coyote , " his need is the hungry 's feast , And mine . " I fumbled and pulled my gun -- emptied it wild and fast , But one of the crazy shots went home and silenced the waiting beast ; There lay the shape of the Liar , dead !

Dreams and visions within the dream ; turmoil and fire and pain ; Hands that proffered a brimming cup -- empty , ere I could take ; Then the burst of a thunder-head -- rain ! It was rude , fierce rain ! Blindly down to the hole I crept , shivering , drenched , awake ! Dawn -- and the edge of the red-rimmed sun scattering golden flame , As stumbling down to the water hole came the horse that I thought was dead ; But never a sign of the other beast nor a trace of a rider 's name ; Just a rain-washed track and an empty gun -- and the old home trail ahead .

THE BANDIT 'S GRAVE ' MID lava rock and glaring sand , ' Neath the desert 's brassy skies , Bound in the silent chains of death A border bandit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowly mound ; The cactus stands with lances drawn ,  --  A martial guard around . His dreams are free from guile or greed , Or foray 's wild alarms . No fears creep in to break his rest In the desert 's scorching arms . He sleeps in peace beside the trail , Where the twilight shadows play , Though they watch each night for his return A thousand miles away . From the mesquite groves a night bird calls When the western skies grow red ; The sand storm sings his deadly song Above the sleeper 's head . His steed has wandered to the hills And helpless are his hands , Yet peons curse his memory Across the shifting sands . The desert cricket tunes his pipes When the half-grown moon shines dim ; The sage thrush trills her evening song --  But what are they to him ? A rude-built cross beside the trail That follows to the west Casts its long-drawn , ghastly shadow Across the sleeper 's breast . A lone coyote comes by night And sits beside his bed , Sobbing the midnight hours away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimless way Across the lonely mound , When the star-guards of the desert Their pickets post around . The winter snows will heap their drifts Among the leafless sage ; The pallid hosts of the blizzard Will lift their voice in rage ; The gentle rains of early spring Will woo the flowers to bloom , And scatter their fleeting incense O'er the border bandit 's tomb .

THE OLD MACKENZIE TRAIL SEE , stretching yonder o'er that low divide Which parts the falling rain ,  - -  the eastern slope Sends down its waters to the southern sea Through Double Mountain 's winding length of stream ; The western side spreads out into a plain , Which sinks away o'er tawny , rolling leagues At last into the rushing Rio Grande ,  --  See , faintly showing on that distant ridge , The deep-cut pathways through the shelving crest , Sage-matted now and rimmed with chaparral , The dim reminders of the olden times , The life of stir , of blood , of Indian raid , The hunt of buffalo and antelope ; The camp , the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely vigil through the night ; The stampede and the wild ride through the storm ; The call of California 's golden flood ; The impulse of the Saxon 's " Westward Ho " Which set our fathers ' faces from the east , To spread resistless o'er the barren wastes , To people all the regions ' neath the sun --  Those vikings of the old Mackenzie Trail . It winds -- this old forgotten cattle trail --  Through valleys still and silent even now , Save when the yellow-breasted desert lark Cries shrill and lonely from a dead mesquite , In quivering notes set in a minor key ; The endless round of sunny days , of starry nights , The desert 's blank immutability . The coyote 's howl is heard at dark from some Low-lying hill ; companioned by the loafer wolf They yelp in concert to the far off stars , Or gnaw the bleached bones in savage rage That lie unburied by the grass-grown paths . The prairie dogs play sentinel by day And backward slips the badger to his den ; The whir , the fatal strike of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , now and then , the curlew 's eerie call ,  --  Lost , always lost , and seeking evermore . All else is mute and dormant ; vacantly The sun looks down , the days run idly on , The breezes whirl the dust , which eddying falls Smothering the records of the westward caravans , Where silent heaps of wreck and nameless graves Make milestones for the old Mackenzie Trail . Across the Brazos , Colorado , through Concho 's broad , fair valley , sweeping on By Abilene it climbs upon the plains , The Llano Estacado ( beyond lie wastes Of alkali and hunger gaunt and death ) ,  --  And here is lost in shifting rifts of sand . Anon it lingers by a hidden spring That bubbles joy into the wilderness ; Its pathway trenched that distant mountain side , Now grown to gulches through torrential rain . De Vaca gathered pinons by the way , Long ere the furrows grew on yonder hill , Cut by the creaking prairie-schooner wheels ; La Salle , the gentle Frenchman , crossed this course , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages and for ages through the past Comanches and Apaches from the north Came sweeping southward , searching for the sun , And charged in mimic combat on the sea . The scions of Montezuma 's low-browed race Perhaps have seen that knotted , thorn-clad tree ; Or sucked the cactus apples growing there . All these have passed , and passed the immigrants , Who bore the westward fever in their brain , The Norseman tang for roving in their veins ; Who loved the plains as sailors love the sea , Braved danger , death , and found a resting place While traveling on the old Mackenzie Trail . Brave old Mackenzie long has laid him down To rest beyond the trail that bears his name ; A granite mountain makes his monument ; The northers , moaning o'er the low divide , Go gently past his long deserted camps . No more his rangers guard the wild frontier , No more he leads them in the border fight . No more the mavericks , winding stream of horns To Kansas bound ; the dust , the cowboy songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , Wild days in Texas by the Rio Grande . And some men say when dusky night shuts down , Dark , cloudy nights without a kindly star , One sees dim horsemen skimming o'er the plain Hard by Mackenzie 's trail ; and keener ears Have heard from deep within the bordering hills The tramp of ghostly hoofs , faint cattle lows , The rumble of a moving wagon train , Sometimes far echoes of a frontier song ; Then sounds grow fainter , shadows troop away ,  --  On westward , westward , as they in olden time Went rangeing o'er the old Mackenzie Trail . John A. Lomax . THE SHEEP-HERDER3 ALL day across the sagebrush flat , Beneath the sun of June , My sheep they loaf and feed and bleat Their never changin ' tune . And then , at night time , when they lay As quiet as a stone , I hear the gray wolf far away , " Alo-one ! " he says , " Alo-one ! " A-a ! ma-a ! ba-a ! eh-eh-eh ! The tune the woollies sing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , Though really just since Spring ; And nothin ' , far as I can see Around the circle 's sweep , But sky and plain , my dreams and me And them infernal sheep . I 've got one book -- it 's poetry --  A bunch of pretty wrongs An Eastern lunger gave to me ; He said ' t was " shepherd songs . " But , though that poet sure is deep And has sweet things to say , He never seen a herd of sheep Or smelt them , anyway . A-a ! ma-a ! ba-a ! eh-eh-eh ! My woollies greasy gray , An awful change has hit the range Since that old poet 's day . For you 're just silly , on'ry brutes And I look like distress , And my pipe ai n't the kind that toots And there 's no " shepherdess . " Yet ' way down home in Kansas State , Bliss Township , Section Five , There 's one that 's promised me to wait , The sweetest girl alive ; That 's why I salt my wages down And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay in town For booze and other things . A-a ! ma-a ! ba-a ! eh-eh-eh ! My Minnie , do n't be sad ; Next year we 'll lease that splendid piece That corners on your dad . We 'll drive to " literary , " dear , The way we used to do And turn my lonely workin ' here To happiness for you . Suppose , down near that rattlers ' den , While I sit here and dream , I 'd spy a bunch of ugly men And hear a woman scream . Suppose I 'd let my rifle shout And drop the men in rows , And then the woman should turn out --  My Minnie !  - -  just suppose . A-a ! ma-a ! ba-a ! eh-eh-eh ! The tune would then be gay ; There is , I mind , a parson kind Just forty miles away . Why , Eden would come back again , With sage and sheep corrals , And I could swing a singin ' pen To write her " pastorals . " I pack a rifle on my arm And jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do me harm ; I sometimes wish there was . If through that brush above the pool A red should creep -- and creep --  Wah ! cut down on ' im !  - -  Stop , you fool ! That 's nothin ' but a sheep . A-a ! ma-a ! ba-a !  - -  Hell ! Oh , sky and plain and bluff ! Unless my mail comes up the trail I 'm locoed , sure enough . What 's that ?  - -  a dust-whiff near the butte Right where my last trail ran , A movin ' speck , a -- wagon ! Hoot ! Thank God ! here comes a man . Charles Badger Clark , Jr. 3 Only such cowboys as are in desperate need of employment ever become sheep-herders . A COWBOY AT THE CARNIVAL YES , o ' cose it 's interestin ' to a feller from the range , Mighty queerish , too , I tell you ,  - -  sich a racket fer a change ; From a life among the cattle , from a wool shirt and the chaps To the biled shirt o ' the city and the other tony traps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every brand O ' humanity , I reckon , in this big mountain land Rounded up right here in Denver , runnin ' on new sort o ' feed .

Mighty curious to a rider comin ' from the range , he feels What you 'd call a lost sensation from sombrero clar to heels ; Like a critter stray that drifted in a windstorm from its range To another run o ' grazin ' where the brands it sees are strange . Then I see a city herder , a policeman , do n't you know , Sort o ' think he 's got men spotted an ' is ' bout to make a throw Fer to catch me an ' corral me fer a stray till he can talk On the wire an ' tell the owner fer to come an ' get his stock . Yes , it 's mighty strange an ' funny fer a cowboy , as you say , Fer to hit a camp like this one , so unanimously gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a rider sich as me Is n't built fer feedin ' on sich crazy jamboree .

I 'm hankerin ' , I tell you , fer to hit the trail an ' run Like a crazy , locoed yearlin ' from this big cloud-burst o ' fun Back toward the cattle ranches , where a feller 's breath comes free An ' he wears the clothes that fits him , ' stead o ' this slick toggery .

Anonymous . THE OLD COWMAN I RODE across a valley range I had n't seen for years . The trail was all so spoilt and strange It nearly fetched the tears . I had to let ten fences down ,  --  ( The fussy lanes ran wrong ) And each new line would make me frown And hum a mournin ' song . Oh , it 's squeak ! squeak ! squeak ! Hear ' em stretchin ' of the wire ! The nester brand is on the land ; I reckon I 'll retire . While progress toots her brassy horn And makes her motor buzz , I thank the Lord I was n't born No later than I wuz ! ' T was good to live when all the sod , Without no fence nor fuss , Belonged in partnership to God , The Government and us . With skyline bounds from east to west And room to go and come , I loved my fellowman the best When he was scattered some . Oh , it 's squeak ! squeak ! squeak ! Close and closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away And call a man a liar . Their house has locks on every door ; Their land is in a crate . There ai n't the plains of God no more , They 're only real estate . There 's land where yet no ditchers dig Nor cranks experiment ; It 's only lovely , free and big And is n't worth a cent . I pray that them who come to spoil May wait till I am dead Before they foul that blessed soil With fence and cabbage head . Yet it 's squeak ! squeak ! squeak ! Far and farther crawls the wire ! To crowd and pinch another inch Is all their heart 's desire . The world is over-stocked with men , And some will see the day When each must keep his little pen , But I 'll be far away . When my old soul hunts range and rest Beyond the last divide , Just plant me in some stretch of West That 's sunny , lone and wide . Let cattle rub my tombstone down And coyotes mourn their kin , Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you fence it in ! Oh , it 's squeak ! squeak ! squeak ! And they pen the land with wire . They figure fence and copper cents Where we laughed round the fire . Job cussed his birthday , night and morn In his old land of Uz , But I 'm just glad I was n't born No later than I wuz ! Charles Badger Clark , Jr . THE GILA MONSTER ROUTE THE lingering sunset across the plain Kissed the rear-end door of an east-bound train , And shone on a passing track close by Where a ding-bat sat on a rotting tie . He was ditched by a shock and a cruel fate . The con high-balled , and the manifest freight Pulled out on the stem behind the mail , And she hit the ball on a sanded rail . As she pulled away in the falling light He could see the gleam of her red tail-light . Then the moon arose and the stars came out --  He was ditched on the Gila Monster Route . Nothing in sight but sand and space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Not even a shack to beg for a lump , Or a hen-house to frisk for a single gump . He gazed far out on the solitude ; He drooped his head and began to brood ; He thought of the time he lost his mate In a hostile burg on the Nickle Plate . They had mooched the stem and threw their feet , And speared four-bits on which to eat ; But deprived themselves of daily bread And shafted their coin for " dago red . " Down by the track in the jungle 's glade , In the cool green grass , in the tules ' shade , They shed their coats and ditched their shoes And tanked up full of that colored booze . Then they took a flop with their skins plumb full , And they did not hear the harnessed bull , Till he shook them out of their boozy nap , With a husky voice and a loaded sap . They were charged with " vag , " for they had no kale , And the judge said , " Sixty days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  a worker 's plea ,  --  So they gave him a floater and set him free . They had turned him up , but ditched his mate , So he grabbed the guts of an east-bound freight , He flung his form on a rusty rod , Till he heard the shack say , " Hit the sod ! " The John piled off , he was in the ditch , With two switch lamps and a rusty switch ,  --  A poor , old , seedy , half-starved bo On a hostile pike , without a show . From away off somewhere in the dark Came the sharp , short notes of a coyote 's bark . The bo looked round and quickly rose And shook the dust from his threadbare clothes . Off in the west through the moonlit night He saw the gleam of a big head-light --  An east-bound stock train hummed the rail ; She was due at the switch to clear the mail . As she drew up close , the head-end shack Threw the switch to the passenger track , The stock rolled in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west-bound train . When she hove in sight far up the track , She was workin ' steam , with her brake shoes slack , She hollered once at the whistle post , Then she flitted by like a frightened ghost . He could hear the roar of the big six-wheel , And her driver 's pound on the polished steel , And the screech of her flanges on the rail As she beat it west o'er the desert trail . The John got busy and took the risk , He climbed aboard and began to frisk , He reached up high and began to feel For the end-door pin -- then he cracked the seal . ' T was a double-decked stock-car , filled with sheep , Old John crawled in and went to sleep . She whistled twice and high-balled out ,  --  They were off , down the Gila Monster Route . L. F.

Your voice is sweet as in alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring me the breath of the prairies , Known in the days that are sped , The wild geese 's cry and the blue , blue sky And the sailing clouds o'er head !

Oh , to hear once more the clanking Of the noisy cowboy 's spur , And the south wind 's kiss like a mild caress Making the grasses stir . I dream of the wide , wide prairies Touched with their glistening sheen , The coyotes ' cry and the wind-swept sky And the waving billows of green ! And oh , for a night in the open Where no sound discordant mars , And the marvelous glow , when the sun is low , And the silence under the stars ! Ho , wind from the western prairies ! Ho , voice from a far domain ! I feel in your breath what I 'll feel till death , The call of the plains again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of freedom in me ; My heart leaps high with a jubilant cry And I answer in ecstasy ! Ethel MacDiarmid . WHERE THE GRIZZLY DWELLS4 I ADMIRE the artificial art of the East ; But I love more the inimitable art of the West , Where nature 's handiwork lies in virginal beauty . Amidst the hum of city life I saunter back to dreams of home . Astride the back of my trusty steed I wander away , losing myself In the foothills of the Rockies . Away from human habitations , Up the rugged slopes , Through the timbered stretches , I hear the frightful cry of wolves And see a bear sneaking up behind . Many nights ago , While herding a bunch of cattle During the round-up season , I lay upon the grass Looking at the mated stars ; I wondered if a cowboy Could go to the Unknown Place , The Happy Hunting Ground , When this short life is over . But , here or there , I shall always live In the land of mountain air Where the grizzly dwells And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few ; In the land of the Bitterroot ,  --  The Indian land ,  - -  Land of the Golden West . James Fox. 4 Fox is a halfbreed Indian who sent me a lot of verse . Although he had never heard of Walt Whitman , these stanzas suggest that poet . The spelling and punctuation are mine . A COWBOY TOAST HERE 'S to the passing cowboy , the plowman 's pioneer ; His home , the boundless mesa , he of any man the peer ; Around his wide sombrero was stretched the rattler 's hide , His bridle sporting conchos , his lasso at his side . All day he roamed the prairies , at night he , with the stars , Kept vigil o'er thousands held by neither posts nor bars ; With never a diversion in all the lonesome land , But cattle , cattle , cattle , and sun and sage and sand . Sometimes the hoot-owl hailed him , when scudding through the flat ; And prairie dogs would sauce him , as at their doors they sat ; The rattler hissed its warning when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathless waste of sod . With lasso , quirt , and ' colter the cowboy knew his skill ; They pass with him to history and naught their place can fill ; While he , bold broncho rider , ne'er conned a lesson page ,  --  But cattle , cattle , cattle , and sun and sand and sage . And oh ! the long night watches , with terror in the skies ! When lightning played and mocked him till blinded were his eyes ; When raged the storm around him , and fear was in his heart Lest panic-stricken leaders might make the whole herd start . That meant a death for many , perhaps a wild stampede , When none could stem the fury of the cattle in the lead ; Ah , then life seemed so little and death so very near ,  --  With cattle , cattle , cattle , and darkness everywhere . Then quaff with me a bumper of water , clear and pure , To the memory of the cowboy whose fame must e'er endure From the Llano Estacado to Dakota 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of fenceless lands . Let us rear for him an altar in the Temple of the Brave , And weave of Texas grasses a garland for his grave ; And offer him a guerdon for the work that he has done With cattle , cattle , cattle , and sage and sand and sun .

RIDIN ' UP THE ROCKY TRAIL FROM TOWN " Billy Leamont rode out of the town --  Close at his shoulder rode Jack Lorell --  Over the leagues of the prairies brown , Into the hills where the sun goes down --  Billy Leamont and Jack Lorell ! * * * Billy Leamont looked down the dell --  Dead below ; him lay Jack Lorell --  With his gun at his forehead he fired and fell , Then rode they two through the streets of hell --  Billy Leamont and Jack Lorell !

Shorty 's nose wo n't bear paradin ' , Bill 's off eye is darkly fadin ' , All our toilets show a touch of disarray , For we found that City life is a constant round of strife And we ai nt the breed for shyin ' from a fray . Chant your warhoops , pardners , dear , while the east turns pale with fear And the chaparral is tremblin ' all aroun ' For we 're wicked to the marrer ; we 're a midnight dream of terror When we 're ridin ' up the rocky trail from town ! We acquired our hasty temper from our friend , the centipede . From the rattlesnake we learnt to guard our rights . We have gathered fightin ' pointers from the famous bronco steed And the bobcat teached us reppertee that bites .

Since the days that Lot and Abram split the Jordan range in halves , Just to fix it so their punchers would n't fight , Since old Jacob skinned his dad-in-law of six years ' crop of calves And then hit the trail for Canaan in the night , There has been a taste for battle ' mong the men that follow cattle And a love of doin ' things that 's wild and strange . And the warmth of Laban 's words when he missed his speckled herds Still is useful in the language of the range .

THE DISAPPOINTED TENDERFOOT HE reached the West in a palace car where the writers tell us the cowboys are , With the redskin bold and the centipede and the rattlesnake and the loco weed . He looked around for the Buckskin Joes and the things he 'd seen in the Wild West shows --  The cowgirls gay and the bronchos wild and the painted face of the Injun child . He listened close for the fierce war-whoop , and his pent-up spirits began to droop , And he wondered then if the hills and nooks held none of the sights of the story books . He 'd hoped he would see the marshal pot some bold bad man with a pistol shot , And entered a low saloon by chance , where the tenderfoot is supposed to dance While the cowboy shoots at his bootheels there and the smoke of powder begrims the air , But all was quiet as if he 'd strayed to that silent spot where the dead are laid . Not even a faro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long green . ' T was a blow for him who had come in quest of a touch of the real wild woolly West . He vainly sought for a bad cayuse and the swirl and swish of the flying noose , And the cowboy 's yell as he roped a steer , but nothing of this fell on his ear . Not even a wide-brimmed hat he spied , but derbies flourished on every side , And the spurs and the " chaps " and the flannel shirts , the high-heeled boots and the guns and the quirts , The cowboy saddles and silver bits and fancy bridles and swell outfits He 'd read about in the novels grim , were not on hand for the likes of him . He peered about for a stagecoach old , and a miner-man with a bag of gold , And a burro train with its pack-loads which he 'd read they tie with the diamond hitch . The rattler 's whir and the coyote 's wail ne'er sounded out as he hit the trail ; And no one knew of a branding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the oldest settler named Six-Gun Sim rolled a cigarette and remarked to him : " The West hez gone to the East , my son , and it 's only in tents sich things is done . " E. A. Brinninstool . A COWBOY ALONE WITH HIS CONSCIENCE WHEN I ride into the mountains on my little broncho bird , Whar my ears are never pelted with the bawlin ' o ' the herd , An ' a sort o ' dreamy quiet hangs upon the western air , An ' thar ai n't no animation to be noticed anywhere ; Then I sort o ' feel oneasy , git a notion in my head I 'm the only livin ' mortal -- everybody else is dead --  An ' I feel a queer sensation , rather skeery like , an ' odd , When thar ai n't nobody near me , ' ceptin ' God . Every rabbit that I startle from its shaded restin ' place , Seems a furry shaft o ' silence shootin ' into noiseless space , An ' a rattlesnake a crawlin ' through the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in a rather startlin ' way . Every breeze that dares to whisper does it with a bated breath , Every bush stands grim an ' silent in a sort o ' livin ' death --  Tell you what , a feller 's feelin 's give him many an icy prod , When thar ai n't nobody near him , ' ceptin ' God . Somehow allus git to thinkin ' o ' the error o ' my ways , An ' my memory goes wingin ' back to childhood 's happy days , When a mother , now a restin ' in the grave so dark an ' deep , Used to listen while I 'd whisper , " Now I lay me down to sleep . " Then a sort o ' guilty feelin ' gits a surgin ' in my breast , An ' I wonder how I 'll stack up at the final judgment test , Conscience always welts it to me with a mighty cuttin ' rod , When thar ai n't nobody near me , ' ceptin ' God .
