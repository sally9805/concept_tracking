OFFICIALLY America declared war on Germany in the spring of 1917 ; actually she committed her heart to the Allied cause in September , 1914 , when the first shipment of the supplies of mercy arrived in Paris from the American Red Cross . There are two ways of waging war : with artillery and armed men , with ambulances and bandages . There 's the war of destruction and the war of compassion . The one defeats the enemy directly with force ; the other defeats him indirectly by maintaining the morale of the men who are fighting and , what is equally important , of the civilians behind the lines . Belgium would not be the utterly defiant and unconquered nation that she is today , had it not been for the mercy of Hoover and his disciples . Their voluntary presence made the captured Belgian feel hat he was earning the thanks of all times . They were neutrals , but their mere presence condemned the cause that had brought hem there . Their compassion waged war against the Hun . The same is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fiercest of the carnage . They confirmed the poilu in his burning sease of injustice . That they , who could have absented themselves , should choose he damnation of destruction and dare he danger , convinced the entire French nation of its own righteousness . And it s true of the girls at the American hospitals , who nursed the broken bodies which heir brothers had rescued . It is true of Miss Holt 's Lighthouse for the training of blinded soldiers , which she established n Paris within eight months of war 's commencement . It is true of the American Relief Clearing House in Paris , which , up to January , 1917 , had received 201 shipments and had distributed eight million francs . When America put on armor , she American Red Cross , as the Army 's expert in the strategy of compassion , round that it had to take over more than eighty-six separate organizations which had been operating in France for the best part of two years . One can not show pity with indignant hands and keep the mind neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not with me is against me . " You can not leave houses , lands , children , wife ? everything that counts ? for the Kingdom of Heaven 's sake , without developing a rudimentary aversion for the devil . All of which goes to prove that America 's heart was fighting for the Allies long before her ambassador requested his passports from the Kaiser . The American Red Cross Commission landed in France on the 12th of June , 1917 , seven days ahead of the Expeditionary Force . Its first act was to convey a monetary gift to the French hospitals . The first actual American Red Cross contribution was made in April to the Number Five British Base Hospital . The first American soldiers in France were doctors and nurses . The first American fighting done in France was done with the weapons of pity . The chief function of the American Red Cross up to the spring of this year was to " carry on " and to bridge the gap of unavoidable delays while the army was preparing . The campaign which the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates is frankly an " out to win " campaign . To win the war is its one and only object . What the army does for the courage of the body , the Red Cross does for the courage of the mind . It builds up the hearts and hopes of people who in three and a half years have grown numb . It restores the human touch to their lives and , with it , their spiritual horizon . It is necessary to lay stress on this program , since it differs greatly from the popular conception of the functions of the Red Cross in the battle area . It was on the field of Solferino , in 1859 , that Henri Dunant went out before the fury had spent itself to tend the wounded . It was here that he was fired with his great ambition to found a non-combatant service , which should recognize no enemies and be friends with every army . His ambition was realized when in 1864 the Conference at Geneva chose the Swiss flag , reversed , as its emblem ? a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations for those international understandings which have since formed for all combatants , except the Hun in this present warfare , the protective law for the sick and wounded . The  | original purpose of the Red Cross still fills the imagination of the masses to the exclusion of all else that it is doing . Directly the term " Red Cross " is mentioned the picture that forms in most men 's minds is of ambulances galloping through the thick of battle smoke , and of devoted stretcher-bearers who brave danger , not to kill , but to save lives . This war has changed all that . Today the Red Cross has to minister not to the wounded of armies only , but to the wounded of nations . In a country like France , with trenches dug the entire length of her eastern frontier and vast territories from which the entire population has been evacuated , the wounds of her armies are small in comparison to the wounds , bodily and mental , of her civilians ? wounds which are the outcome of nearly four years of privation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pluck , no matter how splendid the spirit of its soldiers , its armies become paralyzed . The civilians can commence peace negotiations behind the backs of their men in the trenches . They can insist on peace by refusing to send them ammunition and supplies . As a matter of fact , the morale of the soldiers varies directly with the morale of the civilians for whom they fight . Behind every soldier stand a woman and a group of children . Their safety is his inspiration . If they are neglected , his sacrifice is belittled . If they beg that he should lay down his arms , his determination is weakened . It is therefore a vital necessity , quite apart from the humanitarian aspect , that the wounds of the civilians of belligerent countries should be cared for . If the civilians are allowed to become disheartened and cowardly , the heroic ideal of their fighting men is jeopardized . This fact has been recognized by the Red Cross societies of all countries in the present war ; a large part of their energies has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even in their purely military departments , the comfort of the troops claims quite as much attention as their medical treatment and hospitalization . As a matter of fact , the actual carrying of the wounded out of the trenches to the comparative safety of the dressing-station is usually done by combatants . A man has to live continually under shell-fire to acquire the immunity to fear which passes for courage . The bravest man is likely to get " jumpy " if he faces up to a bombardment only occasionally . There are other reasons why combatants should do the stretcher-bearing , which do not need elaborating . The combatants have an expert knowledge of their own particular frontage ; they are " wise " to the barraged areas ; they are " up front " and continually coming and going , so it is often an economy of man power for them to attend to their own wounded in the initial stages ; they are nearest to a comrade when he falls , and they all carry the necessary first - aid dressings ; the emblem of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the Hun is quite likely not to respect it . What I am driving at is that the Red Cross has had to adapt itself to the new conditions of modern warfare , so that many of its most important present-day functions are totally different from what popular fancy imagines . The American Red Cross has its French headquarters in a famous gambling club in the Place de la Concorde . It is somewhat strange to pass through those rooms where rakes once flung away fortunes , and to find them industriously orderly with the conscience of an imported nation . By far the larger part of the staff are business men of the Wall Street type ? not at all the kind who have been accustomed to sentimentalize over philanthropy . There is also a sprinkling of trained social workers , clergy , journalists , and university professors . The medical profession is represented by some of the leading specialists of the States , but at headquarters they are distinctly in the minority . Girls are very much in evidence . They are usually volunteers , drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would help . Today they are typists , secretaries , stenographers , nurses . The organization is divided into three main departments : military affairs , civil affairs , and administration .. Under these departments come a variety of bureaus : rehabilitation and reconstruction , care and prevention of tuberculosis , needy children and infant mortality , refugees and relief , re-education of the French muffles , supplies , rolling canteens for the French armies , the United States Army Division , Military , Medical and Surgical divisions , et cetera . They are too numerous to mention in detail . The best way I can convey the picture of immense accomplishment is to describe what I actually saw in the field of operations . The first place I shall take you to is Evian , because here you see the tragedy and need of France as embodied in individuals . Evian-les-Bains is on Lake Geneva , looking out across the water to Switzerland . It is the first point of call across the French frontier for the retarries returning from their German bondage . When the Boche first swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population behind him . He has  | since kept them working for him as serfs , aboring in the captured coal-mines , digging his various lines of defenses , setting p wire entanglements , et cetera . Apart from the testimony of repatriated French civilians , I myself have seen messages addressed by Frenchmen to their wives , scrawled surreptitiously on the planks of Hun dugouts in the hope that one day the dugouts would be captured and the mesges passed on by a soldier of the Allies . After three and a half years of enforced labor , many of these captured civilians re worked out . To the Boche , with his ever-increasing food-shortage , they represent useless mouths . Instead of filling hem he is driving their owners back , broken and useless , by way of Switzerland . To him human beings are merchandise to be sold upon the hoof like cattle . No spiritual values enter into the bargain . When the body is exhausted it is sent to the knacker 's , as though it belonged to a worn-out horse . The entire attitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort of the cosmopolitan , has become the knacker 's shop for French civilians exhausted by their German servi'tude . The Hun shoves them across the border at the rate of about 1300 a day . From the start 1 have always felt that this war was a crusade ; what I saw at Evian made me additionally cerLain . When I was in the trenches I never had any hatred of the Boche . Probably I shall lose my hatred in pity for him when I get to the Front again ? but for the present I hate him . It 's here in France that one sees what a vileness he has created in the children 's and women 's lives . I took the night train down from Paris . Early in the morning I woke up to find myself in the gorges of the Alps , high peaks with romantic , Italian-looking settings soaring on every side . At noon we reached Lake Geneva , lying slate-colored and somber beneath a wintry sky . That afternoon I saw the train of repatries arrive . I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might have been a funeral cortege , only there was a horrible difference : the corpses pretended to be alive . The American Ambulance men were there in force . They climbed into the carriages and commenced to help the infirm to alight . The exiles were all so stiff with travel that they could scarcely move at nrst. he wmaows of the train were gray with faces . Such faces ! All of them old , even the little children 's ! The Boche makes a present to France of only such human wreckage as is useless for his purposes . He is an acute man of business . The convoy con sisted of two classes of persons ? the very ancient and the very juvenile . You ca n't set a man of eighty to dig trenches , and you ca n't make a prostitute out of girl child of ten . Men , women , and children ? they all had the appearance of being half-witted . They were i erribly pathetic . As I watched them I tried to picture to my self what three and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How often they must have dreamed of the exaltation of this clay ? and now that it had arrived , they were not ex alted ! They had the look of people so spiritually benumbed that they would never know despair or exaltation again . They had a broken look ; their shoulders were crushed and their skirts draggled . Many of them carried babies ? pretty little beggars with flaxen hair . It was n't difficult to guess their parentage . As they were herded on the platform a low , strangled kind of moaning went up . I watched individual lips to see where the sound came from . I caught no movement . The noise was the sighing of tired animals . Every one had some treasured possession . Here was an old man with an alarm-clock , there an aged woman with an empty birdcage . A boy carried half a dozen saucepans strung together . Another had a spare pair of patched boots under his arm . Quite a lot of them clutched a bundle of umbrellas . I found mysclf reflecting that these were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they valued in the world . Whatever they had saved from the ruin ought to represent the possession which had claimed most of their affections , and yet what did an alarm-clock , an empty birdcage , a pair of patched boots , a string of saucepans , a bundle of ragged umbrellas signify in any life ? What utter poverty , if those were the best they could save ! There was a band on the platform , con sisting mainly of bugles and drums , to welcome them . The leader is reputed to be the laziest man in the French Army . It is said that they tried him at everything and then in despair sent him to Evian to drum forgotten happiness into the bones of the repatries . Whatever his former military record , he now does his utmost to impersonate the defiant and impas sioned soul of France . His mustaches are curled fiercely . His brows are heavy as thunder-clouds . When he drums , the veins swell out in his neck with the vio lence of his energy . Suddenly , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mar seillaise . " You should have seen the change in this crowd of corpses . You must remember that these people had been so long accustomed to lies and snares , that it  | would probably take days to persuade them that they were actually safe at home in France . As the battle-song for which they had suffered shook the air , their lips rustled like leaves . There was hardly any sound , only a hoarse whisper . Then , all of a sudden , words came , an inarticulate , sobbing commotion . Tears blinded the eyes of every spectator , even those who had often witnessed similar scenes ; we were weeping because the singing was so little human . " Vine la France ! Vive la France ! " They waved flags ? not the tricolor , but flags which had been given them in Swit zerland . They clung together dazed , women with slatternly dresses , children with peaked faces , men unhappy and un shaven . A woman caught sight of my uniform . " Vine l'Angleterre ! " she cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was horrible . They creaked like automatons . They gestured and mouthed , but the soul had been crushed out of the eyes . You do n't need any - proofs of Hun atrocities ; the proofs are to be seen at Evian . There are no severed hands , no crucified bodies ; only hearts that have been mutilated . Sorrow is at its saddest when it can not even contrive to appear dignified . There is no dignity about the repa tries at Evian , with their absurd umbrellas , saucepans , patched boots , alarm-clocks , and birdcages . They do not appeal to one as sacrificed patriots . There is no nobility in their vacant stare . They create a cold feeling of bodily decay ? only it is the spirit that is dead . There is a blasphemous story by Leonid Andreyev , which recounts the bitterness of the after years of Lazarus and the mischief Christ wrought in recalling him from the grave . After his unnatural return to life there was a blueness as of putrescence beneath his pallor , an iciness to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror in his gaze , as if he were remembering his three days in the sepulcher , as if forbidden knowledge groped behind his eyes . I thought of that story in the presence of this crowd , which carried with it the taint of the grave . But the band was still playing the " Marseillaise " ; over and over it played it . With each repetition it was as though these people , three years dead , made another effort to cast aside their shrouds . Little by little something was happen ing , something wonderful . Backs were straightening ; skirts were being caught up ; resolution was rippling from face to face ? it passed and repassed with each new roll of the drums . The hoarse cries and moaning with which they had com menced were gradually transforming themselves into singing . There were some who were too weak to walk ; these were carried by the American Red Cross men into the waiting ambulances . The remainder were marshaled into a disorderly procession and led out of the station by the band . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake ? the palaces to which all France used to troop for pleasure . We moved soddenly at first , shuffling in our steps . But the drums were still rolling out their defiance , and the bugles were still blowing . The laziest man in the French Army was doing his utmost to belie his record . The ill-shod , flattened feet took up the music . They began to dance . Were there ever feet less suited to dancing ? That they should dance was the acme of tragedy . Stockings fell down in creases about the ankles . Women commenced to jig their Boche babies in their arms ; consumptive men and ancients waved their saucepans and grotesque bundles of umbrellas . The sight was damnable . It was a burlesque . It pierced the heart . What right had the Boche to leave these people so comic after he had squeezed the life-blood out of them ? All his insults to humanity became suddenly typified in these five hundred jumping tatterdemalions ? the way in which he had plundered the world of its youth , its cleanness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never aroused , where men molder above ground and become unsightly beneath the open sky . The slain of battle-fields were at least motionless ; they did not gape and grin at you with the dreadful humor of these perambulating dead . I felt the Galilean passion that animates every Red Cross worker at Evian ; the agony to do something to make these murdered people live again . This convoy had come , I discovered . from a city behind the Boche lines , against which , last summer , I had often directed fire . It was full in sight from my observ ing station . I had watched the very houses in which these people who now walked beside me had been sheltered . For three and a half years these women 's bodies had been at the Hun 's mercy . I tried to bring the truth home to myself . Their men and young girls had been left behind . They themselves had been flung back on overburdened France only because they were no longer serviceable . They were returning actually penniless , though seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seizing all the good . redeemable French money of the repatrie ; before he lets them escape him , giving them in exchange worthless paper stutt of his own manufacture . which has no security behind it and is therefore not negotiable . We came to the Casino . where endless formalities were necessary . First of all . in the big hall formerly de voted to gambling , the repatrips were fed at long tables . As I passed , odd groups . seeing my uniform , hurried ly dropped whatever they were doing and , removing their caps , stood humbly at attention . There was fear in their promptness . Where they came from an officer exacted respect with the flat of his sword . What a dumb , helpless jumble of humanity ! It was as though the occupants of a morgue had become galvanized and had temporarily risen from their slabs . The band had been augmented by trumpets . It took its place in the gallery and deluged the hall with patriotic fervor . An old man climbed on a table and yelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shouting ; they soon grew tired . The cry was taken up faintly and soon exhausted itself . Nothing held their attention for long . Most of them sat hunched up and inert , weakly crying . They were not beautiful . They were not like our men who die in battle . They were animated memories of horror . " What lies before us ? What lies before us ? " That as the question that their silence asked perpetually . Some of them had husbands with the French armies ; others had sweet hearts . What would those men say to the flaxen-haired babies who nestled against the women 's breasts ? And the sin was not theirs ? they were such tired , pretty mites . " What lies before us ? " The babies , too , might well have asked that question . Do you wonder that I at last began to share the Frenchman 's hatred for the Boche ? An extraordinary person in a white tie . top hat , and evening dress entered . Evi dently he expected his advent to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the official welcomer to Evian . Twice a day , for  | an infinity of days , he had entered in solemn fashion , faced the same tragic assembly , made the same fiery oration , gained applause at the climax of the same rounded periods , and allowed his voice to break in the same rightly-timed places . Having kept his audience in sufficient suspense as regards his mission , he unwrapped the muffler from his neck , removed his coat , felt his throat to see whether it was in good condition , swelled out his chest ? including his waist-coat , which was spanned by the broad ribbon of his office ? then let loose the painter of his emotion and slipped off into the midstream of perfunctory eloquence . With all his disrobing he had retained his top hat ; he held it in his right hand with the brim pressed against his thigh , very much in the manner of a showman at a circus . It contributed largely to the opulence of his gestures . I He always seemed to have concluded and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spectral clapping . He called upon the repatries never to forget the crimes that had been wrought against them , to spread abroad the fire of their indignation , to tell the story of their ravished womanhood and broken families all over France . They watched him leaden-eyed and wept softly . To forget , to forget , that was all that they wanted to Hot out all the past . This man with his top hat and the evening dress , he had not suffered ? how could he understand ? They did not want to remember ; with those flaxen-haired children against their breasts the one boon they craved was forgetfulness . And so they cowered and wept softly . It was intolerable . AND now the formalities commenced . They all had to be medically examined . Questions of every description were asked them . They drifted from bureau to bureau where people sat filling up official blanks . The Americans see to the children . They come from living in cellars , from conditions which were insanitary , from cities in the army zones where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contagion all over France . When infectious cases are found , the remnants of families have to be broken up afresh . The mothers collapse on benches , sobbing their hearts out as their children are led away . For three and a half years everything they have loved has been led away ? how can they believe that these Americans mean only mercy ? From three to four hours are spent in completing all these necessary investigations . Before the repairies are conducted , to their billets , all their clothes have to be disinfected , and every one has to be bathed . The poor people are utterly worn out at the end of it ; they have already done a continuous four days ' journey in cramped trains . Before being sent to France they have been living for from two to three weeks in Belgium . The Hun always sends the repatries to Belgium for a few weeks before returning them . The reason for this is that for the most part they come from the army zones , and a few weeks will make any information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food is more plentiful in Belgium , thanks to the Allies ' Relief Commission . These people have been kept alive on sugarbeets for the past few months , so it is as well to feed them at the Allies ' expense for a little while , in order that they may create a better impression when they return to France . The American doctors pointed out to me the pulpy flesh of the children and the distended stomachs which , to the unpractised eye , seemed a sign of overnourishment . " Wind and water , " they said ; " that 's all these children are . They 've no stamina . Sugar-beets are the most economical means of just keeping the body and the soul together . " The lights are going out in the Casino . It is the hour when , in the old days , life would be becoming most feverish about the gamingtables . In little , forlorn groups the repatries  | are being conducted to their temporary quarters in the town . To-morrow morning before it is light another train-load will arrive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Red Cross workers will again be in attendance , the gentleman in the top hat and white tie will again make his fiery oration of welcome ; his audience will again pay no attention but will weep softly ? the tediously heartrending scene will be rehearsed throughout in every detail by an entirely new batch of actors . Twice a day , summer and winter , the same tragedy is enacted at Evian . It is a continuous , never-ending performance . POOR people ! These whom I have seen . ii they have no friends to claim them , will restart their journey to some strange department on which they will be billeted as paupers . Here again the American Red Cross is doing good work . for it sends one of its representatives ahead to see that proper preparation , - have been made for their reception . After they have reached their destination it looks them up from time to time to make sure that they are being well cared for . If one wants to picture the case of the repatrie in its true misery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of his own mother or grandmother . She has lived all her life in the neighborhood of Vimy , let us say . She was married there , and it was there that she bore all her children . She and her husband had saved money ; they are substantial people now and need not fear the future . Their sons are gaining their own living ; one daughter is married , the others are arriving at the marriagable age . One day the Hun sweeps down on them . The sons escape to join the French army ; the girls and their parents stay behind to guard their property . They are immediately evacuated from Vimy and sent to some city , such as Drocourt , further behind the Hun front line . Here they are gradually robbed of all their possessions . At the begin ning all their gold is confiscated ; later ever . the mattresses upon their beds are requisitioned . For three and a half years they arm subjected to both big and petty tyrannies , till . their spirits are so broken that fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the mines . One by one the daughters are commandeered and sent off into the heart of Germany where it will be no one 's business to guard their virtue . At last the mother is left with only her youngest child . Of her sons who are fighting with the French armies she has no knowledge whether they are living or dead . Then one clay it is decided by her captors that they have no further use for her . They part her from her last remaining child and pack her off by way of Belgium and Switzerland back to her own country . She arrives at Evian penniless and half-witted with the terror of her sorrow . There is no one to claim her ; the part of France that knew her is all behind the German lines . A label is tied to her , as if she were a piece of baggage . and she is shipped off to Avignon , let us say . She has never been in the south before ; it is a foreign country to her . Poverty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will command respect . There is nothing left in life to which she can fasten her affections . Such utter forlornness is never a welcome sight . Is it to be wondered at that the strangers to whom she is sent are not always glad to see her ? Is it to be wondered at that after her repatriation she often wiltand dies ? Her sorrow has the appearance of degradation . Wherever she goes she is a threat and a peril to the fighting morale of the civilian population . Yet in her pre-war kindliness and security she might have been your mother or mine . The American Red Cross , by maintaining contact with such people , is keeping them reminded that they are not utterly deserted ? that the whole of civilized humanity cares tremendously for what becomes of them , and is  | anxious to lighten the load of their sacrifice They have been bullied out o the desire to live and out of all possession of either their bodies or their souls . They have been treated like cattle , and as cattle they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat they are ! The unmerciful Boche , having killed and buried them . drags them out from the tomb and compels them to go through the antics of life . HE pathetic hunger of these people for fine another after they have been so long divided was illustrated for me on my return journey to Paris . A man of the tradesman class had been to Evian to meet his wife and his boy of about eleven . They were among the lucky ones , for they had a home to go to . He . was not prepossessing in appearance . He had a weak face lined with anxiety , broken teeth . and limp hair . His wife , as so often happens in French marriages , had evidently been the manageress . She was unbeautiful in rusty black ; her clothes were the ill-assorted makeshifts of the civilian who escapes from Germany . Her eves were shifty with the habit of fear and sunken with the weariness of crying . The boy was a bright little fellow , full of defiance and anecdotes of his recent captors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled together ? the man in the middle . with an arm about either of them . He kept pressing them to him , kissing them by turns in a spasmodic , unrestrained fashion , as if he still feared that he might lose them and could not convince himself of the happy truth that they were once again together . The woman did not respond to his embraces ; she seemed indifferent to him , indifferent to life , indifferent to any prospects . The boy seemed fond of his father but embarrassed by his starved demonstrativeness . I listened to their conversation . The man 's talk was all of the future , what splendid things he would do for them , how , as long as they lived , he would never waste a moment from their sides . It appeared that he had been at Tours on a business trip when the war broke out , and could not get back to Lille before the Germans arrived there . For three and a half years he had lived in suspense , while everything he loved had lain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his brilliant plans . She clung to him . but she tried to divert his affection . When she spoke , it was of small domestic abuses : the exorbitant prices she had had to pay for food ; the way the soldiery had stolen her pots and pans ; the insolence she had experienced when she had lodged complaints against the men before their officers . And the boy , he wanted to be a poilu . He kept inventing revenges he would take in battle , if the war lasted long enough for his class to be called out . As darkness fell , they ceased talking . I began to realize that in three and a half years they had lost contact . They were saying over and over the things that had been said already ; they were trying to prevent themselves from acknowledging that they had grown different and separate . The only bond which held them as a family was their common loneliness and their fear that , if they did not hold together , their intolerable loneliness would return . When the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's shoulder ; the woman nestled herself in the fold of his arm with her head turned away from him that he might not kiss her so often . The man sat upright , his eyes wide open , watching them sleeping , with a kind of impotent despair . They were together , and yet they were not together . He had recovered them ; nevertheless , he had not recovered them . Those Boches. the devils , they had kept something ; they had only sent their bodies back . All night long , whenever 1 woke up as the train halted , the little man was still guarding them jealously as a dog guards a bone , and staring morosely at the blank wall of the future . These were among the lucky ones ; the boyand woman had a man to meet them . Some- where in France there was protection awaiting them and the shelter of a house that was not charity . And yet ? all night while they slept , the man sat awake , facing up to facts . That is Evian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see it embodied in individuals . THE American Red Cross is specializing on its efforts . to reclaim the children of devastated France , realizing that whatever happens to the adults , the children are the hope of the world . The part of the Front to which I went to study was made famous in 1914 by the disembowelings. shootings , and unspeakable indecencies that were perpetrated there . Near by is the little village in which Sister Julie risked her life by refusing to allow her wounded to be butchered . She wears the Legion of Honor now . In the same neighborhood there lives a mayor who , after having seen his young wife murdered , protected her murderers from the lynch law of the mob when next day the town was recaptured . In the same district there is a meadow where fifteen old men were clone to death while a Hun officer sat under an oak-tree , drinking mocking toasts to the victims of each new execution . The influence of more than three years of warfare has not been elevating , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little over a month from the arrival of the American Red Cross in France , an S. O. S. was sent out by the prefect of the department , begging it to come and help . In addition to the refugees of old standing , three hundred and fifty children had been suddenly put into his care . He had nothing but a temporary shelter for them . and his need for assistance was acute . Within a few hours the Red Cross had despatched eight workers ? a doctor , nurse , bacteriologist. administrative director , two workers , and two women to take charge of the bedding , food , and clothing . A cainionrlie loaded with condensed milk and other relief necessities was sent by road . On the arrival of the party they found the children herded together in old barracks , dirty and unfinished , with no sanitary appliances whatsoever . The sick were crowded with the well . Of the three hundred and fifty children , twenty-one were under one year of age , and the rest between one and eight years .

It was the machinery of mercy which had been built up in six months about this nucleus of eight persons that I set out to visit . The roads were crowded with the crack troops of France ? the Foreign Legion , the Tailleurs. the Moroccans ? all marching in one direction . eastward to the trenches . There were rumors of something immense about to happen ? no one knew quite what . Were we going to put on a new offensive , or were we going to resist one ? Many answers were given ; they were all guesswork . Meanwhile , our progress was slow ; we were continually halting to let brigades of artillery and regiments of infantry pour into the main artery of traffic from lanes and side roads .

They knew that something big was to be demanded of them ; before the demand had been made , they had determined to give to the ultimate of their strength . There was a spiritual resolution about their faces which made all their expressions one ? the uplifted expression of the unconquered soul of France . That expression blotted out their racial differences . It did not matter that they were Arabs , Negroes , Normans , Parisians ; they owned to one na- tionality , the nationality of martyrdom , and they marched with a single purpose , that freedom , might be restored to the world . When we reached the city to which we journeyed , night had fallen . There was something sinister about our entry ; we were veiled in fog and crept through the gate and beneath the ramparts with extinguished headlights . Scarcely any one was abroad . Those whom we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vanished . This city was among the most beautiful in France ; until recently , although within range of the Hun artillery , it had been left undisturbed . In return the French had spared an equally beautiful city on the other side of the line . This clemency shown toward two gems of architecture was the result of one of those silent bargains that are arranged in the language of the guns . But the bargain had been broken by the time I arrived . Bombing planes had been over ; the Allied planes had retaliated . Houses , emptied like cart-loads of bricks into the street , were significant of the ruin that was pending . Any moment the orchestra of destruction might break into its overture . Without cessation one could hear a distant booming . The fiddlers of death were tuning up . EARLY next morning I went to see the prefect . He is an ' old man , whose courage has made Lim honored wherever the French tongue is spoken . Others have thought of their own safety and withdrawn into the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavered . Night and day he has labored incessantly for the refugees , to whom he refers always as " my suffering people . " He kept me waiting for some time . Directly I entered he volunteered the explanation ; he had just received word from the military authorities that the whole of his civil population must be immediately evacuated . To evacuate a civil population means to tear it up and transplant it root and branch , with no more of its possessions than can be carried as hand-baggage . Some seventy-five thousand people would be made homeless directly the prefect published the order . It was a dramatic moment . full of tragedy . I glanced out into the square filled with wintry sunlight : I took note of the big gold gates and the monuments . I watched the citizens halting here and there to chat , or going about their errands with a quiet confidence . All this was to be shattered . The enemy city on the other side of the line was to be shelled ; this city had to take the consequences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city was concerned , but also as regards its inhabitants ' happiness . They had homes today ; they would be fugitives tomorrow . Then I looked at the old prefect , who had to break the news to them . He was sitting at his table in his uniform of office , supporting his head in his tired hands . " What are you going to do ? " I asked . " I have called on the Croix Rouge Americaine to help me , " he said . " They have helped me before ; they will help me again . These Americans ? I have never been to America , but they are my friends . Since they came , they have looked after my babies . Their doctors and nurses have worked day and night for my suffering people . They are silent , but they do things . There is love in their hands ' While I was still with him the Red Cross officials arrived . They had already wired to Paris . Their lorries and ambulances were converging from all points to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their transport facilities at his disposal . They had started their arrangements for the handling of the children . An extra personnel was being rushed to the spot . One unit was already in the city . They had hoped to go nearer to the Front , but on arriving had learned that their permission had been canceled , It was a bit of luck . They could set to work at once . I knew his unit and went out to find it . It was composed of American society girls , who  | had been protected all their lives from ugliness . When I visited them , after leaving the preJet 's , they had heard nothing of the city 's sentence of the evacuation of the civil population . All they knew was that the hospital which had been appointed with their money was only a few kilometers away and that they were forbidden even to see it . They were gloomy with the fear that within a handful of days they would again be walking the boulevards of Paris . When the news was broken to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance of it did not dawn on them at once . " But we do n't want anything easy , " they complained . " This is n't the Front . " " It will be , soon , " the official told them . When they heard that , they cheered up ; then their share in the drama was explained . In all probability the city would soon be under constant shell-fire . Refugees would be pouring back from the forward country . The people of the city itself had to be helped to escape before the bombardment commenced . They would have to stay there , taking care of the children , packing them into lorries , driving ambulances , rendering first aid , taking the wounded and decrepit out of danger , and always returning to it again themselves . As the certainty of the risk and service was impressed on them , their faces brightened . Risk and service , that was what they most desired ; they were girls . but they hungered to play a soldier 's part . They had dreamed only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of waiting stung their pride . It was in Paris that the dream of risk had commenced . They would make France want them . Their chance had come . WHEN I came out into the streets again , the word was spreading . Carts were being loaded in front of houses . Everything on wheels . from wagons to perambulators , was being piled up . Everything on four legs , dogs , cattle . horses ? was being harnessed and made to do its share in hauling . We left the city , going back to the next point where the refugees would be cared for . On either side of the road . as far as eye could stretch , trenches had been dug , barricades thrown up , blockades and wire entanglements constructed . It all lay quiet beneath the sunlight . It seemed a kind o ' preposterous pretence . One could not imagine these fields as a scene of battle , sweating torture and agony and death . I looked back at the city , one of the most beautiful in France . growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Impossible ! Then I remembered the carts being hurriedly loaded and the uplifted faces of those American girls . Where had I seen their expression before ' Yes . Strange that they should have caught it ! Their expression was the same as that which I had noticed on the Tailleurs , the Foreign Legion , and the Moroccans , the crack troops of France ! So they had become that already ! At the first hint of danger , their courage had taken command ; they had risen into soldiers . Through villages swarming with troops and packed with ordnance we arrived at an old caserne , which had been converted into the children 's hospital of the district . It is in charge of one of the first of America 's children 's specialists . While he works among the refugees . his wife . who is a sculptress , makes maskfor the facially mutilated . He has brought with him from the States some of his students . but his staff is in the main cosmopolitan . One of his nurses is an Australian who was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knowledge , despite her nationality , was allowed to help to organize the Red Cross work of the enemy . Another is a French woman who wears the Croix de Guerre with the palm . She saved her wounded from the fury of the Hun when her village was lost , and helped to get them back to safety after it had been recaptured . The matron is Swedish and Belgian . The ambulance drivers are some of  | the American boys who saw service with the French armies . In this group of workers there are as many stories as there are nationalities . If the workers have their stories , so have the five hundred little patients . This barracl s converted into a hospital is full of babies , the youngest being only six days old when I was there . Many of the children have no parents . Others have lost their mothers ; their fathers are serving in the trenches . It is not always easy to find out how they came to be orphans ; there are such plentiful chances of losing parents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being asked where his mother was , replied gravely : " My mama , she is dead . Les Boches , they put a gun to ' er head . She is finished . I ' ave no mama . " The unchildlike stoicism of these children is appalling . I spent two days among them and heard no crying . Those who are sick lie motionless as waxen images in their cots . Those who are supposedly well sit all day brooding and saying nothing . When first they arrive , their faces are earth-colored . The first thing they have to be taught is how to be children . They have to be coaxed and induced to play ; even then they soon grow weary . They seem to regard mere playing as frivolous and indecorous ; and so it is in the light of the tragedies they have witnessed . Children of seven have seen more of horror in three years than most old men have read about in a lifetime . Many of them have been captured by and recaptured from the Huns . They have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the women were spared . They have been present while indecencies were worked upon their mothers . They have seen men hanged , shot , bayoneted , and flung to roast in burning houses . The pictures of all these things hang in their eyes . When they play , it is out of politeness to the kind Americans , not because they derive any plea- ' sure from it . Night is the troublesome time . The children hide under their beds with terror . The nurses have to go the rounds continually . If the children would only cry , they would give warning . But instead they creep silently out from between the sheets and crouch against the floor like dumb animals ! That is what they are when first they are brought in . Their most primitive instincts for the beginnings of cleanliness seem to have vanished . They have been fished out of caves , ruined dugouts , broken houses . They are as full of skin diseases as the beggar who sat outside Dives ' gate , only they have had no dogs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long that they have the faces of the extremely aged . And their hatred ! Directly you utter the word " Boche , " all the little night - gowned figures sit up in their cots and curse . When they have done cursing , of their own accord they sing the " Marseillaise . " SURELY if God listens to prayers of vengeance , He will answer the petitions of these victims of Hun cruelty ! The quiet , just , deep-seated venom of these babies will work the Hun more harm than many batteries . Their fathers come back from the trenches to see them . On leaving , they turn to the American nurses . " We shall fight better now , " they say , " because we know that you are taking care of them . " When those words are spoken , the American Red Cross knows that it is achieving its object and is winning its war of compassion . The whole drive of all its effort is to win the war in the shortest possible space of time . It is in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in broken lives , to mitigate the toll of unavoidable suffering , but first and foremost to help men to fight better .  |
