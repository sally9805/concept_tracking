I CAN only hope , in this paper , to sketch certain lines of thought which soon lose themselves in the mists of the future . Religion and government have come hand in hand down the ages , government expressed by monarchy , religion by hierarchy . Is not the transformation of government by what may be called the Protestant principle , that placing of authority in the individual soul , ? where it seems that Christ would have it , ? the death-sentence of hierarchy ? And , on the other hand , is not this leaven , fatal at once to hierarchy and monarchy , changing our whole conception of government ? The sense of responsibility for our fellow men is gradually creeping into government . What will be the Church of the future ? Who can say ? That process which at a casual glance appears to be disintegration is perceived , on closer inspection , to be a precipitation of the foreign elements hitherto mixed with Christianity , an absorption of the Spirit of Christ into the very life of the nation itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every side , and which is apparently triumphant and ascendant , there are not many thoughtful readers of the Atlantic , I venture to say , who have not felt on occasions certain throbbing , spiritual currents . Perhaps these readers have asked themselves the questions , as I have : ' What are they ? Whence are they ? ' Although signs and portents are not 12lacking elsewhere in this pregnant twentieth century , let us confine ourselves to America , where we have seen a great wave , like an electrical storm , sweep over our country from the Atlantic to the Pacific . People called it political . Was it political ? Many men I know were gripped by it , heated into something like incandescence . We neglected our professions , we went around the state in which we live and into other states , making speeches with other men impelled by the same motive , and we kept on in spite of wholesale criticism and denunciation . When some of us stopped to think , we were puzzled , for we had never gone so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling merely patriotism , merely the natural indignation of American citizens who have discovered that organizations of men have seized control of their institutions for private gain ? Or was it something more ? We were , at least , taking an ethical view of politics ; and it was this attitude , I found , that was most resented by our opponents . They flatly declared that the introduction of morals into politics was mischievous : that the Republican party represented one economic theory of conducting the government , and the Democratic party another . That was all there was to it . But , if this were so , what of the dreamers and idealists who wrote and signed that immortal document in the history of government , the Declaration of Independence ? What of that same // Republican party , now insisting on economics , which had fought and won the greatest moral issue of the nineteenth century ? It seems to me that all our questions point the same way . People are paying no attention to these utterances of the politicians . They are saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Republican . ' And what is a good man but a Christian ? What is the good man they desire but one who does not apply the individualistic theory of the survival of the fittest to society ? In short , we began to see more and more clearly that God is in politics . That he always has been , and always will be . That in some greater and higher sense than we had yet perceived , the saying , vox populi vox dei , is eternally true . He enters into the hearts of the people and moves them , and so the world progresses . God is in politics , to the confusion of politicians . And when these mysterious , quickening currents are abroad , we must believe that mankind is ready for another step forward . Can any person , I wonder , who has seen and perhaps addressed the great political audiences of the past few years fail to be led into reflections more or less profound ? I have known old men and young men , and women with children in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot night listening to ? what ? Fireworks and rhetoric , claptrap ? Not at all . Sober discussions of political problems ? yet problems that involve a greater content still . Who has looked into the upturned faces of these people and not beheld there an intense , unsatisfied yearning ? Politics alone do not fill them , nor ethics alone . The truth is that we are at the dawning of an age , spiritual like all the great ages which have preceded it . Let any one of us look around him , and talk to his neighbors , humble or prosperous , and see if he does not find a spiritual craving . Last year I said to a prominent publisher , ' Send me your recent books on religion . ' His answer was that they would fill my library . A medical specialist recently gave it as his opinion , that most of the so-called nervous prostration of to-day is due to a lack of religious belief . Several men I know , who represent widely divergent elements in American life , are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss a subject which they had thought to have settled forever . That subject is religion . The history of most of these men is a familiar one . They were brought up in orthodox Christian homes , but when they went to school and college , what they were taught of history , of science , the conception they were given of the universe , differed so sharply from their religious instruction that they went through the process of reading the agnostic books of twenty years ago , and lost their faith . They weighed what they believed to be Christianity in the balance , and found it wanting . I repeat , ? what they believed to be Christianity . The thought-currents are playing upon them . To one or two , poignant sorrows have come ; to others , lack of worldly success ; and to others still , a vague sense of the emptiness of a life that does not include service , ? and a desire for service and for the faith which is its driving force . And the majority of them , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years some of the glaring inequalities and injustices of our modern civilization sharply called to their attention , and have been moved to a certain pity , indignation , and shame . Ask the average men who are not connected with any church ? ask even some who are so connected ? what their 14 MODERN GOVERNMENT AND CHRISTIANITY conception of the Christian religion is . The answers will be interesting and varied . Think of the people we all may count among our acquaintances , who are studying Buddhism and Sufism and Babism ! All of this means something ; it is surely a sign of the age . It indicates a want which even scientists now tell us exists in the human heart ? the necessity of religion . Why is it that Christianity as presented to these people has not satisfied them as it satisfied their fathers ? The answer to that question , I firmly believe , lies in the fact that the evolution begun four hundred years ago is not yet completed ; that we are still in a state of transition . And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the sixteenth century , to the time of Martin Luther himself . Luther began it . Luther lighted a fire which was to burn through the centuries , despite the efforts of men to quench it ; which was and is to endure until all the misconception and superstition are consumed ; until the deathless Spirit , the true idea of God as Christ preached it , alone remains . The true idea of God , and the true idea of government . For they are intimately related . Church and State , and State and Church . It can not be said that Luther 's was merely a revolt against abuses . It was infinitely more than that , and we are just beginning to realize to-day something of the extent of it . Martin Luther liberated the idea which is embodied in the Declaration of Independence . Before I come to dwell on this , I would point out that modern learning and modern science had their birth , too , in Luther 's time , and the overwhelming knowledge that is ours is the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulation of knowledge , the momentum it has acquired , make it very difficult to keep pace with the bewildering devel opments going on around us . The gap between succeeding generations is widening by leaps and bounds , and what appeared logical to our fathers and mothers in the last quarter of the nineteenth century is no longer logical to us in the first quarter of the twentieth . This process has been going on for four hundred years , until now , by some incalculable mathematical progression , it has attained a speed that leaves us breathless . Each generation seeks and demands harmony in the relations of life , harmony between religion , science , history and government . It is becoming increasingly apparent , for example , in spite of any seeming indications to the contrary , that a civilization can not hold at the same time a pre-reformation idea of the Church and a post-reformation idea of government . Now the question is continually asked by sincere men and women today who feel in their lives the need of which I have spoken , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern thought that I may accept and embrace it ? ' Nor must we contend that these people are averse from faith . Is there such a thing as a reasonable faith ? Put the matter in another way : is not our religion , as Christ really taught and lived it , independent of all changes in scientific conceptions ? If we have eyes to see , and ears to hear , there is no lack of portents that the fermentation ? if it may be called so ? begun in the time of Luther is growing toward culmination , that we stand on the threshold of a greater religious era than the world has ever seen . And by some mysterious , guiding thought , the men who are led into politics , into literature , into sociology and science , ? science , whereby suffering and disease are relieved and lessened and life is made in a thousand ways more useful , ? all these men ? deleted material 16 MODERN GOVERNMENT AND CHRISTIANITY Roman Empire : we see it in Israel . And just as we turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we turn to Israel for religion . What was the Jew 's conception of God ? He was our God . We can recognize him in Isaiah , in the Psalms , in the Pentateuch . Yet he was , as they conceived him , something of an Oriental despot , ? but not wholly . He was more . He was the kind , just father of his chosen people , but outside of them , in a place above the roof of the sky which they called heaven . He was a God who ruled by laws which he had sent down from heaven and given to Moses ; he was God who demanded sacrifice . Then Jesus came with a new and bewildering idea of him , so transcendent that many , many generations were to elapse before the world could begin to grasp something of the full meaning of it . God is a father ; not the father of a nation , but the father of every man and woman who walks the earth , of the publican , of the sinner and the outcast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to recognize the spirit of God-hood in each , no matter into what state of bestiality he has deteriorated ; man may become , by recognizing God in his true relationship , a responsible , autonomous being . ' I will arise and go to my Father . ' How ? Manfully , not ingratiatingly : not with presents to propitiate him , but with the offer of service ? the only acceptable thing . Whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant . ' And is there , in all the gospel , any emblematic act more sublime than that final attempt , at the last sorrowful supper , of Our Lord to impress upon his disciples the meaning of his mission ? We can hear the amazed cry of Peter , ' Lord , dust thou wash my feet ? ' and Jesus saying to him , What I do thou knowest not now , ? but thou shalt know hereafter . ' He , the Messiah , washing their feet ! Incomprehensible ! What was the idea of God conveyed in this act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brought into the world the germ , the seed , the idea that was to change all governments . He came to show an ignorant , groping humanity what God was . Behold the bewildered Pilate , who could not rid his mind of the obsession of monarchy , demanding , Art thou a king then ? ' And Jesus answering wearily , To this end was I born , and for this came I into the world , that I should bear witness of the truth . ' Read the life of Jesus of Nazareth , which the Roman historian dismisses so contemptuously in a few words ; consider its simple but sublime teaching , put forth amid such trials and sorrows ; think of the darkness and desolation of that Good Friday , when even the disciples had fled in terror , and then of the joy of these same disciples at the Resurrection ? defeat turned into victory . Can it be possible that Peter , who had followed the footsteps of one who had deliberately made himself lowly among men , Peter , whose feet Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teachings that he went to Rome and became a high priest himself , and founded the greatest hierarchy the world has ever known ? The Acts and Epistles have enabled us more or less vividly to picture those early churches in Asia Minor , in Greece , yes , and in Rome itself . ' And he gave some to be apostles , and some prophets , and some evangelists , and some pastors and teachers . ' There , in all its social simplicity , is the organization of Christ 's church ? each worker according to his talent . We may well believe that the blessing of God has descended from one head to another , from one spirit to another , thus going back to the Divine Source of all ? our Lord himself . // It is interesting to consider the form of government taken by those early churches which were nearest to the life and teachings of the Lord . He did not prescribe their form ; he prescribed no form ; it was taken naturally , as the result of his teachings . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been called by some modern writers democracies . We shall not quarrel about the name . We are more concerned with the spirit with which each Christian citizen was imbued ? the spirit of Christ himself , helpfulness toward his neighbor , love of his neighbor . That gave the life to the community , and made its simple form possible . Gradually , as we read history , we see a change coming over the form of government of the Church , a reactionary change . Rome being the centre and metropolis of the empire , as Christianity spread , the church in Rome as a matter of course took precedence . The empire was wide , communication was slow . Heresies , like Gnosticism , arose , and if the body of Christians were to be held together , if the Church were to remain united , a certain uniformity of belief was imperative . Then came the fall of the Roman Empire , and the rise of the Church from its ashes ; the Church transformed , no longer a collection of simple communities , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise undisputed sway over kings and nations , over mind and soul for a thousand years . What had been a social democracy had become a monarchy , with high priests and princes of its own . A monarchical God , a monarchical government , a monarchical church . We see the Church stoutly upholding a theory called the divine right of kings  --  God in the vice-riddled rulers of France , God in Charles Stuart . VOL. 109-N0.1 The marvelous thing to contemplate is that , throughout the transformation , she consorted with kings , she upheld monarchy , but the poor and humble she never forgot . Even after the Reformation , monarchy , for the majority of our race , remained the logical form of government . Read John Bunyan , in spite of the allegory . But with religious enlightenment , which was the result of the translation of the Bible , and especially of the Gospels and the Epistles of Paul , came slowly and imperceptibly ? so slowly and imperceptibly that men themselves did not perceive whither they were going ? another idea of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilgrims across the deep ? What faith inspired them , what force sustained them on rigorous , inhospitable shores ? God was still a terrible God for them . And yet they , and others who came here , Anglicans and Quakers , Baptists and Methodists and Presbyterians , ? yes , and Roman Catholics , for Maryland sought for independence and Charles Carroll signed the Declaration , ? all grew gradually to perceive , although they may not have argued it out in this way , that God had not delegated their government to a man who sat on the other side of the water , and who called himself George the Third , King by the grace of God . ' No , God had brought them , in his own way , to the knowledge that his real dwelling-place was in the bosom of mankind . Government was there . What a casting off of false , what a taking on of true authority was that same Declaration of Independence ! By what authority ? The baptism of John , was it of the Jewish hierarchy , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it of God ? or of the royal line of England ? I can not refrain , here , from saying a word in connection with that other 18 MODERN GOVERNMENT AND CHRISTIANITY country with which we are united by ties of kindred and affection . Their struggle for liberty and truth has been parallel with our own . Nay , it is our own , for ours began in England . As the meaning of history , of God 's hand in history , becomes plain to us , a fact of remarkable significance stands out . We see that our Declaration of Independence had a vital religious significance : it was the first application of what may be called the Protestant principle to what was to become government on a large scale . We , representing a race in the van of civilization , had left one idea of government and religion behind us forever , and were slowly and painfully advancing toward another . Who will read the story of the revolt in Luther 's day and say it was not political , as well as religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Republic proclaimed to the world that transfer of authority to which the Reformation logically pointed ? this is what I should like to make clear . Universal suffrage , which by many was thought madness , was in reality but the Christian principle directly applied , the recognition of the intrinsic worth of the individual , the ignoring of property as a qualification , the expression not only of an ideal , but of a firm conviction that God resided in the soul of man , that the individual conscience was therefore the only authority for an enlightened people . And the confidence that this would work out was a superb and supreme faith in the teaching and life of Christ , a faith in the humanity which he loved . It had a far-reaching religious significance , and exerted an influence on thought and government all over the world . How keenly , how jealously , was this experiment watched by the believers in , and champions of , that other hierarchical and monarchical authority ! Christ condemned , I firmly believe from reading the Gospels , that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest to him in time , rejected it . The world and his Church went back to it and held it for fifteen hundred years , when the light dawned again , ? the light of his true meaning , ? and grows brighter and brighter as the false conceptions are slowly burned away . And the government founded one hundred and thirty-five years ago , in this new world ( let us dare to say it ) , was a nearer approach than any that had gone before to those first communities which took their form directly and naturally from what he taught . But those communities were churches , you say , not governments . Does not this sentence suggest thought ? a thought , perhaps , that we can scarcely put into words , a sublimer conception of a future union between Church and State than any that has yet entered our minds ? ' The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven . ' How indeed could the evolution , the development going on around us be more aptly expressed ! The way in which God works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideal ! Only the man who has read Americans superficially would say we are not idealists . Our very Declaration of Independence , so scoffed at in Europe , itself proves it . And it is that idealism more than any other element which has drawn millions of emigrants to our shores , which will save us in the end . What then is the Christian ideal of government ? We must not let the brightness of the vision dazzle us , we must not let it frighten us ? we must keep our eyes steadily turned toward it . The Christian ideal is the least possible government , a government wherein neither you nor I nor any other man or woman will labor and obey because we have to , but because we have learned // the lesson which Christ taught , that happiness lies alone in service , in giving to the world that which God gave us . To hold up that vision , the vision of what we may be if we try , the vision of what God wishes and expects us to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us will refuse to believe that Abraham Lincoln , like Stephen , saw his Master in the sky ? We are beginning to understand , at the dawning of the twentieth century , that there is still a higher , more Christian conception of government to come , and that our Declaration was but a step toward it . No superficial glance at the civilization of the Protestant nations might lead us to think so . Ah , we have paid a price , a terrible price , for freedom , for the liberation of the individual subject . Until individual responsibility begins to be felt , excesses are the inevitable result of liberty . And so we behold hypocrisy , selfishness , ruthless competition ? as terrible contrasts between luxury and misery as in Mark Antony 's day . Should we , for that reason , go back to leading strings ? Can we if we would ? A little thought should convince us , in the words of an able modern writer on philosophy , that the liberation of the individual can not be revoked , that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry conviction . We can not go back to the Middle Ages ; to do so would be to deteriorate and degenerate . We must go on . We have definitely transferred our authority to the conscience of man , and there it must remain for better or worse . We must and do believe that God dwells there . Nay , that God is that conscience , for God is a Spirit . Let us look again at this civilization by which we are surrounded , and try if we can not see , in increasing numbers , new men emerging , imbued with a new idea of God , new men and women the keynote of whose characters is individual responsibility . Such men and women are the ideal units of the government to come . Yes , somehow , in some way we do not quite grasp , the conviction is being brought home to us that our own incarnation means something : we feel faint stirrings that grow stronger , cosmic memories of forgotten injunctions and resolutions . God is a Spirit ; and man , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear-er . We are beginning to perceive that charity does not consist in dispensing largesse after making a fortune at the expense of one 's fellow men : that there is something still wrong in a government that permits it . It is gradually becoming plain to us , after two thousand years , that human bodies and souls rotting in tenements are more valuable than all the forests on all the hills ; that government , Christian government , has something to do with these . We shall embody , in government , those sublime words of the Master , Suffer little children to come unto me . ' And the government of the future will care for its little children . We are beginning to do it . Here , as everywhere , Christianity and reason go hand in hand , for the child becomes the man who either preys on humanity and fills the prisons and robs his fellows , or else grows into a useful healthy citizen . It is nothing less than sheer folly as well as inhuman cruelty to let the children sleep in crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild throughout the long summer , learning vice in the city streets . And we still have slavery ? economic slavery ? but as much a problem of government and a Christian concern as that which confronted us in 1861 . The Christian man or woman who has worked in politics or sociology 20 MODERN GOVERNMENT AND CHRISTIANITY does not need to read the publication of commissions in Pittsburg or Chicago , or the revelation of a fire in a shirt-waist factory in New York , to realize this . Who freed the Negro slaves ? The Negroes ? Or rather , what freed them ? The Spirit of Christ freed them , the Spirit of Christ in the soul of Wilberforce , of Mrs. Stowe , of Lincoln , in millions of people who had nothing but sorrow and suffering to gain by the struggle . Is not this a wonderful thing , and does it not contradict and confound the wise , the cynical , the materialist ? The Negroes , they said , ? and say still , ? were not ready for freedom , emancipation . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only thing that develops us in this world , until it is thrust upon him ? And then , somehow , he works it out . There is another side to Christianity , a no less vital and important side for us moderns , which I must touch upon before I close . I have laid stress upon the simplicity of government of those early Christian communities . One reason that has been assigned by many writers to account for the willing adoption of the brotherhood of man was the belief in the imminent coming of the Messiah . I am convinced that this reason , although often used to support another argument , is a true one . What our age needs , and what it has lacked , is the conviction of immortality . Here we come again , I think , upon another element in the same problem I referred to before ? the necessity of instilling faith into children in a way that can not be shaken by any apparent contradictions in the knowledge they acquire in after life . The idea of immortality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner that they could understand and grasp and believe it . And out of that belief they acted . Let me be personal for an instant , for I have gone through a process characteristic of thousands of men and women of to-day . I arrived at a conviction of immortality , ? a Christian conviction , I believe , ? but I had first to rid my mind of the imagery of the eschatology presented to me as a child ; and , what is quite as important , of the obsession that my Christianity depended on it . That eschatology given me in childhood was precisely the one preached to the Jewish peasant , the Greek , the Roman slave and freedman of the first century . Whenever I thought of it , I looked forward with terror to the last day , and the lurid light of the judgment scene was vividly pictured in my mind , the dead starting from their graves , the wicked on one side , the blest on the other . As I grew older , the change that occurred in me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the years passed , and the Messiah did not come . So my own belief in the imminence of the Judgment Day gradually faded , and there was no other presentation put forward to take its place . I was not a Jewish Christian of the first century , but an American of the nineteenth . I had not in my blood , or instilled into me from my earliest recollections , the messianic idea , preached by the prophets of my nation for more than a thousand years . And in this messianic idea , by the way , were both patriotism and religion . Think of how the pious Jew must have dwelt upon the conception ! Israel , in spite of the miseries of the past , in spite of oppression , defeats , captivity , persecution , would one day , through her God , come to her own ; would rise triumphant and dominant over other peoples by means of her Messiah , who was to judge her , purge and emancipate her . And this Messiah must be a King himself , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the power of that idea Upon one to whom , by race and environment , it might appeal ! Nor was I a Gentile , slave or freedman of the great Roman Empire , who might take fire from contact with a personality like Paul 's or those of the early apostles , when told that this wonderful idea had been broadened so as to include me . The Messiah had indeed come , but not in the manner that men had looked for him . Therefore he must come again , and in that manner . The effect of that conception on the Christian , Jew , or Gentile of the age was , for reasons which we now clearly perceive , tremendous . While I am on the subject I might go further and say that , as a younger man , Oriental imagery had no attractions for me . I neither understood it , nor sympathized with it temperamentally . The Christian faith was presented to me largely in terms of the Oriental imagination . Not being an Oriental Jew , I had no interest in Jerusalem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new Jerusalem , which must have struck the ancient Oriental mind with force , did not appeal to me as a modern American . What was the effect ? A long period of indifference , until these mysterious thought-currents of which I have spoken began to act upon me , as they are acting upon other men , thought-currents which lead one to believe that this age is comparable to other quickening epochs in history : to the time when the German monk arose to discover that he was thinking what Germany was thinking , and England was thinking . I began to read . I tried to put myself in the place of the ancient Jew , of the Roman slave and freedman ; and then , and not until then , did I see something of the revelation the words and life and resurrection of Christ must have been for such a man . I saw that the Christian religion was far different from what I had supposed . I freed it from the hard shell of its ancient terminology , and made it live for me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being presented , in the language of our time , to the ironworker of Pittsburg as well as to the fisherman of Galilee . I saw what I had not seen before , that it was not necessary to treat the modern ironworker , any more than the ancient fisherman , as a superstitious being who must approach his God through rites , observances , intermediaries , and sacrifices . Truths are eternal , ? the expressions of them may change from age to age . If my own circle of acquaintances presents any indication of the times , I should say that thousands and thousands of men and women to-day who had lost their belief in immortality are regaining it , and some who never had it are acquiring it . As the meaning of life becomes clearer , as the habit of right thinking more general , men are beginning to conceive of immortality itself in terms of service . All is service , here and hereafter . All is development . It is a dazzling , an awful idea , until we begin to get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The peace of God passes understanding , because it is not static . And once having found the secret , who would lose it ? Thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many . ' Good and faithful servant ! There , theq , is our doctrine of immortality , hidden in the parable of the talents . Service , development ! That is the secret . And , if reward be service , higher service , who would not labor for it ? Immortality was not only a conviction of Jesus Christ , but the more one reflects upon his life , the more immortality would seem to be the supreme conclusion to be drawn from it . He taught us the meaning of this life , pointed clearly to a future of further service . And is the developed soul , gained at such cost here , to be wasted in the universe ? Christ lives . Not only , as some would say , in the influence of his life and teachings upon men , but in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccountable otherwise , and stops dismayed at that terrible cry on the cross , ' My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? ' Ah , do not insist upon the exact manner of that resurrection ! Let men believe it as they will , for to believe it is to act upon it , and to act upon it is to bring upon earth the reign of that Kingdom which is God 's own government for mankind , in all its fellowship and simplicity . Lines which we once thought diverging , and then parallel , are now seen to be drawing together to a focus of dazzling brilliancy . There are signs all about us that science and history , government and the church , ? the fellowship of Christians upon earth , ? are drawing nearer and nearer together and to Christ . Psychology is doing an inestimable service for religion in tending to bring it into harmony with modern life and conceptions . Let us believe firmly that a time is coming , nay , is now at hand , when the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when the condition of the Middle Ages shall be restored in a higher , nobler , truer form ; when the religion of the risen Christ , freed from idolatry and superstition , shall find its true abiding-place in the heart of man , reign there in its supreme Authority , and permeate all the departments of life . God is no longer King only of the tribes of Israel , or ruler of a flat terrestrial expanse . God is a Spirit . He is the spirit of a million spheres , the spirit of mankind and of the Universe . ' But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth . '
