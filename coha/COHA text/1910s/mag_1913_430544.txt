IT can hardly be doubted that could Lord Palmerston have seen what I have seen of the changes in Germany , he would at least have placed the " damned " in another part of his famous sentence . These professors have turned their prowess into channels which have given Germany , in this scientific industrial age , a mighty grip upon something more than theories . It may be dull reading to tell the tale of damned professordom , but it is to Germany that we must all go to school in these matters . The American chooses his university or college because it is in the neighborhood ; because his father or other relatives went there ; because his school friends are going there ; on account of the prestige of the place ; sometimes , too , because one is considered more democratic than another ; sometimes , and perhaps more often than we think , on account of the athletics ; because it is large or small ; or on account of the cost . The German youth , owing to widely different customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he be of the well-to-do classes , and his father before him was a corps student , he is likely to go first to the university where his father 's corps will receive him and discipline him in the ways of a corps student 's life , and rigorous ways they are , as we shall see . Young men of small means , and who can afford to waste little time in the amusements of university life , go at once where the more celebrated professors in their particular line of work are lecturing . Few students in Germany reside during their whole course of study at one university . The student year is divided into two so-called semesters . The student remains , say , in Heidelberg two years or perhaps less , and then moves on , let us say , to Berlin , or Gottingen , or Leipsic , or Kiel , to hear lectures by other professors , and to get and to see something of the best work in law , theology , medicine , history , or belles-lettres , along the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in praise of this system . Many a medical , or law , or theological , or philosophical student , or one who is going in for a scientific course in engineering or mining , would profit enormously could he go from Harvard to Yale , or to Johns Hopkins , or to Princeton , or to Columbia , and attend the lectures of the best men at these and other universities . Many a man would have gone eagerly to Harvard to hear James in philosophy , Peirce in mathematics , Abbot in exegesis , or to read Greek with Palmer ; or to Yale to have heard Whitney in philology in my day ; or now , to name but a few , Van Dyke at Princeton , Sloane at Columbia , Wheeler at the University of California , Paul Shorey at Chicago , and many others , are men whom not to know and to hear in one 's student days is a loss . The German student is at a distinct advantage in this privilege of hearing the best men at whatever university they may be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities rises and falls in a large measure according to the fame and ability of the professors who may be lecturing there . One can readily imagine how such men as Hegel , or Ranke , @#  | or Mommsen , who lectured at Berlin ; or Liebig or Dellinger , at Munich ; or Ewald , at Gottingen ; or Sybel , at Bonn ; or Leibnitz or Schlegel , in their day , or Kuno Fischer , in my day , at Heidelberg , must have drawn students from all parts of Germany ; just as do Harnack , and Schmidt , and Lamprecht , and Adolph Wagner , Schmoller , or Gierke , or Schiemann , or Wadi , Haeckel , List , Deitsch , Hering , or Verworm , in these days . Though the German professors are somewhat hampered by the fact that they are servants of the state , and their opinions therefore on theological , political , and economic matters restricted to the state 's views , they are free as no other teachers in the world to exploit their intellectual prowess for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose lectures he attends , and as a result there are certain professors in Germany whose incomes are as high as $30,000 a year . Even in intellectual matters state control produces the inevitable state laziness and indifference . One could tell many a tale of these professors who arrive late at their lecture-rooms , who read slowly , who give just as little matter as they can in order to make their preferred work go as far as possible . Some of them , too , read the same lectures over and over again , year after year , quite content that they have made a reputation , gained a fixed tenure of their positions , and are sure of a pension . There are twenty-one universities in Germany , with another already provided for this year in Frankfort , and practically the equivalent of a university in Hamburg . The total number of students is 66,358 , an increase since 1895 of 37,791 . Geographically , speaking , one has the choice between Kiel , Konigsberg , and Berlin in the north , Munich in the south , Strassburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the present writing Berlin has 9,686 students , and some 5,000 more authorized to attend lectures , over half of them grouped under the general heading " Philosophy " ; next comes Munich with 7,000 , nearly 5,000 of them grouped under the headings " Jurisprudence " and " Philosophy " ; then Leipsic with 5.000 ; then Bonn with 4,000 ; and last in point of numbers Rostock with Boo students . There are now some 1,500 women students at the the Germans 47 German universities , but a total of 4,500 who attend lectures , and Doctor Marie Linden at the beginning of 1911 was appointed one of the professors of the medical faculty at Bonn , but the appointment was vetoed by the Prussian ministry . In addition to the universities is the modern development of the technical highschools , of which there are now eleven , one each in Berlin , Dresden , Braunschweig , Darmstadt , Hanover , Karlsruhe , Munich , Stuttgart , Danzig , Aix , and Breslau . These schools have faculties of architecture , building construction , mechanical engineering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . They confer the degree of Doctor of Engineering , and admit those students holding the certificate of the Gymnasium , Realgymnasium , and Oberrealschule . They rank now with the universities , and their 17,000 students may fairly be added to the grand total number of German students , making 83,000 in all , and if to this be added the 4,000 unmatriculated students , we have 87,000 . While the population of Germany has increased 1.4 per cent in the last year , the number of students has increased 4.6 per cent , and of the total number 4.4 Per cent are women . Since the founding of the empire the population has increased from 40,000,000 to 65,000,000 , but the number of students has increased from 18,000 to 60,000 . The teaching staffs in the universities number 3,400 , and in the technical high-schools 753 , or , roughly , there are , in the highereducation department of Germany , at the least nearly 90,000 persons engaged , as these figures do not include officials and many unattached teachers and students indirectly connected with the universities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technical schools such as veterinary highschools , schools of mining , forestry , architecture and building , commercial schools , schools of art and industry ; a naval school at Kiel , military academies at Berlin and Munich , besides some 5o schools of navigation , and 20 military and cadet institutions . There are also courses of lectures given under the auspices of the German foreign office to instruct candidates for the consular service in the commercial and industrial affairs of Germany .  | At several of the universities now evening extension lectures are given , an innovation first tried at Leipsic , where more than seven thousand persons paid small fees to attend the lectures in a recent year . If one considers the range of instruction from the Volkschulen and Fortbildungsschulen up through the skeleton list I have mentioned to the universities , and then on beyond that to the thousands still engaged as students in the commerce and industry of Germany , as for example the technically employed men in the Krupp Works at Essen , or the Color Works at Elberfeld , to mention two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with a veritable fine-tooth comb of education . There is not only nothing like it , there is nothing comparable to it in the world . If training the minds of a population were the solution of the problems of civilization , they are on the way to such solution in Germany . Unfortunately there is no such easy way out of our troubles for Germany or for any other nation . Some of us will live to see this fetich of regimental instruction of everybody disappear as astrology has disappeared . There is a Japanese proverb which runs , " The bottom of lighthouses is very dark . " As early as r 717 Frederick William I in an edict commanded parents to send their children to school , daily in summer , twice a week in winter . Frederick the Great at the close of the Seven Years ' W'ar , 1 j 64 , insisted again upon compulsory school attendance , and prescribed books , studies , and discipline . At the beginning of the nineteenth century began a great change in the primary schools due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to the efforts of Herder , Frederic August Wolf , William Humboldt , and Sunern . The schools then were part of the ecclesiastical organization and have never ceased to be so wholly , and until recently the title of the Prussian minister has been : " Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs , Instruction , and Medical Affairs . " That part of the minister 's title , " Medical Affairs , " has within the last few months been eliminated . The French Revolution , and the dismemberment of Prussia at Tilsit , put a stop to orderly progress . Stein and his colleagues , however , started anew ; students were sent to Switzerland to study pedagogical methods ; provincial schoolboards were established , and about 185o all public-school teachers were declared to be civil servants ; and later , in 1872 , during Bismarck 's campaign against the Jesuits , all private schools were made subject to state inspection . In Prussia to-day no man or woman may give instruction even as governess or private tutor without the certificate of the state . This control of education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Prussia , at any rate , the officials are hard-working , conscientious , and enthusiastic , and the system , whether one gives one 's full allegiance to it or not , is admirably worked out . Above all , it completely does away with sham physicians , sham doctors of divinity , sham engineers and mining and chemical experts , sham dentists and veterinary surgeons , who abound in our country , where shoddy schools do a business of selling degrees and certificates of proficiency in everything from exegesis to obstetrics . These fakir academies are not only a disgrace but a danger in America , and here as in other matters Germany has a right to smile grimly . at certain of our hobbledehoy methods of government . The elementary schools , or Volkschulen , are free , and attendance is compulsory from six to fourteen ; in addition , the Fortbildungsschulen , or continuation schools , can also be made compulsory up to eighteen years of age . There are some 61,000 free public elementary schools with over 10,000,000 pupils , and over 600 private elementary schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Department of Trade and Industry towns with more than twenty thousand inhabitants are empowered to make their own rules compelling commercial employees under eighteen to attend the continuation schools a certain number of hours monthly , and fining employers who interfere with such attendance . It has even been suggested that this law be extended to include girls . In Berlin this has already been put into operation , and this year some 30,000 girls will be compelled to attend continuation @#  | schools , where they will be taught cooking , dress-making , laundry work , house-keeping economy , and for those who wish it , office work . It will require some training even to pronounce the name of this new institution , which requires something more than the number of letters in the alphabet to spell it , for it has this terrifying title : **32;417;TOOLONG . The work in these **26;451;TOOLONG , or compulsory continuation schools , is practical and thorough . The boys are from fourteen to eighteen years of age , and are obliged to attend three hours twice a week . Shopkeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law are obliged by threat of heavy fines to send them . The boys pay nothing . There are some thirty-four thousand of such pupils under one jurisdiction in Berlin , and the cost to the city is three hundred thousand dollars annually . The curriculum includes letter-writing , book-keeping , exchange , bank-credits , checks and bills , the duty of the business man to his home , to the city , and to his fellow business men , his legal rights and duties , and , in great detail , all questions of citizenship . Methods of the banks , stock exchange , and insurance companies are explained . The business man 's relations in detail to the post-office , the railways , the customs , canals , shipping agencies are dealt with . The investigation of credits and the general management from cellar to attic of what we call a " store " are taught , and lectures are given upon business ethics and family relations and morals . In towns where factories are more common than shops there are schools similar in kind , as at Dortmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cellar , and go up through the work of carpenter , mason , plumber , signpainter , poster-designer , to the designing of stained-glass windows and the modelling of animals and men . In the strictly agricultural districts of Prussia the extent of courses open to those who work upon the land has steadily increased . In 1882 there were 559 courses d instruction and 9,228 pupils ; in 1902 , 1,421 such courses and 20,666 pupils ; and in 1908 , 3,781 courses and 55,889 pupils . About five per cent of the cost d such instruction , which cost the state 566,599 marks in 1968 , is paid by the fees of the pupils themselves . To those interested in ways and means it may serve a purpose to say that the total cost of these elementary schools amounts to nearly St 31,000,000 a year , of which the various state governments pay $37,500 , - 000 and local authorities the rest . In 1910 the city of Berlin spent 59,881,987 on its schools . The average cost per pupil is 513.56 . In some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of pupils per loo inhabitants stands as follows : Berlin , 11.1 ; Essen , 16.5 ; Dortmund , 16 : Dusseldorf , 13.2 ; Charlottenburg , 9 ; Duisburg , 16.7 ; Oberhausen , 17.7 ; Bielefeld , 14.7 ; Bonn , 11.1 ; Cologne , 13.1 . There are 170,000 teachers in these elementary schools , of whom 30,000 are women . They begin with 8250 a year , which is raised to 8306 when they are given a fixed position . By a graduated scale of increase a teacher at the age of forty-eight ( when he may retire ) may receive a maximum of $725 . A woman teacher 's salary would vary from $300 to $600 as the maximum . These figures are for Prussia . In other states of the Empire , in Bavaria and Saxony for example , the scale of wages is somewhat higher . The secondary schools are the wellknown Gymnasien and Progymnasien , the Realgymnasien , and the Realschulen . Roughly the Gymnasia prepare for the universities , and the Realschulen for the technical schools . Admission to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service demands a certificate from one or another of these secondary schools . In 1890 , two years after the present Emperor came to the throne , he called together a conference of teachers and in an able speech suggested that these secondary schools devote more time and attention to technical training . As a result of this , the certificates of the Realgymnasien and Realschulen are now received as equivalent to those conferred by the Gymnasien where Latin and Greek are as they were then still paramount . Of these secondary schools some are state schools ; others are municipal or trade-supported schools ; some are private institutions ; but all are amenable to the rules , organization , and curricula ap- proved by the state . All secondary and elementary teachers must meet the examinational requirements of the state , which fixes a minimum salary and contributes thereto . In the universities and technical high-schools all professors are appointed by the state , and largely paid by the state as well . In the year 1910 the German Empire expended under the general heading of instruction $101,188 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( though nearly $7 J0 , - 0oo of this total went for building and repairs for both churches and schools ) ; Baden , $4,176,075 ; Saxony , $457,325 ; the free city of Hamburg , $5,561,900 . The total expenditures of the empire and of the states of the empire combined , in 1910 amounted to $2,225,225,000 ; of this , as we have seen , more than $101,000,000 went for instruction and allied uses ; $198,748 , - 775 was the cost of the army ; and $82,362 , - 65o the cost of the navy , not counting the extraordinary expenditures for these two arms of the service , which amounted to $5,624,775 for the army , and $28,183 , - 125 for the navy . The total expenditure of the Fatherland for schools , army , and navy amounted , therefore , to one-fifth of the total , or $416,108,225 . I have grouped these expenditures together for the reason that I am still one of those who remain distrustful and disdainful of the Carnegie holy water , and a firm believer that the two best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well conducted as here , are the army and the navy . Even if they were not schools of war , they would be an inestimable loss to the country were they no longer in existence as manhood-training schools . This is the more clear when it is remembered that , according to the army standard , both the German peasant and the urban dweller are steadily deteriorating . In ten years the percentage of physically efficient men in the rural districts decreased from 6o.5 to 58.2 per cent , and this decrease is even more marked in particular provinces . Infant mortality , despite better hygienic conditions and more education , has not decreased , and in some districts has increased ; while the birth-rate , especially in Prussia and Thuringia , has fallen off as well . For the whole of Germany , the births to every thousand of the inhabitants were : in 1876 , 42.63 ; in 1891 , 38.25 ; in 1905 , 34 , and in 1909 , 31.91 . In Berlin the births per thousand in 1907 were 24.63 and in 1911 only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who rambles about in the district of Leipsic , Chemnitz , Riesa , Oschatz , and even in the mountainous district of south-east Saxony , may see for himself a population lacking in size , viggr , and health , noticeably so indeed . Education at one end turning out an unwholesome , " white-collared , black-coated proletariat , " as the Socialists call them ; and industry and commerce , which even tempt the farmer to sell what he should keep to eat , at the other , are making serious inroads upon the health and well-being of the population . The chancellor , von Bethmann-Hollweg , speaking in the Reichstag February i i , 1911 , said : " The fear that we may not be working along the right lines in the education of our youth is a cause of great anxiety to many people in Germany . We shall not solve this problem by shunning it ! " Many social economists hold that higher education is unfitting numbers of young men from following the humbler pursuits , while at the same time it is not making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are recognized as the most potent chemical in making the milk of human kindness to turn sour . At a meeting of the Goethebund this year , advocating school reform , it was evident that many intelligent men in Germany were not satisfied with present methods of education , which were characterized as wasting energy in mechanical methods of teaching , and so robbing youth of its youth . It is beginning to be understood in Germany , as it has been understood by wise men in all ages , that " to spend too much time in studies is sloth ; to use them too much for ornament is affectation ; to make judgment wholly by their rules is the humour of the scholar . " This same commentary of Bacon should be on the walls of every school and university in Germany . In America , it is true , we have gone ahead along educational lines . In 1800 , it is said , the average adult American-.had 82 days of school attendance ; in 1900 , @#  | 146 days . In the last quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,400 to 12,000 ; and during the last 18 years the proportion of our youth receiving high-school instruction doubled , and attendance at American alleges has increased 400 per cent , while the population increased by loo per cent . But education is by no means so strenuous as in Germany . The hours are shorter , holidays longer , standards lower , and the emphasis far less insistent . A boy who has not the mental energy to pass the entrance culminations at Harvard for instance , and proceed to a degree there , ought to be drowned , or to drown himself . I would not say as much of the requirements in Germany , for they are far more severe . Prince von Hohenlohe in his memoirs gives an account of a conversation between the Emperor , the Emperor 's tutor , and himself . The Emperor was regretting the severitv of the examinations in the secondary schools . and it was replied to him that this was the only way to prevent a flood of candidates for the civil service ! There is another all-important factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed into the upper section of the class before the last , " Secunda , " as it is called , or have passed an equivalent examination , in order to serve one year instead of three in the army . To be an Einjahriger is , therefore , in a way the mark of an educated gentleman . The tales of suicide and despair of school-boys in Germany are , alas , too many of them true ; and it is to be remembered that not to reach a certain standard here means that a man 's way is barred from the army and navy , civil service , diplomatic or consular service , from social life , in short . The uneducated man of position in Germanv does not exist , can not exist . This is , therefore , no phantom , but a real terror . The man of twenty-five who has not won an education and a degree faces a blank wall barring his entrance anywhere ; and even when , weaponed with the necessary academic passport , he is permitted to enter , he meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated inefficients who must work for next to nothing , and who keep down the level of the earnings of the rest because there is an army of candidates for every vacant position . On the other hand , the industries of Germany have bounded ahead , because the army of chemists and physicists of patience , training , and ability who work for small salaries provide them with new and better weapons than their rivals . There are two sides to this question of fine-tooth-comb education . Its advantages both America and England are seeing every day in these stout rivals of ours ; but its disadvantages are not to be concealed , and are perhaps doing an undermining work that will be more apparent in the future than now it is . The very fact that an alien , an oriental race , the Jews , have taken so disproportionate a share of the cream of German prosperity , and have turned this technical prowess to purposes of tleir own , is , in and of itself , a sure sign that there may be an educated proletariat working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their mental discipline , they can not force to abdicate . Strange to say , the federal constitution of 1871 , which gave Germany its emperor , did not include the schools , and each state has its own school system , but in 1875 an imperial school commission was formed which has done much to make the system of all the states uniform . The three classes of schools recognized as leading later to a university career are the Gymnasium , in which Latin and Greek are still the fundamental requirements ; the Realgymnasium , in which Latin but no Greek is required ; the Oberrealschule , in which the classics are not taught at all , but emphasis is laid upon modern languages and natural science . In addition to these there are the so-called Reformschulen , of very recent growth , which are an attempt to put less emphasis upon the classics , but without excluding them entirely from the course , and to pay more attention proportionately to modern languages , French in particular . There are in addition some four hundred public and one thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance of a quarter of a million , all subject to state supervision . If one were to make a genealogical tree of the German schools which educate the children from the age of six up to the age of entrance to the university , it might be described as follows :  | First are the Volkschulen , which every child must attend from six to fourteen . In the smaller country schools the children of all ages may be in one school-room and under one teacher ; in another , divided into two classes ; in another , into three or four classes ; up to the large city schools , in which there are eight classes . Next would come the Mittelschulen , where the pupils are carried on a year farther , and where the last year corresponds to the first year of the so-called Lehrerbildungsanstalten , or training schools for teachers . These again are divided into two , one called Praeparanda , the other Seminar , the former carrying the pupil on to his sixteenth year , the latter to the nineteenth year and turning him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve only one year in the army . If boy or girl goes on from the fourteenth year , the hohere Knabenschulen and the hohere Madchenschulen take them on to the eighteenth or nineteenth year . Many boys go on till they have passed from the lower Secunda , next to the last class which is divided into upper and lower Secunda , into the upper Secunda , when their certificate entitles them to serve one year only in the army when they quit school . Many boys , too , intending to become officers , leave school at sixteen or seventeen and go to regular cramming institutions , where they do their work more quickly and devote themselves to the special subjects required . For boys intending to go on through the higher schools , there are schools taking them on from the age of nine , with a curriculum better adapted than that of the Volkschulen to that end . In all these higher schools there is less attention paid to mere examinations , and more attention paid to the general grip the pupils have on the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere , too much can not be said in its praise . For those boys who finish their public schooling at the age of fourteen and then turn to earning their living , there are the continuation schools , which are in many parts of the country compulsory , and . which are nicely adapted , according to their situation in shopkeeping cities , in factory towns , or in the country , to give the pupils the drilling and instruction necessary for their particular employment . According to the last census the proportion of illiterates among the recruits for the army was 0.02 per cent . The number of those who could neither read nor write in Germany was , in 1836 , 41.44 per cent ; in 1909 , 0.01 per cent . If one were to name all the agricultural schools ; technical schools ; schools of architecture and building ; commercial schools , for textile , wood , metal , and ceramic industries ; art schools ; schools for naval architecture and engineering and navigation ; and the public music schools , it would be seen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have visited scores of all sorts of schools all over Germany , from a peasant common school in Posen up to that last touch in education , the schools in Charlottenburg , the ' Schulpforta Academy , and such a private boys ' school as Die Schulerheim-Kolonie des Arndt-Gymnasiums in the Grunewald near Berlin , and the training schools for the military cadets . Through the courtesy of the authorities I was permitted , when I wished it , to sit in the class-rooms , and even to put questions to the boys and girls in the classes . From the small boys and girls making their first efforts at spelling to the young woman of seventeen who translated a paragraph of the " Germania " of Tacitus , not into German but into French , for me ( a problem I offered as a good test of whether I was merely assisting at a prepared exhibition of the prowess of the class or whether the minds had been trained to independence ) , I have looked over a wide field of teaching and learning in Germany . If that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls ' school , there is no doubt of their ability to meet an intellectual emergency of that kind . Of one feature of German education one can write without reservation , and that is the teaching . Everywhere it is good , often superlatively good , and half a dozen times I have listened to the teaching of a class in history , in Latin , in German literature , in French literature , where it was a treat to be a listener . I remember in particular a class in physical geography , another reading Ovid , another reading @#  | Shakespeare , and another reading Goethe 's Hermann and Dorothea , " where I enjoyed my half-hour as though I had been listening to a distinguished lecturer on his darling subject . We know how little these men and women teachers are paid , but there is such a flood of intellectual output in Germany that the competition is ferocious in these callings , and the schools can pick and choose only from those who have borne the severest tests with the greatest success . The teaching is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work these poor children are enabled to get through . School begins at seven in summer , at tight in winter . The course for those intending to go to the university is nine years ; the recitation hours alone range from twenty-five to thirty-two hours a week ; to which must be added two hours a week of singing and three hours a week of gymnastics , and this for forty-two weeks in the year . The preparation for class-work requires from two and a half to four hours more . It foots up to something like fifty hours a week ! At Eton , in England , the boys grumble because they only have a half-holiday every other day and four months of the year vacation . It will be interesting to see which educational method is to produce the men who are to win the next Waterloo . No wonder that nearly seventy per cent of those who reach the standard required of those who need serve only one year instead of three in the army are near-sighted , and that more than fortyfive per cent are put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population in Germany is so great , however , and the candidates for the army so numerous , that the authorities are far more strict in those they accept than in France , for example . There is more manhood material for the German army and navy every year than is needed . In the first year of the nine-years ' course in a Gymnasium the 25 hours a week are divided : religion , 3 hours ; German , 4 hours ; Latin , 8 hours ; geography , 2 hours ; mathematics , 4 hours ; natural science , 2 hours ; writing , 2 hours . In the last year : religion , 2 hours ; German , 3 hours ; Latin , 7 hours : Greek , 6 hours ? Greek is begun in the fourth year ; French , 3 hours ? French is begun in the third year ; history , 3 hours ; mathematics , 4 hours ; natural science , 2 hours . In the first year in a Realgymnasium : religion , 3 hours ; German , 4 hours ; Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 hours ; natural science , 2 hours ; writing , 2 hours . In the last year of the course : religion , 2 hours ; German , 3 hours ; Latin , 4 hours ; French ? begun in third year ? 4 hours ; English ? begun in fourth year -3 hours ; mathematics , 5 hours ; natural science , 5 hours ; drawing , 2 hours . In the first year in an Oberrealschule : religion , 3 hours ; German , 5 hours ; French , 6 hours ; geography , 2 hours ; mathematics , 5 hours ; natural science , 2 hours ; writing , 2 hours . In the last year : religion , 2 hours ; German , 4 hours ; French , 4 hours ; English ? begun in the fourth year ? 4 hours ; history , 3 hours ; geography , z hour ; mathematics , 5 hours ; natural science , 6 hours ; free-hand drawing ? begun in the second year ? 2 hours . It may be seen from these schedules where the emphasis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results are concerned , the pupils about to leave for the universities seemed to me to know their Latin , Greek , French , German , and English , and their local and European history well . Their knowledge of Latin and of either French or English , sometimes of both , is far superior to anything required of a student entering any college or university in America . I have asked many pupils to read passages at sight in Latin , French , and English in schools in various parts of Germany and there is no question of the grip they have upon what they have been taught . I am , alas , not a scholar , and can only judge of the requirements and of the training and its resuls in subjects where I am at home ; and I must take it for granted that these boys and girls are as well trained in other subjects where I am incapable of passing judgment . It is improbable , however , that the same thoroughness does not characterize their work throughout the whole curriculum . The examination at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more thorough and covers a wider range than any similar examination in America . It is a test of intellectual maturity . It permits no gaps , covers a  | wide ground , leaves no subject dropped on the way , and sends a man or woman to the university with an equipment entirely adequate for such special work as the individual proposes to undertake . It seemed to me that in many class rooms the ventilation was distinctly bad , but here too I must admit an exaggerated love for fresh air , born of my own love of out-door exercise . There are practically no schools in Germany like the public schools for boys in England , and our own private schools for boys , like Saint Paul 's , Groton , Saint Mark 's , and others , where the training of character and physique are emphasized . Here again I admit my prejudice in favor of such education . I should be made pulp , indeed , did I try to run through the boys of a fifth or sixth form at home , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for a wager in Germany . It is not their fault , poor boys . Practically the whole emphasis is laid upon drilling the mind . Moral and physical matters are left to the home , and in the home there are no fathers and brothers interested in games or sport , and in this busy , competitive strife , and with the small means at the disposal of the majority , there is no time and no opportunity . Boys and girls seldom leave home for distant boarding-schools . They go from home to school and from school home every day , and have none of the advantages to be gained from intercourse with men outside their own circles . It shows itself in a deplorable lack of orientation as compared with our lads of the same relative standing . In dress and bearing , in at-homeness in the world , in ability to take care of themsieves under strange conditions or in an emergency , and in domestic hygiene they are inferior , and yet they are so competent to push the national military , industrial , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bagehot 's gibe at certain well-to-do classes of the Saxons , that " they spend half their time washing their whole persons , " may not have a grain of truth in it . Another feature of the school life which is prominent , especially in Prussia , is the incessant and insistent emphasis laid upon patriotism . In every school , almost in every class-room , is a picture of the Emperor ; in many , pictures also of his father and grandfather . Even in a municipal lodging-house , where I found some tiny waifs and strays being taught , there were pictures of the sovereign , and brightly colored pictures of the war of 1870-71 , generally with German personalities on horseback , and the French as prisoners with bandages and dishevelled clothing . This war , which began with the first movement of the German army on August 4 , and on the 2d of September next Napoleon was a prisoner ; this war , in which the German army at the beginning of operations consisted of 384,000 officers and men and which had grown to 630,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed and those who died from wounds 28,278 , of whom 1,871 were officers ; this war is flaunted at the population of Germany continually , and from every possible angle . We hear very little of our war of 1861-66 , that cost us $8,000,000,000 with killed and wounded numbering some 700,000 . We do not find it necessary to feed our patriotism with a nursing-bottle . At a kindergarten two tots , a boy and a girl , stood at the top of some steps while the rest marched by and saluted ; they later descended and went through the motions of reviewing the others . They were playing they were Kaiser and Kai-serin ! Two small boys in a school-yard discussing their relative prowess as jumpers end the discussion when one says as a final word : " Oh , I can jump as high as the Kaiser ! " We have noted in another article how even police sergeants must be familiar with the history of the House of Hohenzollern . I am an admirer of Germany and her Emperor , with a distinct love of discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an experience of actual warfare such as only a score or so of German officers or men of my generation have had ; but I am bound to say I found this pounding in of patriotism on every side distinctly nauseating . Boys and girls , and men and women , ought not to need to be pestered with patriotism . We had a controversy in America some ten years before the Franco-German War , where in more than one battle more men were killed  | and wounded than in all the battles Prussia . and later Germany , has fought since 1860 . In the South , at any rate , we bear the scars and the mourning of those days still , but nobody would be thanked for pummelling us with patriotism . In the skirmish with Spain our military authorities were pestered with candidates for the front . Germany itself is not more a nation in arms than America would be at the smallest threat of insult or aggression . But we take those things for granted . If we have the honor to possess a medal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when asked to do so , or perhaps on the Fourth of July . Germany is even now somewhat loosely cemented together . Their leaders may feel that it is necessary to keep ever in the minds even of the children that Germany is a nation with an Emperor and a victory over France , France in political rags " and patches at the time , behind them . They even carry this teaching of patriotism beyond the boundaries of Germany . The Allgemeiner Deutscher Schulverein zur Erhaltung des Deutschtums inz Auslazzde is a society with head-quarters in Berlin devoting itself to the advancement of German education all over the world . The society was started privately in 1886 , and is now partly supported by the state . It controls some sixteen hundred centres for the teaching of German and German patriotism , and German learning . There are such centres in China , South America , the United States , Spain , and elsewhere . They number 90 in Europe ; 25 in Asia ; 20 in Africa ; 70 in Brazil ; 40 in Argentina ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in having German taught in 5,000 schools and academies in the United States to 600,000 pupils . The work is not advertised , rather is it concealed so far as possible , but it is looked upon as a valuable force for the advancement of German interests throughout the world . In the schools , too , there is an enemy of which we know nothing , and that is the active propagandism of socialism , which is anti-military , anti-monarchical , and anti-status quo . Leaflets and books and pamphlets are widely distributed among the school children ; many of the teachers are in sympathy with these obstructionist methods ; and the authorities may feel that they must do what they can to combat this teaching . In Prussia , on every side , and in the industrial towns of Saxony , one sees the evidence of this impotent discontent expressing itself either openly or in surly malice of speech and manner . The streets of Berlin , and of the industrial towns , show this condition at every turn , and when the Reichstag closes with cheers for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that loyal ceremony takes place . We in America are brought up to believe that the best cure for such maladies is to open the wound , to give freedom of speech , to let every boy and girl and man and woman find out for himself his citizen 's path to walk in . We have no policemen on our public platforms , no gags in the mouths of our professors or preachers , no lurid pictures of battles , no plastering of the walls of our schools and seminaries with pictures of our rulers , and withal our German immigrants are perhaps our best and most patriotic citizens . Self-consciousness is the prince of mental and social diseases , as vanity is the princess , and even self-conscious patriotism seems a little unwholesome , not quite manly , and often even grotesque . It is easy to say : ' Dic mihi si fueris to leo , qualis eris ? " and if one is a person of no great importance , it is an embarrassing question to answer . In this connection I can only say that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much roaring , bristling of the mane , and switching of the tail . It irritates those who are discontented , it positively infuriates the redder democrats , and it bores the children , and , worst of all , proclaims to everybody that the lion is not quite comfortable and at his ease . The German lion is a fine , big fellow now , with fangs , and teeth , and claws as serviceable as need be , and it only makes him appear undignified to be forever looking at himself in the looking - glass . Whatever may be the right or wrong of these comparative methods of training , Germans trained in the investigation of such matters agree in telling me that the boys who come up to the universities , especially in the large cities and towns , are  | somewhat lax in their moral standards as regards matters upon which the puritan still lays great stress . In Berlin particularly , where there are some thirty-five hundred registered and nearly fifty thousand unregistered women devoting themselves to the seemingly incompatible ends of rapidly accumulating gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immorality unequalled in any capital in Europe . In the whole German Empire the average of illegitimacy is ten per cent , but in Berlin the average for the last few years is twenty per cent . Out of every five children born in Berlin each year one is illegitimate ! It is questionable whether the increasing demands of the army and navy require such laxity of moral methods in providing therefor . There is , however , a state church in Germany with its head in Berlin , and no doubt we may safely leave this matter in these better hands than ours . I beg to say that in mentioning this subject I am quoting unprejudiced scientific investigators , who , I may say , agree , without a dissenting voice of importance , that Berlin has become the classical problem along such lines . In the endeavor to compete with the gayeties elsewhere , a laxity has been encouraged and permitted that has won for Berlin in the last ten years an unrivalled position as a purveyor of afterdark pleasures . Berlin not only produces a disproportionate number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a veritable horde of those who are like unto the son of Bosor . After the sheltered home life and the severe discipline of the higher schools , a German youth is permitted a freedom unknown to us at the university . There is no record kept of how or where he spends his time . He matriculates at one or another of the universities , and for three , four , or , in the case of medical students , five years , he is free to work or not to work , as he pleases . There are , however , three factors that serve as bit and reins to keep him in order . The final examination is severe , thorough , and can not be passed successfully by mere cramming ; very few of the students have incomes which permit of a great range of dissipation ; and not to pass the examination is a terrible defeat in life , which cuts a man off from further progress and leaves him disgraced . These are forces that count , and which prevail to keep all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole is so disciplined , so fitted together , so impossible to break into except through the recognized channels , that few men have the optimistic elasticity of mind and spirits , the demoniac confidence in themselves , that overrides such considerations . We suffer from a superabundance of men of aleatory dispositions , men who love to play cards with the devil , who rejoice to wager their future , their reputation , their lives , against the world . I admit a sneaking fondness for them . They are a great asset , and a new country needs them , but if we have too many , Germany has too few . They are forever crying out here for another Bismarck . Whenever in political matters , in foreign affairs , even in their religious controversies , things go wrong , men lift their hands and eyes to heaven and say , " How different if Bismarck were here ! " Bismarck and two of his predecessors as nation-builders were not afraid to throw dice with the world , and what " the land of damned professors " could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Gymnasium come into the freedom of university life , they toss their heads a bit , kick up their heels , laugh long and loud at the Philister , but just as every German climax is incomplete without tears , so they too are soon singing : " Ich Weiss nicht was soil es bedeuten dass ich so traurig bin ! " the gloom of the Teutoburger Wald settles down on them , and they buckle to and work with an enduring patience such as few other men in the world display , and join the great army here , who , bitted and harnessed , are pulling the Vaterland to the front . The British Empire between ' Soo and ' 9 ' 0 grew from 1,500,000 square miles to 11,450,000 square miles , and its trade from $400,000,000 to $11,020,000,000 ; not to mention the United States of America , now considered to be of noticeable importance , though we are universally sneered at by the Germans , to an extent that no American dreams of who has not lived here , as a land of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book-learning , dullards . But it is this , none the less , that Germany envies , and has set out to rival and if possible to surpass . No wonder the training must be severe for the athletes who propose to themselves such a task . For a semester or two , perhaps for three , the German student gives himself up to the rollicking freedom of the corps student 's life . That life is so completely misunderstood by the foreigner that it deserves a few words of explanation . I am not yet old enough to envy youth , nor sourly sophisticated enough to deal sarcastically or even lightly with their worship and their creeds , that once I shared , and with which lately I have been , under the most hospitable circumstances , invited to renew my acquaintance at the Commers and the Mensur . One may be no longer a constant worshipper at the shrine of blue eyes , pink cheeks , flaxen hair , and the enshrouding mystery of skirts , which make for curiosity and reverence in youth ; one may have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best women are so much nobler than the best men , that the best men may still kneel to the best women ; just as the worst women surpass the worst men in consciencelessness , brutal selfishness , disloyalty , and degradation . The female bandit in society , or frankly on the warpath outside , takes her weapons from an armory of foulness and cruelty unknown to men ; just as the heroines and angels among women fortify themselves in sanctuaries to which few if any men have the key . One returns , therefore , to the playground of one 's youth with not less but with more sympathy and understanding . Far from being " brutalizing guilds , " far from being mere unions for swilling and slashing , the German corps , by their codes , and discipline , and standards of manners and honor , are , from the chivalrous point of view , the leaven of German student life . In these days many of them have club-houses of their own , where they take their meals in some cases and where they meet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of expenditure by students at the German universities , whether they are members of the corps or not . At one of the smaller universities in a country town like Marburg , for example , a poor student , with a little tutoring and the system of Frei Tisch ? money left for the purpose of giving a free midday meal to poor students ? may scrape along with an expenditure of as little as twenty dollars a month . A member of a good corps at this same university is well content with , and can do himself well on , seventy dollars a month . I have seen numbers of students ' rooms , with bed , writing-table , and simple furniture , perhaps with a balcony where for many months in the year one may write and read , which rent for sixty dollars a year . One may say roughly that at the universities outside the large towns , and not including the fashionable universities , such as Bonn , the student gets on comfortably with fifty dollars a month . They have their coffee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take together at a restaurant , and their supper of cold meats , preserves , cheese , and beer where they will . For seventy-five cents a day a student can feed himself . The hours are Aristotelian , for it was Aristotle in his " Economics , " and not a nursery rhymer , who wrote : " It is likewise well to rise before daybreak , for this contributes to health , wealth , and wisdom . " " Early to bed and early to rise " is a classic . At Bonn , a member of one of the three more fashionable corps spends far more than these sums , and his habits may be less Spartan . The ridiculous expenditure of some of our mamma-bred undergraduates , who go to college primarily to cultivate social relations , are unknown anywhere in Germany , for a student would make himself unpopularly conspicuous by extravagance . Two to three thousand dollars a year , even at Bonn as a member of the best corps , would be amply sufficient and is considered an extravagant expenditure . The origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students dates back to the days when the students aligned themselves with more rigidity than now according to the various German states from which they came . The names of the corps still bear this sug- gestion , though nowadays the alignment is rather social than geographical . The Burschenschaften societies of students had their origin in political opposition to this separation of the students into communities from the various states . The originators of the Burschenschaften movement , for example , were eleven students at Jena . Sobriety and chastity were conditions of entrance , and " Honor , Liberty , Fatherland " were their watchwords . It was deemed a point of honor that a member breaking his vows should confess and retire from the society . The societies of the Burschenschaften are still considered to have a political complexion and the corps proper have no dealings with them . In any given semester the number of students in one of these corps varies from as few as ten to as many as twenty-five , depending , much as do our Greek-letter societies and college clubs , upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certain corps are composed almost exclusively of noblemen , but none is distinctly a rich man 's club . An active member of a corps during his first two semesters may do a certain amount of serious work , but as a rule it is looked upon as a time " to loaf and invite one 's soul , " and little attempt is made to do more . Not a few men whom I have known have not even entered a class-room during the two or three semesters of this blossoming period . I have spent many days and nights with these gentlemen , at Heidelberg , at Leipsic , at Marburg , at Bonn , and been made one of them in their jollity and good-fellowship , and I have agreed and still agree that " Wir sind die Konige der Welt , wir sind 's durch unsere Freude . " They are by no means the swashbuckling , bullying , dissolute companions painted by those who know nothing about them . They may drink more beer than we deem necessary for health , or even for comfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword practice that we do not esteem , they may be proud of the scars of these imitation duels , but these are all matters of tradition and taste . When one writes of eating and drinking , it is hardly fair to make comparisons from a personal stand-point . An adult of average weight requires each day 125 grams of proteid or building material , 500 grams of carbohydrates , 50 grams of fat . This equals , in common parlance , one pound of bread , one-half pound of meat , one-quarter pound of fat , one pound potatoes , onehalf pint of milk , one-quarter pound of eggs , assumed that one egg equals two ounces , and one-eighth pound of cheese . Divided into three meals , this means for breakfast : two slices of bread and butter and two eggs ; for dinner : one plateful potato soup , large helping of meat with fat , four moderate-sized potatoes , one slice bread and butter ; for tea : one glass of milk and two slices of bread and butter ; for supper : two slices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plain white bread supplies more caloric , or energy , for the price than any other one food and , with one or two exceptions , more proteid , or building material , than any other one food . One to one and a half fluid ounces of alcohol is about the amount which can be completely oxidized in the body in a day . This quantity is contained in two fluid ounces of brandy or whiskey ; five fluid ounces of port or sherry ; ten of claret or champagne or other light wines , and twenty of bottled beer .. All this means that a pint of claret , or two glasses of champagne or a bottle of beer , or a glass of whiskey with some aerated water during the day will not hurt a man , and adds perhaps to the " agreeableness of life , " as Matthew Arnold phrases it . At any rate this table of contents is a much safer standard of comparison in judging the eating and drinking habits of other people than either your habits or mine . The German student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe authorities here in Germany that his heart , liver , and kidneys suffer ; but he has been at it a long time , and in certain fields of intellectual prowess he is still supreme , and as we only drink with him now occasionally when he is our host , perhaps he had best be left to settle these questions without our criticism . In general terms , I have always considered , as a test of myself and others , that a healthy man is one who lies down at night without fear , rises in the morning cheerfully , goes to a day 's serious  | work of some kind rejoicing in the prospect , meets his friends gayly , and loves his loves better than himself . It is folly to maintain that it does not require pluck and courage to stand up to a swinging Schlager and take your punishment without flinching , and then to sit without a murmur while your wounds are sewn up and bandaged . I can not help my preference for foot-ball , or base-ball , or rowing , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pheasant shooting , or the shooting of bigger game , or the driving of four horses , or the handling of a boat in a breeze of wind , but the " world is so full of a number of things " that he has more audacity than I who proposes to weigh them all in the scales of his personal experience , and then to mark them with their relative values . First of all , it is to be remembered that these Schlager contests between students are in no sense duels ; a duel being the setting by one man of his chance of life against another 's chance , both with deadly weapons in their hands . These contests with the Schlager at the German universities , wrongly called duels , are so conducted that there is no possibility of permanent or even very serious injury to the combatants . The attendants who put them into their fighting harness , the doctors who look after them during the contest and who care for them afterward , are old hands at the game and no mistakes are made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule . They are merely candidates for promotion in the corps who meet candidates from other corps , and prove their skill and courage auf die Mensur , or fighting-ground . When a youth joins a corps he chooses a counsellor and friend , a Leibbursch , as he is called , from among the older men , whose special care it is to see that he behaves himself properly in his new environment ; he pledges himself to respect the traditions and standards of the corps and to keep himself worthy of respect among his fellows and among those whom he meets outside . A companion and guardianship not unlike this used to exist in the Greekletter society to which I once belonged . He of course abides by the rules and regulations of the order . It is a time of free-@# dom in one sense , but it is a freedom closely guarded , and there is rigid discipline here as in practically all other departments of life in Germany . The young students , or Fuchse as they are called , are instructed in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose authority is absolute . This authority extends even to the people whom they may know and consort with , either in the university or in the town ; and to all questions of personal behavior , debts , dissipation , manners , and general bearing . In many of the corps there are high standards and old traditions as regards these matters , and every member must abide by them . Every corps student is a patriot , . ready to sing or fight for Kaiser and Vaterland , and socialism , even criticism of his country or its rulers , are as out of place among them as in the army or navy . They are particular as to the men whom they admit , and a man 's lineage and bearing and relations with older members of the corps are carefully canvassed before he is admitted to membership . Both the present Emperor and one of his sons have been members of a corps . Let us spend a day with them . It is Saturday . We get up rather late , having turned in late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to fight the next day were drunk to , sung to , and wished good fortune on the morrow , and sent home early . The trees are turning green at Bonn , the shrubs are feeling the air with hesitating blossoms , you walk out into the sunshine as gay as a lark , for the champagne and the beer of the night before were good , and you sang away the fumes of alcohol before you went to bed . There was much laughter , and a speech or two of welcome for the guest , responded to at I A. M. in German , French , English , and gestures with a beer-mug and punctuated with the appreciative comments of the company . It was a time to slough off twenty years or so and let Adam have his chance , and the company was of gentlemen who sympathize with and understand the " Alter Herr , " and are only too delighted if he will let the springs of youth bubble and sparkle for them , and glad to encourage him to return to reminiscences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledge him  | in bumper after bumper success in the days to come . You might think it a carouse . Far from it . The ceremony is presided over by a stern young gentleman , who never for a moment allows any member of the company to get out of hand , and who , when a speech is to be made , makes it with grace and complete ease of manner . Indeed , these young fellows surprise one with their easy mastery of the art of speech-making . Even the spokesman for the Fuchse , or younger students , at the lower end of the table , rises and pledges himself and his companions in a few graceful words , with certain sly references to the possibility that the guest may not have lost his appreciation of the charms of German womankind , which the guest in question here and now and frankly admits ; but not a word of coarseness , not a hint that totters on the brink of an indiscretion , and what higher praise can one give to speech-making on such an occasion ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest of all , and though seemingly as lavish in his potations as any one , sings his way home with me , head as clear , legs as steady , eyes as bright , as though it were 10 A.M. and not 2 A.M. , and as though I had not seemed to see his face during most of the evening through the bottom of a beer-mug . That was the night before . The next morning we stroll over to the room where the Schlager contests are to take place . It is packed with students in their different-colored caps . Beer there is , of course , but no smoking allowed till the bouts are over . I go down to see the men dressing for the fray . They strip to the waist , put on a loose half-shirt half-jacket of cotton stuff , then a heavily padded half-jerkin that covers them completely from chin to knee . The throat is wrapped round and round with heavy silk bandages . The right arm and hand are guarded with glove and a heavily padded leather sleeve ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded with steel spectacle frames fitted with thick glass . Nothing is exposed but the face and the top of the head . The exposed parts are washed with antiseptics , as are also the swords , repeatedly during the bout . The sword , hilt and blade together , measures one hundred and five centimetres . There is a heavy , wellguarded hilt , and a pliable blade with a square end , sharp as a razor on both edges for some six inches from the end . The position in the sword-play is to face squarely one 's opponent , the sword hand well over the head with the blade held down over the left shoulder . The distance between the combatants is measured by placing the swords between them lengthwise , each one with his chest against the hilt of his own weapon , and this marks the proper distance between them . When they are brought in and face one another , the umpire , with a bow , explains the situation . The two seconds with swords crouch each beside his man , ready to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two other men stand ready to hold the rather heavily weighted sword arm of his comrade on the shoulder during the pauses . Two others with cotton dipped in an antiseptic preparation keep the points of the swords clean . Still another official keeps a record in a book of each cut or scratch , the length of time , the number of bouts , and the result . The doctor decides when a wound is bad enough to close the contest . At the word " Los : " the blades sing and whistle in the air , the work being done almost wholly with the wrist , some four blows are exchanged , there is a pause , then at it again , till the alloted number of bouts are over , or one or the other has been cut to the point where the doctor decides that there shall be no more . We follow them downstairs again , where , after being carefully washed , the combatants are seated in a chair one after the other , their friends crowd around and count the stitches as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wrist produced such and such a gash . I have seen scores of these contests , and during the last year as many as a dozen or more . There is no record of any one ever having been seriously injured ; indeed , I doubt if there are not more men injured by too much beer than too much swordplay . It is perhaps expected that the football player should sneer at bull-fighting ; the boxer at fencing ; the rider to hounds at these Schlager bouts ; and that we game-@#  | players should say contemptuous things of the contests of our neighbors . Personally , if one could eliminate the horse from the contest , I go so far as to believe that even bull-fighting is better than no game at all . As for these Schlager contests , they seem to me no more brutal than our own foot-ball , which is only brutal to the shivering crowd of the too tender who have never played it , and not so dangerous as polo or pick-sticking , and a thousand times better than no contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the human body and that human life are the most precious and valuable things in the world . They are only servants of the courageous hearts and pure souls that ought to be their masters . Without training , without obedience , without the instant willingness to sacrifice themselves for their masters , the human body and human life are contemptible and unworthy . I claim that it braces the mind to expose the body ; that an education in the prepared emergencies of games and sport is the best training for the unprepared emergencies with which life is strewn . The most cruel people I have ever known were gentle enough physically , but they were hard and sour in their social relations , and often enough called " good " by their fellows . The disappointments , losses , sorrows , defeats , of each one of us , trouble , even though imperceptibly , the waters of life that we all must drink of ; and to ignore or to rejoice at these misfortunes is only muddying what we ourselves must drink . I believe the hardening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleansing the soul , and toward fitting a man with that cheerful charity that supplies the oil of intercourse in a creaking world of rival interests . To see a youth swinging a sword at his fellow 's face with delighted energy ; to see a man riding off vigorously at polo ; to see a man hard at it with the gloves on ; to see another flinging himself and his horse over a wall or across a ditch ; to see these things without seeing that ? perhaps often enough in a muddy sort of way ? the soul is making a slave of the body , that courage is mastering cowardice , that in an elementary way the youth is learning how to @# give himself generously when some great emergency calls upon him to give his life for an ideal , a tradition , a duty , is to see nothing but brutality , I admit . Who does not know that the Carthaginians at Cannes were one thing , the Carthaginians at Capua another ! I have therefore no acidulous effeminacy to pour upon these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I am a hardened believer in the manhood bred of contests , and though their ways are not my ways , I prefer a world of slashed faces to a world of soft ones . Prosit , gentlemen ! Better your world than the world of Semitic haggling and exchange ; of caution and smoothness ; of the disasters born of daintiness ; of sliding over the ship 's side in women 's clothes to live , when it was a moral duty to be drowned . Better your world than any such worlds as those , for " If one should dream that such a world began In some slow devil 's heart that hated man , Who should deny it ? " Milton held that " a complete and generous education fits a man to perform justly , skilfully , and magnanimously all the offices , both private and public , of peace and war . " It is my opinion that the Schlager has its part to play in this matter of education . A mind trained to the keenness of a razor 's edge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is of small account in the world . The whole aim of education is , after all , to make a man independent , to make the intelligence reach out in keen quest of its object , and at its own and not at another 's bidding . An education is intended to make a man his I own master , and so far as any man is not his own master , in just so far is he uneducated . What he knows , or does not know , of books does not alter the fact . Much of the pharisaism and priggishness on the subject of education arises from the fact that the world is divided into two camps as regards knowledge : those who believe that the astronomer alone knows the stars , and those who believe that he knows them best who sleeps in the open beneath them . In reality , neither type of mind is complete without the other . To turn from any theoretical discussion  | of the subject , it remains to be said that Germany has trained her whole population into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural advantages of either England or America she has become the rival of both . Her superior mental training has enabled her to wrest wealth from by-products , and she saves and grows rich on what America wastes . Whether Germany has succeeded in giving the ply of character to her youth , as she folds them in her educational factories , I sometimes doubt . That she has not made them independent and ready to grapple with new situations , and strange peoples , and swift emergencies , their own past and present history shows . It is a very strenuous and economical existence , however , for everybody , and it requires a politically tame population to be thus driven . The dangerous geographical situation of Germany , ringed round by enemies , has made submission to hard work and to an iron autocratic government necessary . To be a nation at all it was necessary to obey and to submit ; to sacrifice and to save . These things they have been taught as have no other European people . Greater wealth , increased power , a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education thus far has been in the direction of fitting each one into his place in a great machine , and less attention has been paid to the development of that elasticity of mind which makes for independence ; but men educate themselves into independence , and that time is coming swiftly for Germany . " Also he hath set the world in their heart , " and one wonders what this population , hitherto so amenable , so economical , and so little worldly , will do with this new world . The temptations of wealth , the sirens of luxury , the opportunities for amusement and dissipation , are all to the fore in the Germany of to-day as they were certainly not twenty-five years ago . " The land of damned professors " has learned its lessons from those same professors so well , that it is now ready to take a post-graduate course in world politics ; and as I said in the beginning , some of our friends are putting the word " damned " in other parts of this and other sentences when they describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
