txt Where the Dust Comes From . I wish to draw your attention to a. public nuisance which is a crying evil and needs remedying , namely , when the ash carts go through the street emptying those ash cans about one-half of the ashes blow out again into the street into people 's faces , eyes and noses . It may sometimes be seen that halt those ashes are blown out of the cart into the street again and into the houses or anywhere else . There is certainly no need for that job being handled so clumsily and so detrimental to the public health , and it happens all the time all along the various streets wherever this job is being carried on . ' rho remedy would be , to my mind , to Whist on all bouseholden ; ha , ing these ashes thoroughly dampened with water or else only covered ash carts should to used . but it would seem as if nothing would prevent dry ashes from being blown out again , especially on a windy day . Such a bungling way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town in Europe , and it is an evil which gets worse if anything . and certainly should be put a stop to .
