txt THE SELF AND NATURE Nevertheless , the doubter will probably not be satisfied with our explanations ; he will object : surely the past experience did cease to exist ; there was a time during which it was not at all ; how then can that which once has not been be again numerically the same as it was before ? Well , why not ? Experience is a process of transformation and creation ; hence , why can not that which was destroyed be recreated ? that which was formed be formed anew ? There is no principle of thought or reality which forbids this . And the denial of it is due to ignorance of the fundamentally resilient character of experience . In the passage to non-existence a thing does not acquire any new character which could distinguish it from what it was ; during the period of non-existence it undergoes no radical transformation ? how could it ? ? and there is no new character added by emergence into existence . Existence , as Kant said , is no quality and non-existence equally not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist does not affect its character ; hence can not affect its sameness or difference . The whole difficulty roots , I repeat , in the supposition that the present thing has its double back in the past ; that there are two existences which , qua two , can not be identical . But , once more , a difference in moments does not involve a difference in existences ; for the same thing may exist at many different moments and quite irrespective of whether they are continuous or discontinuous . The very same experience that was can exist anew at separate moments of time ; and these reappearances are not duplicates of the old ; they are just the old recreated . When an experience disintegrates , it // ceases to exist absolutely ; but now , this very thing may be redintegrated ; that which ceased to exist may come again into existence . And its sameness is not of mere quality as distinguished from numerical or existential sameness . If the past and the present thing were two , as two rungs of a ladder are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the very stuff of the old is born again , and when reborn is the same past thing which was destroyed and had ceased to exist until now . Thus far , however , we have simply shown the baselessness of the prejudices against personal identity , but we have not shown it to be real . We turn now to the positive , ' constructive task . We must show two things : first , that personal identity exists , and second , how much of the person is identical ; for we admit , with every one else , that a large share of experience is transient . But first of all we must inquire more narrowly into what we mean by identity and how we can prove that it exists in the mind . By identity may be meant the abstract concept or meaning , identity . This , however , like all concepts , is the reflex or representative in the mind of something real in that which the mind knows and reflects upon . The application of a concept to anything is the assertion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept , known by the concept . To verify a concept means to bring the concept and the reality which it means face to face , to cover the one with the other . Hence , just as the concept blue means the concrete blue of skies and flowers , means this element in the reality of these things , and could be formed only because // there is this real blue in things ; so identity means something concrete and real in the things of which it is asserted . If you ask me what identity is , I should have to reply by showing you an identical object , by giving you an experience of identity ; just as , if you were to ask me what blue is , I should show you something blue , give you a blue experience . For identity is just as simple and irreducible as blue . Identity must be carefully distinguished from similarity . Similarity pertains to two things ; identity only to one . Thus two leaves are similar , while each is identical . Those things are similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the similarity , the larger being the number of such concepts . Two individual things can be in all points similar and yet not be identical . A single thing can be more or less identical , which means that some of its elements are the same , while others are different . And , of course , in so far as elements of a thing are the same , the same abstract concepts fit it , while in so far as they are different , other concepts have to be applied . Hence only a single individual can be more or less identical ; different individuals can be only more or less similar . Moreover , as Hegel taught us , identity always implies difference : identity does not exist unless some of the elements of an individual change , that is , become different . I do not mean merely that identity is not noticed apart from difference , but that it does not exist to be noticed . In a purely static world things would not be identical with themselves ; they would simply be . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change will have to be treated more at length when we study // the general problem of change and time ; what we have presented here is for the purpose of making clear the premisses of our discussion of personal identity . Such being the general nature of identity , let us inquire how we can prove it to pertain to experience . Now the identity or non-identity of experience is in a peculiarly favorable position so far as discovery is concerned . For it does not have to be inferred or represented , but can be actually found , since the thing to which it pertains , namely experience , is always and alone capable of being found in the sense in which we have been using this term . Now I claim that identity is found in experience . Everybody admits that we seem to find it , that we have an " impression " or " feeling " of it ; I claim that this " feeling " is a fact . And I claim that the only reason why it is not recognized to be such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds which we have examined and found to be false . It is a fundamental principle in the theory of knowledge that the evidence of experience must be accepted unless proved to be fallacious through conflict with logical principles . And it seems as perverse to doubt the identity within experience as it would be to doubt that the sky which you are looking at is blue . For just as the concept blue has been derived from blue experiences and so must apply to the like , so the meaning identity has been acquired as a reflex of personal identity experiences . It means , aboriginally , a certain feature of experience and so must be true of it , just as blue means another feature and so must be true of that . Of course , one may deny that there is identity within experience , just as // one may deny that the sky which one is looking at is blue ; yet it is impossible not to possess the evidence which contradicts these assertions ; both the blue and the identity are in the mind . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience is not similarity . When we waken in the morning we find ourselves thinking the same thoughts , harassed by the same worries , ardent with the same hopes and plans . You can not be true to your experience and say that the morrow has brought you similar thoughts and anxieties and plans . The sting and the significance alike of your experience consist in their identity . You know that you are not many selves strung together like beads on a thread , new each day or hour or minute ; but one self , the same through all . The task of exhibiting the range of identity within the mind is now easy . First we have to find the region of mind in which the identity is given . The region in which this is certainly the case , is the self . Let us seek the identity in each of the three great classes of self experiences : thinking , interest and feeling . The tool of thinking is the concept . The concept is a residuum of masses of similar experiences . The act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concept to an object . When the object is new , the application of a concept to it is a novel event , through which the concept is partly changed and enriched ; yet not wholly so . For when , for example , I recognize a flower as a flower , there is actually present in the concept vestiges of countless former flower // experiences of which it is a precipitate ; and not only is the concept partly identical with much of the past , but the activity of application is also the same . Even when I employ new concepts , it is the one and identical function which energizes ; the function is , of course , differentiated ; yet it is the same , nevertheless ; for there is present in each new judgment the substance of all previous ones . And this identity in a function is given in the mind . Suppose I am recognizing plants : I judge " rose , " " lily , " " sweet william , " each time applying a different concept and judging a different object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking throughout . This identity in the apperceptive function is very impressive when traveling . During the journey we receive countless new impressions , yet because we recognize them all , employing a single function continually and old concepts in the emplo'yment , the experience of personal identity is striking through the contrast with the novelty of the scenes . Identity is given with equal evidence in the volitional experiences . Take the simple matter of interest . Suppose I start off to the woods to study plants . During the excursion I shall study many specimens ; the direction of my interest will therefore be constantly changing ; yet the interest itself will remain the same ; and the sameness will be given in the interest of studying , just as the difference will be given in the difference of the applications . And when in the morning I awaken with this interest upon me , identity is present there also ; for it is the same interest which kept me at my microscope until late at night and the same which has given direc46 THE SELF AND NATURE tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity in the interest is given , I mean that not only is the interest actually the same , but that it is experienced as the same , as familiar , and that this sameness and familiarity are real identity . Since desire is a complex affair involving not only interest but also the idea of an object towards which striving is directed , the identity there is twofold : on the one hand within the idea , and on the other , within the striving . Thus the desire for food involves an idea , the materials of which are probably older than any other ? some trace of infantile sucking is present . It is understood , of course , that the intermittence of the idea of food in the mind does not prejudice its real identity . The idea in the new setting is , to be sure , not exactly the same as in previous desires , yet it is fundamentally so . And the element of striving in the desire is essentially the same ; it has simply re-emerged directed to a new object and adherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love is , of course , a novel experience ; but each new love , although new as love of a new object , contains the echoes of all old flames . The familiar instance of personal identity , the experience of carrying out a plan , illustrates the chief points in our , adherent to an idea which means that action . Now when the plan is carried out , there is an experience of identity ; for there is identity in the experience : the plan enters bodily into the action , the selfsame plan conceived long ago perhaps ; the action exists in the mind as the incarnation of the plan , as containing it in its substance ; and the striving , the yearsPERSONAL // old striving , works itself out and feels itself the same in its new shape as fulfilled . As for emotions and pleasures , they are identical in correspondence with the identity in the strivings of which they are respectively phases and fulfillments . The fact that in our discussion of personal identity we have not yet referred to memory will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The importance of memory for personal identity has , I believe , been exaggerated . Memory enters into the identity of the self experiences in so far , chiefly , as they are connected with imagery . The activities of desiring and thinking are , as we have seen , entwined with images inherent in the ideas of the things thought of or desired . Originally all strivings and satisfactions are embedded in sense experiences ; but the latter , in passing , leave replicas of themselves , the store of which is increased by every new experience . Now these traces , although continually being lost , are never lost completely ; they are forever re-emerging , and a central core abides . They penetrate the activities , making up the substance of concepts and representative ideas . It is in this way that the activities of thinking and desiring involve memory . But memory in the sense of remembering past events is not involved . For in remembering , the images have a meaning ; they refer back to past experiences of which they are a survival . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences from which they have been derived , but are employed away from their base to represent new things . This is evidently true of the concept ; the concept does not know the experiences from which its imaginal material came ; it knows other // things ? the things to which it is applied . The same is true of the ideas employed in desire ; their substance is certainly past experiences , but they do not represent their originals ; they are given a new intent , a direction to the future . The central peculiarity of remembering , on the other hand , consists just in the fact that the image means the experience of which it is itself a derivative . It is this which gives to memory its warmth and intimacy , so different from the knowledge of past events not belonging to one 's own life . The image and the thing which it remembers are , of course , not the same ; yet the image is a child of the thing , its duplicate , and the old attitudes and feelings towards it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past self is present in the self which remembers . But although remembering is a vivid instance of personal identity , it is by no means the only case of it . During intense work , for example , there may be little or no remembering ; yet , because of the persistence of purpose and the attitudes required by the work , there is a large share of identity ; and this is experienced ? there is a keen sense of it . So far we have reviewed two regions of the mind in our search for identity : the activities which constitute the self , and the images with which the activities are so closely bound that they are almost inseparable by analysis and are hardly separable in reality . We have found that real identity exists in these regions . But what of sense experience ? The complete discussion of this will come later when we study the nature of physical things . Yet there is a phase of the matter which belongs here . For , whether there is identity in sensaPERSONAL // tions or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In so far as the latter are perceptions of familiar things , they contain the images of former experiences of these things ; their familiarity is due largely to this source . The presence of these identical images explains the seeming identity in things really new ; there is real identity in the perceptions , but the extent of it is misunderstood . Every concrete perception , even if of a new thing , contains an element of identity ; for , so far as it is recognized as being of a definite kind , there are present in it revived images of similar objects , on the basis of which recognition takes place . Of course the identity here is an identity in the images and not in the sensations , so that it is really covered by our discussions of the previous paragraph ; yet it is so closely connected with sensation that it may well be said to belong to sense experience . This element of identity in perception does not , however , involve remembering . For example , every morning when I see my desk anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity in it ; yet I do not think of occasions when I saw it on previous days ; I simply have in mind elements of former experiences , the residua of old memories , which simply are , without representing the former total experiences of which they were a part . From our development of the subject it is clear that personal identity can be more or less . It is usually greater between phases of experience which are near in time than between those which are remote . The crises of life , like the changes from childhood to maturity , the entrance upon new work , marriage and the birth of children , involve grave SO THE SELF AND NATURE alterations . The persistence or disturbance of the coenaesthesia is supposed to be important ; but far more so are purpose , interest , memory . From birth to death there is a continual acquisition of new experiences ; a partial preservation of these through the residua of memory ; a reemergence of old activities ; the loss again of these ; the irreparable loss of some ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and change , adventurous seeking for the new and a tragic holding on to the old or effort to escape the old ; self-making and self-mending ? such is the life of the mind . Throughout there is the thread of identity ; the old man remains in some respects the same as the child . Yet the amount of this identity varies on different occasions . It is great when a man puts all his emotional energy into some task which requires the use of his whole past experience , the total resources of his memory and learning ; then , as we say , he is most himself ; it is little when , in a light moment of gaiety , he forgets himself , feeding on new impressions . It is great again in constancy and continuity of work and affection , and less in disloyalties and infidelities . We usually call a man another man when he fails to recognize himself ? when he applies to his experience a different concept of self from the one which we have been accustomed to . Since the material upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , memories , beliefs , the failure to subsume oneself under the same concept of self implies the gravest alterations . Yet identity may exist here as elsewhere , even when not recognized . The application of a disPERSONAL // tinct concept of self to the self is an intellectual process of identification precisely similar to any other , the only difference being that the object recognized lies within the mind and so is the most accessible and certain of all objects ; yet if the actual identity between one phase of experience and another is not great , the old concept may not now seem applicable . There may still be identity ; experience may in some measure be familiar still ; yet the strangeness may be greater than the familiarity and there may be lacking the necessary power of discernment in order to disentangle the one from the other . The poor man may not know whether he is Sam Jones or another ; and if he does not know , how can we ? The changes in the idea of oneself are a good indication of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built up parallel with and as a reflex of the process of self-creation and preservation which is life . Personal identity is , however , no more identical with self identification than blue is with the concept of blue . The most ordinary experiences give evidence of this . When we waken in the morning we feel ourselves to be the same without any overt assimilation of the new experience to the idea of ourselves ; the idea may not arise at all . There are times , as we have seen , when the idea of self is in abeyance , as when we work quietly ; yet there is a sense of familiarity which pervades all experience and is the abiding identity within it . Yet when the idea of self is in mind we can not apply it to another self ; for its root and substance is just oneself and no other . One 's sense or feeling of identity with one 's past is thus no illusion or empty boast ; for it is the 5 2 THE SELF AND NATURE having in mind of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one 's past . The false self identifications of the insane are not cases unfavorable to our view . For there the psychic life is so awry that there is little real identity between the man 's present and his past ; hence he does not recognize himself . His identification of himself with Napoleon does not , of course , imply any real identity between the two individuals ; it is simply a false application of his concept of Napoleon , the ineptness of which the poor man has not wit enough to perceive . Give to him even a little power of discernment and he could not make the application . Let me emphasize , by way of summary , the contrast between my view of personal identity and the ordinary one . Mine is a doctrine of the real identity of the self and the recurrence of its elements ; the other is a doctrine of illusion and substitution of elements . According to the latter , the self is never identical with its past , because its elements are continually dying away , yet is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are replaced by similar ones . According to the view of this chapter , on the other hand , the judgment which the self makes about itself is a true judgment ; for , although its elements are continually being lost , they are found again ; they perish indeed , but not without hope ; their death is often followed by resurrection . For us also , the self is a fragile thing , broken by its environment and torn by internal tensions ; yet for us , it is capable of mending itself , and with its own fragments . CHAPTER III THE METAPHYSICS OF PERCEPTION THE self , as we observed in our first chapter , is in contact with and interwoven in content . A large part of this content is what is ordinarily called sensation . Now sensation is at least a part of things . If we lay aside all theories of what things really are and consider them only as they are given to us , we find them a complex of sense elements . Take the rose as an example : the rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , shapely , soft , sweet smelling . Of course , all that we mean by the rose is not present in sensation ; there is the part which is not seen , and there is the prick of the thorns which we carefully avoid . Yet these latter , although not reallypresent in sensation , are so , as it were vicariously , through images . There is nothing of the thing which we ever find that is not a sensation or image . We open our eyes and are face to face with things . In perception we are in direct contact with the physical world ; nothing intervenes . Perception is , first , a contact of the self with a sensuous reality , and second , a representation through idea of other sense elements which might be given . Some sensation is always the nucleus of the perception , but the larger part is a meaning . And last , perception involves recognition ? the given sense elements are subsumed under a concept , whereby their relations to other things , their 53 // place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perception of the rose . When you see the rose , certain visual elements enter into the already constituted whole of your mind ; they come into contact with other sensations there , with your feelings , interests , and thoughts ; forthwith there arise into this whole images which mean further rose elements not given ; finally , the structure thus formed is a familiar , a recognized thing - - a rose . As a result of this process , the mind is enriched and expanded ; it has acquired new elements , and part of its old self has been reborn ? sentiments that cling to roses , systems of botanical concepts revive . Although in perception the self is in direct contact with things , they are no part of it . I find sense elements to be other than myself with the same evidence that I find the identity of myself with the activities . It is impossible to argue this otherness away . Perception is a contact with an alien reality ? a chance embrace of strangers , involving no fatal entanglements . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape and texture . They are not you . And consider how they stand there self-possessed and independent . They have no need of your emotion or of your uncertain judgment and regard . You may interfere with , but you can not determine , the sense elements which are the rose ; they follow after their own nature , not after yours . You may cultivate or neglect , let bloom or pluck to deck your chamber ; but what will ensue you will have to learn from them ; you can not determine it for them . If the rose is independent of you , so are you of it . Contact with it may leave you with a vivid // image and no less vivid emotion , but you will go your way much as if you had never found it on your path . There are , of course , the familiar cases where this otherness seems to be overcome . Yet it is really never surmounted ; what occurs is a union of the self with sensation , an involution of the one in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aesthetic experience I may find myself mixed with the blue of the painting or lost in the mazes of its lines , but the poignancy of the experience depends , as in love , upon being intimate with something radically other than oneself . Were the lines and colors a part of the self , there would be nothing extraordinary and startling about the experience . The apparent selfness of sensation is due in every case to the admixture of the activities , and disappears as soon as they are withdrawn . The semblance of activity in sensation is due to the presence of the same factors . Thus lines may vibrate , colors may have vitality ? when emotion is felt into them . ' Perception is never , as we know , the mere existence of a sense element in the mind ; it always involves , in addition , the creation of a meaning . ' The sense elements in perception are recognized , interpreted , employed as signs ; but recognition , interpretation , the signitive function are activities which belong to the self . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealistic fallacy ? it rests on an insufficient analysis of the perceptual experience , on a failure to distinguish the active from the passive elements . The theory that the unity of mind is due to a transcendental ego may also be responsible for the belief that sensa56 THE SELF AND NATURE tion is a part of the self . This we have already disposed of in our chapter on The Self and the Mind . But let us consider the matter anew , with especial reference to perception , and let us seek to get at the facts . Suppose , once more , I turn my head and see the rose . New color elements will enter into the already constituted whole of the mind of which the self is a part . What sort of relation will be effected between them and it ? Now I submit that if we follow the facts and not some preconceived theory of them , we can best describe the relation as an adjunction , entrance , contact , implying by the use of these terms , ( i ) that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within ; ( z ) that there is nothing within the mind that can explain their nature ; ( 3 ) that they come as strangers , possessed of that otherness upon which we have already laid emphasis , possessed besides of their own individuality and identity ; ( 4 ) that the already constituted whole of mind has no need of them , for when I turn my head away and they leave the mind , it continues to exist without any large alteration . Of course , as I linger to look at the rose , its relation to the self becomes more intimate ; it had already awakened the activities of recognition and interpretation ; now it becomes suffused with emotion and interest ; it passes into the substance of the self . But the primary relation is adjunction , contact ; upon this is based the more interior relations . And no matter how closely the activities may twine about the sense elements of the rose , the latter retain their fundamental otherness and their own individuality and subsistence . // Again , I do not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the self and not , in some fashion , transform it . The modification of the self of the moment may indeed be very profound . Not only are certain activities , like recognition and interest , immediately and almost always evoked , thus expanding the self , but its whole pattern may be altered ; certain elements will be driven out , while others will acquire a new prominence . And the change is not wholly one-sided , confined to the self alone ; it affects the perceived sense elements as well . The clearness or unclearness of sense elements is a character which accrues to them only as elements of mind ; their suffusion with images effects other transformations . For example , through the connection of the visual elements with the images which mean the related touch object , the former may acquire some of the size of the latter ? the man whom I see far off may seem to be as large as if I were close to him ; or the blue in the picture may seem to be cold through the association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any loss of identity , or dependence on the self . ' Since perception is a contact of the self with sense elements , the association to them of memories , judgments and feelings , and since this relation is of the character described , it is obvious that things do not depend for their existence on perception . Sensations must first exist before they can be perceived . Yet , although independent of perception , sensations are not independent of the body . For example , the quality and form of visual sensations depend upon the structure of the eye . The failure to distinguish the depend58 THE SELF AND NATURE ence of sensations on the body from dependence on perception is one of the chief reasons , I believe , why so little has been accomplished towards clearing up these problems . Yet the confusion is a natural one , since the perception of a sense element is also dependent on the body ? although upon a different part ? and is nearly simultaneous with the existence of the element . The partial control which the self may exert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For in so far as the self has control over the body , it may co-operate in determining the existence of sensations . For example , by directing the adjustment of the sense organs , our interests are factors in the determination of the existence and course of visual , auditory and tactile sensations . But this is not a determination by perception . For , even in these cases , the sensations are first created through the sensory process before they are perceived . Perception ? the contact of sensations with feelings and ideas ? is an event following upon , but not determinative of , their existence . Obviously , while sensations are dependent upon the body , they are not created by it . If I close my eye , visual sensations disappear ; but the mere existence of the eye will rot serve to produce color . And there are functional relations between sensations which , although the body is always involved as a third party , can not be explained in terms of the body alone . For example , if I put a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors in my room will be changed . Moreover , the body itself ? which is also a complex of sensations ? is functionally related to other sense elements . It , too , // for example , would change its hue along with all the other things in the room . The empirical physical world consists of masses of sense elements functionally related among themselves , and above all to one part of themselves , bodies . By functional relation in this connection I mean that a change of one is correlated with a change in another , or that the appearance of one is sequent upon the appearance of another . Nothing else is given . The first objection commonly raised against a theory such as this is that it makes impossible the simultaneous perception by two or more people of the same thing . For how , if sensations , which are never the same in different minds , are the things perceived , is common perception possible ? For example , the electric light globe in my mind is elliptical in shape , while in yours it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meadow is green , while to you who are far away , it is violet . How can the same thing be at once violet and green , or elliptical and round ? The removal of this objection depends upon the realization that it is based upon a preconceived theory of things . It is assumed , namely , that the things which we see can have only one size , shape , and color at a given moment ; when , as a matter of observation , they possess a multitude of these , as many as are seen from any so-called point of view . The globe is at once elliptical and round , the meadow is at once violet and green , if it is seen so . All the so-called appearances of a thing are real . But there are usually one or more particular aspects , those where the thing can be handled , where it can be brought into bodily contact with the organ6o THE SELF AND NATURE ism , which , because of their practical importance , are emphasized over all the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rank of mere subjective signs of these . ' Thus , in order to adjust the globe , one has to act through tactile circular sensations , but not through visual elliptical ones ; and , in order to pluck the leaf , one has to act through green touch sensations rather than through violet ones ; hence , the former are viewed as real qualities of the object , of which the latter are thought to be mere appearances . But surely all sensations are equally real while they last ; practical importance may determine our interest in them , but it can not determine their reality . Things have no such simplicity as common sense supposes . We are evidently brought face to face with the general problem of the identity and unity of things . To take the former first : The identity of things belongs , in the first place , to their sensuous substance . Sensations shift and disappear ; yet they also reappear and abide . The red of the rose is the same red today as it was yesterday , despite its intermittence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we showed that an activity may be destroyed , and yet reborn the same . This is equally true of a sensation . When it reemerges , it is changed , but identity may exist despite difference . There is , indeed , no substance in things except that of their sensuous qualities . This is true of all sensations ; of a sound or a perfume . The vibratory , and other such facts which men of science regard as the substance behind sensation are only further sensuous elements of the whole , or else 1 See James : Principles of Psychology , Chapters xx and xxt. // mere symbolic images with only a subjective and pragmatic value . The existence of any sensation depends , without doubt , upon the co-operation of countless facts . Yet every sensation is real while it lasts and may come again after it has disappeared . We can not , therefore , be said to perceive the same thing in the sense that we are at any moment in contact with the same sense elements . ' The sensory content of people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe is circular , in mine it is elliptical . Only if you could occupy my position in space and possess my organs of vision could you have in mind the same sensations that I have . Nevertheless , we rightly feel that we are perceiving the same thing ; for we are in contact with parts of the same complex object . We perceive the same thing , despite the differences in the contents of our minds , just as we sit in the same room although we occupy different chairs . Although this identity in the stuff of things is their real identity , we often treat things which are merely similar as if they were the same . For example , when a number of people attend the performance of a symphony , we say that they hear " the same symphony . " But , as a matter of fact , the sound contents of their minds are different ? different , for example , in intensity and timbre , according to the positions in the hall occupied by the auditors , and other factors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now intense , now weak , but it is not possible for the same sound to be at once intense and weak . The various people in the hall are therefore in contact with different individual sounds , similar // in many ways , yet numerically different . Is there then no sense in saying that they hear the same symphony ? It all depends upon what we mean by the symphony . If we mean by the symphony a universal , a type , then it is true that they all hear the same symphony . The same musical composition , in this sense , can be heard simultaneously in New York and Boston by many different people . But the identical object which they perceive is not a physical thing at all , but , I repeat , an ideal or type . Here , as always , the perception of the ideal and typical takes place through the concrete and individual ; the same universal symphony is perceived through the similar , but numerically different , sounds in the minds of the various auditors . Now , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary perception is of just this nature . When we say that we perceive the same rose , we do not so much mean that we are in contact with parts of a single region of the physical world as that we are undergoing experiences of the same type . We are seeing the " same rose " just as we are " having the same pleasure " in it . The contents of our minds are numerically different ; yet they are similar in various ways , and adherent to them are thoughts which mean a sort of typical rose , which is the schematic invariant of all the concrete phenomena of the rose . Visual perception is a process of at least twofold complexity : first , a contact with some of the visual elements of the thing ; second , a representation through idea of the type to which the thing belongs . Even the common thing perceived is , I repeat , largely a type , but a type functioning through actual // aspects of the concrete thing with which the self is in contact . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic perception that , in the latter , the type or ideal is determined by aesthetic feelings which can acquire permanence through record in a score ; whereas , in ordinary perception , there are no values through which a type could be established . There is no standard for rose ? or chair ? experiences , it may be said . Yet , as a matter of fact , whereever there is identification , there is the thought of a type , and memory plays there precisely the recording role of a score ; and ordinary perceptions are full of the values of use and curiosity . There may be a difference of precision in the two cases , but only as a matter of degree ; and , in the case of the sharply defined types of scientific perception , the advantage is probably with the non-aesthetic . No one knows what the absolutely ideal and typical performance of the symphony is ; so , similarly , no one ever gets a complete perception of a thing , ever comes into real or , through representation , into vicarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses allow us to get into touch with or our imagination to picture is only a fragment . Nevertheless , in our dealings with common things we have pretty definite ideas of some of the possibilities of human experience , and the man of science has ideas of the highest precision ; such ideas represent the types of things . The elaboration of these ideas , in order to make them more adequate to the possibilities of human experience , is exactly the task of natural science . // The extent to which perception is more than the mere possession in the mind of parts of existing things , and contains representative elements , is plain when we consider how large a part is played by memory and expectation . When I perceive an electric light I inevitably think of lighting it ? that is , I represent a non-existent future action upon it and the sensations which would result ; if I am an electrician , I may think of the manufacture of it , that is , of its non-existent past history . Such memories and expectations enter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always extends beyond the present , back into the past and forward into the future . The type of things is a complex of true propositions about their present , past and future being . The metaphysical status of these types will be the topic of a future chapter ; it is necessary at this point only to call attention to the large share which they have in the object of perception . The object of perception is never so much the actual physical thing as the truth about the thing . The recognition of the importance of the type in perception has given rise to the idea that perception is largely a falsification of the reality of things ? a view maintained by a thinker whose doctrine of perception is very much like our own . But this is a misrepresentation of the situation . It is , indeed , true that the type is no part of the sensuous reality of things . It is also true that our representations of the type are largely determined by practical motives . We represent of the total truth about things only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partiality of our representations , the human limitations of them , do not make them // necessarily deceitful . It is , of course , easy to mistake the part for the whole , especially where our human conceits are concerned ; but the intent of partial knowledge is not to take itself for omniscience . It is also true that a large part of scientific knowledge is expressed in purely symbolic terms or in the form of mechanical images to which no sensuous reality literally corresponds . But it is always possible to translate these symbols into the sensuous experience which is the real object represented . The unwary , it must be admitted , are often led astray into thinking that the symbols picture real objects ; but once this error is corrected , the genuine metaphysical truth embodied in scientific formulas and concepts becomes patent . The theory of things which we have been advocating requires the abandonment of the common sense notion of their unity . This notion has been developed by a process of exclusion and simplification , with the method of which we have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rejected because they are practically irrelevant , leaving a relatively simple remainder more easily handled by the mind . But , as we have seen , the thing owns all of its aspects , every shape , color , size or other quality that can be perceived . All the supposed conflicts among them disappear as soon as we abandon the notion of the superior reality of some over the others . They are all on the same level , all parts of the thing , falling easily within its wide domain . But if the thing is so hospitable and inclusive , in what sense is it one at all ? Ten people in the room who look at the electric light globe have in mind ten different complexes // of visual sensations ; how then can they belong to the one object ? The essential unity is that of causality . A single act or process will make them all disappear or reappear . To be sure , one of them may disappear without affecting the existence of the others , as when , for example , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore my globe , nor will open eyes in themselves guarantee the existence of the other nine globes . The existence of any sensation depends upon two sets of conditions ? one within the body , another outside of the body . The former set is a prerequisite for the existence of the sensation in the single mind ; the latter is a co-operating cause of all the sensations in the different minds which we attribute to one thing . That there is a single determinant without the body for all the ten complexes of globe sensations is clear from the simultaneity and inclusiveness of its effect ? all at once and together the sensations will disappear if some person breaks the bulb . A thing , therefore , consists of all sensations under the control of a single determinant outside of the body . Or to put the matter the other way round ? sensations belong to one thing when they are all under a single extra-bodily control . There are , of course , certain sensations , such as nausea or those which come from the joints , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sensations , but , on the contrary , to be determined from within the body alone . Yet careful investigation would prove that even in such cases there is a twofold control , only by different determinants within the one region of the body . // In talking about the determination of sensations we are readily led beyond the bounds of the given . Sensations are given , but the nature of that which determines them outside of the body is certainly not given . Given , as we have said , are only the sensations . Yet , that they are not controlled wholly from within , is certainly given ; it is only the what or nature of this control which is not given . Solely by means of hypotheses can we get any idea of this . And the natural hypothesis to make is the one which has been made so often , and which we shall defend later on , that the control is like that which we ourselves exert . For , as we have seen , we do , to a certain extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy sensations ; I can close my eyes and annihilate a whole group of them ; I can take bow and violin and create another group . In the latter case I determine sensations not only within my own mind , but in the minds of others as well . Of course , in neither case am I the sole determinant of what happens ; foreign controls must co-operate . But now , the hypothesis is precisely this , that the nature of the co-operant foreign controls is like that which I exert within my own mind , and to a certain extent within the minds of other men . It is some purpose or interest which determines the closure of the eyes and the annihilation of the visual sensations ; it is some purpose or interest which determines the existence of the musical sounds . And hence we suppose that , in addition to our own activities , co-operating with , or frustrating , or acting independently of them , there are other activities , not ours , playing with and determining the sensations in our minds . // Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may make music or paint pictures for ourselves , so ? shall I say nature ? ? sings for itself and for us , too , in the sound of the brook , and paints pictures for itself and for us in every landscape that we see . Does nature contain any other sensations than those which are produced through the activities of the body in co-operation with foreign controls ? Of course , by the nature of the case , none other than these can come within the mind . Yet there are good reasons , I believe , for thinking that there are others . The sense organs , through which the sensations that we know are determined , are special differentiations of a material of like nature with themselves . There is good reason , therefore , for supposing that they mediate only part of the total number of sensations produced in connection with the body . Moreover , the law of continuity forbids us from believing that our sense life is a sudden development , that it has had no history in the evolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of life which possess no organs of special sense , we must ascribe the same to the whole body . And the same principle of continuity forbids us from stopping here . The organism is itself an outgrowth of what we call the inorganic world ; and consists of exactly the same materials . Hence , just as we infer from the existence of the bodies of our fellow men and of animals to the existence of their sensations , so , it seems to me , we can infer to the existence of further sensations in nature from those whichwe actually perceive . In both cases we infer from the existence of sensations which we perceive to the existence // of those which we do not perceive . From the existence of an eye ? a group of sensations in my own mind ? I infer the existence of visual sensations in the mind of my fellow . Nothing else of his eye is given to me or real for me except my own sensations . Well , similarly , I have given countless other sensations ? the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , I think I can infer others . Only the tiniest part of the sense world is , I believe , given to us in perception . What the rest is like , we , to be sure , can not know . Yet we are justified , I think , in judging the whole by the part . The visual sensations which enter into the mind depend , of course , upon the eye ; yet I can not help thinking that when the man of science talks about light he means something more than a symbol for possible human sensations ? that his vibrations in the aether correspond with actual sensations like our own . Nature is , I think , full of warmth and cold , pressures and touches and colors unperceived by man , and doubtless full also of countless other sensations of a kind unlike anything which we know . The hospitality which we ascribe to the thing destroys its reputed seclusion and involves a complexity and nrgighborliness undreamed of by common sense . Since a thing owns every aspect equally , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief grounds upon which common sense accords to it a simple and separate existence . The sun , for example , is not only where science locates it , but also in the intervening space , and at the point where I see it ? at the eye . One may , of course , distinguish what is called the real sun from these visual phenomena ; but , how70 THE SELF AND NATURE ever useful this procedure may be practically , it can not be done without question metaphysically . On the other hand , in view of the actual solidarity of things , one may refuse to distinguish between one thing and another . There is , it may be said , only a single thing , the universe ; what are called separate things are only parts of this , isolated by us for reasons chiefly practical . And there is truth in this view , which science , and not metaphysics , has been teaching us for the last century . There is a mutual dependence of sense qualities making of the physical world a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for distinguishing between one part and another . There is a differential distribution of qualities ; here it is hot , there cold ; here a sweet odor , there a sour ; red and blue are not on the same , but on different points . Such regional differences in the distribution of sensations are real . Moreover , there is greater solidarity between the causal determination of certain parts than of others . There is a greater solidarity between the elements of one organic body , for example , than between those of two ; a change is more immediately and pervasively effective within the single body than between the two . This objective unification of things is the basis of the subjective unification of them through the purposes which they serve . The difference between things is a difference in the qualitative pattern and causal interdependence of the elements of the whole . In accordance with its own harmonic laws , the universe composes sense elements in multitudinous figures . Doubtless , there is a basal and pervasive rhythm ; yet , just as we rightly distinguish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are justified in distinguishing the many parts of the one whole . In our chapter on space we shall study again , for a final statement , the individuality and unity of things . The doctrine of this chapter should recommend itself not only to the reason , but to the emotions . For what is the thing which you love and cherish ? It is not a heap of ions which you have never seen ; it is no bit of extension robbed of color and odor ; it is not even some possessor of soul-life too simple for sympathy with your human affections . It is the phenomenal thing which you love ; the possessor of color and outline and odor ; the appearing thing which you can see and touch and smell . The familiar haunt that you love is not some practical or scientific reality behind that which has given itself to your eye and hand , but the thousand views and perspectives with their every shadow and change of hue . These you love ; these you find fair . The dramatic background of our human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in painting and poem and history , is the given thing , the so-called appearance ? which is the reality . And if , as in common sense , you admit the validity of the practical motives in determining the criterion of reality , why should you not admit to at least an equal right the interests of affection and beauty ? CHAPTER IV THE RELATION BETWEEN MIND AND BODY IN our last chapter we studied the relation of the self to the external world given in perception . Another , and to most minds , more striking relation is that of the self to the body . That we should find ourselves in the midst of a bright and sounding and odorous reality , immersed in it , gathering from it satisfaction and sorrow , becomes strange to the reflective thought of certain moods , but stranger still seems the fact that the presence of the self in the world should be conditioned by one small fact in that world ? the body . Let us approach the problem through an examination of the oldest theory in the field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumental theory . According to this theory , the body is the tool of the mind . In sawing wood , I make use of a saw ? and of arm and hand ; the latter , from the point of view of the realization of my purpose , are as much pure instrument as the former . Or in the manufacture of anything , when one 's interest is fixed upon the material and the purpose to be achieved through it , the body which manipulates seems like any tool which one might employ . Again , in all desire , which involves the separation of the idea of the end from the fact desired , the body may easily be regarded as just the first link in a chain of means and instruments intervening . Not only the muscular apparatus , but the sense organs also appear to be 7a // interpretable in this way : if I have the desire to hear or see something , eye and ear look like mere means to the end of these experiences . Finally , in the realms of memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body and of sensation ; yet when I desire contact with the sense world , the body is there for this end ; just as the musician , tiring of the music which he hears in his dreams , may employ a lyre upon which to execute heard melodies . Yet if this be the relation of the body to the self , the query is inevitable ? why is the body necessary at all ? If the soul can manipulate the body to its ends , why can not it make use of things with equal directness and without the intervention of the body ? This question arises not only in the minds of objectors to the theory , but in the minds of its advocates also . The body seems to be a pure superfluity . The possibility of a naked action upon matter and an existence independent of the body haunts them in their dreams . And so this conception , instead of making the relationship more perspicuous , excites a new wonder . An indispensable tool would seem to be something more than a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be duplicated . A tool which another can not use is again a unique instrument . Why , we ask , is this particular soul tied to this particular body on pain of inefficacy ? For many of our purposes the body of another would be a fitter instrument than our own , why , then , if it be a mere tool , can we not use it ? And , last , a tool is something which the user makes ; but no man has made his body . The individual is endowed at birth with structures preformed for the exercise of func74 THE SELF AND NATURE tion . As the function is exercised these structures develop , the development being correlated with the refinement of the former . But never does the function manufacture its organs . Only recently are we beginning to understand the mechanism of the body ; yet with all our knowledge we are incapable of constructing its simplest forms . It is absurd , therefore , to suppose that , previous to the acquirement of this knowledge , previous even to birth , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul has built up the body , the soul must be a larger and wiser being than the man whom we know . And by the soul as a builder is usually meant such a wiser force . This force , we are told , constructs the body for the use of its offspring , responding always to the latter 's needs . Hence , the individual , as we know him , always has instruments ready at his service . We sometimes find , already constructed by another , just the tool that we require . The relation between soul and body may be an instance of this . Yet this proffered solution of the difficulty only pushes it back in time , but does not solve it . We now put the query to the constructive soul ? why have you tied your creature to his instrument ? If you yourself could act directly upon matter , why can not he ? A part of the difficulty may be removed by admitting the large sensuous element in the soul 's life . After all , the primal interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , and the fundamental values are immediately realized through the activities of the body , not in things lying without the body The activity of eating is the animal 's original good , not the preparation of food ; the satisfaction of sexual craving , not . // the courting of the female . The animal first moves in order to move rather than to attain anything through moving . It does not eat in order to live , generate in order to perpetuate , move in order to appropriate ; but eats , loves and moves , for eating , loving and moving . The original locus of all interests is the body ; the interest in external things is derivative , being transferred from the body . That which co-operates in bodily satisfaction acquires irradiated values ; because in order to eat I must have food , and in order to love I must have an object , these latter become radiant ; they have no value in themselves , but only through needs , which are bodily . It is not strange that the energies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeding and finding a mate for its body , since the body 's activities are the direct source of most of its satisfactions . Hence , to the question why the soul is tied to the body , one might answer , because its interests are primarily in the body . And by body we mean , of course , not the hypothetical system of atoms constructed by the scientists , but the sensuous reality given in our experience . Just as different instruments are assigned to different people in an orchestra in order that they may make music of various colors , so particular bodies are given to souls in order that they may realize the values potential to their activities . The constructive soul , we may suppose , makes the body in order that the individual man or woman may use it to obtain the unique satisfactions which it affords . Even viewed from this angle , the instrumental theory is not free from difficulties ; for this one at least remains , that // in order for a thing to be given as a tool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pre-exist to the acts of its body . The interests which are attached there can not exist separately . There can be , for example , no satisfaction in movement unless there is movement , and no desire to move unless there is a commencing motion ; and the self can have no idea of these experiences ? and a fortiori no desire for them ? before it has possessed them . So far , therefore , as the corporeal interests of the soul are concerned , it would seem to be misleading to think of the latter as a musician playing upon the body as an instrument ; because , once more , the soul does not exist at all until the body is set into action . The player can exist without his instrument ; but the soul does not exist without the body . In a larger sense , however , it is not true that the musician exists apart from his instrument . Take from him his violin or his piano and his musicianly self is gone . The playing of the instrument is himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the workman puts away his tools , he leaves behind a part of himself ; we do not see this so clearly in the case of the artisan as we do in the case of the artist , because more of the man 's self is in the latter 's work than in the former 's . It is not true , moreover , that in all cases one instrument is as good as another , for neither the materials nor the tools of the artist can be exchanged . In so far , therefore , as each self is unique , its body , as the instrument of its activities , must also be unique . The use of this tool is the man ? without it , he is not . Hence , only in the larger sense of medium of expression is the body a tool of the self . // The difficulty in the way of accepting this last view , so close to unprejudiced habits of thinking among the people , arises from the artificial , " scientific " conception of the body . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a swarm of atoms imaginable only by the most attenuated thought must always remain a mystery ; but when we come to recognize that the body is what we find it in our experience ? a sensuous congeries , warm and hot , straining and relaxing , moving and reposing , this strangeness disappears ; it is then no longer wonderful that the self should be bound to that in which it is chiefly interested . For example , the movement sensations of the dancer are elements of her very body 's motions ; it would be absurd , therefore , to consider her limbs as mere external instruments of the dancing experience , when they are not something other than it , but a part of it , the rest being the values in dancing , which certainly could not exist previous to the dancing . The instrumental theory , as ordinarily conceived , is thus inadequate to the facts of the lower soul-life , and could never have grown out of reflection upon them . For there the soul is so immersed in the body that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , that spiritualistic philosophers from Plato downward have sought to minimize or reject this part of the soul , and have founded the instrumental theory on the consideration of the higher soul-life of memory , imagination and thought . The roots of the theory in this region might profitably be traced from Plato through Plotinus to Bergson in our own time . In the view of all these thinkers the higher soul-life is essentially distinct from , // and independent of , the body , making use of the latter only as a tool for the purpose of acting on the sense world . With Plato , who was near enough to common modes of thinking to perceive the necessary connection of the lower soul-life with the body , the theory was a part of that dualism between the lower nature and the higher which persists among all his intellectual children . It is in the higher region , therefore , that the final test of the theory must be made . Let us , then , proceed to study it there , confining our attention for the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based . On the way to the higher soul-life stands the image . The image is obviously the basis or material of all imagination , thought , purpose , and sentiment . The image has a double relation : on the one hand , to the sensation of which it is a derivative , and on the other , to the brain on which it is somehow dependent . If considered with reference to either one of these alone , it is incomprehensible . The image is obviously a duplicate of sensation . In the image the sense world is mirrored . But the replica is no exact copy . The differences between the two are commonplaces of observation ; what is important for us is the secondary character of the image in relation to sensation , which is plain alike from the differences and the resemblances between them . There is nothing in the image which is not in the sensation ; there are , of course , combinations of images to which nothing in the sense world corresponds ; but there are no such elementary images . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has preceded , there is no image . // Invention is no exception ; for the elements of a plan are based on sensations antecedent both to the plan and to the thing constructed in accordance with it . The image is also dependent in a third respect , evident at once in the plan and in memory ? it demands fulfillment in sensation . It is the intention of the image to lead into a sensation of like quality or to offer itself as a substitute , confessedly poor , of a sen-sation ; the latter being the case with memory , the former with volition . The memorial image has value only in the absence of sensation , the plan or expectation only until realization . But the whole sense world is not imaged . Only so much as is perceived , and even not all of that , is mirrored . Now in the process of mirroring the brain is somehow concerned . This is the strange thing . The dependence upon sensation is easily comprehensible ? we can understand how the reflec-tion presupposes the object reflected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts are these : The brain medi-ates integral reactions of the organism to the sense world ; these reactions with the values attendant upon them are thus brought into contact with the sense elements ; such elements are said to be perceived . Nervous processes which have once mediated the perception of a sense element may , when stimulated to like activity in the absence of the sense element , be accompanied by an image of that element . Now the instrumentalist claims to have an explanation of these facts . To the question why the image , which is ad-mittedly heterogeneous with the brain , should be dependent upon the latter , he answers , Because it is the purpose of the // image , as we have just seen , to lead back to sensation , and to this end the body is useful . Volition is the clearest case of this . The plan , an imaginal structure , demands fulfillment in a sensuous reality , and in order to complete itself therein makes use of the motor mechanism of the brain . The brain is a motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense world . From the fact that the brain is only an instrument for the realization of ideas , it is inferred that they must be capable of existence independent of it . The user is not dependent for his existence upon the tool . This , as we saw in the discussion of the lower soul-life , is the premiss of the instrumental theory . The case of Bergson is typical . The idea , he asserts , has a double mode , on the one hand speculative ? " pure memory " ? which exists independent of the brain ; on the other hand practical , anticipating and leading into action , and dependent on the brain for just this realization . The practical character of the image is the key , Bergson asserts , to the relation between mind and brain . There are obviously two points to be considered here : the , alleged independent existence of the image and the purely practical relation to the brain . Let us study the former first . A man who tries to find his way out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his way in . One place recognized suggests another in its vicinity , and by following these suggestions , that is , by ordering his conduct in accordance with these images , he succeeds in his effort . If the search for the way out is difficult and the situation anxious , his mind will be entirely filled by the images ? no other // memories will be present . Here is a typical example at once of the apparently instrumental character of the relation between image and body ? for the image seems to guide the body much as a hand might guide a tool ? and of the practical character of the image itself . Let us study this example in terms of our problem . In the first place , the suggested images which guide our huntsman 's steps seem to be brought into existence by the associative process , which at every point is controlled by the immediate practical purpose involving the body . No one would deny , I suppose , that their emergence into the mind depends on the purpose in hand . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they did not pre-exist and are not simply selected for use at this particular vital juncture ? Well , first of all , there is no evidence of their previous existence . Some of the images , the simulacra of objects seen for the first time , will be new to the man 's mind ; they will appear on its surface with the freshness and uniqueness of a new ripple on water ; hence their power of existing apart from this mental context can not be tested . On the other hand , some of the images will be old ones ; they will be familiar ; and by reappearing will show themselves capable of a certain independence of special mental structure . Yet how could one prove that they continued to exist between the old and the new appearances ? Only by the actual discovery of them during this interval . But plainly the man himself could not discover them . And no one of his friends could . For , although another man might have images of the same objects , he could not have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have a common reference to identical objects ; but they are not themselves common . Yet one might grant the individuality of imagery and still maintain its existence independent of its appearance in the mind . Every experience of an object may result in the creation of an image of it which exists independent of any mind , yet accessible to one mind only ; each person thus possessing a storehouse of images into which he and he only can enter . The individual brain would be just a key , as it were , to unlock this chamber ; but would not in any way be capable of creating it ? just as the senses do not create the sense world , yet give access to it . Yet a simple reflection suffices to show the ineptitude of this supposition . It is enough to examine the image itself to discover that it has no status independent of the mind . The image is part of an intention ; it possesses a function ? reference to an object ; this intention is a mental act . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It serves , as we saw , either to lead into a sensation ? volition ? or to substitute itself for one ? knowledge . But both knowledge and action are functions of the self . But does the functional character of images and the consequent dependence on mind prove dependence on the body ? I think so . The instrumentalists admit this for the practical side of the higher soul-life . Since the use of images in action depends on the body , and since , as we have seen , they have no existence apart from this use , their dependence on the body is made out . The body in its relation to the environment sets every practical problem . We have // already shown how the interests are bound up with the body . And the practically available imagery is determined through these interests . Take the illustration of the huntsman in the woods . His interest in feeding his body determined him to enter the woods ; and the practical problem of getting out was determined by the presence of his body there . This presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the problem of getting out , the images of the route back were suggested . Now each one of these images is either of a useful movement or of an object towards which it would be useful to move . Hence , their relation to the brain is clear : they are accompaniments of brain processes which either set up useful movements or tend to do so . The intent of every practical image is to place the body in a more favorable relation to the environment . In fine , the body does not exist for the sake of the image ; rather , conversely , the image exists for the sake of the body . Similar to the instrumental theory of the relation of the image and the brain is so-called interactionism , the passing examination of which , will , I think , throw light on our problem . According to interactionism , the image depends upon the body for its existence , yet , once it is there , intercalates itself between stimulation and reaction , guides the latter , and so has the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teleological reactions of the organism , in particular , are causally dependent on the functional image . The interactionist no more thinks of the image as being independent of the body than we do . In this he differs radically from the Platonic instrumentalist . He simply claims for the image // the same sort of efficacy as is possessed by any organ , say by the stomach or eye , which are produced by the organism as a whole , and are incapable of existing separate from it , yet , as constituent parts , enter into its causal economy . The functional image is responsible , it is claimed , for two characteristics of conscious behaviour : the association of old reactions to new stimuli either contiguous or similar to the old ( learning ) , and the combination of old reactions into new ones ( invention ) , always in the direction of dominion over the environment to the end of self-preservation . No mere machine could exhibit behaviour of this kind , it is claimed . The examination of experience seems to confirm this view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end precedes and seems to determine the activities of the body . The idea of the point to be reached , for example , precedes the steps of the huntsman at each part of his journey , and his steps are taken in accordance with it . Yet , interactionism can not be established on the basis of these arguments . The impossibility of explaining the behaviour of the conscious organism on mechanical principles does not prove that consciousness intervenes as a cause . It proves only that the living and conscious body possesses the capacity for acting in a fashion other than mechanical . The limits of this capacity can not be established a priori . The sufficiency of the mechanical principles for the description of nature is a hypothesis which is highly probable in the inorganic world , but so far not established in other fields . And the apparent intervention of the image between stimuTHE // lation and reaction is not proved . Indeed , if we take into account not merely the gross acts of the body , but all the preparatory phenomena , the idea appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body is already beginning to undertake , and of the end to which it is even now tending , than a precedent and separate fact . That ideas are not transitively causal in their relation to the body , as the interactionist maintains , can , I think , be made plausible by the following argument . It will probably be granted that if we can prove this for ideas in their purposive function , we can do so for all ideas . Every purpose is a formulated desire , one that has become aware of the object which would satisfy it . This awareness of its object distinguishes desire from simple impulse or instinct , but does not itself constitute desire ; for the mere knowledge of an object does not make it desirable . Hence , more accurately , purpose is impulse upon which has been engrafted , in its service , an idea . Let us now study each of these elements of purpose and ask ourselves whether or not their relations to the body are transitively causal . This is certainly not true of the idea taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal to be attained and possesses proleptically the experience which will give satisfaction ; but , of itself , it can not create that object or bring to pass that experience . And a mere knowledge of an object certainly can not move and direct a brain and muscular apparatus to any action . The knowing idea , if taken in abstraction , is representative of its object , not dynamic to the brain , of which it is completely ignorant . But now , if we consider the // other factor in purpose , impulse , we find that in itself it , too , is not dynamically related either to the thing desired or to the body . For , instead of standing over against the body and then impelling or dragging it to action , desire presupposes a definite state of the body in order to exist . The impulse for food , for example , is the expression of hunger ? but what is hunger except a certain state of the body ? Would hunger be possible without a body ? Any one who answers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory that the body is a heap of atoms inaccessible to direct experience . But as soon as it is recognized that our experience of the body is the body , it becomes as absurd to think of hunger without a digestive organ as of motion without a thing which moves . The interaction theory sins in the same way as the instrumental theory ? in thinking that desire can exist without the organs of which it is an expression . Hunger can not react with the body , for it possesses no substantial reality apart from the body . It arises as a phase of certain bodily conditions , varies with them , and necessarily ceases with them . It is an expression or aspect of them , not a cause of them . Let it not be supposed that we here fall into contradiction with ourselves ; that , in order to refute the supposition that the soul could exist apart from the body , we urged the functional character of ideas ; whereas now , in order to refute the interaction theory , we assert that ideas do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional character of ideas ; we are rather assigning to them their proper function . The idea is functional only when penetrated by a // desire ; it represents those objects which would satisfy desire ; but desire is itself a function of the body . The idea , therefore , expresses the body 's action just as desire does , and so does not stand over against the body interacting with it . Yet the idea is not functionless simply because it does not enter into causal relations with the body ; for by representing the objects which would satisfy desire , it affords premonitory delights , and , in the truest sense , enlightens behaviour . And it is also not ineffective ; for the desiring , planning body is the integral fact which stands in causal relations with the other facts in the world . The idea is , indeed , effective , but only through its organ of expression , the body . A person who rejects interactionism is usually found to uphold the theory called parallelism . But parallelism is , I think , equally unsatisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mere passive accompaniment of the body 's action , totally ineffective . But every one knows at first hand that this is not true . Its plausibility rests wholly on the materialistic reconstruction of experience , the artificiality and baselessness of which we have already referred to . Of course , once you conceive of the body as a system of atoms , it becomes impossible to understand how the mind can control it . On the other hand , just as soon as you recognize that the body is what it is found to be , all the objections to the control of the body through ideas fall away , and the testimony of experience forces acceptance . It might , however , still be urged that even from the standpoint of our own theory of the physical world , ideas and // their bodily expression are too dissimilar to allow of the kind of unity which we suppose to exist between them . For could there be anything empirically more heterogeneous than an idea and the cell-bodies , neurones and dendrites of the brain ? But two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , that even these are sensations , are just the visual phenomena which we discover them to be , and second , that they are not the immediate means of expression for the idea , but rather facts in the mind of the observer , connected indeed with the action of the ideas in question , but only indirectly through the body of the observer and the intervening physical world . The direct medium for the expression of ideas is the body which adjoins the experience of which they are a part ; the rest are indirect expressions . And , of course , we are far from maintaining that a purposive idea and its medium of expression are identical ? there is no identity anywhere between a function and its medium ; we claim only that they are here , as elsewhere , on the one plane of experiential reality . Our disproof of the ordinary instrumental theory and proof of what we may call the expression theory will remain incomplete until we consider the most exalted of the soul 's activities , the purely cognitive . Even Aristotle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we have recalled , Bergson believes that " pure memory " exists independent of the body . The basis for independence is the asserted non-practicality of these functions . The body exists for the sake of adjustment to and dominion over the environment ; hence , to use Bergson 's case , a mental funcTHE // tion like reverie , during which the individual surveys his past , not with the purpose of learning a lesson for the future , but just to get a vision once more of deeds once lived , can have no need of the body ; such an act , being purely theoretical or aesthetic , involves , it is said , no adjustment and results in no practical mastery . Even as the past itself is removed from our action , so a vision of the past , when entered upon simply for its lingering charm and interest , has no practical reference . Along with the denial of the dependence of such mental acts on the body , Bergson asserts their existence independent of consciousness . A man 's whole past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small number come at any moment into the light of consciousness ; and those that do appear there are for the most part invoked because of their utility ; they use the brain as an instrument ? they can not act without it ; the rest have no brain correlatives ? they are inactive . We have already said something against the existence of images independent of consciousness ; yet that might be considered insufficient , since no reference to explicitly nonpractical images was made . But the same arguments apply generally . The image always appears in the mind impregnated with an act ; it is always the vehicle of a meaning and the embodiment of a feeling . Apart from its representative function and emotional significance , it has no standing in reality . As we have shown , an image does not stand on its own feet as a sense element does ; it is always retrospective of or transitive to something else . Even in free imagination the image is there to picture a fictitious sensuous reality . And // in memory the image represents the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer itself . A cognitive activity is no less functional , no less active , than a practical one . Hence , the supposition that an act can exist apart from consciousness is meaningless ; for consciousness is nothing except acts and the sense elements with which they are in contact . And to suppose that some acts , the memories , can be split off from the rest is like supposing that one could cut off a limb and keep it alive . Bergson makes the mistake of conceiving memory as a passive review of objects , when , as a matter of fact , it is a living development of one activity out of another . There is nothing more intimate than memory , nothing that penetrates so far into the soil of feeling and striving . Every vision of the past , no matter how seemingly static and purely pictorial , is born of some mood or desire . The same organic relation to the self which we have claimed for memory is true also for thought , even in its most speculative and apparently non-practical reaches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one 's thinking , and by memory a reality independent of any one 's remembering , can be maintained with some plausibility , but that the thinking and remembering of the individual man is not his , not an inseparable part of the self , can not be supported by any arguments . Thinking is an activity ; it fulfills a striving and is itself a meaning even when divorced from practical motives fixed by the body 's relation to the environment . There is no thinking without the purpose , the will to think . But the activities are identical with their being lived , with the consciousness of them ; THE RELATION BETWEEN MIND AND BODY qI there is , as we have argued at length , no difference between an act and the consciousness of an act . And to suppose that activities could be split off from the rest of what at any moment we know as the self is , we repeat , to ignore the living integrity of the self and the interwovenness of its acts ? their relativity to their cues and occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occult unity for the self ? merely that which is possessed by any highly organized animal body . We do not deny the non-practical character of much memory and thought . The mind , like the body , in large part ? certainly in by far the largest part ? is developed with reference to the external world in order to dominate it ; yet there are internal relations of part to part within the organism , and even developments of single parts which only remotely have this reference . The mind , like the organism , is a little world by itself , and so , to a certain extent , ruled by its own laws and possessed of an independent career . Yet we claim that , except in the pathological conditions of dissociation , perhaps , the various acts of the self are so interdependent that they can not exist separate from their world . It might seem , however , that even if we have proved the impossibility of the existence of the higher acts beyond consciousness , we have not proved their dependence on the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul-life on the body follows from what we have already established . We have shown that the lower soul-life is dependent upon the body because it expresses the body , and the practical life of ideas because they serve the body . // Now no one would deny the close relation between the higher soul-life and the lower . Both arc parts of the one mind . Hence , whatever affects the lower part of the soul in its connection with the body affects the higher , and nothing can happen in the higher without affecting the lower and so coming into relation with the body . Yet a doubt may still remain ; for might not this relation be expressed by some sort of interaction theory ? Might not the lower soul-life in its attachment to the body be connected causally with the higher , although the latter had no physical expression ? Thus the soul would have an extension , an upper story , as it were , raised above the physical world , yet connected with it through the lower foundation upon which it rests . Influences would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the motor organism for the expression and record of itself ; and disturbances arising from the lower soul would propagate themselves higher . Yet the intellect itself would be free of the body . The interpenetration of the parts of the soul forbids , however , such an interpretation . The speculative and the practical are only two directions of a single function , and the bodily contacts which make the latter possible are not broken , but only less active in the case of the former . Every idea , as we have shown , is the reflex of a sense experience , essentially corporeal in its origin , the expression of some bodily movement and adjustment . In its original phase , the idea exists to guide the organism back to such an experience ? the memory of some scene of vivid enjoyment leads us back to enjoy it once more . Apart from the longing // and motor tendency to return , the idea would not arise . The idea is not self-sufficient ; it demands fulfillment in a sense experience of the same type , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience is impossible . Does the idea then cease to exist ? Not necessarily . A failure to adjust the organism to the environment in any given direction need not spoil the function concerned ; it may simply be the means of turning the energy inwards . The tendency to return to the scene of our illustration will continue to exist and become active when the proper cues are provided , even when no successful issue in behaviour occurs ; and with the arousal of the motor tendency the desire and the idea which are its expression will recur : only they will now exist in a new form ; they will have become a mere memory of the scene ? a pure memory ? practically ineffective . And to this fruitless image will be attached the values which would have accrued to the reinstatement of the experience which it means ? the sunny joys of activity will be transformed into the moonlit delights of contemplation . And so the speculative grows out of the practical : we build in the imagination that desired thing which we shave failed to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the speculative can not free itself from the bodily attachment which is clearly necessary to the life of the former . The original total thing is the plan with the motor aspect ; now the plan can not be transformed into the speculative idea , since the whole thing is a unit , without a transformation of the bodily aspect of the whole ; least of all can the plan free itself from the body . The continued de94 THE SELF AND NATURE pendence of ideas on the body is evident once we reflect that ideas become speculative because of events and circumstances in which the body plays the deciding role . Every idea has originally a practical intent ; the purely speculative idea is an aborted plan ; but all practical failure is due to the body in its relation to the physical world . Not only are the higher activities a development of the lower and practical and so bound to maintain the connection with the body possessed by the latter ; they are always implicated in the latter . The higher soul-life is no separable phase or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , even when soaring highest , keeps its roots in the lower . Consider beauty and affection . A purely non-corporeal affection is an abstraction , not a concrete reality ; torn from its sensuous root , it withers and dies ; this is true , not only of passionate love , but of quiet friendship , which also requires bodily presence and the interchange of word and act . The aesthetic interests , despite all their spirituality , depend flagrantly upon the interfusion of subtle organic values ; it is the balance between spirit and sense which gives them their pre-eminence , the clear and equal participation of body with feeling and thought . Finally , there is no purely speculative activity . Every philosophy expresses the emotional and striving life of the philosopher ; even when standing in apparent contradiction with his ostensible acts , it is in secret agreement with some part of his nature which virtue or fear or circumstance has kept him from living out ? the radical thought of the conventional man has another ground than pure reason . And if we take practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has refer-ence to effectiveness beyond the individual mind , then all soul-life is practical . There is no idea or emotion , however attenuated , which does not crave expression , communication , a career in the wider world of the fellow mind . But expres-sion and communication involve the body . And thought and feeling do not first exist and then use the body as an instrument for expression ; for an activity and its expression are one fact . Thought does not begin to be without some incipient expression . And it is not the fancies and thoughts of the man of genius alone that crave expression ; there is no vision of the past held by any common man , and no one of his dreams , that does not yearn for relation , and , in devious ways , affect his conduct . Thus the dependence of the mind on the body has been shown to be complete . ' The body is the soul 's expression , its indispensable tool , without which it is not . CHAPTER V TIME EVERY phase of reality which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , the external world , is pervaded by change . Being so fundamental a property of existence , change is naturally thought to be simple and unanalyzable . Yet an attentive examination reveals three indispensable aspects . Change involves , first , the coming in , rise or emergence into existence of something new , something which was not before . Every alb eration or development is an illustration : a body moves into a new point ; an organism passes into a stage which was hitherto not its own . Although perfectly clear as a mark of direct experience , this is often only grudgingly recognized . People try to minimize it by seeking to break the new into smaller and ever smaller increments , even into an infinite multitude of them , yet the fact of increment remains ? creative steps are made . Plainly the new which comes to be does not rise into a void , but into a space already there , into a world already old . Here is the second moment of change ? the persistence of a core of reality upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing thing is usually called " the thing which " changes . In the self we have the most direct knowledge of the combination of new and old , of identity and diversity , essential to change ; for there , as we have seen , 96 // new sensations and new images , new interests and new emotions , are developed out of , and woven into , purposes and attitudes that endure . Third and last , change involves disappearance from existence , disintegration , loss . If we did not know this independently , we could deduce it from the moments of change already cited . For the new , by breaking in upon the old situation and giving to it a new element , necessarily destroys it . When c enters , the old whole a+b passes away ; for it has become a+b+c , and its several elements have changed in adjusting themselves to the intruder . But the devastating effect of change is not confined to the destruction of old totalities ; for the very elements of the old may pass away . The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought which I now entertain may leave my mind ; the man may die . This aspect of loss in change is as absolute and indefeasible as any other . You may seek to minimize it by reducing it to small steps , just as you did with growth , but you can not eliminate it ; however small or gradual , even if infinitesimal , it nevertheless remains . Yet loss , like novelty , never covers the entire field ; loss is always a loss from something ; passing is always from a permanent . And just as creation involves destruction , so destruction involves creation ; for every whole , in losing an element , thereby becomes a new one . The three moments of process are present together in every individual of the world ; yet in varying degrees . In some individuals , creation is especially intense ; in others , rest ; in still others , loss . By reason of this , the elements of reality acquire an order , the so-called time-form . In the // song ? to use the familiar example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , another which lingers , a third which is dying away . The direction of this order is towards the individuals where there is most creation of the new and away from those which are passing . The new comes before the old , the old before the dying ; the novel enters , becomes familiar , and then is lost . The fact of coming and going differentiates the time-form from every other structure , making it unique and irreducible . In a static series , like that of the letters on this page , there is also variety and unity , but there is not novelty and losing . There , each element has a distinct and unique place , but all places are filled , and there is no passing of one and rise of another ; here , elements enter into places left vacant by others , the newcomers crowding out the old . In the eternal and static , all things can conceivably be known together ; in time , acquaintance must proceed from one to another ? a thing must enter a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one whole of elements , permanent , rising and perishing , may seem to raise a problem . For if they are all co-present , they must co-exist ; hence , at any least moment , it may be said , they must either be all static and changeless , the ultimate constituents of the rising and perishing elements being on a level with the rest ; or else , in the whole which they form , existence and co-existence , two contradictories , must be peacefully united , the transient elements keeping their unique character . Yet neither of these alternatives is possible ; for , on the one hand , change // can not be made out of a succession of static states , and , on the other , two contradictories can not be united in any given thing . We have a direct intuition at once of change and of the certainty of the principle of contradiction . This difficulty arises from a poverty of categories . We must distinguish rising and perishing from non-existence ; we must recognize that existence has three temporal forms : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dying is not the dead , the absolutely non-existent . Existence and non-existence can no more cohere than any two other contradictories can ; yet in the same thing , in the same least moment of reality , creation and decay are present together with the permanent , just as color and extension and hardness co-exist in the same physical object . Becoming and passing must be recognized as ultimate categories , sub-forms of the existent , on an equal footing there with the permanent . Still , it is sometimes thought that you can reduce transition ? coming to be or passing away ? to existence and non-existence as simpler and more ultimate categories . That which is coming to be , it is said , is that which both is and is not yet ; that which is passing away both is and is no longer . Thus , when a child becomes a man , it might seem that as a child , he is , and as a man , he is not ; and yet , in becoming a man , he must be both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing either is or is not . The difficulty comes from a failure in analysis . No distinction is made between an ideal thing which does not exist , yet may come to exist or have existed , and the real moments of process which alone exist . In the case of our illustration , only the tiny present
