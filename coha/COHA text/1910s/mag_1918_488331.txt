WITH some of the vagaries of our censorship the read- ers of the Nation are now familiar . I wonder how many are aware that efforts are being made to extend it to other countries . The other day the Associated Press reported the suppression in Paris of one issue of Le Populaire , the new radical Socialist daily , " at the request of General Pershing " ? for what reason no one yet knows . Almost simultaneously came the news , via Sweden and Switzerland , of the beginning of criminal proceedings against the Swedish newspaper Aften Bladet , at the request of the American Minister to Sweden . The ground of the complaint was that this newspaper had attacked President Wilson in a way to endanger , the present friendly relations between the United Statestnd Sweden . While this report must be taken with some reservation pending absolute verification , it unfortunately fits in with other developments in Sweden . We have no doubt whatever that if the American Minister has taken such action he has done it without the knowledge and consent of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childishness either at home or abroad . But there are curious things happening every hour and it is regrettable that Mr. Wilson permits the men responsible to remain in office instead of making an example of one or two conspicuous ones pour encourager les autres . - yNOTE that the policy of anonymity as to the army in I France still continues . The censor even deleted the other day the name of an army corps which apparently General Pershing himself desired printed in recognition of its admirable services . Only occasionally does the name of a general crop out in the news . This seems to be altogether absurd . We know who the German generals are against whom we fight , and they know ours . But it is safe to say that the great public in America knows the names of only four generals , Pershing , March , Bullard , and Liggett  --  the last two now lieutenant generals . So I was glad when the name of an old friend turned up as the commander of the Third American Army Corps ? John L. Hines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war began and in the short time since has risen by sheer merit to the rank of corps commander . Major Hines was on General Pershing 's staff as assistant adjutant general during the expedition into Mexico , and demonstrated his worth at that time . Accordingly General Pershing took Major Hines with him when he started for France . But Major Hines was not content with staff duties and speedily became Colonel of the Sixteenth Regulars , which is supposed to be the first regular - regiment to have landed in France  --  at least one guesses this in the absence of official information . One of its battalions was the organization which created such enthusiasm in Paris on Bastile Day , 1917 . General Hines is the best type of the modest , unassuming West Point graduate , not so brilliant as some , but hard-working , devoted , and not in the least militaristic . As a journalist I can not help wondering how in the face of an absurd censorship we are going to give men like General Hines and General Cameron and General Read and others who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled . The other day the managing editor of the Nation dropped in on me , almost in despair as he faced the prospect ofmaking up the present number , for the first time without " Andy " to keep everything straight . Thirty-odd years ago the name of Howard M. Anderson stood for five years on the rolls of the United States army . Then he came to New York , and last week he was presented with a gold watch fob in recognition of thirty-two years of faithful service in the ' Evening Post composing room , where he has always been a sturdy , outstanding figure . An old-fashioned printer , who learned his trade long before the- days of the linotype , he has carried over into these later times the finest ideals of the craft . Summer and winter , year in , year out , he has stood at the stone and made up the Nation , with an unfailing intelligence and skill , unflagging interest , unwearying readiness to take pains . To him as to no other one man has been due the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation . Often , when the dilatoriness of contributors resulted in impossible demands on the printer , he would express a sulphurously uncomplimentary opinion of " grown men " who knew no better than to create such a situation , only to add , " Well , we 'll have to do the best we can " ; and somehow the impossible always came to pass , and Tuesday night saw the forms locked and the presses running . The separation of the Nation from the Evening Post has now robbed the former of " Andy . " With him go H. J. W. Harrington , whose advertising make-up was a weekly work of art , and George M. Babbage , who in recent years has set almost the whole paper on his own machine ? The contribution of these three has been by no means limited to their technical specialty . Over and over again has each one of them called the editor 's attention to inaccurate statements of fact , infelicities of expression , sometimes even doubtful points of judgment , that had crept into the proofs . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fine printers they are ; - every Nation reader is in their debt . Of such is the strength of our country . THE DRIFTER Correspondence Army English To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sul : Some months ago an excellent fascicle for instruction , in elementary French , of the personnel of the army and navy came under my observation . I was struck by a memorandum of the publishers , regarding the pronunciation of the letter r as follows : " Just one word of caution to the would-be student concerning the author 's original , and so far entirely successful , system of phonetic pronunciation of French . It will be noticed that Madame C ? ends her phonograms of words like le , to , with the letter r . This r must be kept silent in the pronunciation . Its use is to ensure the correct value of the vowel before it , and it is not meant to be sounded , any more than we really sound the final r in words like for , or sooner . In fact it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time these latter statements seemed somewhat amusing , for in spite of an acquaintance with cultured people , in widely separated sections of the country , I was not aware that such pronunciation was the vogue , save perchance in or near Boston , certain portions of Virginia , and more or less throughout the South . Since entering active service it has been my lot to be stationed in Kansas , Louisiana , Washington , and California ; in addition . I have journeyed through Missouri , Arkansas , Texas , Arizona , New Mexico , and Oregon . In this experience I have encountered officers and men , in large numbers , from all sections of the country . A substantial proportion of the officers have been university or college bred ; and a fair sprinkling , with similar antecedents , has been noted among the enlisted personnel . The soft drawl and the careless manipulation of consonants characteristic of the South were common , and a cognate , though not identical , habits of phrasing , from men not Southern in residence and frankly without Southern ancestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher ) , catchah ( catcher ) , shawtstop ( short stop ) , moah ( more ) , haaht ( heart ) , cah ( car ) , rnotah ( motor ) , runnah ( runner ) , aviatah ( aviator ) , coah ( corps ) , heah ( hear ) , runnin , walkin , readin , flyin ( running , walking , reading , flying ) . In addition to this slovenly manipulation of r and final g , there was an alteration of vocal timbre , almost invariably confined to this group of men . This seemed to fall either into a well-defined accentuation of nasal tones , or a vocalization commonly known as " throaty , " while a third class fantastically combines the two . The result is far from pleasing , the voice ceases to maintain a. virile quality and rather decidedly partakes of feminine characteristics . I might add that these characteristics were found widely exhibited among the flying officers of the Air Service , a body of young men decidedly above the average both mentally and physically . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slovenliness that is so frankly an American characteristic . But I am inclined to raise the question , Is not such speech ( though doubtless not taught as such ) a by-product of the modern " college atmosphere " ? And is it not probable that imitation ( sincerest flattery ) has conspired to disseminate this assumed manifestation of modern " cultchah " ? This up-to-date , freakish affectation of slovenly phraseology must grieve all who cherish the use of sound English speech , who will likewise deplore the engraftment of feminine vocal mannerisms upon the virile type . NORVELLE WALLACE SHARPE Sacramento , Cal. , August 8 A Sturdy Protest To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The most important issue in the approaching election , overshadowing all other question 's , appears to me the rehabilitation of our civic liberties . Under the Federal Espionage Act and similar State laws , the free expression of opinion that used to be the foundation of our liberty no longer exists . Citizens feel intimidated and , for fear of denunciation , do not dare to express their convictions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vote for the Socialist party , the only one that stands for the repeal of those laws that have resulted in an abridgment of the freedom of speech and of the press , of the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . FRANZ BOAS Grantwood , N. J. , October 19 Smollett and the Universal History To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Thomas Seccombe in his article on Smollett , in the " Dictionary of National Biography , " is not precise in reference to Smollett 's general editorship of a Universal History . Mr. Seceombe says : " In 1758 Smollett undertook the superintendence of a voluminous Universal History , which was to be published in collaboration . One of his assistants was the veteran , Dr. John Campbell , whose books ' no man can number . ' The work of the lesser members of the confederation required much polishing , and Smollett felt the drudgery keenly . He himself wrote the portions relating to France , Italy , and Germany . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1766 cf. Nation , September 9 , 1915 . But it appears that Dr. Smollett had a hand in this work , to which it is known that Dr. Campbell contributed . In a letter to Richard Smith , of Burlington , N. J. ( printed from the manuscript in the Atlantic Monthly , III , 696 ) , under date of May , 1763 , Smollett gave a list of his acknowledged works  --  among them " a small part of the Modern Universal History . " In this letter Smollett was plainly disturbed at being misrepresented in America . At the time he said he was not yet done with a work " exhibiting the present state of the world . " This was the voluminous History towhich Mr. Seccombe makes reference , " The Present State of All Nations , " 8 vols. , 1764 . In the case of England , Dr. Smollett was supposed to be able to make a History at the rate of a century a week . What was his Speed with all nations ? And when shall we have another Modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , August 17 Holland 's Military Preparations TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : We continue here to keep up the good fight on the side of the Allies . Independently of my political and literary labors , I conceived last year the grand project of providing our army with a large number ? I dare not say a sufficient number  --  of reserve officers . I spoke of the plan to some of my friends and I was lucky enough to secure the support of one of our ablest retired officers , Captain Polviet , who was good enough to aid us with his counsels ; and finally we obtained the indispensable approval of our Minister of War . So now it , is possible for all Dutch civilians from twenty-five to fifty-five years of age to learn as rapidly as possible the duties of a reserve officer . A committee , whose membership embraces all our different political parties with the exception of the Socialists , who refused to join us , acts as patron of our enterprise , which at the present juncture is as necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 Senator Vardaman To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I regret to note in the issue for August 31 The Drifter 's unqualified condemnation of Senator Vardaman . Granting that he is a " fire-eating " Southerner , " suckled in a creed outworn , " we can still trace some threads of gold in the web of his public life . Fearless , honest , single-minded perhaps to fanaticism , he is not to be bribed , cajoled , still less bullied , from his chosen course . It must not be forgotten that lie was one of those who a year ago voted for the provisions of the now famous minority report of the Senate Finance Committee , which if adopted then would have saved the country several billions of dollars in bonds and interest , besides preventing much scandalous profiteering . I misdoubt that it was Senator Vardaman 's few virtues rather than his many faults that retired him from the Senate . A. W. B. Deephaven , Minn. , September 5 Bare Justice To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamaliel Bradford , writes in your issue of September 14 about " restoring Belgium , " as follows : " Every cent of that sum should be paid by Germany , if it starves every German man , woman , and child . " Why is not that " blood vengeance " ? Every leader of public opinion ought to know better than to say such things . In the first place , no nation in the smoke of battle can see what real justice is . Who can be trusted to be judge in his own cause ? Who among finite men knows enough of the unseen forces working behind the errors and sins of nations , fairly to apportion blame or deserts ? Who can ever tell what bare justice is ? We already see ( note , for example , your admirable review in the same Nation , of Dr. Schlesinger 's book , " The Colonial Merchants and the American Revolution " ) that our fathers suffered no such intolerable oppression as they imagined ! Even in the case of the Civil War we are now frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curse of slavery as the South was . The fact is , that no enduring peace , such as the sore world calls for , can be had without fair-mindedness and mutual sympathy . Grant that not Belgium alone , but every innocent population , overrun by the war , should so far as possible be restored . Grant that Germany ought to make restitution , and every other nation with her , for overpassing the lines of " civilized warfare , " provided we can be sure where those lines run . ( How about the treatment by all of us of the little neutral nations ? ) Grant especially that private property and indemnities collected ought to be returned in full . But suppose that , as Mr. Bradford intimates , such reasonable restitution is impossible for the defeated nations without many years of starvation and penury ! What does mercy , sympathy , common humanity , ask of us ? I can not imagine Mr. Bradford willing to stand by , as a citizen of a prosperous country rapidly recovering from the losses of- , , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people in Germany toiling like slaves to repay her debts in. behalf of Belgium . The patient Belgians would not wish to see this fierce punishment of their neighbors . Neither would the workers of the world allow the peasants and artisans of Germany to suffer the dire penalty for conduct for which a few scheming aristocrats and professional soldiers were responsible . Why not rather bring to bear a higher force , worthy of the new civilization and the better democracy for which we are said to be fighting ? Suppose we show the good will due from a great nation to whose power millions of honest and useful German emigrants , some of them notable pioneers of freedom , have contributed . Suppose then we help bridge the gulf of strife and angry blame by the frank offer to share with Germany in the restoration of Belgium . Here is a bridge to the peace of the world that can bear the mighty weight that will rest upon it . Will any other kind of a bridge bear the strain ?
