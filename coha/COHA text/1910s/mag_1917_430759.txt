 | DURING the past two years there has been an evolution going on in British lines of thought and policy which is as truly revolutionary as are the drastic and violent changes in Russia which recently have held the attention of the world . It also is very important to the United States in an economic and fiscal connection . These changes have been the silent workings of necessity , the results of a stern awakening to real conditions in a real world . Many of the theories and beliefs of a century , the prejudices of a lifetime , the faiths which had become fetishes , have disappeared in the whirlpool of war . The end of the war will mean the opening out and evolution of a new world ? in military , economic , diplomatic , and social conditions alike . WAR CHANGES NATIONAL CONCEPTIONS The tremendous impact of the struggle already has destroyed the aloofness of England and made her one in policy with some of the great nations of Europe ; it has absolutely changed the British viewpoint of Russia and her ambitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the English masses had in the friendship of the United States , though later events have revived the feeling that American cooperation in days of stress is a matter of course ; it has brought classes and masses together for a time which no one can say will be short or long , but is presently obvious ; it has removed a dim cloud which stood before the eyes of the people in looking at the growing greatness of their own empire ; it has given a vital shock to the ideal of England standing alone in free-trade policy without a fiscal weapon to protect herself or control her rivals . This latter point became a vital one last year when so many things were laid away and buried at the Paris Economic Conference of June 14-17 , where France , Russia , Italy , Belgium , Japan , Portugal , Serbia , and the British Empire were represented . The resolutions of that great gathering were largely devoted to plans and principles for trade and fiscal unity between the nations involved , and the following clause indicates their policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary steps without delay to render themselves independent of enemy countries in so far as regards raw materials and manufactured articles essential to the normal development of their economic activities . These measures will be directed to assuring the independence of the Allies , not only so far as concerns sources of supply , but also as regards their financial , commercial and maritime organization . The Allies will adopt such measures as seem to them most suitable for the carrying out of this resolution according to the nature of the commodities and having regard to the principles which govern their economic policy . ENGLAND 'S ALLIANCE WITH PROTECTIVE COUNTRIES On the surface this did not mean much ; in reality it was extremely significant . It meant the close alliance of free-trade Britain with three great protective nations ; it meant that behind the proceedings of the congress and the British delegates was a movement initiated years before by Joseph Chamberlain which had now found its day of victory and was coming into its own ; it meant that Australia and Canada , represented at the meeting by Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as protective Dominions , were in accord with this policy . It was followed up by the appointment of committees in France , Russia , Italy , and Britain to further the proposed action . That of Great Britain was appointed by the Prime Minister , on July 19 , " to  | consider the commercial and industrial policy to be adopted after they war , with special reference to the conclusions reached at the Economic Conference of the Allies , and to the following questions : ( 1 ) What industries are essential to the future safety of the nation , and what steps should be taken to maintain or establish them ; ( 2 ) what steps should be taken to recover home and foreign trade lost during the war , and to secure new markets ; ( 3 ) to what extent and by what means the resources of the Empire should and can be developed ; and ( 4 ) to what extent and by what means the resources of supply within the Empire can be prevented from falling under foreign control . " The committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman ) , Arthur Balfour ? not the Foreign Secretary ? H. Gosling , W. A. S. Hewins , M. P. , Alfred Illingworth , M. P. , Sir J. P. Maclay , the Rt . Hon. Sir A. Mond , M. P. , Arthur Pease , R. E. Prothero , M. P. , Sir Frederick H. Smith , and G. J. Wardle , M. P. , together with the heads of various government committees on associated subjects . It sat for months , consulted many and varied interests and , in its decisions as below , made public in March , 1917 , represented the revolution in fiscal thought which was coming to the United Kingdom : I. In the light of experience gained during the war , we consider that special steps must be taken to stimulate the production of food-stuffs , raw materials , and manufactured articles within the Empire wherever the expansion of production is possible and economically desirable for the safety and welfare of the Empire as a whole . 2 . We therefore recommend that H. M. Government should now declare their adherence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactures of the British Overseas Dominions the self-governing countries of Canada , Australia , South Africa , New Zealand , and Newfoundland in respect of any customs duties now or hereafter to be imposed on imports into the United Kingdom . 3 . Further , it will , in our opinion , be necessary to take into early consideration , as one of the methods of achieving the above objects , the desirability of establishing a wider range of customs duties which would be remitted or reduced on the products and manufactures of the Empire , and which would form the basis of commercial treaties with Allies and neutral powers . INCREASE IN BRITAIN 'S FOREIGN TRADE There was no doubt as to the serious nature of the economic problem . The United Kingdom had , before the war , become a hive of Germanized trade and industry with such vital things as chemical articles , dyes and tungsten , and such important trades as the toy industry , optical and electrical apparatus , almost entirely in German hands ; the great metal interests of Australia had got completely under German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian interests ? more in the latter case than was generally mown . In many branches of supply to India the Germans had acquired a monopoly and were steadily ousting British industries . It had been a peaceful penetration equivalent to economic warfare . Was all this and more to continue in , perhaps , still greater . degree , with still cheaper competition , after the war , together with still higher German and other tariffs against British goods ? Steadily , but surely , in three years of war the conviction has grown in the British mind that this could not be , that there must be a change in British policy . It is not because of decreasing trade ? the figures show a wartime total of imports of X696,635,113 during 1914 , X851,893,350 in 1915 , and X949,152,305 in 1916 , and in exports of X430,721,357 , X384,868,448 , and X506,545,443 , respectively . The astounding increase , in this period , of X252,500,000 ( equivalent in American money to $1,262,500,000 ) in imports and $379,000,000 in exports ? despite the loss of all Teutonic trade ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British people and of the protective power of the British Navy . But it is obvious , also , that much of it was due to special conditions and that to retain it in total , if not in detail , would require immense after-war adjustments in business methods , national customers and tariffs . One of these changes would be in the reconstruction and upbuilding of Europe , as to which the United States Foreign Trade Council has made an estimate of $6,000,000,000 in immediate requirements . Another would be found in meeting the enormous loss of shipping which ? Allies and neutrals alike ? Germany had deliberately undertaken to bring about and which amounted , at the end of 1916 , to about 5 per cent . of British shipping and as much more of the other countries and has increased during 1917 at a tremendous rate . ECONOMIC WAR PROPOSED The nature of this change as it developed in British fiscal thought can be easily traced , but is little known in the United States and not fully appreciated in Great Britain itself .  | Mr. Runciman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-trader in theory , said in the Commons on January 10 , 1916 : " An economic war should be well within the range of our powers . How long that economic war is to be waged is another matter . At any rate we must see to it that having ended this war victoriously , we do not give Germany a chance of reconstructing her commercial position . " Sir Alfred Mond , one of the most vigorous old-time members of the Cobden Club , followed with the admission that : " It will be to our interest , and probably necessary for political reasons , to take steps which some may consider economically unsound in order to tie ourselves and our Allies closer together . " It is probable that few men in England more visibly represented in the public eye the old-time school of free-trade , at any price , than did these two men . A TARIFF TO PROTECT BRITISH MANUFACTURERS On February 2 a parliamentary paper was issued giving the report of a committee appointed by the government to inquire into measures for securing certain branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many detailed recommendations ? amongst them the declaration that government departments and local authorities should buy only goods produced within the Empire , and the following tariff statement : We are of opinion that where the national supply of certain manufactured articles , which are of vital importance to the national safety , or are essential to other industries , has fallen into the hands of manufacturers and traders outside this country , British manufacturers ready to undertake the manufacture of such articles in this country should be afforded sufficient tariff protection to enable them to maintain such production after the war ; and that ( after the war ) it will be necessary to impose some widely spread import duties , and we are , therefore , prepared to recommend that a larger proportion of the revenue should be raised by reasonable import duties . We are of the opinion that such import duties would go a long way toward satisfying the requests for special protective treatment for the industries which we have had under consideration . The members of the committee were Sir Algernon Firth , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stanley Machin , E. Parkes , M. P. , and Sir Alfred Spicer , M. P. ? the last of whom preferred a wider scheme to a " piecemeal tariff " dealing with selected industries . The tariff rates suggested applied to paperprinted matter , silverware , cutlery , fancy leather goods , glassware , china and earthenware , toys and brushes , and ran from 10 to 33/ per cent . ad valorem with , in two cases , prohibitive duties . The Associated Chambers of Commerce of all Britain met in London on February 29 and passed resolutions declaring it desirable to make provision ( 1 ) for preferential reciprocal trading relations between all parts of the Empire ; ( 2 ) for reciprocal trading relations between the Empire and the Allied countries ; ( 3 ) for the favorable treatment of neutral countries ; and ( 4 ) for restricting , by tariffs and otherwise , trade relations with all enemy countries , so as to render dumping and a return to pre-war conditions impossible and for " stimulating the development of home manufacture and the consequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris Conference already referred to . DEMANDS OF LIBERAL LEADERS The following quotations indicate still further the growth of the protective sentiment and they are selected from the standpoint of personal and political significance ? it would be superfluous to quote Conservative or Unionist leaders : The Earl of Rosebery ? Liberal and free-trader : There are two points on which I think we should be prepared to disregard pre-conceived notions . One is the question of tariffs , as to which we shall have to reconsider , I suspect , many of our previous formulas , and by which we can not be hampered in the prosecution of a successful foreign trade . The other is this . As you are aware , the Foreign Office has always had the greatest antipathy to their consular agents engaging in promoting commerce of particular firms in foreign countries . I think the laissez aller policy will have to be abandoned. ? At Edinburgh , January 20 , 1916 . Rt . Hon. John Hodge , M.P. ? labor leader and free-trader : It appears to those with whom I have spoken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit Germany the freedom of our markets which she had in times past . It , therefore , behooves those who formerly held Free-Trade opinions to make it known to the Coalition Government that all those notions have been placed in the melting-pot , and that we are prepared to reconsider the position free from the trammels of party. ? In The People , February 27 , 1916 . It must not be thought that , powerful as is this movement for a new policy , there is no opposition to the proposed changes . That would be inconceivable in a country where every living man has been born and bred in  | the ideal of Free Trade as a gospel of fiscal liberty , a source and mainstay of cheap production , distribution and prices , a doctrine involving purchase in the cheapest market and sale in the dearest ? even when the only cheap market was China and the only unprotected one his own ! As was inevitable a vigorous opposition was led by the Manchester Guardian and London News E.5 ' Leader and by such men as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty out of thirty-three had resigned when that body repudiated Free Trade , early in 1916 . OPPOSED IN FREE-TRADE STRONGHOLDS In the Daily News on July 6 , 1916 , there was published a letter signed by a number of prominent freetraders and recording the emphatic opinion that no reason existed for changing the fiscal policy of Britain : " This war has proved the strength of Free Trade and the weakness of protection at home and abroad . After the war Free Trade will be more needful than ever to Great Britain and the British Empire , for it is only by returning to cheap production and unfettered intercourse with all nations that we shall be able to resume our commercial and manufacturing superiority , and to find from our incomes the huge revenue necessary to pay pensions to the victims of war and interest on a dead-weight debt of unexampled magnitude . " Amongst the signatories were Earl Beauchamp , lately a member of the government ; Lord Ashton of Hyde , Sir Hugh Bell , a great industrial magnate , Earl Brassey , Viscount Bryce , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penwith , Farrer and Eversley , the Earl of Loreburn , ex-Lord Chancellor of England ; Sir John Simon , M. P. , Rt . Hon. John Burns , the labor leader ; F. W. Hirst and H. W. Massingham , well-known journalists ; Lord Weardale , and ten not very well-known members of Parliament . The fact of only a dozen members of the Commons signing the appeal was more significant than all the signatures put together ? influential as many were . FISCAL IMPERIALISM Behind much of this changed viewpoint is the idea of an Empire trade and fiscal policy ? the old Chamberlain scheme in fact . Mr. Bonar Law , Colonial Secretary , put this clearly in a speech on June 23 , 1916 : " The value of a change in fiscal policy in the past has always depended , in my opinion , on its use as a means of securing a closer union of the British Empire . " As the issue developed he further amplified the view which Mr. Chamberlain had first presented to the people and , in addressing the Unionist National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There may be a fight ( on the fiscal issue ) but I ask you to remember what is always present in my mind , that behind any trade question in connection with this there is a bigger question . Behind all there is the question of the closer union of the British Empire . " This phase of the fiscal issue had been dealt with in the Commons on January 10 , 1916 , when W. A. S. Hewins moved a resolution , which passed unanimously and stated that " with a view to increasing the power of the Allies in the prosecution of the war , His Majesty 's Government should enter into immediate consultation with the governments of the Dominions in order , with their aid , to bring the whole economic strength of the Empire into cooperation with our Allies in a policy directed against the enemy . " It was pointed out during the debate that in 1913 , before the war , Germany had sent 48 per cent . of her exports , or $I , 026,000,000 , to Britain and her Allies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following months this Empire cooperation in war and trade was accentuated until at its close the calling of a War Council brought the matter to a climax , and resulted during May , 1917 , in the breaking of all traditions and customs by the Prime Ministers of Australia , South Africa , New Zealand , Newfoundland , and Canada sitting in the British Cabinet and dealing with issues of war , trade , and peace . Another sign of the times was the official proposal ? report of a government Committee on Financial Facilities for Trade ? to establish a British Trade Bank under royal charter with a capital of $50,000,000 . Such is the position which has developed in Great Britain as a result of world-wide and world-war conditions which have reflected themselves in the changed convictions of a nation . This acceptance of protection by the United Kingdom is as great and sweeping a change as would be the acceptance of Free Trade by the United States and the bringing together here of these steps in the process of evolution may be of interest to many in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues of war and a world-policy.
