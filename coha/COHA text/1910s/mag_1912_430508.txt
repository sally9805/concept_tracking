IT 'S always blowin ' in Mo - harvey , " I was informed by a leatherbrown citizen of that desert metropolis . Personal experience confirmed him entirely . There is nothing to stop it , for Mojave squats low and alone in a vast plain of sand , which rears only a useless growth of greasewood , cactus , and sage . It boasts a couple of " cement block " buildings , but , for the most part , frame structures and tents anchored to stout poles line its streets . A scarce halfdozen in number , these , after the short space of a couple of " blocks , " discouraged-like , blur themselves in the scorched surrounding barrier of nothingness . The municipal board of Mojave needs to go to no expense for street-sweepers , for the ever-present wind keeps its thoroughfares clear and clean to the hard-baked surface . From the active patronage of its thirst-quenching establishments , of hospitable title and multi-colored design , I should judge much of the spare sand lodges in the throats of its inhabitants . Mojave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of the great American Desert . It has outfitted numberless Jasons who have fared forth from its shelter to search for golden treasure . It has received the wagon trains of ore rumbling down from mines in the barren northern mountains . Some five years ago , prospectors of a new order came to Mojave . From a rapidly growing community across the Coast Range to the southward they came in search of water , much more precious to that community than silver or gold . The water question in this portion of our great southwest has always been paramount in importance . The year 's supply of moisture must fall between the months of November and April . Many a year has been marked by insufficient rainfall . Los Angeles stands at the head of this section , and is typical of the rapid advance in population throughout . Continual development of water went on as the city grew , but the time has come when local conditions are no longer adequate . A herculean effort must be made for an ample , permanent supply . So the prospecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley , the lowest point in the United States , and up among the noble Sierra Nevadas to the base of Mount Whitney , our highest land . On the sides of this great watershed lie perpetual snows , which constantly feed the valleys below with an abundance of pure water . Here was the solution of the difficulty , but to place this water in Los Angeles was plainly a daring , tremendous task . This valley , which the engineers found , is  |p539  two hundred and fifty miles distant , and much of the journey lies across the dry death of the Mojave . Los Angeles owns her water-works , and these her engineers , undismayed at the huge undertaking , only exceeded by two or three other projects of its kind , determined to win the city 's cooperation . This came with a shout . Bonds were voted . The city knew these men and trusted them . For the preliminary survey , party after party was thrown into the field . They were scouts for the main army of laborers and machinery which was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it bear across its rugged shoulders the vivifying liquid for the southern country . They had , to begin with , the faint scratch of a stage road , running north from Mojave to Keeler . This road is punctuated by seven " water-holes , " the breathing places of the desert in the early days for wandering prospectors , and , later , points for stage stations , where horses were exchanged . Now they are recorded on the maps for construction camps and power development . Broad mesas stretch far away to the east , terminating in the purple ranges of the Panamint Mountains , the western boundary of Death Valley . The billowing surface is covered with clumps of greasewood , scarce as high as a burro 's back , thorny cactus , and the pale , fragile sage . The growth close at hand spreads out in orderly spaced patches of dull green . On a distant roll of the plain , rising to the level of the eye , it solidifies into soft , dark tone . Of living things you may see a coyote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once went to an ancient inhabitant for information about a yellow bunch-grass , which is seen only in rare instances . " That yelluh grass , " said he , " used tuh grow over this hull business , but yuh see , th ' sheep goin ' up into th ' Sierras tuk it out clean . " " Who would ever start across here with sheep ? " I remonstrated . " Well , them old-timers did it , just the samey , son , " was his reply . " They knew the water-holes , all right , and most of ' em would git across . " This stretch of burning sand and ragged growth is the desert which is most familiar to the uninitiated , but only those who have travelled within its borders can know how much more of death and desolation is ex- pressed by its mountains . They have a character all their own . Theirs is not the grandeur of the Rockies , whose pinnacles rise mightily into the blue from out a mane of forest growth . Theirs is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spruce and redwood , such as is given the lofty Sierras . They are tumbled together in tawny , maze-like confusion , ugly , sullen , repellent . The desert herbage straggles over their rounding sides and upward for a space , and then , faintheartedly , dies out . Their summits , rounded and stunted by erosion , are crumbling slowly , inevitably , to the level of the plain . Here and there , in bold , rugged outcrop , the rocky framework of their interior is bared against a brazen sky . Down in the canyons the blighting heat of the sun is conserved and multiplied to almost furnace-like intensity . The work of preliminary survey was carried on against all these odds . In many places the engineers ' footsteps were the first to echo among the baked walls . At times , even fuel was not to be obtained ? many a dry camp was made . With infinite patience a path was found , and the invisible lines drawn tight that would link Mojave 's waste to civilization . In Owens Valley , discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options on one hundred and twenty square miles of land , with full water rights attached . The price paid when the project was finally launched was one million dollars . Here the waters will be rounded up . There will be a storage reservoir in Long Valley , north of Owens , from which the water will be allowed to flow down Owens River for a distance . As Owens River flows finally into an alkaline sink , the aqueduct planners are prevented from using its entire course . Thirty-five miles from the river mouth the aqueduct water is diverted into an open canal , fifty feet wide and ten feet deep , and for twenty miles is thus conducted , high above the bed of the river . Then it enters the confines of a concretelined ditch , eighteen feet wide and fifteen feet deep , to be carried along a range of the Sierra foot-hills for some forty miles , gathering to itself , as it goes , additional mountain streams . This first stage of the journey will be completed when it spreads out into the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , and whose  |p541  contents alone will be able to satisfy Los Angeles ' demands for three years ' time . Loosed from Haiwee it will make its way a distance of one hundred and twenty-five miles , through the desert , circling the inhospitable slopes , boring its flinty anatomy , and lying a gray streak across the mesas . Then at the Fairmount reservoirs , under the north slope of the Coast Range , it will be given a rest . Once more released , it will plunge into the mountain side , and for five miles course through Elizabeth tunnel , emerging on the southern slope of the mountains . At this point it will be dropped eight hundred feet upon the turbines of two great hydro-electric plants ; on once more by conduit for seven miles , and then another drop of seven hundred feet to generate more power ; again a journey of sixteen miles to the wheels of a third great power plant , and , with this last task done , it will come to rest in the San Fernando reservoirs . Thence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles by conduit . From Haiwee reservoir southward the aqueduct dimensions will vary according to grade and pressure , but ten feet high and twelve feet wide will be the general average . Two hundred and sixty million gallons daily can be rushed through this tube , and the city , whose lifeblood it is , may go on growing for years without taxing its capacity . Los Angeles ' present water consumption is about thirtyfive million gallons daily , which leaves ample surplusage to be thrown into the fertile surrounding valleys for irrigation . While satisfying the need for water is the first consideration in the enterprise , the power developed in the plants above San Fernando will follow a close second in beneficial import . The revenue from the thousands of horse-power turning the city 's machinery and car systems , together with that received for the water in irrigation , will speedily repay the cost of the project . As the water is brought the entire distance by gravity up-keep is reduced to the lowest figure . Opportunity was given private contractors to bid on the work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the municipal engineers ' figures , that the city determined to throw the whole proposition over to its men . They have set the cost of the aqueduct at about twenty-three million dollars . @# The next problems , those of placing the army of men and toils of bulky machinery on the line of work , the development of power and water , and establishment of transportation facilities in this land which refused any aid whatsoever of itself , loomed large over that of the preliminary work , arduous as it was . At points in the Coast Range , near the terminal , and as far north on the desert as Mojave , the work could be begun with little difficulty . The real tussle of the job was to bring the ditch through the Mojave , and there it stood , its thirsty miles of mountains and plain defying the wits of a whole corps of engineers , in just the same way it had defied the lone prospector , adrift with his burro . Thus it was the dusty little town in the midst of the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if an army of conquest had made it its head-quarters . Tons of freight and machinery were deposited at its dingy station . Each day 's trains brought detachments of men , engineers in khaki and corduroy and high boots ; laborers , if they had the fare . If no fare was possessed , whole squads " hoofed it in " along the railroad . Out over the old stage road went straining ten-mule teams , and along a line of stakes , straggling through the desert reaches , arose the first camps of construction , the shining white of their canvas making a new note of color in the pervading grayness . This work of establishment was painfully slow , in itself not an inconsiderable enterprise . Wagon roads must be built through the trackless country ; camps to live in this land of little moisture must have water found and brought to them ; power must be developed before the drills and dredges could be operated . A year and a half went by , and the chief 's report showed but a few hundred feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , had been well done , and from that time on the great ditch has been pushing through the earth at a record-breaking pace . Whole divisions are being completed below estimates . The city 's trust is being justified . The engineers , with their young , vigorous assistants in the field , are making good . It was soon discovered that the long , laborious wagon haul northward from Mojave must be eliminated . A western road was asked to build a railroad to Keeler ,  |p542  paralleling the aqueduct line . This was refused , but the city 's men , undismayed , took upon themselves , besides the ' task of the aqueduct , that of building a railroad as well . The route had been set out and work commenced when the railroad company suddenly changed its mind , and for the freight contract with the aqueduct agreed to take the road off its hands . As soon as it could be operated , work on the ditch progressed much more rapidly . There is still much tough teaming to be done , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several miles distant from the railroad . Although these mountains from a distance appear to be old piles of rotting , disintegrating sand , they present to the workman a core of hardest rock . Instances have been met where every inch of a road had to be " shot out " with dynamite . It is slow going and expensive road-building , this . With the exception of a point near Tehachipi , it was necessary to go nearly as far north as the intake for water for power and camp use . Four water systems were established , and mains soon made their way along the course of the ditch . With the major issue before them , these men are not for long concerned with the laying of a paltry sixty miles of three- or four-inch pipe . It looks in places as if they had walked straight across country , dragging it after them as though it were a hose . It will span lightly an arroyo to climb straight up the sheer wall of the cliff beyond , and then descend as precipitously the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little distance to keep it from breaking apart of its own weight . Three hydroelectric power plants have been established in places of sufficient water supply to operate the dredges at work on open canal at the intake , some of the power shovels , the machine-shops , and air-drills . Power will also come from them for lights , and to maintain the complete telephone system which binds all the camps together , and all to the chief at city head-quarters . Four or five years will be consumed in the building of the aqueduct . Each division over the course has its camp capital , from which post the division engineer controls the activities of its several subsidiary construction camps. - The system of the project making every bunk-house , mess-hall , or corrugated iron warehouse alike , does not keep each camp from investing itself with an individuality of its own . Among these Cinco , in the " Jawbone , " lies panting on the lifting slope of the valley , exposed to the full strength of the sun ; Boulder , camped high , overlooks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which give Boulder Mountain its name ; lovely Grapevine , amid a scrap of verdure in the great cup of a canyon , one of the precious water-holes , shelters its lucky inhabitants in envied desert luxuriance . What is it that brings this young engineer chap out here in these lone places ? Truly , he is young , in nearly every case . Sometimes you would say he had not turned thirty , and his assistants , with desert-fostered beards and a forced bravado of experience , seem barely loosed from their schools . Though not so many miles separate him from the busy world , he is as effectively removed as his fellow in Panama ; he suffers as inhospitable a climate . He represents a new impulse in the world . It is not that of the soldier , nor that of the discoverer , and yet , it may be , a touch of both . It is with the discoverer 's instinct that he finds his course , and the general 's planning that he breaks through opposing barriers . But above these , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land , is the impulse to make useful useless places , to loose the powers lying long latent in our great natural resources . The power of modern science has given him the air of a master over the varied forces of the earth . The other fellow stands in awe when he speaks , in quiet tones , of eliminating a mountain , or spanning a high , cliff-bound gulf . The open life makes him most democratic . He can not move with too much nicety among his men . He must have them with him . You most always find him at the general mess . He has a complex army of men under his control . Clerks and draughtsmen , mechanics and miners , and the rank and file , the hobos . " Stakers , " as these well-known gentlemen are termed on the ditch , make up the general mass of laborers . They come in from somewhere and work awhile at a camp . Then , leaving with their roll of blankets and a bottle of water , foot it to the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , out into the comforts of  |p543  civilization . It is said the aqueduct is being built by hobo labor . Energetic and resourceful this man must be , ever on the alert to keep the careful watch needed along many hot miles of ditch excavation . Set out by yourself for the next camp up the line , and you will not have travelled half the clay before you feel it all . The road is making around the mountains , whose rounding ridges have broadened gradually until , under you , they are almost merged in great , wave-like rolls with the sloping plain . Your eyes can see a hundred miles , but you can not hold them on the distance long , for the blinding surrounding glare of the sun forces you to close them for relief . 1 , hat a stillness ! There 's not a living thing to be seen except your mules , grunting into their collars ahead . Maybe a whirlwind rises , thirty miles away , and races , spectral , swaying , across the valley floor . You come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down its side and over its bone-white stones . On the far bank a crook in the road changes the light , and far ahead against the mountains appear two gigantic bowlders . Blended before in the grayness , they now stand boldly out , and you know them to be the looked-for beacons of a friendly course . Five miles beyond , with a turning to the left , lies your camp . A few stray clouds pass before the sun , and their shadows , miles wide , make insignificant patches on the expanse . The desert in the light is accentuated to a gleaming gold . The shadows touch a far range , which turns to purple ; the one beyond stands out a glaring red . Now the mountains close at hand begin to round inward . You reach the turn , and the road becomes a grade dug along a canyon-side . Below you an arroyo issues from the canyon 's mouth , its stones , bonedry , shining white against the dusty growth of either bank , and spread out fanlike into the desert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes are before you , and beyond them , rising a mighty rampart over all , is the jagged , rocky summit of the range . High on the mountain side you see an even scratch of familiar gray ? the ditch . Zigzagging to and from it are the smaller scratches of workmen 's trails , and you note with much satisfaction their general direction to be the same as that of your road . Where all these marks come together is ? camp . There is now no need to urge the team . With ears pricked forward they turn the last obscuring ridge , and there , between wide-spreading mountain sides , it lies . Most wonderful sight ! There are trees again , green trees with white tents , and houses around about on terraces notched in the canyon walls . Surely you have n't been touched by the sun , but that is the sweet sound of running water you hear ! A boy , with apron rolled up about his waist , steps from the mess kitchen , and shielding his eyes with his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the corral you go , and draw up under a big cotton-wood by the office . The " boss , " with boyish , unshaven face , is there to greet you . Shortly , down the trails , which seem to hang almost over the camp , come the men in answer to the supper call . Two lengths of rough , carpentered tables , in the long , narrow hall of the mess , are attacked by a hungry horde . The polite , conversational meal of civilization is banished here . This is the place to eat ? the talk can come outside . A big pan of meat starts at the head of the table , and stays not in its going until it reaches the foot , its contents vanished . Cooks ' boys struggle back and forth with mountains of bread and huge pots of coffee . Their fate it is to catch all the boisterous joking . But from their vantage point between the rows of bending backs revenge is swift and easy . Here an eater dodges from a rap on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rafters , when . another is punched over into his plate . The pie is downed and , with little lingering , the men get out , each one with a fresh puncture in his meal ticket by the steward on guard at the door . The camp is strongly built for one whose existence will no doubt terminate with the completion of the aqueduct . The office building , with its quarters for the engineer and assistants , and its comfortable , shielding porches , stands under a huge cottonwood tree beside the creek . The camp store , of mongrel architecture , half canvas , half wood , is just across the stream . All the necessaries of desert life are there , from clothing to tobacco . In a row stand the bunk-houses , rough , strong , but comfortable , a room for each two men . Built to protect the men from an unmerciful sum-  |p544  mer sun , they are prepared to withstand , paradoxical though it may appear , the desert 's winter cold . In that season the mercury drops at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp is complete in its hospital . Although alike in its temporizing structure . it is prepared , in its cleanly and systematic interior , to cope with the accidents to which a hardy work exposes the men . A surgeon is in charge , with a hospital steward for assistant . He is ready , as the engineer , to travel at a call to any of his division camps . These have temporary hospital tents under the care of a hospital steward . Warehouses and machine shops ? the hospitals for the mechanical beasts of the aqueduct ? the steam shovel , the caterpillar traction engine , and the drill ? are of corrugated iron . Stout barns and corrals are constructed for the live-stock . Breaking a way for the circling streak of conduit above the camp is one of the big shovels . In use throughout the work , these ? are driven both by steam and electricity . A steam shovel is no uncommon sight to-day , but the effect produced by one of the big mechanical monsters , high-perched against the glare of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as though you had been transported to some ancient period , and that that black thing up there , with hoarse snorts and dipping , swaying beak , was one of the prehistoric animals , making a gritty meal . The steel-tusked shovel leans into the ditch , and with a few stertorous puffs from the engine , noses about for a mouthful . Into the rock it plunges , with rattle of chains and the screeching grit of steel on rock . A rapid series of puffs , and it rears swiftly into the air , dust clouds streaming in its wake . Swaying out over the rim of the ditch , with a grin of its gaping jaws , it drops the load . A few stones , finding no lodgement on the side , go on down to the valley in great skips and bounds , but before their clatter has ceased the shovel is again in the ditch . This time it rises with a huge rock in its clutches , and swings over to a bunch of attendants on the bank , who jump forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock it is bringing up from the ditch is placed on the outer side , thus strengthening that side , and laying the foundation for a road for patrol when the work is completed . Perched out on the great beam , at his levers and " trip rope , " like an East Indian mahout astride the neck of his elephant , sits the master of the metal brute . At will he can make it dig or lift , push , pull , or bump . " How on earth did you ever get it up there ? " I asked . " To get one of those shovels over here when we first started work was somewhat of a trick , " replied my friend . " Then we had to take it apart at the railroad , get the sections over by mule team , and assemble them again on the mountain . Now , since we 've got the " caterpillars , " we can hitch two or three of ' em onto a shovel and snake it up to the base , where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ditch on its own steam . Simple enough , you see . " With an emphatic " Of course ! " I tried to look scientifically intelligent , and as though I could " see . " Ahead of the shovel is a gang of drillers , using " hand steel . " These men prepare for blasts , by which the surface is shot just enough to break the rock , and so ease the progress of the shovel . Following in its wake come men who complete by hand the shaping of the ditch . Then a force of carpenters build the moulds , and the reenforcing steel is placed . The concrete pourers follow , carrying the liquid stone from mixer to moulds , and beyond them the finished conduit appears gray-white , with curious , rib-fashioned cover . In a long , swinging curve it follows a recession of the mountain-side , to appear boldly against the distance on the adjacent promontory . Lost from sight and again to be seen in ever-diminishing proportions , it makes its tortuous way until it reaches the gulf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engineer sat himself down and with knitted brows turned his imagination loose . To span the gap would require an enormous structure , five hundred feet high , a mile or more wide . Multiplied by the numerous times this condition confronts him would mean the aqueduct 's cost sailing into the impossible . To carry the aqueduct to the head of the canyon and back again down the other side was for the same reason not to be considered . There was nothing to do but to go straight over the side to the canyon 's bottom and climb  |p545  again " to grade " on the opposing wall ? so he traced on his plans a letter V and throughout the aqueduct 's course these gigantic initials are being set up . A number are built of steel to withstand the terrible force of water falling from great heights , and are called , in technical terms , " inverted siphons . " Some of them will approach two miles in length , and about fifteen miles in all of this novel construction will be required . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand tons to be carried across the desert . The difficulties in every phase of the work show with what effectiveness old Mojave opposes invasion . I do n't believe there is a place in the world where the problems of transportation are more varied and difficult . Transportation by mule team , shortly after the work began , was seen to be expensive and ineffectual . A larger , more powerful means must be secured . At nearly every turn the aqueduct presented problems for original treatment . In this work , precedent does n't seem to count for much . It is up to the engineer to get around his diffi- culty in any way he can . So the " caterpillar " traction engine was pressed into the service of the ditch , to navigate the sea of sage and sand . It has proved a most efficient and economical means of transportation . Great weight of machinery that it is , its pace surely links it with its diminutive namesake . But give it time , and it gets there with enormous burdens . The type used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for a pair of big driving wheels , but do not find them . In their place a chain of broad links of steel , corrugated to grip the sand , revolves about small wheels , which are at once sprocket and drive wheels . This is its own road which it carries and lays as it goes . A single broad wheel in front serves to steer its course . Perched in the rear , up under a flapping canvas canopy , sits the helmsman of this new " ship of the desert . " The clutching , evasive fingers of the sand have been staved , not by lightening the load , but by pressing a still heavier one upon them . A " caterpillar , " slowly topping a rolling wave of the desert floor , with broad-tired  |p546  freighters grinding heavily in tow , joins itself in your mind , at first thought , to all traditional forms of desert travel . But when you see its burden , equal to that of a dozen caravans ; that a great piece of machinery , which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten by a dozen mule teams up the canyon grade where it must go ; and when the horrible racket of its unmuffled motor beats in your ears , you finally confess : " This belongs to to-day . It is different . It is new . " Not so much innovations , but none the less spectacular and daring , are the methods adopted to get men and material to the different points inaccessible by road or trail . There are thrills to be had from the dipping over a declivity on a little car tethered to a strand of cable , at the mercy of an engineer , hand on lever , beside his " drum " at the top ; and the sensations of aerial travel in an enlarged package carrier strung across the gap of a canyon . To find a way to cut off an hour of deviating trail ; to reduce the expense of delivery of material ? these are some of the joys of the engineer . He is as proud of their successful accomplishment as he is of his major job , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without delay he starts off with the " green one " to inspect the new " hoist . " There , securely anchored in a huge mass of rock on the canyon side , is a series of big bolts and steel cables . These , by gigantic knots and bolted clamps , hold a single cable , a mere spider 's thread between the mighty walls , swinging upward five hundred feet to the other side . Going on at a great rate about the relative merits of " inch " and " inch and a half " cable , " tensile strength , " " traction , " and so on , he gets him over to the station of this air railway . On a post at the side he presses a button . The cable begins to sing , and looking along its length a speck is seen swinging downward . Descending , enlarging , it soon scrapes on the platform ? the car of the system . This is a stout wooden affair , with two sides about a foot high . The ends are open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running gear , which is a two-wheeled truck . Come on , let 's go up , " invites the host . All but the " green one " climb aboard , and he , not able at the sudden summons to produce a reasonable excuse , with one last hesitating glance at good old Mother Earth , joins them . The signal to hoist is given , and the car swings out over the canyon . The camp buildings below take on the proportions of chicken coops . The " green one " sits holding to one of the chains , and swings his legs over the side in an effort at outward calm . He wonders if he had n't better keep all of himself up on the car , and if his feet are really still there at the end of his legs . He does n't care to be caught looking for them over the edge . The car keeps rising , the camp below is but a toy . Every once in a while there comes a little jerk from the traction cable , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , wonders he , that those wretched chaps standing calmly by him have to discuss a runaway load of machinery , which smashed to Hinders at the bottom the week before ; or the ways and means of saving oneself if the traction cable should break . He glances along the arc of steel falling away below him . How small it looks ! More often he measures the remaining stretch above him . At last , after a terrible moment of giddy swinging beside the upper landing , he climbs out on a terrace cut in the mountain 's side . Here are supported the machine shops , power installation , and housing for the mules , attendant on a tunnel opening into the canyon wall . Doubly isolated , in the heart of the mountain , a good dozen city squares distant , is a little knot of human energy , slowly fretting its way with vibrating steel through the flinty core . The tunnel needs no timbering . It is piercing some of the hardest rock known . At the portal nothing can he heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rough , over a narrow-gauge track and lengths of snaky air tubes . The tunnel 's air is cooler and begins to take on a clinging dampness . A faint purr falls on the ear from the blackness ahead . It rises louder , a clatter , a racket , and then , as the obscurity resolves itself into mysterious moving forms , becomes a dreadful din , the clamor of a whole battery of Gatlings in swift discharge . This is the drill shift . Two machines are raised on a platform , attacking the upper part of the rock , a man , grime-streaked , at each . Braced mute against the vibrating drills , their eyes strain forward as though they can see the mysterious line which the transit men have pointed for them through the mountain . They work  |p547  amid the eternal furor of battle . Nothing can be heard until the drills are changed . All orders must be given by signs . One of the men on the platform reaches a hand with his pipe and tobacco to his helper among the coiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights it in his own mouth , and hands it up to his mate , who turns puffing to his machine as though this were always the way pipes were lit for a body . There is a unity in this effort against the rock which shows well-developed team work among the men . Like foot-ball players , they press forward together against the opposition . The work has , in truth , been made a great game for the men by the aqueduct builders . The excavation , whether tunnel or conduit , in rock or clay , is classified , and a ten-day average progress set for each . A  |p548  gang , when it exceeds the average , receives a bonus . The men in rock , where five feet gained to a shift is reckoned an honorable accomplishment , strain as hard for the extra inch as the sprinter who endeavors to clip a fraction of a second from his record . Down at Red Rock summit there is an Irishman , rather under-sized , and redheaded . His conversational powers are not , brilliant along some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corduroys are never clean of a yellow clay . With his yellowdaubed gang he has gone through that clayey sandstone eleven hundred feet in thirty days ? a world 's record in tunnel excavation . Over in the Jaw-bone , whose character is admirably indicated by its name , a lean , wiry young man , brown as a Navajo , is putting that toughest of divisions through below the estimates alike of private builders and canal chiefs . The drillers , through with their attack on the rock , the holes are charged with powder and " shot . " " Now , is n't that pretty ? " said an old tunnel foreman , as he proudly directed my attention to the orderly pile of blasted rock following the " shooting " at the tunnel breast . " The boys can lay it out about any way they please . Get in here in Eleven , where they are ready to shoot , and we can get an idea of how the holes are arranged . Here you 've got a centre cut hole , " said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Around it there are thirteen other holes ; the two lower ones we call lifters . ' Now , when the boys shoot , this arrangement will throw the rock out a good piece , and break it up pretty well . By varying the hole placement , and changing the timing of the fuses , you can break the rock up more or less , or throw it one way or the other . Just a minute now , and we 'll light up our little Christmas tree . " After having examined everything about the " breast " to see that nothing was left to prevent a successful " shot , " all the workers , with the exception of two , started back through the tunnel . At a word from the foreman , they began " spitting " the coiling lengths of fuse , which marked , in crude geometrical design , the work of the drillers . We tarried an instant , just long enough to see this " Christmas tree " sputtering away in the face of the rock . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebration , " my friend said . " But you do n't need to hurry , for we 've got five minutes to get out of range . " Well down the tunnel and safe around a curve , we presently heard the muffled " humpbump-bump " of the distant exploding charges . Careful count was kept of the shots to see that none had missed . The " Christmas tree " had , with the force of giants , obeyed the will of its masters . Amidst the gray , boiling clouds of smoke and gases we found the rock , well broken up , and thrown out in a well-ordered mass . The first rude cut of the tunnel made by the blasts at the " breast " is afterward shaped up in quite a neat manner by smaller shots along the side called " trimmers . " After I had seen what this man could do with rough holes in the rock and powder , I would have believed him if he had said he could " shoot " so that the rock would pile itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn from the solidity of the mountain becomes , in the technical terms of excavation , " muck , " and then it is the mucking gang , with mules and rumbling cars of steel , comes in for its shift . Alongside the drillers ' , their 's is the prosaic task . The members of the " mucking gang , " tin lunch buckets in hand , are waiting at the platform to " go on " when the car with the " green one " returns from its perilous soaring . A big , cool , gray shadow comes creeping over the canyon from the western wall , and begins to climb the other side , absorbing as it goes that rim of flaming cadmium . Up the camp street arises the clamor of a massive triangle , beaten by a significant individual in bare brown arms , and an apron sometime white . The " green one , " with alacrity and no effort to disguise his feelings , joins the throng at the door , and disappears within the savoryodored mess hall . In the reviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social parlor of the camp . Groups at one end , with guitar or mandolin , are doing " close harmony , " with old college songs . Down the porch-rail is a border of broad , tan-shirted backs and grimy mountain boots , twined about the braces . On the steps sit dusky figures , elbows across knees , or sprawling back . A light shows in the mess kitchen across the way , where the cooks ' boys are clattering through their late task . Over all is drawn a broad band  |p550  of star-dotted sky between canyon walls , hushed and looming . The talk going round can not wander far from the ditch . It 's told how " W " ' is held up for cement because his " caterpillars " are both knocked out ; how " bum the grub is " down at Dove Springs ; that " R " is going to bring his wife up with him to Sun Canyon : that " they 're going away over seventy feet a day up on the Olancha " ; and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is finished . " The " green one 's " chance comes in , too , and he gives the intimate , personal news of the other part of the world to an appreciative audience . Gradually the groups break up , the porch becomes deserted , and all is quiet in the desert night . Down in the camp 's draughting rooms are maps and blue prints , covered with curves and angles and figures . Up in the mountains and across the mesas the great bore is repeating them in proportions unerring and heroic . Section is joining section , tunnel is meeting tunnel ; here a " siphon " links together the opposing arteries , and there a great reservoir stands ready with open gates . Soon a great day will come for the city , a day when the " staker " will swing blankets to back , and fill the water-bottle for the last time ; when miners and engineers will lay aside their tools and troop back to civilization . The turbines of the huge power-houses will begin to turn , and a flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirst of the Southland . And the lank mountain lion , atop some one of Mojave 's grizzled crags , remonstrant at encroaching habitation , raises his voice in melancholy yowl.
