OuR readers will remember that at the close of the narrative in the March issue , ' A Soldier of the Legion , ' Sergeant Morlae , who is reciting his adventures , was left curled up in a newly won German trench , dropping off to sleep , with the comfortable knowledge that he was assured , with the captain 's compliments , ' of a citation . The narraI ive is resumed at that point . IT seemed but a few minutes when I was awakened by Collette and Marcel , who offered me a steaming cup of coffee , half a loaf of bread , and some Swiss cheese . This food had been brought from the rear while I was lying asleep . My appetite was splendid , and when Sergeant Malvoisin offered me a drink of rum in a canteen that he took from a dead German , I accepted gratefully . Just then the agent de liaison appeared , with the order to assemble the section , and in column of one , second section at thirty-metres interval , to return the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were visible at two to three metres . The bombardment had died down and the quiet was hardly disturbed by occasional shots . Our captain marched ahead of the second section , swinging a cane and contentedly puffing on his pipe . Nearly everybody was smoking . As we marched along we noticed that new trenches had been dug during the night from sixty to a hundred metres in rear of the position we had held , and were filled by the Twenty-ninth Chasscur Regiment , which replaced us . Very cunningly these trenches were arranged . They were deep and narrow , fully seven feet deep and barely a yard wide . At every favorable point , on every little rise in the ground , a salient had been constructed , projecting out from the main trench ten to fifteen metres , protected by heavy logs , corrugated steel sheets , and two to three feet of dirt . Each side of the salients bristled with machine-guns . Any attack upon this position would be bound to fail , owing to the intense volume of fire that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To make assurance doubly sure , the Engineer Corps had dug rows of cup-shaped bowls , two feet in diameter , two feet deep , leaving but a narrow wedge of dirt between each two ; and in the centre of each bowl was placed a six-pointed twisted steel porcupine . ' This instrument , however it is placed , always presents a sharp point right at you . Five rows of these man-traps I counted , separated by a thin wall of dirt , not strong enough to maintain the weight of a man , so that any one who attempted to rush past would be thrown against the ' porcupine ' and be spitted like a pigeon . As an additional precaution a mass of barbed wire lay in rolls , ready to be placed in front of this ouvrage , to make it safe against any surprise . We marched along , talking and chatting , discussing this and that , without a care in the world . Every one hoped we were going to the rear to recuperate and enjoy a good square meal and a 813 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . He was rather dirty , and so was I. My puttees dangled in pieces round my calves . It seems I had torn them going through the German wire the day before . I told Haeflle to keep his eyes open for a good pair on some dead man . He said he would . The company marched round the hill we descended so swiftly yesterday and , describing a semi-circle , entered again the Selditzengraben Spandau and marched back in the direction we had come from . The trench , however , presented a different appearance . The bad places had been repaired , the loose dirt had been shoveled out , and the dead had disappeared . On the east side of the trench an extremely high parapet had been built . This parapet was complete even to loop-holes  - -   - -  -  rather funny-looking loop-holes , I thought ; and when I looked closer , I saw that they were framed in by boots ! I reached my hand into several of them as we walked along , and touched the limbs of dead men . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had placed the dead Germans on top of the ground , feet flush with the inside of the ditch , leaving from six to seven inches between two bodies , and laying another body cross-wise on top of the two , spanning the gap between them . Then they had shoveled the dirt on top of them , thus killing two birds with one stone . The discovery created a riot of excitement among the men . Curses intermingled with laughter came from ahead of us . Everybody was tickled by the ingenuity of our genie . ' They are marvelous ! ' we thought . Dowd 's face showed consternation , yet he could not help smiling . Little King was pale around the mouth , yet his lips were twisted in a grin . It was horribly amusing . Every 200 metres we passed groups of the One Hundred and Seventieth , on duty in the trench . The front line they told us , was twelve hundred me : tres farther east , and this trench form . ed the second line for their regiment . We entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yester. day to surrender , and continued marching in the same direction ? always east . Here we had a chance to investigate the erstwhile German habitations . Exactly forty paces apart doorways opened into the dirt bank , and from each of them fourteen steps descend . ed at about forty-five degrees into a cellar-like room . The stairs were built of wood and the sides of the stairways and the chambers below were lined with one-inch pine boards . These domiciles must have been quite comfortable and safe , but now they were choked with bodies . As we continued our leisurely way , we met some of our trench-cleaners and they recited their experiences with gusto . The Germans , they told us , pointing down into the charnel-houses , refused to come and give up , and even fired at them when summoned to sur . render . " Then what did you do ? ' I asked . ' Very simple , ' answered one . ' We stood on the top of the ground right above the door and hurled grenade after grenade through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went to the next hole and did the same thing . It was n't at all dangerous , ' he added , ' and it was very effective . ' We moved but slowly along the trench , and every once in a while there was a halt while some of the men investigated promising prospects , ' where the holes packed with dead Germans held out some promise of loot . Owing to the order of march , the first company was the last one in line , and my section at the very end . The head of the column was the fourth company , then the third , then the second , and then we . By the time my section came to any hole holding out hopes of souvenirs , there was nothing left for us . Yet I did find a German officer with a new pair of puttees , and , hastily unwinding them , I discarded my own and put on the new ones . As I bound them on I noticed the name on the tag ? ' Hindenburg . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We left the trench and swung into another communication trench , going to the left , still in an easterly direction , straight on toward the Butte de Souain . That point we knew was still in the hands of the Germans , and very quickly they welcomed us . Shells came shrieking down ? 105 mm. , 150 , 210 , and 250 . It 's very easy to tell when you are close to them , even if you ca n't see a thing . When a big shell passes high , it sounds like a white-hot piece of iron suddenly doused in cold water ; but when it gets close , the sw-i-ish suddenly rises in a high crescendo , a shriek punctuated by a horrible roar . The uniformity of movement as the men ducked was beautiful ? and they all did it One moment there was a line of gray helmets bobbing up and down the trenches as the line plodded on ; and the next instant one could see only a line of black canvas close to the ground , as every man ducked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been blown to pieces when I was buried , and I felt uncomfortably handicapped with only my musette for protection against steel splinters . About a mile from where we entered this boyau we came to a temporary halt , then went on once more . The fourth company had come to a halt , and we squeezed past them as we marched along . Every man of them had his shovel out and had commenced digging a niche for himself . We passed the fourth company , then the third , then the second , and finally the first , second , and third sections of our owncompany . Just beyond , we ourselves came to a halt and , lining up one man to the metre , started to organize the trench for defensive purposes . From the other side of a slight ridge , east of us and about six hundred metres away , came the sound of machine-guns . Between us and the ridge the Germans were executing a very lively feu de barrage , a screen of fire prohibiting any idea of sending reinforcements over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the major of the battalion , a captain , and three sergeants of the etat-major . Two of the sergeants were at the trench telephone , and I could hear them report the news to the officers . The Germans , ' they reported , are penned in on three sides and are prevented from retreating by our artillery . ' Twice they had attempted to pierce our line between them and the Butte de Souain , and twice they were driven back . Good news for us ! At 10 A.M. we sent three men from each section to the rear for the soup . At about eleven they reappeared with steaming marmites of soup , stew , coffee , and buckets of wine . The food was very good , and disappeared to the last morsel . After eating , the captains granted me permission to walk along the ditch back to the fourth company . The trench being too crowded for comfort , I walked alongside to the second company , and searched for my friend , Sergeant Velte . Finally I found him lying in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morin . All three were dead , torn to pieces by one shell shortly after we had passed them in the morning . At the third company they reported that Second Lieutenant Sweeny had been shot through the chest by a lost ball that morning . Hard luck for Sweeny ! ' The poor devil had Lieutenant Sweeny has returned to America . just been nominated sous-lieutenant at the request of the French Embassy in Washington , and when he was attached as supernumerary to the third company we all had hopes that he would have a chance to prove his merit . In the fourth company the losses were also severe . The part of the trench occupied by the three companies was directly enfiladed by the German batteries on the Butte de Souain , and every little while a shell would fall square into the ditch and take toll from the occupants . Our company was fully a thousand metres nearer to these batteries , but the trenches we occupied presented a three-quarter face to the fire , and consequently were ever so much harder to hit . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hors de combat in the fourth section . In my section two niches were demolished without any one being hit . Time dragged slowly until four in the afternoon , when we had soup again . Many of the men built little fires , and with the Erbsenwurst they had found on dead Germans prepared a very palatable soup by way of extra rations . At four o'clock sentries were posted and everybody fell asleep . A steady rain was falling , and to keep dry we hooked one edge of our t ent-sheet on the ground above the niche and put dirt on top of it to hold . Then we pushed cartridges through the button-holes of the tent , pinning them into the side of the trench and forming a good cover for the occupant of the hole . Thus we rested until the new day broke , bringing a clear sky and sunshine . This day , the 27th , ? the third of the battle , ? passed without mishap to my section . We spent our time eating and sleeping , mildly distracted by an intermittent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We were getting weary of inactivity , and it was rather hard work to keep the men in the ditch . They sneaked off singly and in pairs , always heading back to the German dug-outs , all bent on turning things up . side down in the hope of finding something of value to carry as a keepsake . Haeffle came back once with three automatic pistols but no cartridges . From another trip he returned with an officer 's helmet , and the third time he brought triumphantly back a string three feet long of dried sausages . Haef. fie always did have a healthy appetite , and it transpired that on the way hack he had eaten a dozen sausages , more or less . The dried meat had made him thirsty and he had drunk half a canteen of water on top of it . The result was , he swelled up like a poisoned pup , and for a time he was surely a sick man . Zinn found two shiny German bap. nets , a long thin one and one short and heavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to . Zinn hailed from Battle Creek and wanted to use them as brush-knives on camping trips in the Michigan woods ; but alas , in the sequel they got too heavy and were dropped along the road . One man found a Ger . man pipe with a three-foot soft-rubber stem , which he intending sending to his brother as a souvenir , Man and pipe are buried on the slopes of the Butte de Souain . He died that same evening . At the usual time ? 4 P.M. - we had soup , and immediately after came the order to get ready . Looking over the trench , we watched the fourth company form in the open back of the ditch and , marching past us in an oblique direction , disappear round a spur of wooded hill . The third company followed at four hundred metres distance , then the second , and as they passed out of sight around the hill , we jumped out and , forming in line sections at thirty-metre intervals , each company four hundred metres in the rear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bretelle . We were quite unobserved by the enemy , and marched the length of the hill for three fourths of a kilometre , keeping just below the crest . Above us sailed four big French battle-planes and some small aero scouts , on the lookout for enemy aircraft . For a while it seemed as if we should not be discovered , and the command was given to lie down . From where we lay we could observe clearly the ensuing scrap in the air , and it was worth watching . Several German planes had approached close to our lines , but were discovered by the swift-flying scouts . Immediately the little fellows returned with the news to the big planes , and we watched the monster biplanes mount to the combat . In a wide circle they swung , climbing , climbing higher and higher , and then headed in a bee-line straight toward the German Tauben . As they approached within range of each other , we saw little clouds appear close to the German planes , some in front , some over them , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of the 32 nun . guns mounted on our battle-planes floated down to us , immediately followed like an echo by the crack of the bursting shell . Long before the Germans could get within effective range for their machine-guns , they were peppered by our planes and ignominiously forced to beat a retreat . One Albatross seemed to be hit . He staggered from one side to the other , then dipped forward , and , standing straight on his nose , dropped like a stone out of sight behind the forest crowning the hill . Again we moved on , and shortly arrived at the southern spur of the hill . Here the company made a quarter turn to the left , and in the same formation began the ascent of the hill . The second company was just disappearing into the scrubby pine forest on top . We entered also , continued on to the top , VOL. 1.77 - NO. 6 and halted just below the crest . The captain called the officers and sergeants , and , following him , we crawled on our stomachs up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forget the panorama that spread before us ! The four thin ranks of the second company seemed to stagger drunkenly through a sea of green fire and smoke . One moment gaps showed in the lines , only to be closed again as the rear files spurted . Undoubtedly they ran at top speed , but to us watchers they seemed to crawl , and at times almost to stop . Mixed in with the dark green of the grass covering the valley were rows of lighter color , telling of the men who fell in that mad sprint . The continuous bombardment sounded like a giant drum beating an incredibly swift rata-plan . Along the whole length of our hill this curtain of shells was dro ; Jping , leveling the forest and seemingly beating off the very face of the hill itself , clean down to the bottom of the valley . Owing to the proximity of our troops to the enemy 's batteries , we received hardly any support from our own big guns , and the role of the combatants was entirely reversed . The Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the company descended into the valley the pace became slower , and at the beginning of the opposite slope they halted and faced back . Owing to the height of the Butte de Souain , they were safe , and they considered that it was their turn to act as spectators . As our captain rose we followed and took our places in front of our sections . Again I impressed upon the minds of my men the importance of following in a straight line and as close behind one another as possible . ' Anne a la main ! ' came the order , and slowly we moved to the crest and then , immediately broke into a dog-trot . Instantly we were enveloped in flames and smoke . Hell kissed us welcome ! Closely I watched the captain for the sign to increase our speed . I could have run a mile in record time , but he plugged steadily along , one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four , ? at a tempo of a hundred and eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regulation tempo . Inwardly I cursed his insistence upon having things reglementaires . As I looked at the middle of his back , longing for him to hurry , I caught sight , on my right , of a shell exploding directly in the centre of the third section . Out of the tail of my eye I saw the upper part of Corporal Keraudy 's body rise slowly into the air . The legs had disappeared , and with arms outstretched the trunk sank down on the corpse of Varma , the Hindu , who had marched behind him . Instinctively , I almost stopped in my tracks : Keraudy was a friend of mine ; but at the instant Corporal Mettayer , running behind me , bumped into my back , and shoved me again into life and action . We were out of the woods then , and running down the bare slope of the hill . A puff of smoke , red-hot , smote me in the face , and at the same moment intense pain shot up my jaw . I did not think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . Some one in the second section intoned the regimental march , Allone , Giron . ' Others took it up ; and there , in that scene of death and hell , this song portraying the lusts and vices of the Legion Etrangere became a very pwan of enthusiasm and courage . Glancing to the right , I saw that we were getting too close to the second section , so I gave the signal for a left oblique . We bore away from them until once again at our thirty paces distance . All at once my feet tangled up in something and I almost fell . It was long grass ! Just then it seemed to grow upon my mind that we were down in the valley and out of range of . the enemy . Then I glanced ahead , and not over a hundred metres away I saw the second company lying in the grass and watching us coming . As we neared , they shouted little pleasantries at us and congratulated us upon our speed . Why this unseemly haste ? ' one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' answers Haeffle . Merci , mon ami ! ' retorts the first ; I have just come through his back kitchen . ' Counting my section , I missed Dubois , St. Hilaire , and Schueli . Collette , Joe told me , was left on the hill . The company had lost two sergeants , one corporal , and thirteen men coming down that short stretch ! We mustered but forty-five men , all told . One , Sergeant Terisien , had commanded my section , the ' American Section , ' for four months but was transferred to the fourth . From where we rested we could see him slowly descending the hill , bareheaded and with his right hand clasping his left shoulder . He had been severely wounded in the head , and his left arm was nearly torn off at the shoulder . Poor devil ! He was a good comrade and a good soldier . Just before the war broke out he had finished his third enlistment in the Legion , and was in line for a discharge and pension when he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we could see the bodies of our comrades , torn and mangled and again and again kicked up into the air by the shells . For two days and nights the hellish hail continued to beat upon that blood-soaked slope , until we finally captured the Butte de Souain and forced an entire regiment of Saxons to the left of the butte to capitulate . Again we assembled in column of fours , and this time began the climb up- hill . Just then I happened to think of the blow I had received under the jaw , and feeling of the spot , discovered a slight wound under my left jaw-bone . Handing my rifle to a man , I pressed slightly upon the sore spot and pulled a steel splinter out of the wound . A very thin , long sliver of steel it was , half the diameter of a dime and not more than a dime 's thickness , but an inch and a half long . The metal was still hot to the touch . The scratch continued bleeding freely , but I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needing my emergency dressing farther along . Up near the crest of the hill we halted in an angle of the woods and lay down alongside the One Hundred and Seventy-Second Regiment of infantry . They had made the attack in this direction on the 25th , but had been severely checked at this point . Infantry and machine-gun fire sounded very close , and lost bullets by the hundreds flicked through the branches overhead . The One Hundred and Seventy-Second informed us that a battalion of the Premier Etranger had entered the forest and was at that moment storming a position to our immediate left . Through the trees showed lights , brighter than day , cast from hundreds of German magnesium candles shot into the air . Our officers were grouped with those of the other regiment , and after a very long conference they separated , each to his command . Our captain called the officers and subalterns of the company together , and in terse sentences explained to us our positions and the object of the coming assault . It was to be a purely local affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hill we were on . On a map drawn to scale he pointed out the lay of the land . It looked to me like a hard proposition . Imagine a tooth-brush about a mile long and three eighths to one half a mile wide . The back is formed by the summit of the hill , which is densely wooded , and the hairs of the brush are represented by four little ridges rising from the valley we had just crossed , each one crowned with strips of forest and uniting with the main ridge at right angles . Between each two lines of hair are open spaces , from one hundred to one hundred and fifty metres wide . We , of the second regiment , were to deliver the assault parallel with the hairs and stretching from the crest down to the valley . The other column was to make a demonstration from our left , running a general course at right angles to ours . The time set was eight o'clock at night . Returning to our places , we informed the men of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed a group of men come from the edge of the woods and form into company formation , and we could hear them answer to the roll-call . I went over and peered at them . On their coat-collars I saw the gilt No. 1 . It was the Premier Etranger . As the roll-call proceeded , I wondered . The sergeant was deciphering with difficulty the names from his little carnet , and response after response was , Mort . ' Once in a while the answer changed to ' Mort sur le champ d'honneur , ' or a brief ' Tombe . ' There were twenty-two men in line , not counting the sergeant and a corporal , who in rear of the line supported himself precariodsly on two rifles which served him as crutches . Two more groups appeared back of this one , and the same proceeding was repeated . As I stood near the second group I could just catch the responses of the survivors . Duvivier ' Present . ' ? Selonti ' Present . ' ? Boismort " rombe . ' ? Herkis ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ? ' MacDonald ' : Presen t . ' ? ' Farnsworth ' : Mort sur le champ d'honneur , ' responded MacDonald . Several of the men I had known , Farnsworth among them . One officer , a second lieutenant , commanded the remains of the battalion . Seven hundred and fifty men , he informed me , had gone in an hour ago , and less than two hundred came back . Ah , mon ami , ' he told me , c'est bien chaud dans le bois . ' Quietly they turned into column of fours and disappeared in the darkness . Their attack had failed . Owing to the protection afforded by the trees , our aerial scouts had failed to gather definite information of the defenses constructed in the forest , and owing also to the same cause , our previous bombardment had been ineffective . It was our job to remedy this . One battalion of the One Hundred and Seventy-Second was detached and placed in line with us , and at 8 P.M. sharp the major 's whistle sounded , echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edge of the forest , shoulder to shoulder , bayonets fixed . Quietly each corporal examined the rifles of his men , inspected the magazines , and saw that each chamber also held a cartridge with firing-pin down . As silently as possible we entered between the trees and carefully kept in touch with each other . It was dark in there , and we had moved along some little distance before our eyes were used to the blackness . As I picked my steps I prepared myself for the shock every man experiences at the first sound of a volley . Twice I fell down into shell-holes and cursed my clumsiness and that of some other fellows to my right . The " Dutch " must be asleep , ' I thought , or else they beat it . ' Hopefully the latter ! We were approaching the farther edge of the tooth-brush bristle , ' and breathlessly we halted at the edge of the little open space before us . About eighty metres across loomed the black line of another ' row of hairs . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we kept in line , still slowly and cautiously , carefully putting one foot before the other . Suddenly from the darkness in front of us came four or five heavy reports like the noise of a shot-gun , followed by a long hiss . Into the air streamed trails of sparks . Above our heads the hiss ended with a sharp crack , and everything stood revealed as though it were broad daylight . At the first crash , the major , the captains ? everybody , it seemed to me ? yelled at the same time , ' En avant ! Pas de charge ! ' ? and in full run , with fixed bayonets , we flew across the meadow . As we neared the woods we were met by solid sheets of steel balls . Roar upon roar came from the forest ; the volleys came too fast , it shot into my mind , to be well aimed . Then something hit me on the chest and I fell sprawling . Barbed wire ! Everybody seemed to be on the ground at once , crawling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grasped my parabellum . It was a German weapon , German charges , German cartridges . This time the Germans were to get a taste of their own medicine , I thought . Lying on my back , I wormed through the wire , butting into the men in front of me and getting kicked in the head by Mettayer . As I crawled I could hear the ping-ping of balls striking the wire , and the shrill moan as they glanced off and continued on their flight . Putting out my hand , I felt loose dirt , and , lying flat , peered over the parapet . ' Nobody home . ' I thought ; and then I saw one of the Collette brothers in the trench come running toward me and ahead of him a burly Boche . I could see Joe make a one-handed lunge with the rifle , and the bayonet showed fully a foot in front of the German 's chest . Reforming , we advanced towara the farther fringe of the little forest . Half- way through the trees we lay down flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , very slowly , wormed our way past the trees into the opening between us and our goal . Every man had left his knapsack in front or else hanging on the barbed wire , and we were in good shape for the work that lay ahead . But the sections and companies were inextricably mixed . On one side of me crawled a lieutenant of the One Hundred and Seventy-Second and on the other a private I had never seen before . Still we were all in line , and when some one shouted , Feu de quatre cartouches ! ' we fired four rounds , and after the command all crawled again a few paces nearer . Several times we halted to fire , aiming at the sheets of flame spurting toward us . Over the Germans floated several parachute magnesium rockets , sent up by our own men , giving a vivid light and enabling us to shoot with fair accuracy . I think now that the German fire was too high . Anyway , I did not notice any one in my immediate vicinity getting hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the main wire entanglement . All corporals in the French Army carry wire-nippers , and it was our corporals ' business to open a way through the entanglement . Several men to my right I could see one ? he looked like Mettayer ? lying flat on his back and , nippers in hand , snipping away at the wire overhead , while all of us behind kept up a murderous and constant fire at the enemy . Mingled with the roar of the rifles came the stuttering rattle of the machine-guns , at moments drowned by the crash of hand-grenades . Our grenadiers had rather poor success with their missiles , however , most of them hitting trees in front of the trench . The lieutenant on my left had four grenades . I could see him plainly . With one in his hand , he crawled close to the wire , rolled on his back , rested an instant with arms extended , both hands grasping the grenade , then suddenly he doubled forward and back and sent the bomb flying over his head . For two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we listened , and then came the roar of the explosion . He smiled and nodded to me , and again went through the same manoeuvre . In the meantime I kept my parabellum going . I had nine magazines loaded with dum-dum balls I had taken from some dead Germans , and I distributed the balls impartially between three erineaux in front of me . On my right , men were surging through several breaks in the wire . Swiftly I rolled over and over toward the free lane and went through with a rush . The combat had become a hand-grenade affair . Our grenadiers crawled alongside the parapet and at regular intervals tossed one of their missiles into it , while the others , shooting over their heads , potted the Germans as they ran to the rear . Suddenly the fusillade ceased , and with a crash , it seemed , silence and darkness descended upon us . The sudden cessation of the terrific rifle-firing and of the constant rattling of the machine-guns struck one like a blow . Sergeant Altoffer brought me some information about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to shout ! ' I 'm not deaf yet , ' I assured him . Mon vieux , ' he raged , ' it ' s you who are shouting ! ' I realized my fault and apologized , and in return accepted a drink of wine from his canteen . Finding the captain , we were ordered . to assemble the men and maintain the trench , and after much searching I found a few men of the section . The little scrap had cost us three more men . Subiron , Dowd , and Zinn were wounded and sent to the rear . The One Hundred and Seventy-Second sent a patrol toward the farthest , the last hair of the tooth-brush , with orders to reconnoitre thoroughly . An hour passed and they had not returned . Twenty minutes more went by , still no patrol . Rather curious , we thought . No rifle-shots had come from that direction , nor any noise such as would be heard during a combat with the bayonet . The major 's patience gave way , and our captain received orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose King , Delpeuch , and Birchler . All three had automatics ? King a parabellum , Delpeuch and Birchler , Brownings . They left their rifles , bayonets , and cartridge-boxes behind , and in Indian file followed me at a full run in an oblique direction past the front of the company , and , when half way across the clearing , following my example , fell fiat on the ground . We rested a while to regain our wind and then began to slide on our stomachs at right angles to our first course . We were extremely careful to remain silent . Every little branch and twig we moved carefully out of our way ; with one hand extended we felt of the ground before us as we hitched ourselves along . So silent was our progress that several times I felt in doubt about any one being behind me and rested motionless until I felt the touch of Delpeuch 's hand upon my foot . After what seemed twenty minutes , we again changed direction , this time straight toward the trees looming close to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lying still as death listened for sounds of the enemy . All was absolutely quiet ; only the branches rustled overhead in a light breeze . A long time we lay there , . but heard no sound . We began to feel somewhat creepy , and I was tempted to pull my pistol and let nine shots rip into the damnable stillness before us . However , I refrained , and touching my neighbor , started crawling along the edge of the wood . Extreme care was necessary , owing to the numberless branches littering the ground . The sweat was rolling down my face . Again we listened and again we were baffled by that silence . I was angry then and started to crawl between the trees . A tiny sound of metal scratching upon metal and I almost sank into the ground ! Quickly I felt reassured . It was my helmet touching a strand of barbed wire . Still no sound ! Boldly we rose and , standing behind trees , scanned the darkness . Over to our right we saw a glimmer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully before the other , moved toward it . When opposite we halted and ? I swore . From the supposed trench of the enemy came the hoarse voice of an apparently drunken man , singing the chanson ' La Riviera . ' Another voice offered a toast to ' La Legion . ' Carelessly we made our way through the barbed wire , crawling under and stepping over the strands , jumped over a ditch , and looked down into what seemed to be an underground palace . There they were ? the six men of the One Hundred and Seventy-Second ? three of them lying stiff and stark on benches , utterly drunk . Two were standing up disputing , and the singer sat in an arm-chair , holding a long-stemmed glass in his hand . Close by him were several unopened bottles of champagne on the table . Many empty bottles littered the floor . The singer welcomed us with a shout and an open hand , to which we , however , did not immediately respond . The heartbreaking work while approaching this place rankled in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of any help , while two of the men were crying , locked in each others ' arms . Another was asleep , and our friend the singer absolutely refused to budge . So , after I had stowed two bottles inside my shirt ( an example punctiliously followed by the others ) , we returned . Leaving Birchler at the wire , I placed King in the middle of the clearing , Delpeuch near the edge of the wood held by us , and then reported . The captain passed the word along to the major , and on the instant we were ordered to fall in and in column of two marched over to the abandoned trench , following the line marked by my men . As we entered and disposed ourselves therein , I noticed all the officers , one after the other , disappear in the palace . Another patrol was sent out by our company , and , after ranging the country in our front , returned safely . That night it happened to be the second company 's turn to mount outposts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fig e men in each , march out into the night and somewhere , each in some favorable spot , they placed themselves at a distance of about one hundred metres away to watch , while we slept the sleep of the just . Day came , and with it the corv ? e carrying hot coffee and bread . After breakfast another corvee was sent after picks and shovels , and the men were set to work remodeling the trench , shifting the parapet to the other side , building little outpost trenches and setting barbed wire . The latter job was done in a wonderfully short time , thanks to German thoroughness , since for the stakes to which the wire is tied the Boches had substituted soft iron rods , three quart ers of an inch thick , twisted five times in the shape of a great corkscrew . This screw twisted into the ground exactly like a cork-puller into a cork . The straight part of the rod , being twisted upon itself down and up again every ten inches , formed six or seven small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Into these eyes the barbed wire was laid and solidly secured with short lengths of tying wire . First cutting the tying wire , we lifted the barbed wire out of the eyes , shoved a small stick through one , and , turning the rod with the leverage of the stick , unscrewed it out of the ground and then , reversing the process , screwed it in again . The advantage of this rod is obvious . When a shell falls in the midst of this wire protection , the rods are ben t and twisted , but unless broken off short they always support the wire , and even after a severe bombardment present a serious obstacle to the assaulters . In such cases wooden posts are blown to smithereens by the shells , and when broken off let the wire fall fiat to the ground . As I was walking up and down , watching the work , I noticed a large box , resting bottom up in a deep hole opening from the trench . Dragging the box out and turning it over , I experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my astonished eyes , resting upon a little platform of boards , stood a neat little centrifugal pump painted green , and on the base of it in raised iron letters I read the words , ' Byron Jackson , San Francisco . ' I felt queer at the stomach for an instant . San Francisco ! my home town ! Before my eyes passed pictures of Market Street and the ' Park . ' In fancy I was one of the Sunday crowd at the Cliff House . How could this pump have got so far from home ? Many times I had passed the very place where it was made . How , I wonder , did the Boche get this pump ? Before the war , or through Holland ? A California-built pump to clean water out of German trenches , in France ! It was astonishing ! With something like reverence I put the pump back again and , going to my place in the trench , dug out one of my bottles of champagne and stood treat to the crowd . Somehow , I felt almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man sitting on the edge of the ditch , surrounded by naked branches , busy cutting them into two-foot lengths and tying them together in the shape of a cross . I asked him how many he was making , and he told me that he expected to work all day to supply the crosses needed along one battalion front . French and German were treated alike , he assured me . There was absolutely no difference in the size of the crosses . As we worked , soup arrived , and when that was disposed of , the men rested for some hours . We were absolutely unmolested except by our officers . But at one o'clock that night we were again assembled in marching kit , each man with an extra pick or shovel , and marched along parallel with our trench to the summit of the butte . There we installed ourselves in the main line , out of which the Germans were driven by the One Hundred and Seventy-Second . There was no work of any kind to be done , and quickly we found some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material found in dug-outs brewed some really delightful beverages . Mine was a mixture of wine and water out of Haeffle 's canteen , judiciously blended with chocolate . The weather was delightful , and we spent the afternoon lying in sunny spots , " shifting once in awhile out of the encroaching shade into the warm rays . We had no idea where the Germans were ? somewhere in front , of course , but just how far or how near mattered little to us . Anyhow , the One Hundred and Seventy-Second was fully forty metres nearer to them than we were , and we could see and hear the first-line troops picking and shoveling their way into the ground . Little King was , as usual , making the round of the company , trying to find some one to build a fire and get water if he , King , would furnish the chocolate . He found no takers and soon he laid himself down , muttering about the laziness of the outfit . Just as we were dozing , deliciously , an agonized yell brought every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found a man sitting on the ground , holding his leg below the knee with both hands , and moaning as he rocked back and forth , ' Jo suis blesse ! Je suis blessed ' Brushing his hands aside , I examined his leg . There was no blood . I took off the puttee , rolled up his trousers , and discovered no sign of a wound . On my asking the man again where the wound was , he passed his hand over a small red spot on his shin . Just then another man picked up a small piece of shell , and then the explanation dawned upon me . The Germans were shooting at our planes straight above us ; a bit of shell had come down and hit our sleeper on the shin-bone . Amid a gale of laughter he limped away to a more sympathetic audience . Several more pieces of iron fell near us , Some fragments were no joking matter , being the entire rear ends of three-inch shells , weighing , I should think , fully seven pounds . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup we had roast mutton , one small slice per man , and a mixture of white beans , rice , and string beans . There was coffee , and one cup of wine per man , and , best of all , tobacco . As we munched our food , our attention was attracted to the sky above by an intense cannonade directed against several of our aeroplanes sailing east . As we looked , more and more of our war-birds appeared . Whipping out my glasses , I counted fifty-two machines . Another man counted sixty . Haeflie had it a hundred . The official report next day stated fifty-nine . They were flying very high and in very open formation , winging due east . The shells were breaking ahead of them and he- tween them . The heaven was studded with hundreds upon hundreds of beautiful little round grayish clouds , each one the nimbus of a bursting shell . With my prismatics glued to my eyes I watched closely for one falling bird . Though it seemed incredible at the moment , not one faltered or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red painted sky . For several minutes after they had sailed out of my sight I could still hear the roar of the guns . Only one machine , the official report said , was shot down , and that one fell on the return trip . Just before night fell , we all set to work cutting pine branches , and with the tips prepared soft beds for ourselves . Sentries were placed , one man per section , and we laid ourselves down to sleep . The night passed quietly ; again the day started with the usual hot coffee and bread . Soup and stew at 10 A.M. , and the same again at 4 P.M. One more quiet night , and quiet the following day . We were becoming somewhat restless with the monotony , but were cheered by the captain . That night , he told us , we should return to Suippes , and there reform the regiment and rest . The programme sounded good , but I felt very doubtful , we had heard the same tale so many times and so many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ es had brought the same news from the kitchen . At least twenty times different telephonists and agents de liaison had brought the familiar story . The soup corv ( tes assured us that the drivers of the rolling kitchens had orders to hitch up and pull out toward Souain and Suippes . The telephonists had listened to the order transmitted over the wires . The agents de liaison had overheard the major telling other officers that he had received marching orders , and , ma foil each time each one was wrong ! ' So , after all , I was not much disappointed when the order came to unmake the sacks . We stayed that night and all day , and when the order to march the next evening came , all of us were surprised , including the captain . I was with the One Hundred and Seventy-Second having some fun with a little Belgian . I had come upon him in the dark and had watched him in growing wonder at his actions . There he was , stamping up and down , every so often stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curses . I asked him what was the matter . ' Rion , mon sergent , ' he replied . Je m ' excite . ' Pourquoi r I demanded . ' Ah , ' he told me , look , ' ? pointing out toward the German line ,  - -  -  out there lies my friend , dead , with three pounds of my chocolate in his musette , and when I 'm good and mad , I 'm going out to get it ! ' I hope he got it ! That night at 7 o'clock we left the hill , marched through Souain four miles to Suippes , and sixteen miles farther on , at St. Hilaire , we camped . A total of twenty-six miles for the day . At Suippes the regiment passed in parade march before some officer of the kat-major , and we were counted : eight hundred and fifty-two in the entire regiment , out of three thousand two hundred who entered the attack on the 25th of September !
