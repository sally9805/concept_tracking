WE all know that we are influenced by the weather . That is why we talk about it so much . Yet few of us have any definite idea of how it affects us . Do we work most slowly in hot weather or at some other season ? Is brain-work influenced in the same way as physical work ? Is a uniform climate like that of California the best , or a changeable one like that of Massachusetts ? Is the effect of the weather produced chiefly through its external influence on the senses or through some more subtle internal influence ? We know that we enjoy the clear , sunny days which prevail so constantly in the drier parts of America , and which frequently cheer other parts of the country . Do we really work faster on these days than on others ? Most of us are ready to answer these questions , but our answers do not agree . Stop a minute and write the answers to the questions that have just been asked ; state the kind of day when you are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a cold one ? Clear , cloudy , or rainy ? And at what time of the year ? In this article I purpose to answer these questions ? not - according to the opinion of one person or of many , but according to the observed experiences of , for example , factory operatives in Connecticut and students at Annapolis and West Point . Certain individuals may be affected differently from those whose records are here considered . A few may be almost independent of the weather . Yet we may safely say that if several hundred readers of this magazine should be selected haphazard and put at some mechanical work or set to studying , the chances are that they would react essentially as did the operatives and students . If this is so , the kind of investigations here outlined will in time lead to many valuable results . For instance , we shall be able to determine in what parts of our country or of the world the greatest amount of either mental or physical work can be accomplished . We shall be able to measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various races , and shall use these differences as the basis for determining where factories , schools , or other institutions can most profitably be located . We shall find that certain climatic conditions which seem pleasant are in reality debilitating . And , above all , we shall discover exactly what conditions are most harmful in such places as the tropics . With this knowledge we shall go to work , not to change the climate , but to supply some sort of stimulus or other corrective which shall overcome the effects of the specific meteorological conditions which are proving most harmful . In order to discover these things the first requisite is to find out exactly what people are doing to-day under various climatic conditions . This is difficult , for the effect of the climate of two places such as Chicago and Vera Cruz , for example , can not be compared directly . Exactly the same kind of people are not found in both places , and many other conditions are also wholly different . Hence the best method is to take people in some places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how their work varies from month to month . For this purpose I have obtained the records of over five hundred operatives in three factories in Connecticut . All three are exceptionally well managed and have a most careful system of accounting . In all cases the responsible officials were most helpful in facilitating my work . They kindly selected several groups of the steadiest operatives who were doing piece-work and whose output was not limited by the fear that their wages would be cut if they worked too fast and thereby earned too much .  | The wages of the operatives depended solely on their own individual feelings . A hundred causes may , of course , enter into these feelings . One man may have eaten something that disagreed with him ; another 's wife may have scolded him for not earning enough last week ; another may want to send his child to school ; and a fourth may have had a death in his family . If only a single individual is considered , his wages will vary from causes of this sort much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , however , such exceptional circumstances do not occur every day , and the majority of people work for weeks at a time without being much influenced by them . Moreover , when the wages of large numbers of people are averaged , the purely individual circumstances neutralize one an- other . When Peter MacSheane works slowly because of a sore hand , Gustave Olsen works fast because he is going to be married . Hence , if we have enough people , we may be quite sure that when we find pronounced differences between the amount of work done on different days , it is due to influences which affect all the operatives and not merely single individuals . It is much harder to weigh the work of a man 's brain than that of his hands . Nevertheless , something can be done . Through the courtesy of the officers at West Point and Annapolis , I have been able to secure the average marks of nearly sixteen hundred students , either week by week or day by day , for a period of six years at Annapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant pressure brought to bear upon the students by their instructors , and the distractions due to football , vacations , and social festivities , their marks are not so good a test as the work done by factory operatives . Yet in spite of this they show clearly that there is a direct relationship between climate and mental efficiency . Since the factory work is the more important , let us begin with that . The first and most obvious results are summed up in Fig. 1 . This represents the fluctuations in wages week by week for four successive years , 1910-1913 . The height of the curves shows the average wages earned per hour , making full allowance for holidays , short time , and other irregularities . The figures have been reduced to percentages because the scale of wages varies in different departments , and men receive about twice as much as women . By using percentages the different groups can be combined . The upper curve is based on the work of about sixty people at Bridgeport . These people were tending machines . Some were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into holes in which the sockets of electric lights are stamped out . All the work was of this nature , not requiring much skill , but demanding quickness and concentration . The curves for the next three years are based on a factory at New Britain . Both men and girls are  | included in approximately equal numbers . The girls were mostly from six teen to twenty years of age . They were Americans by birth , but of varied descent , chiefly Irish , German , Scandinavian , English , and other north Europeans . Their work was the packing of hinges or screws , which are first wrapped in paper and then placed in pasteboard boxes . The men were of all ages , and were in general of the same races as the girls . They were engaged in buffing hinges . That is , they take the completed hinges and smooth them upon rapidly revolving cloth buffs covered with emery dust . Then the hinges are plated , and are polished by another set of men whose records have also been used . The wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but upon the number of pieces which are rejected . In other words , the wages vary not only according to speed , but according to accuracy . At first a new-comer 's work is of course slow , and where screws are being packed the girls ' fingers are made sore for a few weeks . Soon , however , a fairly stable degree of speed is obtained , and thereafter variations depend upon outside causes . So far as possible new operatives have been avoided in our tabulations . The data from a third factory at New Haven are not yet extensive enough to be used in the curves of Figs 1 , but they are used in other connections . At this factory wires are wound for armatures and electrical coils of various kinds . The simplest work consists of winding a layer of wire on a cylinder , wrapping the coil thus formed in a piece of oiled paper , winding another layer of wire , and so on until the completed coil is ready to be sawed off . In other departments twenty or thirty processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tying of tape and the setting of gages , are required . Elsewhere the different parts of armatures are assembled to make the completed articles . Thus , in this factory greater diversity of work is required than in either of the others . Taking all the operatives whose work was actually used in Fig. 1 , we have the record of over four hundred men and girls for an entire year , or the work of a single individual for about one hundred and twenty thousand days . Let us now examine the curves of Fig. 1 attentively , fixing our attention on the main ups and downs , and disregarding the minor fluctuations . Looking at the extreme left of the upper curve , we see that early in 1910 relatively little work was accomplished , so that the laborers received only 85 per cent . as much wages as they did at the maximum for that year . About the middle of January , however , the wages began to rise somewhat and continued to rise until near the end of April . Then they fell off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In general , the entire period from mid-April almost to late June was a time when the operatives worked rapidly . Then their activity declined somewhat during the summer , although in July they were still earning more than in January . This medium rate continued during July and August , but began to increase in September , and by the middle of November had reached the highest point for the year . Thereafter the wages dropped off , slightly at first , and then rapidly . In 1911 we find similar conditions . In January the amount of work accomplished was less than at any other time of the year . Then it rose irregularly and became fairly high by the middle of March . Through April and May it continued at a high level , and in June rose considerably , so that at the end of June wages were at the highest level for the year . Then they dropped off just as in the year before , but more markedly . The sudden rise at the end of August and others of the same kind at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at other times were due to accidental reasons , such as a rush of orders . After the hard work of August the wages fell a little , but soon began to increase in the normal autumn fashion , so that in the first half of November they were almost at the highest level . After that they dropped off , slightly at first , and then rapidly , just as in 1910 . At the beginning of 1912 they were again very low . This year the wages did not begin to rise so quickly as in 1910 and 1911 , and through January , February , and March they remained at almost the same low level , perhaps because that winter was unusually cold far into February . In April , however , they began a rise which cul- minated only at the end of June . They then fell off a little , but not greatly , and by the end of August were once more beginning a steady rise . In the first half of November , just as before , they were high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . The curve for the next year ( 1913 ) has similar characteristics , but does not remain low so long in the spring , and shows only faint traces of a drop in summer . Before we attempt to interpret the curves let us combine the four into a single curve . This gives us the heavy line of Fig. 1 , in which the smaller irregularities disappear . Here , even more than in the other curves , we are impressed by the fact that the lowest wages are earned during January . Then there is a rather steady increase through February , March , April , May , and the first half of June . A little after the middle of June the amount of work begins to fall off , and continues to do so for the next two or three weeks . Then , through July and August the curve remains at a lower level than in June , but much higher than during the winter , a somewhat surprising fact . About the end of August people once more begin to work fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of November . Then the rate begins to fall , but recovers somewhat in December , and finally at the end of that month drops off very rapidly . Let us now inquire what the curves mean . The fact that they all show the same features seems to mean that some common factor is at work from year to year . The variations are of considerable importance . They reach a maximum of 15 per cent . as given in the curves , but actually are more , since in these curves a certain amount of " smoothing " has been done to eliminate minor variations . Individual days vary as much as z5 per cent . and individual weeks nearly 20 per cent . What is it which causes these variations ? Let us consider the various factors which may have a bearing on the matter . In the first place may not the variations be due to exigencies in the factories ? May not the low wages in January be because the factories did not have enough orders on hand and so shut down in part ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a special rush of work at that time ? Of course , any variation of the way in which the factory is running must be reflected in the wages of the operatives , but in the present case the factory officials state that this does not seem to apply to the main variations , although it may apply to minor details . The factories here considered are engaged in making staple products for which the demand varies relatively little . There is no Christmas rush on hinges or electric-light sockets . Of course , more are sold at some seasons than at others , but these seasons are not the time when the factory hands work fastest . An operative who wants to work fast in January is quite as able to do so then as in June or November , as far as the factory is concerned . In fact , the system under which the factories are run encourages extra exertion . In the  | Bridgeport factory half of the men were working upon the plan known as " premium " work . That is , the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated according to the number of hours which they are supposed to require . If a man does an eight-hour task he is to be paid for eight hours , even though it takes him ten . If , however , he succeeds in doing the work in less than the stipulated time , he is still to be paid for eight hours . Moreover , the wages for a particular kind of work are not to be reduced even though an eighthour task is sometimes done in four or five hours . In return for this concession the operative who finishes his task in less than the allotted time is to work during the remaining hours of his allotment . For half of this time he is to be paid , while the factory gets the benefit of the other half . Thus if an operative succeeds in doing an eight-hour task in six hours he is paid eight hours ' wages for it . Then he works two more hours and is paid for one hour . Thus , although he actually works only eight hours , he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , gets an eight-hour piece of work and also two extra hours ' work . Thus it gets what might be reckoned as ten hours ' work for nine hours ' pay . Hence both sides are one hour 's work to the good . In one case the management made a mistake in deciding upon the number of hours probably needed for a task . It had never been done very quickly , and no one knew how rapidly it could be done if a workman put his whole energy into it . The man who does it now earns ten or twelve dollars a day where he formerly earned two and a half . Inasmuch as the management has agreed not to change the rates , they stick to their bargain . The particular task only comes once each month , and hence the matter is not serious . Moreover , even if the operative earns ten or twelve dollars , the work actually costs the factory less than when he was earning two and a half . In the factory at New Britain the girls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only paid for the amount of work they do , but if they do more than is expected they receive a bonus . For example , if a girl 's wages are supposed to be a dollar a day , and she does work worth $1.20 , she does not receive $1.20 , but $1.25 , or even $1.40 in special cases . The factory finds it worth while , because more work can be done with smaller capital , and with no more expense for bookkeeping , superintendence , heating , power , salesmen , and other overhead charges . The overhead charges plus the charges for unproductive work , such as running the engines , actually exceed the direct cost of productive  | labor . Inasmuch as they can not be diminished , the profitableness of the factory depends almost entirely on the speed of the operatives . If they could work twice as fast as they ordinarily do , the factory could afford to increase their wages two and a half times . When the bonus system was first tried , its effect was almost negligible . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bonus or not , and did not make any special effort to get it . The management soon realized that the trouble was that the parents were getting the extra money , and so it made no difference to the girls , most of whom turned over their pay-envelopes unopened to their parents . Then a change was made so that the bonus was not put in the envelopes , but was handed out in loose change . After that the girls felt that it was rightly theirs , and began to work for it . The bonus , it should be added , is not included in our calculations . These include only the actual wages , which are in direct proportion to the work accomplished . The bonus and premium systems , it will be seen , tend to keep the operatives up to a high state of efficiency . As the systems are equally applicable at all times of the year , there is no special reason , so far as the factories are concerned , why the average amount earned per hour should be low in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this seems to be that people 's energy varies ten or fifteen per cent . from season to season . That this is actually the case has been shown by two Danish psychologists , Lehmann and Pedersen . In Copenhagen they have tested the strength of school-children at different times of the year . When allowance is made for the normal growth of the children , it appears that their strength fluctuates from season to season as shown in the middle curve of Fig. 2 . For the sake of comparison I have placed above it the average curve for factory operatives , while the curve for a single year , 1910 , is placed below . Clearly , the strength of the children varies in the same way as the energy of the operatives . When mental work is tested we find approximately the same result , as is shown in Fig. 3 , where the marks of students are shown . The chief difference between these curves and those of Figs. 1 and 2 is that the fall maximum at West Point comes later than that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Annapolis the two maxima are pushed still closer together . Lehmann and Pedersen tested the mental capacity of their school-children by means of sums in addition . They found that the children vary from season to season in this as well as in strength , but the temperature at times of greatest power in mathematics is lower than at the time of maximum strength . Our curves for West Point and Annapolis show the same thing . The two West Point maxima come more nearly in the winter than do the factory maxima , while the maxima at Annapolis are pushed still farther into the winter , because the climate there is warmer than in southern New York and Connecticut . Taking all these various facts together , it seems scarcely possible to avoid the conclusion that our mental and physical power is constantly varying in ways of which we are often quite unconscious . Since this variation applies to large numbers of people in different countries and during different years , it must be due to some cause outside the people themselves . An interesting illustration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community is seen in the middle of December in each of the five upper curves . of Fig. 1 . At that time each curve shows a little hump . Of course , there are . many other minor humps , but the others do not occur at the same time year after year . Moreover , they tend to disappear when several years are averaged together , while this one remains , as may be seen in the heavy curve of Fig. 1 . Its cause is obvious . After the autumn maximum in November people 's energy begins to decline . It would naturally fall off in accordance with the dotted line ; but as Christmas approaches , every one wants extra money , and so makes an unusual effort . The presence of this Christmas hump is significant , because it shows that when all the operatives are subjected to some outside stimulus which applies to all alike a distinct and easily measurable  | effect is produced upon the curve of work . Aside from Christmas the only conditions which are at all likely to produce the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the seasons . Let us now see exactly what types of seasonal variation are of special importance . Temperature is obviously the most important element , as appears from the lower curve of Fig. i , but let us leave that for a moment . Many students have ascribed a great influence to the amount of sunlight . They say that light is a great stimulant , not only because of its effect on our minds , but because it increases the activity of various chemical processes within the cells of the body . At first sight it looks as if the low energy of January might be due to the shortness of the winter days , but a little examination shows that this can be only a minor factor . From September to the middle of November the amount of work is steadily increasing , although the days are growing shorter . This is exactly the opposite of what would happen if the shortness of the days had an appreciable effect . Moreover , in June , at the very time when the days are longest , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what we should expect . If the length of the days had much to do with the matter , there is no reason why more work should be done in September or November than in June . Nevertheless , the effect of light can apparently be detected . Compare the two lower curves of Fig . I. The curve of work begins to rise before the curve of temperature . In spite of the low energy occasioned by the winter 's cold or by some other cause , people begin to work faster when the days become a little longer , and apparently the two phenomena are connected . The same line of reasoning which we have applied to light applies also to the possibility that the variations of the curve of energy depend on the extent to which people are shut up in the house . Obviously , this has nothing to do with the two maxima in November and May , nor with the minimum in July . These must be due to some other cause , which seems to be the mean temperature of the outside air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite sure- ly due , at least in part , to the necessity of being shut up in the house . People begin to shut up their houses in October , and by the middle of November this would probably produce an effect . The effect would become more and more marked as the weeks went on , and would be pronounced by the middle of January . It would not cease then , however , but would go on until about the middle of March , for not till that time do people in Connecticut begin to open their houses to any appreciable extent . As the curve of work has risen notably by  | that time , some other factor must intervene , presumably the increase of light , to a small extent , and the rise of the temperature , to a large extent . The effect of keeping our houses shut up is produced largely through the unnatural conditions of humidity which it occasions . Our statistics of factory operatites show that in hot weather a relative humidity of 6o or 65 per cent . is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . is best , and in winter about 90 per cent . In winter , when the inside temperature is near 70 degrees , the relative humidity ought to be not far from 65 or 70 per cent . in our houses . As a matter of fact , it is far lower because we heat the air so greatly . This condition , as students of factory management have frequently pointed out , is most injurious , and is doubtless one cause of the lowness of our curves in winter . Another matter which is closely connected with the seasons is vacations . Do people work fast in the fall because they have been rested by vacation ? They certainly do , but in the present case this has relatively little importance . Factory operatives are not the kind of people who take summer vacations . This , however , need not concern us , for the actual facts show that vacations have little to do with the matter . If they were the cause of the fast work , we ought to find the fastest work within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as people once more get broken in to their work . But we find t h a t that is not the case . During the vacation period of J u l y and August the amount of w o r k is moderately low . Then at the end of August it begins to increase , and increases steadily for two and a half months . The maximum in November is so long after the vacation period that it can hardly have anything to do with it . We have an idea that people need vacations in summer , but apparently the need is much greater in January and February . Of course , there are strong arguments for taking vacations in summer , since that is the time when it is pleasant to be out of doors , whereas during the winter the majority of people have no means of enjoying themselves . In spite of this the work of our operatives suggests strongly that in the management of factories it is eminently wise that work should be light during the winter months . Already it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now we see that there are strong physical reasons for doing this . Another important suggestion afforded by our curves is this : If the operatives of a factory , or people engaged in any kind of work , are to be speeded up , the time to do it is when nature lends her aid . To speed up in February is analogous to whipping atired horse and expect- ing him to win a race . Later in the year , however , during the spring , and especially during May and early June , people may be pushed to the limit and will not suffer , because their energies are naturally increasing . This is still more the case in October and early November . After the middle of November pressure may produce important results , as we see at Christmas . Nevertheless , the chances are that if the pressure is continued straight through the winter it exhausts people to an undue degree . It may be that a considerable part of the nervousness of Americans is due to the fact that , although we relax during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly need it , we keep ourselves at high pressure right through the winter , when the need of relaxation is much greater . Turning now directly to temperature , we see that in Fig. 1 the curve of temperature at the bottom and the average curve of efficiency above it are similar in many ways . Both are low in January and February . From February onward they rise together until about the middle of June . Then the efficiency curve begins to fall while the other goes on rising . The fall of the efficiency curve begins when the average temperature has risen to about 65 or 7C degrees . When the temperature stops rising , the work stops falling , and then remains steady for nearly a month , or until the average temperature has fallen again to about 65 or 70 degrees . During the succeeding period of favorable temperature the curve of work keeps or going up until the middle of November , when the average temperature fall : below 48 degrees and be . gins to b e unfavorable Thereafter , if we omit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the amount of work decline together until they reach the lowest point in January . It certainly looks as if there were a close relationship between temperature and work , but , curiously enough , the relationship is in part the reverse of what most people would expect . Low temperature seems much more harmful and high temperature less harmful than is commonly supposed . This by no means indicates that high temperature is favorable . Compare the first four curves of Fig. i with the four diagrams of Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 represents the temperature week by week during the four summers from 1910 to 1913 . The black portions indicate weeks having an average temperature night and day of over 73 degrees ? that is , times of extreme heat . The size and distribution of the black areas is in close correspondence with the amounts by which the curves of work dip down in summer . In 1910 there were four extremely hot weeks , which were only slightly sepa- rated from one another by two cooler weeks . As a result , the curve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , one of which was the worst for a hundred years , came together . Then there was a respite for two weeks , after which there were two more weeks of extreme weather . That year the efficiency of the operatives dropped tremendously , and at its lowest ? which is concealed by the smoothing of the curves of Fig. 1 ? was lower than during the winter . In 1912 there were four hot weeks , or as many as in 1910 , but they were separated by a long cool period , and only one was excessive . Accordingly , the curve of work drops only a little . In 1913 the number of very hot weeks was only two , and they were separated by three moderate weeks . That year the efficiency of the operatives scarcely suffered at all . The year 1914 was even cooler than 1913 , and when its figures are compiled they will probably show that the rate of work increased steadily during the whole summer . Thus it appears that in general the summers of southern New England are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as are experienced only once or twice in a century , to produce effects as harmful as those of an ordinary winter . It seems a strange thing that low ternperature shoald do so much harm even when people work in well-warmed factories , and are out of doors-only a few minutes each day . Nevertheless , physicians say that the outside temperature , even when experienced only for a short time , is peculiarly effective in giving the tone to a whole day . The closeness of the relationship may be seen when we determine how fast people work on days having various temperatures , no matter in what month they come . The very cold days , of course , will all come in winter , but may be in either December , January , or February . The very hot days may come in June , July , or August , while days with a temperature of about 5o degrees occur in almost every month of the year . Taking each group of days , we find the average wages for men and women separately , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 5 . Here the left end represents the days with low temperatures , 15 degrees being the average of day and night together for the lowest group . Toward the right the temperature increases until it reaches a maximum of 8o degrees , as the average for the group of hottest days . The curves show that at very low temperatures both mental and physical work are depressed . On days with higher temperatures activity of both kinds increases , the increase being slight at first . Mental work reaches its highest point at a temperature of 38 degrees , while physical work reaches a maximum at 59 degrees for men and 6o degrees for girls . Then the curves begin to fall . They would fall much more rapidly were it not that on very hot days many operatives , especially the girls , stop working . Hence only the stronger ones are left , and of course their wages are comparatively high . The curves of the variation of effi- ciency according to mean temperature are especially interesting because they are closely similar to curves which have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made to show how fast plants grow at different temperatures . Beginning at about 40 degrees , which is almost the lowest temperature at which plants make much growth , the amount of growth increases slightly at first as the temperature rises , then rapidly , and afterward more slowly , and reaches a maximum at about 86 degrees . This is seen in the lower curve of Fig. 6 , which represents all the plants given in Pfeffer 's Plant Physiology . Turning to animals , Professor Woodruff has worked out the rate at which the kind of infusoria known as paramcecia divide into new cells at various temperatures , and finds that this varies according to the second curve from the bottom . Infusoria are among the lowest of animal forms , and represent very closely the conditions of pure protoplasm , the stuff which lies at the basis of all life . Higher in the scale the crayfish conducts its activities according to the same law , as appears in the third curve from the bottom . This shows how much oxygen this crab absorbs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73 degrees , and afterward drops off quite rapidly . The oxygen used in breathing is a good measure of the animal 's activity . Apparently the crayfish does exactly what people do , as may be seen from the next curve , which shows the variation in man 's physical activity . This curve is formed by combining the men 's and women 's curves of Fig. 5 . Finally , the curve of variations in mental activity has been placed at the top of Fig. 6 , while just below it stands the combined curve of physical and . mental activity . Taking this series of curves as a whole , a surprising relationship appears . The activities of all sorts of living beings seem to vary in response to temperature , and the variations all seem to follow the same law . Each type of activity has a distinct optimum at which it is greatest . The optimum lies at lower and lower temperatures as the type of activity reaches a higher level . For the plants here used the optimum is 86 degrees , for infusoria 83 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's physical activity 6o degrees , for human activity of all kinds combined , about 50 degrees , and for mental activity 38 degrees . Turning back once more to our curve of changes in efficiency throughout the year , let us interpret it in the light of the facts that have just been presented . In general the two lower curves of Fig . I , representing mean temperature and work , correspond to what we should expect from the third curve of Fig. 6 ; that is , from the curve representing man 's physical activity . This is high between the temperatures of about 45 and 70 degrees . During the part of the  | year when the temperature passes beyond these limits people 's work falls off sharply . When the temperature approaches these limits , work increases . Between the limits , however , it does not vary as one would expect , but tends to keep on rising all the time . Apparently this is because the temperature keeps changing , and change is a stimulus , provided it does not carry conditions to undue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fig. 7 . Here all the days with a temperature less than a degree different from that of the preceding day have been put in one group . Other groups have been made of the days where to-day 's temperature is higher or lower than yesterday 's by one , two , or three degrees , and so on until at the left end we get a group where the fall amounts to 14 degrees or more , and at the right a group with a rise of 12 degrees . These days are of course distributed all through the year , for we have great changes of temperature both in summer and in winter . The height of the curves shows the amount of work done by our factory operatives and the marks of students . The curves differ in many ways , but possess certain striking resemblances . In , the first place , each has a low dip on days when the temperature falls one degree . If the bottom of the dip came at zero ? that is , on days when there is no change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people work and think slowly when the temperature remains constant . This is probably true , for the two upper curves , representing physical work , are nowhere so low as in the portions near zero . The most important feature of the curves , however , is that toward the left-hand end , but not at the extreme left ? they are all high . This means that when the temperature drops , provided the drop is not excessive , human activity is decidedly stimulated . Every time that a storm passes over a region and is followed by cooler weather , people 's efficiency is increased . We say bad things about our storms , we are loud in our defamation of the changeableness of the weather in the eastern United States . Yet , after all , this is by no means a bad feature . Each storm brings a stimulus , as is shown in Fig. 8 . The curve in that figure represents the changes in the amount of work done by two hundred and ninety operatives during an average period of six days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear days which followed cloudy days , the second the work done on all the clear days which followed another clear day , the third on all the partly cloudy days which followed clear days , and so on . The first clear day , surprising as it may seem , shows the least efficiency . The second cloudy day , on the other hand ? that is , the day when the weather begins to clear off after a storm ? shows distinctly the greatest efficiency . More important than this , however , is the fact that each succession of stormy days brings a stimulus which we should not have without it . If space allowed it would be easy to go on and point out other effects of climate . Day by day the changes of-temperature which we sometimes curse and sometimes bless are stimulating us . When winter comes , or summer , as the case may be , our vitality is weakened . Or perhaps we live in a climate which is stimulating all the time and therefore exhausting because there is no alternation from day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year out we are subject to these influences . Yet how little we know as to their effect on us ! We judge by what is pleasant for the moment ? we rarely stop to consider what is best in the long run . Indeed , it would he of little use to stop and consider , for as yet we do not know . We only know that a great force is constantly operating upon us for good or ill . Some day we shall doubtless discover precisely how it works . Then we shall be able to prevent many disorders which , find their opportunity because we do not now understand how to protect ourselves . In the course of his age-long wanderings over the face of the earth man has gone to many places which are ill adapted to his physical being . He must learn how to overcome the effects of such maladjustment . The only way to learn is to discover what nature is actually doing to us day by day .  |              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
