txt Will it be believed that one of those farmers ' organizations which the Administration is forbidden to prosecute - with money voted by Congress has Teen unable to get accommodation from the funds of the Treasury ? The fact is vouched for by an officer of the kgricultural Department , who saw the loan refused . It was asked by a cotton 7. -. - rowers organization in Arkansas , 7vhich wanted it on the security of . ? rops , and the unsympathetic bank oficial Little Rock said he had already loaned three millions to buyers and commission men . The President added that he was one of the committee handling the Arkansas allotment of Government funds distributed for crop moving , and that SO far as he knew no farmer was able to avail himself directly of the use of any part of the fund . It seems that the people who were buying the crops could get accommodation , but there were no funds for those who wanted to hold the crops ? This is as it ought to be . although not as the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of funds to move " the crops appears from the fact that the Treasury 's allotment was not an applied for , and while the funds were on offer they did not reach the farmers about whom the Treasury was so anxious . The incident is instructive in connection with the trending banking and currency reform bill . It is not pretended that it is constructed upon banking . principles . It is motived by the . Democratic platform . and by the benevolence of those who want to divert funds from Wall Street speculation to the uses of planters who want to carry their crops until the prices suit them . There is not the least objection to anybody carrying anything he owns as long as he wants to , provided he does it with his own funds , or with the assistance of banking funds secured at his own rust and risk . But it ought not to be done with the Treasury funds . Similarly , banking legislation designed for the good of the entire country ought to do the best that can be done , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment of any class . Such an attempt will not he successful any more than the Treasury 's attempt . The money so carefully diverted front Wall Street drifted into Wall Street as fast as credits could travel , and even before it reached Wall Street it could not be got by the farmers . Any attempt to distinguish between bad speculators in produce and bad speculators in securities will fail . They are birds of one feather . and equally ill-deserving . The danger is that the attempt to give them their deserts will react against speculators who serve a legitimate purpose . The country can not afford to lose those speculators in commodities who provide abundance against scarcity and those speculators in securities who construct ? railways , and industrial works . The good and the bad of both sorts are to be found in Wall Street , and the punishment of Wall Street will fall alike on the ' just and the unjust The remedying of abuses of this Fort is not the fair function of a banking bill , but it is the undisguised objective of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure even if not exact .
