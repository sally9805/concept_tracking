txt The American aril ! ? ; lery continued hammering German positions with marked success last night and today . A destructive fire on enemy buildings and works was maintained . ' A Germany battery position was struck by a shell from our largo guns and caused a heavy explosion of ammunition . A sheet of flame shot high in the air , the gi ? ound trembled , and the camouflage protection around the position was set on fire . Just before dawn two German patrols were observed in front of our position . A barrage fire called for by the infantry in the front trenches etfectively scattered and drove off the enemy . With our machine guns we all day harassed the enemy , continuously shooting streams of bullets into working parties or whenever the enemy showed himself . The enemy patrols have evidently learned a lesson , for last night while our patrols worked freely all over No Man 's Land , they were unmolested .                    @
