txt IGNORANT CRITICISM Physician Takes Prof. Sherwood to Task . It seems to me that Prof. Margaret Sherwood of Wellesley College has absolutely given away her case in one expression of her letter of yesterday . She refers to the silly and infamous act of sewing two animals together . This shows how entirely ignorant she is of the practice of surgeons and of the possibilities of modern research . Surgeons sometimes sew two human beings together for the purpose of transplanting tissues or transferring blood . As it happens , I have had my own son and daughter sewn together , and lives have been saved by the process . There might easily arise occasions when sewing two animals together would be of the greatest help in solving biological problems with the results of benefit to man and to animals as well . If I may say so without offense , it seems to me really " silly and infamqps " for any one ? holding a responsible position to pass judgment on a matter of which he is fundamentally ignorant .
