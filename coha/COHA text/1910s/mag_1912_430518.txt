 | THAT adequate rail and water transportation facilities represent a basic factor in nation building , is a maxim which is appreciated more than ordinarily by the people of Canada . With them it is a well-recognized fact ? one which has possessed itself of the public mind ? that their potential forest , agricultural , and mineral resources , all of which are known to be abundant , can not be economically utilized until the country is opened up by railways and improved by artificial waterways . The strenuous efforts which they have put forth during the last two or three decades to supply themselves with the necessary transportation systems have been such as to attract the attention , if not the admiration , of the rest of the civilized world . The great commercial highway formed by the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes has been brought to its present condition only by the expenditure of millions of dollars of the public money in the " conquest of nature . " The seventythree miles of canals between Montreal and Lake Superior alone cost the government nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dominion down to March 31 , 1910 , was $97,000,000 . The building of upwards of 31,000 miles of railway by June 30 , 1910 , was accomplished by an expenditure of money , courage , and effort which it is difficult fully to appreciate . And notwithstanding the fact that already Canada has the greatest railway mileage in proportion to population of any country in the world , with possibly one or two minor exceptions , it would seem as if she were just entering now upon an era of great expansion in railway building . It is true that her railways  | have been constructed mostly by private companies ; for , excepting the eastern section of the Grand Trunk Pacific , stretching for a distance of about 1800 miles from Moncton , New Brunswick , to Winnipeg , Manitoba , which is being built by the federal government , only about 2000 miles are owned by the public . But the private companies have been assisted liberally by grants of land and cash subsidies from the federal and provincial treasuries , and by the guaranteeing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such assistance represents a grand total of something like $875,000,000 ? a substantial sum for a population of less than eight millions . Within recent years the most pressing transportation problems have arisen as a result of the settlement of the West , especially of the prairie provinces ? Manitoba , Saskatchewan , and Alberta . A moment 's consideration will reveal the real significance of this statement . To this region a large percentage of the Canadian immigrants is gravitating ; and luckily the bulk of them are making for themselves permanent homes and are becoming productive settlers . In the year 1910 , over 48,000 ordinary homestead entries were made , while large blocks of land were secured from the railway companies also for farming purposes . This is merely indicative of what has been going on for a number of years , and it is believed that the influx has just fairly begun . This annual army of settlers continues to join forces with those who have been on the ground longer , in an effort , unconscious on their part though it may be , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereals . To deny that the movement already is well under way is to subscribe to something which does not square with the facts . A few decades ago all of Canada 's wheat was produced east of Lake Superior . The census figures show that as late as 1870 the yield in Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , Quebec , and Ontario totalled less than seventeen million bushels . The output of the rest of British North America was then  | too insignificant to be taken into consideration ; the real Canadian wheat belt had not been reached . With the later movement of population westward , the centre of wheat production has shifted westward also , until at the present time it is somewhere within the limits of the three prairie provinces . This is shown by the fact that in 1911 , Manitoba , Saskatchewan , and Alberta together produced 194,083,000 bushels of wheat out of a total of 215,851,000 for the whole of Canada . That such a change should come about sooner or later was inevitable , for here is situated one of the most promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The realization is just dawning upon the people of the United States and Canada alike that a large , if not the best , part of the wheat belt on the plains of North America lies north of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude . Just how many million acres of land are available here for the growth of this cereal it is impossible with any degree of accuracy to estimate . Likewise , as a writer in the " American Economic Review " recently has said , " how much wheat Canada is capable of producing , even with the methods of extensive farming , has hardly passed the guessing stage . " There seems to be pretty general agreement , however , that within a decade or two Canada will be exporting several hundred millions of bushels annually . By far the largest proportion of this will undoubtedly be grown in the three prairie provinces . No one who has recently visited them during the harvest season will be inclined to question this statement . Others can not fail to be impressed with the situation if they will take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces which was issued a short time ago by the Department of the Interior at Ottawa . From the valley of the Red River in southeastern Manitoba , a wheat belt two hundred miles or more in width stretches away to the northwest for hundreds of miles through Manitoba , Saskatchewan , and Alberta . A careful reading of the map reveals the fact that in the more thickly settled  | townships of this region , especially in the eastern portion , one half or more of the land is producing wheat . The average yield per acre is considerably above that of the best spring wheat lands in the United States , and already in 1911 the crop had amounted to over 194,000,000 bushels . Yet less than 10,000,000 acres have ever been planted in any one year ? a very small fraction of the land known to be available for wheat . Is it little wonder , then , that some of Canada 's leading public men are looking to the Northwest to produce in the not distant future a billion bushels of this cereal annually ? It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only source of agricultural wealth in this region . In addition to important crops of potatoes , turnips , peas , flax , etc. , there were produced in 1911 over 24,000,000 bushels of barley and 212,000,000 bushels of oats . The crop which already figures most prominently in the export trade , however , and the one which , as has just been shown , promises the most for the future is wheat . Probably a portion of the surplus will seek a market south of the forty-ninth parallel . The greater quantity , however , is pretty sure to cross the Atlantic . Accordingly , sufficient and adequate transportation facilities must always be available to move the surplus to the seaboard , otherwise great loss will incur to the Canadian farmer , and the healthful economic development of the West will be retarded . In spite of the rapid growth of the railway net in the Canadian wheat belt , the grain traffic continues to suffer from congestion . The culmination of a continuous blockade occurred in 1906 ( a year of particularly good crops ) , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a state of affairs naturally stimulated the demand for more outlets . If the present crop can not be handled adequately , what will be the situation , it is asked , when a crop equal to several times that of the present is harvested ? The building of the Canadian Northern and  | the Grand Trunk Pacific Railways does not seem to furnish a satisfactory solution to the problem . Some other supplementary route must be provided . Absurd as the scheme may seem at first thought to one unacquainted with climatic conditions in Canada , it is true , nevertheless , that the people of the prairie provinces have been clamoring for several years past for a railway to Hudson Bay to supplement the existing transportation routes to the seaboard . Their demands , which have furnished considerable political capital in the provinces of Manitoba , Saskatchewan , and Alberta , and which have provoked lengthy discussions in the Dominion parliament , have at last borne fruit . For the government has already appropriated nearly $1,700,000 for the project . Contracts have been signed for the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on the sixth of September , 1910 , the first sod in connection with the building of the new railway was turned with due ceremony by the Minister of Railways and Canals . Advertisements have been running asking for tenders for the construction of the first one hundred and eighty miles northward from The Pas . The change of government which resulted from the federal elections of last September will , in all probability , hasten the work of construction , for the Liberal-Conservative party is pledged to build the road . Hence , there seems to be no doubt but that the long-talked-of Hudson Bay Railway will soon be an accomplished fact . A glance at the railway map of the Dominion issued in 1911 by the Department of the Interior shows that of all the lines in the prairie provinces the Canadian Northern approaches the nearest to Hudson Bay . On the Prince Albert branch of this system , at a point nearly four hundred miles northwest of Winnipeg , the trains now stop at a place called " Hudson Bay Junction . " Upon inquiry it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance of eighty-six miles in almost a direct line towards Hudson Bay to a point on the south side of the Saskatchewan River  | known as The Pas . From here to Hudson Bay the distance is only four hundred and seventy-seven miles via the surveyed route to Port Churchill , and but four hundred and ten miles to Port Nelson . The latter follows the course of the former for the first one hundred and fifty miles or thereabouts from The Pas , so that the work of construction need not be delayed on account of the failure thus far to decide upon the choice of route . Until recently the country through which the railway will pass was little known , and even at the present time our knowledge of the region is very incomplete . The best available information is contained in the various volumes of the Canadian Geological Survey , and in the two reports of John Armstrong , chief engineer of the Hudson Bay Railway surveys , which were submitted to parliament in 1909 . On the whole , the character of the country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although in certain places it will necessitate the building of a winding track in order to secure at a moderate cost the easy grades which are provided for in the estimates . There is little reason for believing that the agricultural resources of the country are such as will attract any considerable number of settlers for some time to come ? at any rate , not until the more desirable portions of the Canadian West have been filled with immigrants . At present the country is practically unoccupied , for not a single road or farm crossing is to be met with on the projected railway lines throughout the entire distance between The Pas and Hudson Bay . Considerable timber is met with on the line to Port Churchill , but probably the Nelson route is the better timbered throughout . It has yet to be shown that the region is rich in minerals . The building of the railway may result in the finding of valuable deposits , as has been the case heretofore in other parts of Canada . Hence , although it is always impossible to predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence leads to the conclusion that there seems to be no prospect of the  | railway deriving much income from carrying the products of the immediate country through which it will pass ? certainly not for some time to come . The revenue must be obtained largely from the drawing of through trains of grain from the Northwest to meet ocean steamers at the terminus on Hudson Bay . One has only to study a map for a few moments to see that the shortest route from the centre of the wheat belt to Liverpool is via Hudson Bay and Strait . There is no need of giving in detail comparative figures of distances , for in this important particular the Hudson Bay route has a decided advantage over all others . For all practical purposes the distance by steamship from the railway terminus on Hudson Bay to Liverpool will be approximately the same as from Montreal to Liverpool . But the distance by rail to Hudson Bay from the wheat fields of the West averages about a thousand miles less than to Montreal , the head or ocean navigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect a shortening , on the average , of approximately a thousand miles in the distance from the wheat fields of the West to the seaboard , without increasing the ocean distance to the world 's principal markets . From what has already been said it ought to be evident that there is no question as to the pressing need of opening up this additional outlet for Canadian wheat nor as to the saving in distance that would be effected by its use . The crucial point in the whole project , however , and the one upon which the success or failure of the scheme depends , is the possibility of ocean steamers reaching the railway terminus on Hudson Bay for any considerable length of time per year . This is a complex problem , but one upon which a good deal of light has been shed by the investigations of exploring expeditions sent out by the Dominion government , and by the reports of others who have spent considerable time at or in the vicinity of Hudson Bay . We shall soon see what conclusions may be drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passing judgment upon the important point as to how long each season the proposed route will be available for the purposes of commerce . As we shall see later , such limits as are imposed are due to climate . In the meantime , owing to the rather general erroneous impressions which prevail abroad regarding the climatic and weather conditions in the Dominion , it may be worth while to pause a moment to consider this matter . In all probability the climates of but few important countries are subject to greater misconception by the general run of people in other countries than is that of Canada . Even Mr. Kipling has referred to the Dominion as " Our Lady of the Snows . " A few years ago a writer in the " Canadian Magazine " took the pains to gather together a considerable number of instances of erroneous references to Canada 's climate which had occurred in some of the leading books and periodicals . A few of these may be repeated here . A contributor to a popular English magazine , for example , tells of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months every winter ! As a matter of fact , it is uncommon to find two consecutive days when this is the case . McCulloch 's " Commercial Dictionary " refers to the region which now includes Canada 's leading wheat fields as " situated in an inhospitable climate , and worth very little , excepting as hunting grounds . " Another writer tells , with apparently the greatest seriousness , of horses having to be cut out of the ice formed from the overflowing troughs at which they were drinking ! This statement appears all the more ridiculous for he was referring to conditions in the mild peninsular portion of Ontario . Again , at the time of Prince Arthur 's visit to the region of the lakes , one of the leading English papers allayed the fears of its readers at home by the comforting statement that " Canada has plenty of bearskins and deerskins to clothe her own children and the Queen 's son , too . " With such erroneous statements scattered abroad , there is little wonder that many  | people have the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ; that the Hudson Bay Railway would have to traverse an inhospitable country in the Arctic regions whose scanty vegetation consists of mosses and stunted shrubs ; and that no one in his right mind would think of making use of a route so far remote from the beaten path . How much truth these and similar impressions really contain we shall presently see . Turning now to a consideration of the practicability of navigating Hudson Bay and Strait for commercial purposes , it should be remembered that their most northern shores are well outside the Arctic circle . Port Churchill is in about the same latitude as the north of Scotland ; and Moose Factory , on the southern shore of James Bay , is farther south than London . Hudson Bay , including the southern projection known as James Bay , is a vast area of water which is , roughly speaking , a thousand miles in length from north to south and six hundred miles in breadth . Its approximate area is 600,000 square miles or nearly five times that of the British Isles , or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to Hudson Bay from the Atlantic is through the strait of the same name . This is a deep channel about five hundred miles in length , with an average breadth of one hundred miles , narrowing down to a minimum width of from forty to forty-five miles . It is remarkably free from rocks and shoals or other obstructions to navigation , while the soundings show the depth of water to vary between 900 and 1800 feet . It has been stated upon good authority that the bay is always open and as free to navigation as the Atlantic itself . The waters in the harbors , as also those for some distance from the shore line , are frozen for a part of the year ; but it is reported that by the use of ice-breakers the harbors may be kept open for the entire winter . Moreover the bay is easy of navigation in that it is unusually free from rocks and shoals , and its depth is remarkably uniform , averaging over four hundred  | feet . On the whole , then , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government 's expeditions to this region , that " there is no natural difficulty in the navigation of the bay and strait so far as the depth of water , presence of obstructions , and width of channel are concerned , and , if situated in a more southern region , the route would be an ideal one for the navigators . " But fortunate as it is that Hudson Bay itself contains no obstacles which would interfere with its use for commercial purposes at any time of the year , it is to be regretted that such a favorable report can not be made upon Hudson Strait ; for here we find that nature has imposed a limit to the period of navigation , in the form of ice . Another possible drawback to the easy use of this route is that , no matter whether Port Churchill or Port Nelson be eventually selected as the railway terminus , the harbor will be icebound for a part of the year . There seems to be no serious problem , however , connected with the ice conditions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as it is possible for vessels to leave the strait , and are likely to be clear again the following season by the time they are able to enter the bay . Moreover , it is highly probable , as we have already seen , that the harbors can be kept open the whole year . Hence , the question as to how long each season the Hudson Bay route could be used for the purposes of commerce is dependent chiefly upon the length of time Hudson Strait may be navigated with safety . As already pointed out , the Dominion government has been untiring in its efforts to arrive at the true answer to this question . Without entering into an exhaustive analysis of the various reports of exploring expeditions sent out to study the problems pertaining to the navigation of the bay and strait , it may be said that there is more or less difference of opinion with respect to the length of time the strait may be navigated . The more optimistic are inclined to extend the period to four months or possibly longer ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . In the light of all the evidence collected by experts , it seems fair to conclude that Hudson Bay and Strait , when properly charted and lighted , will afford a reasonably safe route for commercial vessels for at least three months in the year ? from about the middle of July to the latter half of October . This conclusion should be considered as conservative . It is not entirely improbable that the period of safe navigation , so far as it is dependent upon ice conditions , may be lengthened materially when full information regarding the strait is at hand . Already there are those who believe that it is feasible so to neutralize natural conditions in the St. Lawrence as to extend the time of navigation until it shall cover the whole year . This opinion is based upon long and continued study and experimentation on the part of experts . If the ice phenomena can be conquered in the St. Lawrence , it is not beyond the bounds of reason to believe that at least a partial victory can be won for longer navigation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicability of shipping grain from the Northwest via Hudson Strait , it may be well to inquire what portion of the export crop will probably be handled by this route . It must be admitted frankly at the outset that this question can be answered only in a general way , for there are so many factors which are capable of influencing the choice of route that it is impossible accurately to reckon with them all . So far as distance is concerned , it is evident that there would be a great advantage in shipping by the Hudson Bay route . For all practical purposes , The Pas is as near to Port Nelson on Hudson Bay as Winnipeg , the great wheat-shipping centre in Manitoba , is to Fort William and Port Arthur , the two important grain ports on Lake Superior . But , as it has already been shown , Port Nelson is almost as near to Liverpool as is Montreal ; so that the average distance to be saved by shipping via Hudson Bay is the distance between Fort William and Montreal ? approxi- mately a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be as cheap and as easy to provide for the transportation of grain from Port Nelson to Liverpool as it now is to make such shipments over the longer route from Fort William ; and that , under any circumstances , grain will be carried as cheaply to Hudson Bay as it now is from Winnipeg over the railway lines converging upon Fort William and Port Arthur . Winnipeg and The Pas may then be considered as " radiating points , " each of which may be expected to draw upon a considerable area for traffic . Evidently somewhere between these two centres there will be neutral ground from which there would be no choice of route . This whole matter has received attention at the hands of the government officials , and it has been estimated that a line drawn from Dauphin , Manitoba , in a southwesterly direction so as to pass through Weyburn , Saskatchewan , would separate the territories tributary to Winnipeg and The Pas . Such a line of demarcation gives practically the whole of Manitoba and something like 11,000 square miles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saskatchewan , including by far the greater part of the province , and all of Alberta belong to The Pas . The latter comprises a vast area equal in size to the Dakotas , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Nebraska , and Iowa combined , whose fertility is believed to compare favorably with that of the States mentioned . It is the abundant faith in the future of this large region tributary to The Pas which has prompted the government of Canada to hearken to the demands of its western constituents and build the railway to Hudson Bay . It is true that the country to the eastward of the line of demarcation is producing the most wheat at present , but already the yield in the area tributary to The Pas is considerable , and there is no question but that millions of acres more will be sown to wheat within the next two or three decades . There are , however , as has been intimated , certain indeterminable factors which are likely to upset all calculations  | and turn the shipments into channels least expected . The Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two months after the shipment of the year 's crop begins ; it will be closed for the season a month or more before the last shipments may be made from Fort William . And in the spring the great mass of grain which has been contained in the elevators during the winter can not be forwarded via Hudson Bay for possibly three months after the opening of navigation on the lakes . No one can foretell the ultimate influence of such facts upon the choice of a transportation route . Our assumption that the grain will be landed at Hudson Bay as cheaply as at Fort William is a reasonable one , for the distances over which it would move are approximately the same to both points . In spite of the fact that the return traffic from Hudson Bay promises to be light , it is expected that the rates on the new road will meet those on the lines which lead eastward . If it be assumed that freight and insurance rates will be equal from Montreal and the Hudson Bay terminus of the railway to Liverpool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-half to four and onehalf cents per bushel in using the Hudson Bay route instead of the St. Lawrence . For the cost of carriage from the head of Lake Superior to Montreal in 1910 varied between these two figures . The writer is not unaware of the fact that a large percentage of Canadian grain is shipped abroad over other routes than the St. Lawrence , but the whole question of future comparative costs and advantages is too complicated and uncertain to enable one to arrive at estimates sufficiently accurate to warrant further discussion at this point . The fact that the railroad can be operated to its fullest capacity for only two months , to a somewhat lessened capacity for a third month , and possibly not at all or at any rate only to a small fraction of its capacity for the remaining three fourths of the year , presents some unusually difficult problems to the engineers . It has been hard to decide upon what basis to provide accommodation for a railway which  | must be operated with such limitations . According to the plan which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer of the Department of Railways and Canals , in the latter part of 1909 , it was provided that there should be a single-track road . It was believed that thirtytwo freight trains and one passenger train per day would be its capacity , so that round houses and shop accommodation sufficient to handle these numbers would be required . It was estimated that a road thus equipped , when working to its fullest capacity and allowing for delays and accidents , would carry about 64,000,000 bushels of wheat to Hudson Bay per month . There would have to be provided over a hundred train crews , a hundred and fifty telegraph operators , over fifty gangs of section men , shopmen , roundhouse men , superintendents , train masters , yard masters , etc. , most of whom would not be required for more than two or three months in the busy season in the autumn . For this reason it may be entirely impracticable for the government itself to operate the road after it has been built . It was stated by the deputy minister that it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large corporations , so that men and rolling stock could be utilized the whole year . " But at the very time that the Hudson Bay Railway would be running to its fullest capacity , both men and rolling stock are most in demand on the lines which operate throughout the year . This is also the time when there is usually a heavy general demand for labor . Then soon after the cessation of wheat shipments northward , the rush season would be over on the regular lines . Undoubtedly , however , some solution of the problem will be found . It is possible that the building of the road will soon be followed by the settlement of the adjacent country , and that a growing local traffic will make it necessary to operate the road the year round . This is a glimmering hope of the many , although it is actually expected only by the more optimistic . Those who look with little favor upon the whole project  | find no end of prospective troubles . Yet it is to be remembered that there are few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what seemed to many at first sight to be insurmountable difficulties . This is true of a number of the Canadian lines . When it was first proposed to build a railroad northward from Quebec to Lake St. John , there were those who asked " what the promoters of the road expected to find in the Lake St. John region besides bears and blueberries . " Others asserted that " one might almost as well propose building a railroad to the mountains in the moon as to run it over the Laurentian mountain chain which intervenes between Quebec and Lake St. John . " There are few to-day , however , who question the wisdom of building the road . When the Canadian Pacific Railway was projected , it was predicted by a number of the leading men in the Canadian parliament that the road never would earn grease for its car wheels ; and yet it is now one of the most prosperous railroad companies in the world . There is absolutely no way of foretelling with accuracy the results which will follow a new line , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be hoped that the building of the Hudson Bay Railway will hasten the development of the Canadian Northwest ; that the country through which it will pass may prove to be , when better known , of far greater economic value than the present available data would warrant us in believing ; and that the various difficulties which now present themselves respecting the safe shipment of grain from the Hudson Bay terminal may prove in time to have been more imaginary than real .
