txt At the moment when the Russian Mission arrived in New York there came a message from the American Mission in Petrograd . One of - the members of the American Mission , CHARLES EDWARD RUSSELL , sent this appeal to the American people : I venture to appeal to my fellowdemocrats in the United States and Great Britain . for a more sympathetic attitude toward the struggling democracy of Russia . I appeal to editors not to print wild-eyed stories of impending ruin and chaos and to newspaper readers not to believe such stories if printed . There is no anarchy here . There is only a limited amount of disorder . The people of Russia , under the most trying conditions in history , have given an example of dignity and selfrestraint . It is well to face the facts frankly , but it is also well to look beyond surface conditions to the true basis of Russian development . Every phase of the present situation is a logical and normal outcome of natural causes . The substance is sound and hopeful , if only other democracies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction . These people know their job and will do it . I suggest it Is about time to do away with all criticism and give them a chance . If there is the least disposition to be patronizing or condescending toward the new Russia personified in the Bakhmetieff mission , it is wholly out of place . What Russia has done merits : not condescending approval but respectful admiration . It is less than four months since the great convulsion . For years it has been freely pre . dieted that when the explosion came the state of Russia would , be worse than that of France in 1792 ; that there would be nothing short of chaos . ' Instead , we see Russia righting herself in an incredibly short time after a shock of terrific proportions . What was overlooked by the prophets of those years was the character of the Russian people , which ' has never ' been unstable or heady . When the real voice of Russia began to be heard above the uproar of the fanatics whom the convulsion tossed to the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the voice itself were the accent and the - tone. , The pronouncements of the Peasants ' Congress , for instance , were not appeals ; they were I the ordered , majestic decrees of a supreme power , the people itself speak , ing and commanding the waves of dissension to be still . The Sinai-like tone , the authoritative deliberateness , were those of the people as a conscious entity . If liberty breaks suddenly upon the Russian people , yet the genius of that people has never been such as to dispose it toward irresponsibility or levity ; and if inexperienced , it has great power of self-command . Its task now is to build upon the wreck made by a volcano which swept everything away ; and if there were those in Russia , as there would be in. any country , whose idea of building was that of the builders of Babel , they were not the Russian people . The democratic world has fervently hoped that the result of the revolution might be that which Mr. RUSSELL declares it in fact to be ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it with joy .
