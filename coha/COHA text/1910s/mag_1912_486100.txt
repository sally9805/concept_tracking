Gov . Wilson spoke last week with emphasis of his determination to carry into execution the policies to which he stands committed , - yet in the same breath announced his purpose of continually going to the people to ask what they want done . He has more than once said that he aspired to be the " spokesman " ? and , presumably , the at ficient agent  --  of the popular will . If he has any quality of vigorous leadership , he prefers to think of it as merely responding to direction by the people II would he obviously easy , for those so mindeda to see in this something very like a contradiction in terms . The true leader can not so completely lose his identity in the follower . That would be to go over to the famous dictum of the French politician , shame-facedly trailing after a mob of his constituents . " I must follow them , for I am their leader . " But Gov . Wilson 's utterance is doubtless not to be taken too literally . It is partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presume , it is the seeming self-effacement of a masterful man who knows what he means to do , but desires to base his action upon the semblance of a strong popular demand . It would not be a bad definition of a successful leader in a democracy that he is a man of abundant initiative and resolute will who appears to be doing only what the people desire him to do . As regards Gov . Wilson , the surest guide to his future conduct is furnished by his official course in New Jersey . In certain important matters , he did not hesitate to assume and avow leadership . One of his explicit and daring deliverances , in his campaign for the Governorship , was that , if elected , he himself , and no other man , should be the leader of his party in the State This , of course , had a specific occasion and a definite reference . It was in answer to MS . Record , who publicly questioned Wilson about the Democratic machine and its former operator , " Jim " Smith : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old boss ? Mr. Wilson answered squarely . He would lead , not Smith . That was fiat . It proved also to be absolutely true , as el erybody knows . And the tremor that ran through all bossdom at Mr. Wilson 's bold promise and complete fulfilment has not yet subsided . In this respect , at least , he ds certain to be a loader in the Presidency . No boss can dictate to him . No threat of punishment Pi the polls will terrify him . He will he his own master . But this attitude towards his party organization is only one part of ths work of a real leader . If he is such , he can not neglect the devising and advocacy of party policies How will he set about that ? Is he to look into Ilia own heart alone ? Or is he to have no thought or will except what is conveyed to him as he places his ear to the ground ? The whole question is confessedly intricate . It goes close to the centre of successful statesmanship Lord Rosebery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his party . He both gets and gives . Rosebery thinks that he gets more than he gives . But that depends upon the man . Gladstone did not come out for Irish Home Rule because the brains and mass of the Liberals demanded It . He rather imposed that policy upon his party . Joseph Chamberlain was not a puppet , moved by party wire-pullers , when he startled England by advocating a return to protective tariffs . He furnished an instance of a vigorous. ; statesman scoring off his own bat , and forcing a reluctant party to fall ml o line behind him . It would be foolish to say that this can often be done , or should always be attempted . A Prime Minister or a President has frequently to be an opportunist . That word has a good sense as well as a bad .. It may signify the public man who , to be sure , has plans which he cherishes and hopes which he keeps alive , but who knows that he must wait for the ripening of the time . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet has the patience of a Lincoln to abide the slow result . Lord Cromer describes the responsible statesman in a democracy as very much in the position of a man in. a boat off the mouth of a tidal river . He long has to strive against wind and current until finally a favorable conjunction of weather and tide forms a wave upon which he rides safely into the harbor . There is an essential truth in this which no man attempting to play the part of leader in a democracy can forget except at his peril Government by public opinion is bound to get a sufficient body of public opinion on its side . But withal it is manifestly the duty of a leader to help form a just rublic opinion . He must dare to be temporarily unpopular , if only in that way can he get a hearing for the truths which the people ought to have presented to them . He is to execute the popular will , but he is not to neglect shaping it . It is his duty to be properly receptive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out of him to touch and quicken the masses of his citizens . If their minds and imaginations are played upon with sufficient persistence and sufficient skill , they will give him back his own ideas with enthusiasm . A man who throws -a ball against a wall gets it back again as if hurled by the dead brick and mortal : ; but the original impulse is in his own muscle . So a democratic leader may say , if he chooses , that he takes only what is pressed upon him by the people ; but his function often is first to press it upon them . Without something of this personal initiative and vigor , it is certain that there can be no true leadership . The theory of a ruler always listening for the word of command from the crowd breaks down in a dozen ways . Gladstone said that the orator got as vapor from his audience what he returned as shower . But if a would-be leader collects only the dust that blows through the streets and across the fields , what can he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a led democracy , and is always looking about for men of force to show it where to go . If they fail it , it is in constant peril of attempting to proceed where there is no thoroughfare . And no quality is more necessary in them than courage to stand up and tell the people when they are wrong . They may strike a President , but they are bound to hear him . He has , as Mr. Wilson has said , the one voice that carries through the entire nation ; and unless he seizes the opportunity to put into it both the exhortation and the warning which the times need , he is falling short as a leader FINANCE AND HUMAN NATURE . The report of Mr. Morgan 's testimony before the Pujo Committee made fascinating reading . For , in addition to the technically financial contents of Mr. Morgan 's examination , it yielded matter of immense social and personal interest That Mr Morgan was in many ways an excellent witness does not need to be argued . His mind moves with great directness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the core of the business . When he does not know , he says so without hesitation . If his opinion is asked , he gives it squarely . Without fencing or hedging , he answered question after question , even when they went deep into matters of his policy and motive . Distinctly , he made the impression of uncommon ability uncommonly frank This is the reason , taken in connection with his great position in the financial world , why thousands who know nothing of banks and stocks and interlocking directorates and voting trusts followed his testimony like men absorbed . It was to them not so much a financial revelation as a big human Phenomenon unveiling itself . Now , we freely admit that when the natural instincts are allowed to play freely upon matters of special knowledge and exceptional activities , there is danger of blundering . The man in the street is not able to stand as a judge over everything . When it is said that common sense is good enough to apply to matters about which the ordinary man is uninstructed , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really common ignorance . And there are many aspects of the affairs on which Mr. Morgan was ez-i would be rash for to pronounc always held t t is often regard And we doubt ni Mr. Morgan 's tee SUSpetted by t his horse sense iderstand them irily follow , thou it it , that every ( ' mice company on n director is u umb Men may suspicious and mind about all to_the ance , and so do tctice them Thi it the start and is mind . But our pi great deal was I irgan 's testimony least technical I upon which an3 express his opinion . When human nature is involved in finance , those who know , anything about human nature have as good a right to be heard as the greatest financier . And a few of the positions which Mr. Morgan took , with his admirable frankness , may well be challenged as contrary to all that is settled in regard to the nature of man . Mr. Morgan made no bones of admitting that he and his associates might , if they chose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of banking facilities , their large influence in the extension of credit , they could , if they so willed , discriminate against this corporation and in favor of the other , set one man up and knock another down . That anything of the kind was done , Mr Morgan naturally denied . But he conceded that it might be done ; yet , when asked if the vesting of such enormous power in one man , or group of men , was not dangerous , and whether it would not be wise to have coins check upon it , he gave his opinion strongly in the negative . The vast potential power he did not question ; but he maintained that it would be used wisely and fairly . Now , this is a question , not purely of finance , but of human nature . The insatiate love of Power and the peril that lies in unlimited power have been the theme of moralists and writers on government from the beginning of civilization Mr. Morgan is confident , and so are many , that he fluid not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Jay Gould or John W. Gates or Lawson or Keene ? It will never do to say that unchecked power is a good thing because it is in the hands of good men . The better the men are the readier will they be to confess the need of putting limitations on any such heaped-up and perilous power over the lives and fortunes of their fellows . That even good men grow drunk with power , and need to be protected from its excesses , is one of the oldest teachings of human experience . Modern finance can not brusquely set it aside . Human nature , we have said , may too much suspect finance ; but finance may expect too much of human nature It certainly did so in the person of Mr Morgan , when it asked us to believe that a man may have absolute control of another , yet leave the latter entirely independent The question arose in con nection with the workings of a voting trust . In the case of a given railway , for example , it appoints all the three-:tors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm or vot- ing trust upon which their official lives depend , and the question was put to Mr. Morgan whether he did not regard such a relation as unfortunate . Could the directors really exercise an independent judgment ? Would they dare refuse a plan advantageous to the men who held them in the hollow of their hands ? Mr. Morgan coolly maintained that they could and would . He affirmed that directors of such precarious tenure  --  whose official heads might be out off at the end of the year  --  are in the habit of acting as if they were entirely their own masters . But this again is not a mystery of finance ; it has to do with the plain facts of human nature ; and what man in his senses is able to believe that the subtle play of motive in such cases can possibly be what Mr Morgan would have us think it ? He Promptly and boldly gave his opinion , on this as on other matters , but we are bound to say that , in. this particular affair , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejects as incredible . VICE AND GOVERNMENT . That New York compares favorably with any great city in the world in the matter of vice , we have been repeatedly and emphatically assured on the highest official authority . Whether this be true Or not , so far as regards the actual extent of " the social evil " taken in itself , we shall not undertake to judge . Government , in any event , is only one of the factors that enter into the case ; economic conditions , the prevailing moral standards of the community , and other elements of pervasive importance and influence , go to the shaping of the situation . There may be other cities in which there is more vice , or in which its manifestations are more revolting , than in our own . But there is another aspect of the vice question no less serious than this . How the city government affects vice is one thing ; how vice affects the city government is another . And in this regard Nevy York has an ignoble preeminence over all the great cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , neither Mayor Gaynor nor any one else has attempted to dispute . and heart of every citizen of New York when he read such a story as that which Sipp , the keeper of a disreputable hotel , gave to the Curran Committee the other day For what that witness disclosed was something very different from the knavery of a patrolman or two , or even the venality of so high an officer as an inspector of police . The note that ran through his whole story was the note of Tammany . It was Tammany that had to be appeased ; it was Tammany that held - Sipp safe if he satisfied the desires of its henchmen , and that cut off the means of - his disgraceful livelihood when those desires were crossed . Nor were the allegations vague or general . Names were named ; names of men in the police service and out of it ; above all , names of men strong in the organization , and especially the name of one man who is known as among the closest friends of Murphy , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know that this particular story is true , and the person accused has branded it as an invention . But we do know that nobody was in the least surprised by it , that no indignant denial by Murphy was forthcoming , that everybody feels sure that the only thing novel about Sipp 's story is its actual production in public . So perfectly is the situation understood as a matter of " common knowledge " that everybody regards the story as merely a sample of what a hundred Sipps could tell , and tell truthfully , any day in the year . Can this situation be matched in London , or Paris , or Berlin , or Frankfort , or Glasgow ? Is there , in any of these cities , a great depository of governmental power which stands in any such relation to the commercial exploitation of vice ? Is there , in any of them , a man with whom the whole people have to reckon as coordinate in strength with the community itself , and whose friends and friends ' friends systematically profit by blackmail levied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by being in that trade themselves ? That is the real issue between the people of the city of New York and Tammany Hall , between the people of the city of New York and Murphy , Over this filthy morass of prostitution and bribery and blackmail the structure of Tammany 's power is built ; this connec traffic in vice the people of New York have ' been tolerating . And the man at the centre of this system they have allowed to get such a hold on public power as to overshadow the State Legislature , to paralyze the Governor , and to come dangerously near to wrecking a great political party in the nation At this particular time , indeed , Tammany is not in absolute possession Thanks partly to Mayor Gaynor 's independence and force , but above all to the success of the Fusion movement in electing a remarkably strong group of anti-Tammany men to the high places in the government other than the Mayoralty , the grip of the Murphy machine on New York City has , in the past three years , been far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so deep down are the sources of its strength that even when it seems to be thrown out altogether Its malign influence is powerfully exerted in a thousand ' ways ; and always we have to reckon with the menace of the complete restoration of its domination The disclosures that-have come thick and fast ever since the murder of Rosenthal open up questions with ' which the best thought of the wisest and bravest men will hardly suffice to grapple ; but they challenge in quite another way the manhood and the civic pride of the people at large . It may be impossible to solve those problems of vice and crime the struggle with which is as old as civilization ; but this is no excuse for tolerating that shameful identification of political power with vice and crime which is the peculiar disgrace of the American boss-ridden city , the disgrace which stamps the name of , New York with a brand known throughout the civilized world . Whatever else may come of the Becker case and the Curran Committee revelations , there should be no doubt of its breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not experienced since the days of Tweed . A MATHEMATICAL CENTENARY . To be an illustrious mathematician is to have attained as high and shining a reward as any that comes to genius . In no department of thought is a great intellectual conquest the source of more warded by more enthusiastic homage in the charmed circle of his peers . But it is far different as regards the outside world . Of those mathematicians whose names " on the stretched forefinger of all time sparkle forever , " so as to be visible to the multitude , the list is extremely short . Ask the first man of culture you meet to name the great mathematicians of our OWD time and of past ages , and lie will hardly get beyond Archimedes and Euclid for the ancients , and Newton and perhaps Laplace for the moderns . He may think of Descartes or Pascal or Leibnitz , but this will probably be because he happens to know that , besides being philosophers or controversialists , they had also done something in mathematics . Even the four names first mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than their distinctive achievements in pure mathematics . Euclid 's name is a familiar sound to every schoolboy for obvious reasons . Archimedes is known rather for the principle of the lever and the " eureka " story than for his fathership of the method of infinitesimals . Newton is , by general acknowledgment , the most majestic name in the history of science ; and the mathematical triumphs of Laplace would not have sufficed to place him in the list of the universally known had they not been connected with the more palpable interest attaching to astronomy . Of the splendid array of commanding minds whose conquests make up so wonderful a record of intellectual achievement , the world of non-mathematicians is , with a few chance exceptions , wholly unaware . Scotland can not boast of any great share in this story ; but she is fortunate in being able to claim one mathematician who stamped his name on the pages of history by a single achievement of picturesque character , of great practical importance , and of such a nature as to have made his name more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the little group we have indicated . The announcement was made a few days ago that the Royal Society of Edinburgh was preparing to celebrate the tercentenary of the invention of logarithms by Napier of Merchiston , whose " Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis its originality , there is no doubt , though tables of a somewhat similar nature bad been constructed ( but not published ) by a Swiss mathematician , Burgi , a few years before ; a coincidence which , as is usually true in such cases , is to be explained on the ground that the time had arrived when the need of some such invention had become acute . The calculations demanded by the grand development of astronomy in the hands of Tycho Brahe and Kepler were stupendously laborious ; and Napier deliberately set himself the task of finding a means of substituting addition for multiphcation , and subtraction for division . This , and much more , his invention of logarithms effected ; and its effect , as has been said , was to double the astronomer 's life by halving his labor . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and as a mere delight and fillip to mathematicians , it can not have tailed to act as a , powerful stimulus to the advancement of mathematical science in general . We do not know what form the celebration at Edinburgh will take . But one might imagine a celebration in which the chief feature should be some kind of bird's-eye view of what-has happened to mathematics since Napier 's time . Between the science of the day when Napier 's " Canon Mirificus " stirred the geometers and astronomers with a fresh delight , and that of our time , there is a contrast no less impressive than that presented by our power-mills and dynamos and skyscrapers , as compared with the primitive achievements of three hundred years ago . Story has been piled upon story , and mine has been bored under mine , until the whole structure is awe-inspiring  --  or appalling , as we may choose to view it  --  in a degree that Napier 's contemporaries ' could not ' have dreamed of . Perhaps nothing can bring the contrast more vividly to mind than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers of a quantity had not come into use in Napier 's time . Indeed , what made his merit so signal is that he should have evolved the idea of the logarithm without having as a starting point the idea of the exponent . The logarithm of a number soon came to be regarded as the exponent of the power to which a fixed base must be raised to produce the number ; to Napier , his logarithms were simply a series of num hers which form an arithmetical - progression , while the natural numbers to which they correspond form a geometrical progression . We may point here to a curiosity of history Among the intellectual events of British history there are not many that stand out with more spectacular distinctness than the publication of Napier 's " Canon Mirificus , of IVIalthus 's Essay on Population , " and of Darwin 's " Origin of Species . " Between the work of Malthus and that of Darwin there was , as is well known , a distinct eau sal connection . Of course , nothing of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interesting to note that they had in common the juxtaposition of an arithmetical and a geometrical progression . That this was of the essence of Napier 's work is simple matter of fact ; but , in spite of the patronizing indulgence or complacent contempt with which Malthus 's use of the comparison between the geometrical and the arithmetical progression has sometimes been treated , it was truly this that gave backbone to his doctrine , both by its effect upon his own mind and by its inherent appropriateness . The circumstance has no mystic significance , nor would we abuse the opportunity to infer from it anything about the characteristics of the British mind ; but as an example of singular fertility in consequences issuing from the contemplation of a simple mathematical idea in fields as wide asunder as possible , the fact is worthy of passing mention AN INSATIATE NAVAL POLICY . We have now at hand the full text of the speech which Premier Borden made to the Canadian House of Commons , at the time of proposing to build for the British navy " three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build or money supply " The money , in this case , will be $35,000,000 , which the Canadians are asked to contribute in order to show that they are prepared to " defend on sea as well as on land our flag , our honor , and our heritage . " Mr. Borden spoke as both a Canadian patriot and a British Imperialist Some of the things which he said in the latter guise may , we should think , make English-men wince a little . They could scarcely like to hear that " irreparable disaster " might overtake the British fleet if Canada should neglect to do her duty . But this was largely rhetorical . The Canadian Prime Minister was more matter-of-fact when he undertook to explain the Imperial naval policy , and to show just what was the present status of the British navy . Some of his statements sound rather alarmist and might be thought indiscreet . But Mr. Borden was speaking by the card . For he made public a special memorandum prepared by the British Admiralty which was in many ways more significant than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships by Canada . The Admiralty expressly disclaimed any thought of influence on Canadian action , Aid from Canada would be gratefully accepted , but the Admiralty wished to leave no doubt of England 's ability to cope with her naval problems alone The intention of the memorandum was merely to set forth the actual strength of the British navy at present , together with the building programme which is necessary , in the opinion of the Admiralty . And here we get a glimpse of the absolutely limitless demands of the big-navy men . For the Admiralty , after showing how England , by great exertions and enormous expenditures , has made arrangements to keep well ahead of the German navy , coolly lets it be known that this is only a beginning . It points out " the simultaneous building by many Powere of great modern ships of war . " Then it makes the following ominous statement : Whereas , in the present year , Great Britain possesses eighteen battleships and battle-cruisers of the Dreadnought class , against nineteen of that class possessed by the other Powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the figures in 1914 will be thirty-one to thirty-three , and in the year 1915 thirty-five to fifty-one . Talk about the daughters of the horse-leech ! They never cried " Give , " " Give , " with anything like the insatiate urgency of our modern naval authorities It is impossible to get from them a fixed policy . All their estimates of strain and cost are wholly provisional What they tell us to-day will make us " safe " or " invincible , " to-morrow they will declare to be entirely inadequate There is a world of sinister meaning in this memorandum of the British Admiralty . Ever since 1906 the one cry of the alarmed big-navy champions in England has been that on no account must Germany be enough  --  but by Englishmen . Then what a hollow kind of generosity it is to give the ships to England , so as to relieve the over-burdened taxpayer , and thereupon compel him to pay the entire bill for operation , upkeep , and repairs . These are but a few of the points which the Liberal leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal as it stands . Politically , it seems to be a shrewd stroke by the new Government . The organ of Bourassa , Le Devon- , speaks of Borden playing his " trump card . " But as there is political motive on the one side , so there will he on the other ; and there will be long and stirring debates in the Canadian Parliament before the measure is accepted .
