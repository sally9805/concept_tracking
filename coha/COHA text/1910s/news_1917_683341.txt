txt For a Naval Offensive I see our warships at anchor here . I read accounts of the reception of Admiral Capperton 's squadron In the Argentine , and I sigh for the old naval spirit of the Republic . Were that revived , did that burn unimpaired , our ships would not be idle in home ports , nor wasting theirs energies in hunting for an almost impossible enemy in southern waters ; they would be attacking the Germans in full force , going ahead , with a damn for their torpedoes , crushing their submarine lairs , and giving their High Fleet the alternative of either being smashed in hiding or smashed In the open . The cure for the submarine danger is not to build so many merchant ships that the submarine can not destroy all of them , but to attack and destroy the entire German naval power , including the submarines . Think how inglorious the present situation . The ? fleets of England , France , Italy , and America afraid on account of loss to attack the German naval ports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , there would be loss , but It would not be all on one side . In naval warfare , especially , it is not calculation but spirit that counts .
