The death of Jean Clemens occurred early in the morning of December 24 , 1909 . Mr. Clemens was in great stress of mind when I first saw him , but a few hours later I found him writing steadily . I am setting it down , " he said , " everything . It is a relief to me to write it . It furnishes me an excuse for thinking . " At intervals during that day and the next I looked in , and usually found him writing . Then on the evening of the 26th , when he knew that Jean had been laid to rest in Elmira , he came to my room with the manuscript in his hand . " I have finished it , " he said ; " read it . I can form no opinion of it myself . If you think it worthy , some day ? at the proper time ? it can end my autobiography . It is the final chapter . " Four months later ? almost to the day ? ( April 21st ) he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the world may , with propriety , read these closing words . ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE . STPEMPIELD , CHRISTMAS EVE. , it A. W. 1900 , J EAN is dead ! Has any one ever tried to put upon paper all the little happenings connected with a dear one ? happenings of the twentyfour hours preceding the sudden and unexpected death of that dear one ? Would a book contain them ? would two books contain them ? I think not . They pour into the mind in a flood . They are little things that have been always happening every day , and were always so unimportant and easily forgettable before -- -but now ! Now , how different ! how precious they are how dear , how unforgettable , how pathetic , how sacred , how clothed with dignity ! Last night Jean , all flushed with splendid health , and I the same , from the wholesome effects of my Bermuda holiday , strolled hand in hand from the dinner table and sat down in the library and chatted , and planned , and discussed , cheerily and happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is late for us ? then went up-stairs , Jean 's friendly German dog following . At my door Jean said , " I ca n't kiss you good night , father : I have a cold , and you could catch it . " I bent and kissed her hand . She was moved ? I saw it in her eyes ? and she impulsively kissed my hand in return . Then with the usual gay " Sleep well , dear ! " from both , we parted . At half past seven this morning I woke , and heard voices outside my door . I said to myself , " Jean is starting on her usual horseback flight to the station for the mail . " Then Katy* entered , stood quaking and gasping at my bedside a moment , then found her tongue : " Miss Jean is dead ! " Possibly I know now what the soldier feels when a bullet crashes through his heart . In her bath-room there she lay , the fair young creature , stretched upon the floor and covered with a sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if asleep . We knew what had happened . She was an epileptic : she had been seized with a convulsion and heart failure in her bath . The doctor had to come several miles . His efforts , like our previous ones , failed to bring her back to life . It is noon , now . How lovable she looks , how sweet and how tranquil ! It is a noble face , and full of dignity ; and that was a good heart that lies there so still . In England , thirteen years ago , my wife and I were stabbed to the heart with a cablegram which said , " Susy was mercifully released to-day . " I had to send a like shock to Clara , in Berlin , this morning . With the peremptory addition , " You must not come home . " Clara and her husband sailed from here on the 11th of this month . How will Clara bear it ? Jean , from her babyhood , was a worshipper of Clara . * Katy Leary , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four days ago I came back from a month 's holiday in Bermuda in perfected health ; but by some accident the reporters failed to perceive this . Day before yesterday , letters and telegrams began to arrive from friends and strangers which indicated that I was supposed to be dangerously ill . Yesterday Jean begged me to explain my case through the Associated Press . I said it was not important enough ; but she was distressed and said I must think of Clara . Clara would see the report in the German papers , and as she had been nursing her husband day and night for four months* and was worn out and feeble , the shock might be disastrous . There was reason in that ; so I sent a humorous paragraph by telephone to the Associated Press denying the " charge " that I was " dying , " and saying " I would not do such a thing at my time of life . " Jean was a little troubled , and did not like to see me treat the matter so lightly ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there was nothing serious about it . This morning I sent the sorrowful facts of this day 's irremediable disaster to the Associated Press . Will both appear in this evening 's papers ' : ? the one so blithe , the other so tragic . I lost Susy thirteen years ago ; I lost her mother ? her incomparable mother ! ? five and a half years ago ; Clara has gone away to Iive in Europe ; and now I have lost Jean . Row poor I am , who was once so rich ! Seven months ago Mr. Rogers died ? one of the best friends I ever had , and the nearest perfect , as man and gentleman , I have yet met among my race ; within the last six weeks Gilder has passed away , and ladfan ? old , old friends of mine . Jean lies yonder , I sit here ; we are strangers under our own roof ; we kissed hands good-by at this door last night ? and it was forever , we never suspecting it . She lies there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to keep my heart from breaking . How dazzlingly the sunshine is flooding the hills around ! It is like a mockery . Seventy-four years old , twenty-four days ago . Seventy-four years old yes- * fir . Gabrilowitsch had been operated on for appendicitis. terday . Who can estimate my age to-day ? I have looked upon her again . I won der I can bear it . She looks just as her mother looked when she lay dead in that Florentine villa so Iong ago . The sweet placidity of death ! it is more beautiful than sleep . I saw her mother buried . I said I would never endure that horror again ; that I would never again look into the grave of any one dear to me . I have kept to that . They will take Jean from this house to-morrow , and bear her to Elmira , New York , where lie those of us that have been released , but I shall not follow . Jean was on the dock when the ship came in , only four days ago . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reached this house the next evening . We played cards , and she tried to teach me a new game called " Mark Twain . " We sat chatting cheerily in the library last night , and she would n't let me look into the loggia , where she was making Christmas preparations . She said she would finish them in the morning , and then her little French friend would arrive from New York ? the surprise would follow ; the surprise she had been work ing over for days . While she was out for a moment I disloyally stole a look . The loggia floor was clothed with rugs and furnished with chairs and sofas ; and the uncompleted surprise was there : in the form of a Christmas tree that was drenched with silver film in a most wonderful way ; and on a table was a prodigal profusion of bright things which she . was going to hang upon it to-day . What desecrating hand will ever banish that eloquent unfinished surprise from that place ? Not mine , surely . All these little matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes ? then . But not now . Nothing she said or thought or did is little now . And all the lavish humor ' : ? what is become of it ? It is pathos , now . Pathos , and the thought of it brings tears . All these little things happened such a few hours ago ? and now she lies yonder . Lies yonder , and cares for nothing any more . Strange marvellous ? inered-ible ! I have had this experience before ; but it would still be incredible if I had had it a thousand times . " Miss Jean is dead ! " That is what Katy said . When I heard the door open behind the bed 's head without a preliminary knock , I supposed it was Jean coming to kiss me good morning , she being the only person who was used to entering without formalities . And so I have been to Jean 's parlor . Sueh a turmoil of Christmas presents for servants and friends ! They are everywhere ; tables , chairs , sofas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is many and many a year since I have seen the like . In that ancient day Mrs. Clemens and I used to slip softly into the nursery at midnight on Christmas Eve and look the array of presents over . The children were little then . And now here is Jean 's parlor looking just as that nursery used to look . The presents are not labelled ? the hands are forever idle that would have labelled them , to-day . Jean 's mother always worked herself down with her Christmas preparations . Jean did the same yesterday and the preceding days , and the fatigue has cost her her life . The fatigue caused the convulsion that attacked her this morning . She had had no attack for months . Jean was so full of life and energy that she was constantly in danger of overtaxing her strength . Every morning she was in the saddle by half past seven , and off to the station for her mail . She examined the letters and I distributed them : some to her , some to Mr. Paine , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share and then mounted her horse again and went around superintending her farm and her poultry the rest of the day . Sometimes she played billiards with me after dinner , but she was usually too tired to play , and went early to bed . Yesterday afternoon I told her about some plans I had been devising while absent in Bermuda , to lighten her burdens . We would get a housekeeper ; also we would put her share of the secretarywork into Mr. Paine 's hands . No ? she was n't willing . She had been making plans herself . The matter ended in a compromise . I submitted . I always did . She would n't audit the bills and let Paine fill out the checks ? shewould continue to attend to that herself . Also , she would continue to be housekeeper , and let Katy assist . Also , she would continue to answer the letters of personal friends for me Such was the compromise . Both of us called it by that name , though I was not able to see where any formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was sufficient for me . She was proud of being my secretary , and I was never able to persuade her to give up any part of her share in that unlovely work . In the talk last night I said I found everything going so smoothly that if she were willing I would go back to Bermuda in February and get blessedly out of the clash and turmoil again for another month . She was urgent that I should do it . and said that if I would put off the trip until March she would take Katy and go with /TIP . We struck hands upon that , and said it was settled . I had a mind to write to Bermuda by tomorrow 's ship and secure a furnished house and servants . I meant to write the letter this morning . But it will never be written , now . For she lies yonder , and before her is another journey than that . Night is closing down ; the rim of the sun barely shows above the sky-line of the hills . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearer and dearer to me every day . I was getting acquainted with Jean in these last nine months . She had been long an exile from home when she came to us three-quarters of a year ago . She had been shut up in sanitariums , many miles from us . How eloquently glad and grateful she was to cross her father 's threshold again ! Would I bring her back to life if I could do it ? I would not . If a word would do it , I would beg for strength to withhold the word . And I would have the strength ; I am sure of it . In her loss I am almost bankrupt , and my life is a bitterness , but I am content : for she has been enriched with the most precious of all gifts ? that gift . which makes all other gifts mean and poor death . I have never wanted any released friend of mine restored to life since I reached manhood . I felt in this way when Susy passed away ; and later my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the station in New York and told me Mr. Rogers had died suddenly that morning , my thought was , Oh , favorite of fortune ? fortunate all his long and lovely life ? fortunate to his latest moment ! The reporters said there were tears of sorrow in my eyes . True ? but they were for me , not for him . He had suffered no loss . All the fortunes he had ever made before were poverty compared with this one . Why did I build this house , two years ago ? To shelter this vast emptiness ? How foolish I was ! But I shall stay in it . The spirits of the dead hallow a house , for me . It was not so with other members of my family . Susy died in the house we built in Hartford . Mrs. Clemens would never enter it again . But it made the house dearer to me . I have entered it once since , when it was tenantless and silent and forlorn , but to me it was a holy place and beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead were all about me , and would speak to me and welcome me if they could : Livy , and Susy , and George , and Henry Robinson , and Charles Dudley Warner . How good and kind they were , and how lovable their lives ! In fancy I could see them all again , I could call the children back and hear them romp again with George ? that peerless black exslave and children 's idol who came one day ? a flitting stranger ? to wash windows , and stayed eighteen years . Until he died . Clara and Jean would never enter again the New York hotel which their mother had frequented in earlier days . They could not bear it . But I shall stay in this house . It is dearer to me to-night than ever it was before . Jean 's spirit will make it beautiful for me always . Her lonely and tragic death ? but T will not think of that now . Jean 's mother always devoted two or three weeks to Christmas shopping , and was always physically exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child ? she wore herself out presenthunting in New York these latter days . Paine has just found on her desk a long list of names ? fifty , he thinks ? people Vow cxxIt. ? No 728-27 to whom she sent presents last night . Apparently she forgot no one . And Katy found there a roll of bank-notes , for the servants . Tier dog has been wandering about the grounds to-day , eomradeless and forlorn . I have seen him from the windows . She got him from Germany . He has tall ears and looks exactly like a wolf . He was educated in Germany , and knows no language but the German . Jean gave him no orders save in that tongue . And so , when the burglar-alarm made a fierce clamor at midnight a fortnight ego , the butler , who is French and knows no German , tried in vain to interest the dog in the supposed burglar . Jean wrote me , to Bermuda , about the incident . It was the last letter I was ever to receive from her bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be neglected . There was never A kinder heart than Jean 's . From her childhood up she always spent the most of her allowance on charities of one kind and another . After she became secretary and had her income doubled she spent her money upon these things with a free hand . Mine too , I am glad and grateful to say , She was a loyal friend to all animals . and she loved them all , birds , beasts , and everything ? even snakes ? an inheritance from me . She knew all the birds : she was high up in that lore . She became a member of various humane societies when she was still a little girl ? both here and abroad ? and she remained an active member to the last . She founded two or three societies for the protection of animals , here and in Furope . She was an embarrassing secretary , for she fished my correspondence out of the waste-basket and answered the letters . She thought all letters deserved the courtesy of an answer . Her mother brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good Letter , and was swift with her pen . She had but an indifferent ear for music , but her tongue took to languages with an easy facility . She never allowed her Italian , French , and German to get rusty through neglect . The telegrams of sympathy are flowing in , from far and wide , now , just as they did in Italy five years and a half ago , when this child 's mother laid down her blameless life . They can not heal the hurt , but they take away some of the pain . When Jean and I kissed hands and parted at my door last , how little did we imagine that in twenty-two hours the telegraph would be bringing words like these : " From the bottom of our hearts we send our sympathy , dearest of friends . " For many and many a by to come , wherever I go in this house , remembraneers of Jean will mutely speak to me of her . Who can count the number of them ? She was in exile two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no words to express how grateful I am that she did not meet her fate in the hands of strangers , but in the loving shelter of her own home . " Miss Jean is dead ! " It is true . Jean is dead . A month ago I was writing bubbling and hilarious articles for magazines yet to appear , and now I am writing ? this . Christmas Day . Noon. ? Last night I went to Jean 's room at intervals , and turned back the sheet and looked at the peaceful face , and kissed the cold brow , and remembered that heart. - breaking night in Florence so long ago , in that cavernous and silent vast villa , when I crept down-stairs so many times , and turned back a sheet and looked at a. face just like this one ? Jean 's mother 's face ? and kissed a brow that was just like this one . And last night I saw again what I had seen then ? that strange and lovely miracle ? the sweet soft contours of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean 's mother lay dead , all trace of care , and trouble , and suffering , and the corroding years had vanished out of the face , and I was looking again upon it as I had known and worshipped it in its young bloom and beauty a whole generation before . About ' three in the morning , while wandering about the house in the deep silences , as one does in times like these , when there is a dumb sense that something has been lost that will never be found again , yet must be sought , if only for the employment the useless seeking gives , I came upon Jean 's dog in the hall down-stairs , and noted that he did not spring to greet me , according to his hospitable habit , but came slow and sorrowfully ; also I remembered that he had not visited Jean 's apartment since the tragedy . Poor fellow , did he know ? I think so . Always when Jean was abroad in the open he was with her ; always when she was in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the day . Her parlor was his bedroom . Whenever I happened upon him on the ground floor he always followed inc about , and when I went up-stairs he went too ? in a tumultuous gallop . But now it was different : after patting him a little I went to the library ? he remained behind ; when I went up-stairs he did not follow me , save with his wistful eyes . He has wonderful eyes ? big , and kind , and eloquent . He can talk with them , He is a beautiful creature , and is of the breed of the New York police-dogs . I do not like dogs , because they bark when there is no occasion for it ; but I have liked this one from the beginning , because he belonged to Jean , and because he never barks except when there is occasion ? which is not oftener than twice a week . In my wanderings I visited Jean 's parlor . On a shelf I found a pile of my books , and I knew what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bermuda and autograph them , then she would send them away . If I only knew whom she intended them for ! But I shall never know . I will keep them . Her hand has touched them ? it is an accolade ? they are noble , now . And in a closet she had hidden a surprise for nie ? a thing I have often wished I owned : a noble big globe . I could n't see it for the tears . She will never know the pride I take in it , and the pleasure . To-day the mails are full of loving remembrances for her : full of those old , old kind words she loved so well , " Merry Christmas to Jean ! " If she could only have lived one day longer ! At last she ran out of money , and would not use mine . So she sent to one of those New York homes for poor girls all the clothes she could spare ? and more , most likely . Christmas Night. ? This afternoon they took her away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went down to the library , and there she lay , in her coffin , dressed in exactly the same clothes she wore when she stood at the other end of the same room on the 6th of October last , as Clara 's chief bridesmaid . Her face was radiant with happy excitement then ; it was the same face now , with the dignity of death and the peace of God upon it . They told me the first mourner to come was the dog . He came uninvited , and stood up on his hind legs and rested his fore paws upon the trestle , and took a last long look at the face that was so dear to him , then went his way as silently as he had come . He knows . At mid-afternoon it began to snow . The pity of it ? that Jean could not see it ! She so loved the snow . The snow continued to fall . At six o'clock the hearse drew up to the door to bear away its pathetic burden . As they lifted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impromptu , which was Jean 's favorite . Then he placed the Intermezzo ; that was for Susy ; then he played the Largo ; that was for their mother . He did this at my request . Elsewhere in this Autobiography I have told how the Intermezzo and the Large came to be associated in my heart with Susy and Livy in their last hours in this life . Front my windows I saw the hearse and the carriages wind along the road and gradually grow vague and spectral in the falling snow , and presently disappear . Jean was gone out of my life , and would not come back any more . Jervis , the cousin she had played with when they were babies together ? he and her beloved old Katy ? were conductingher to her distant childhood home , where she will lie by her mother 's side once more , in the company of Susy and Langdon . December 26th. ? The dog came to see me at eight o'clock this morning . He was very affectionate , poor orphan ! My room will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has raged all the morning . The snow drives across the landscape in vast clouds , superb , sublime ? and Jean not here to see . 2.80 e.m. ? It is the time appointed . The funeral has begun . Four hundred miles away , but I can see it all , just as if I were there . The scene is the library , in the Langdon homestead . Jean 's coffin stands where her mother and I stood , forty years ago , and were married ; and where Susy 's coffin stood thirteen years ago ; where her mother 's stood , five years and a half ago ; and where mine will stand , after a little time . Fire o'clock ? It is all over . When Clara went away two weeks ago to live in Europe , it was hard , but I could bear it , for I had Jean left . I said we would be a family . We said we would be close comrades and happy ? just we two . That fair dream was in my mind when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in my mind when she received me at the door last Tuesday evening . We were together ; we were a family ! the dream had come true ? oh , preciously true , contentedly true , satisfyingly true ! and remained true two whole days . And now ? Now Jean is in her grave ! In the grave ? if I can believe it . God rest her sweet spirit
