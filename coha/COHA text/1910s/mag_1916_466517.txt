FATHER was conse-crated to the Lord when he was a baby . Being a minister in a small town did not come so hard on him . He had been trained for it from babyhood . I have often heard grand-mother tell of her prayer for a boy after a maddeningly long succession of girls . She said she went down on her knees one day in the garden where she was setting out tomato-plants and promised the Lord that if He would send her a boy , she would dedicate him to the ministry . In those days they thought nothing of making a sort of bargain with the Lord . They would agree to do so much if He would do His part ? my brother Charlie used to say that they proposed a sort of partnership compact with the Almighty . Charlie and I did not mean to be irreverent . We had religion administered in such overwhelming and in such insistent and curiously inconsistent doses that we were compelled to furnish our own antidote to maintain a balance ? a stabilizer , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday services and endless serious talk of the church and its problems , Charlie and I would slip out to our special corner of the woodshed , where we went to talk over the affairs of the universe that puzzled us , and relieve our feelings by saying " damn . " We had no special application for the word ; but the mere explosive use of it seemed to soothe our pent-up feelings , especially as we knew it was forbidden as an extremely wicked expletive . It was not that we wished to he profane , but that we needed a relaxation after the solemn conversations that most of our callers seemed to think were necessary . Often they demanded prayers as well . Everybody knelt , and one after another offered up long prayers , taking much comfort in the rolling , unctuous sentences . The trouble was that both Charlie and myself had inherited mother 's brain and her keen power of analysis and fund of humor , without inheriting either her broad faith and belief in religion , or father 's . Mother accepted life meekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few women in the congregation did their own thinking . They allowed the men in their family to do it for them and accepted the result without ques-tion , quoting their males quite simply and without malice . They were proud of their men-folks ' ability to think ; but they seldom dreamed of trying it for themselves . The popular conception of God among the children of the congregations , as taught by our elders , was a fiercely impatient Personage sitting on a throne high in an invisible heaven and invariably mad at us . He was supposed to punish us instantly for every transgression . We feared Him as a child would fear an irate parent ; but we did not dare to love Him as we loved our own parents . Father was consecrated . So was mother . They practically devoted their lives to their religion . They did it cheerfully and joyfully . It was a vital element of their lives . There are thousands like them in the small towns in this country . I used to pity my mother with a vague wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I felt dimly that mother never had a chance . I wanted to see her well-gowned and leading a meeting at the women 's clubs , as other girls ' mothers did . She was prettier and sweeter than any of them , yet she had few clothes and almost no comforts . But mother was gentle and uncomplaining , and with a flashing spirit of humor that sometimes bubbled up when we were alone in our family circle , only to be as quickly suppressed , lest some one drop in and deem her undignified . Mother would have been a wonderful woman if she had ever had a chance to adjust herself . A wonderful woman to the world , I mean , for she was always wonderful to us children . Religion meant much to her , and she was always happy with her family . Her pride in father was pathetic . It was different with father . He had been brought up to the idea that the ministry was the noblest calling to which man could attain , and he looked upon himself as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a minister , he was entitled to privileges that we could not share . Besides that , mother used always to keep as many of our worries from him as possible . Father had to dress well , to appear properly before his congregation , and mother saw to it that his black broadcloth suits were never shiny or shabby . He was generally sure of so many good meals away from home that he did not often notice the poor ones we served at our own table . Like nearly all the ministers in a small town charge , he had a country appointment . It meant that every Sunday afternoon he must drive from five to ten miles to a country church to hold services . On these occasions he would be invited to eat dinner or supper with some of the congregation . i You know how it is ? they always set the best in the house before the minister . He was sure of chicken and preserves and good vegetables and plenty of cream for his coffee . Sometimes we had only bread and butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , we kept a cow , and Charlie and I milked her in turns . This helped out wonderfully . Usually we had a garden . Otherwise we would have gone hungry many a time . My sisters and the other boys in the family took things as a matter of course ; but to i Charlie and myself it seemed unfair to see men not nearly so intelligent as father having sufficient income with which to support their families in comfort and under no obligation to consider a con-gregation in any way . Until I was sixteen I never had any new clothes . I wore what was handed down to me from my mother or what the congregation furnished . The one yearn-ing of my childhood was to have an entirely new outfit , purchased expressly for me . I wanted a dress , hat , gloves , and shoes all new at once . My mother understood my longing , and with the first money I ever earned , when I was sixteen years old , she bought for me the first really new garments I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naturally . To me , a chocolate ice-cream soda represented all the pleasures of life . To be able to walk carelessly into the village drug-store and order a chocolate ice-cream soda seemed to me to be more bliss than would ever be my lot ? for when fate handed me an ice-cream soda I generally had a small sister or brother whose innate helplessness almost demanded the larger share . I used to dream of the day when I could eat all I wanted without feeling selfish about it . I said the congregation managed to clothe me somehow . I grew fast , and I never seemed to be able to meet the seasons with my garments . When spring was fairly launched on a surprised and welcoming world , I was still wearing heavy underwear because there had been no way found to provide me with those for spring . My wrists and ankles could not restrain themselves modestly within the garments offered me , and I was such a general misfit that I shrank from observation when I went to church or to school , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me with what I deemed a patronizing air , and the former owner of my shoes was wont to glance at her own smartly shod feet and then gaze meditatively at mine until I was crazy to jerk those shoes from my feet and throw them at her head . We never dreamed of laving these things at our parents ' door . We saw no fault in them ; but we did see error in the religion that seemed to pay very poor and exceedingly few returns on the investment . I remember one evening hearing my father tell mother of an old friend of his . The friend had exchanged into an Oklahoma conference in the hope that things would be better financially . Later on he wrote to the Conference and asked to be honorably dismissed and to have his name taken from the Conference list . He said that in the past three years he had succeeded in collecting only four hundred and eighty-five dollars of his salary , and that this amount hardly sufficed for the support of a family of six . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should endeavor to get into some line of business that would maintain his family , since he could not support them in the ministry . He said he believed God was still in the church , but not often in the congregation . Charlie and I retired to our consultation-room in the woodshed when we heard that , and he said he wished father would do the same thing . He said he was so tired of living on prospects that he would rather stand honorably on the street-corner with a handful of shoestrings and lead-pencils and beg openly and aboveboard for a living . For when you come right down to it , we were little less than profeSsional beggars . Many ministers ' families are . They deny it , of course , and cite you long precepts in which they point out that the laborer is worthy of his hire ? which is true , but the ministerial laborer in the small town can not always collect his hire . When we went on visits to our country parishioners for a day we were always on the alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take home . Poor , distracted mother would craftily plan to visit in the country along about the time that our lard ran out , because she knew everybody in the country had plenty and might replenish our stock . Mother , bless her anxious soul , did not know she was a beggar ; but she was . The church had always doled out her living in this way , and she had always so accepted it . We always expected something . But we expected it with an air of polite nonchalance . We would appear intensely surprised when they handed us the basket of apples or potatoes or fresh pork as we left . They were accustomed to it , too . But while they respected father for his ministerial ability , they despised us for our dependence on them . They despised us while they fed us , even at the annual donation-parties . How we hated those donation-parties ! One man used to save all his specked potatoes for the donation-party which was expected to take the place of anincrease in father 's salary . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up themselves , including whatever delicacies mother might have stored away in her preserve-cellar against unexpected company . At these parties they used up our reserve table-cloths and napkins , and upset the house and scattered crumbs about , and mother and I had to clean seemingly for days to get the house in order again . We used to covertly feed those specked potatoes to the chickens later . If they had given us the money the things cost , we could have lived sensibly for weeks on it . They seldom thought to bring flour or coffee or sugar or hams , or other things that would keep . They brought perishable things ? and helped eat them . The curious ones had a chance to snoop about in mother 's closets and note their condition ? to talk about later with their neighbors . At the last donation-party we had , Charlie and I went out into the kitchen and , under the pretense of helping , sequestered a whole roast chicken , a grand loaf of the famous Jones chocolate cake , plenty of fresh rolls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awhile . We had some good eating for a few days . But when mother thanked Mrs. Jones who always helped serve at the donation - parties ? the latter looked thoughtfully at Charlie and me and seemed to be recalling the fact that she could not find that cake or chicken on the night of the donation-party , when she wanted to cut them for the guests . Mrs. Jones was noted for her cooking . I have often heard guests pass by a plate of cake at a party and say , patiently : " I do n't care for any , thanks . I think wait for Mrs. Jones 's choco-late cake . " Mrs. Jones was kind-hearted , and said nothing . She had been a minister 's daughter herself in her day . She was one of the really fine souls who were our comfort in our congregation . The only trouble was that the people worth cultivating sat back in the church work and let the other set run the church . The other set were inclined to be aggressive , and to offer father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs in general . One of the deacons came into the parsonage one night and reproved father because he had not preached a sermon on Hell in a long time . Poor father used to hold off from that subject as much as he could . In his blessed old heart of hearts he did not believe in eternal punishment at all ; but the congregation expected an old-fashioned sermon on Hell about once a year . Father used to preach that sermon fast and get it over with visible relief . Deacon Brown also brought up the matter of our trading at Byrnes ' s instead of with Simmons . Byrnes was a Presbyterian , and Simmons a Methodist . Mother broke in with the gentle defense that Byrnes had the best and cheapest groceries ; but Mr. Brown retorted that the discipline of our church required that we trade with members of the church wherever possible . It did , too . Charlie and I looked it up . I advised father , after Brown had gone , to go down and trade up a good-sized bill with Simmons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least we might have had a few good meals on the strength of it . Father reproved me gravely , and my heart sank with remorse , for the poor old dear had trouble enough without having his children , who adored him , make him more worry by our unrestrained behavior . You see , the average minister is flayed by the lash of a thousand whips . And no laborer in the city ever harbors a more sincere fear of losing his job than does the minister in the small town . A black-list in the church is a thousand times more deadly than a black-list in industrial life . Father was of the type that is inclined to leave too much of the practical details of life to God . His was the religion that goes with the long black coat and somber black ties that seem to be the badge of service of the old-fashioned minister . In one of the towns in which we lived there was a minister ? he was a Presbyterian or a Baptist ? who scandalized the people of his church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He donned his livery on Sundays only . Once , when he had waited three months for the stewards of his church to have the leaking roof of the parsonage repaired , he wentdown-town and bought a pair of overalls , put them on , and climbed up on the roof in full view of the passing public and mended the leak himself . The congregation raised a dreadful stir over this lack ofdigniity , but I always admired i that minister . We belonged to the tribe of moving ministers . We moved every other year or so . Father was a saint on earth , and he would come home from each Conference with news of another move and full-up with enthusiasm and renewed energy and plans for doing good and enlarging his congregation . He would also come home with pledges for half his year 's salary , for missions and funds and endowments and all the other things that are brought up before the Conference . At such times the ministers , unless they are restrained by prudent wives , become overzealous , and are apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes the congregations did not agree with father about these pledges . Then mother must get out and hustle and plan for socials and entertainments to make up the money , and the congregation would growl about it , and object to sending the money out of town . That is the reason why so many ministers ' wives try to attend Conference with their husbands . They act as a restraining judgment , so to speak . Not but that the Conference is a sort of vacation to the wives . It is the one time of the year when they can eat good meals without having to worry about cooking or washing dishes . They revel in the steam-heated rooms and the luxury of white bath-tubs and hot water and of wearing their best clothes every day . They sit around and exchange experiences in a ladylike manner ? poor dearsl ? and warn one another about the queer parishioners and the warring factions of the charge to which each may be sent . We dreaded the pledges almost as much as the moving . Many times we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledges when the congregation refused to meet them . And as for the moving , no sooner were we fitted down into the grooves of our new appointment and become accustomed to the ills we wotted of , and grown to like the many good and kind friends and how best to avoid rasping the others , than we had to move on again and encounter new hardships . So , either way , we did not care much for Conference . I saw a poor chap the other day in a thy park . He was settled in the sun for a comfortable snooze . My heart throbbed with sympathy when a policeman tapped him on his feet and invited him to " move on . " He had been there as long as the law allowed . I knew exactly how that tramp felt when he rose meekly to his feet and shambled away . He will never know that the reason I gave him a bit of money that day was because I knew what it meant to be tapped by the Conference officials and bade to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with father to the conferences as a matter of precaution . It was cheaper in the long run . Usually she took but little part in the women 's meetings ; but one day in the midst of a woman 's missionary meeting at Conference she started something . Some one in the meeting had reproved her because she would not pledge twenty-five dollars for foreign missions . So mother got right up in meeting and said she did not propose to let her own children go without clothes any more since one of its had caught pneumonia from wearing thin shoes so that she could pay for shoes for little colored children who lived in a warm climate and seldom cared to wear clothes anyhow . She said at least the savages provided for their own families first , and that was a trait that might well be emulated by some Christians . She told us about it when she came home . Her cheeks were flushed with remorse , and she felt rather ashamed of her outburst . But we hugged her and shouted with approving laughter . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fully for maw ! " If we seem to have run to slang it was only because we had to have some outlet for our emotions ; otherwise we would have burst . Father recognized that , and both he and mother wisely turned a deaf ear at times . This saved us later , for I have always believed that one VOL . CXXXIII. ? No. 706. - 64reason why ministers ' children have such a sinister reputation is that the change from the suppressed and restricted home atmosphere to the relaxation they encounter away from home goes to their heads and intoxicates them into unrestrained enjoyment of their liberty . I used to wonder what the congregations thought we lived on . They knew that they never quite made up father 's salary ; but they never seemed to worry about it . He was n't commercial enough to demand it , as they say ministers do in some places . He had a fixed belief that the Lord would provide somehow . But often the provision was so dilatory and so far from being up to specifications that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really had firm faith in was mother 's prayers . You see , the wedding fees in any parsonage , from time immemorial , have been turned over to the minister 's wife . She has them in fee-simple . This is the one bit of extra money a minister 's wife ever gets . We used to long for weddings . We fervently believed in matrimony . We would have encouraged it in every way possible . For those wedding fees bought us the only new garments we ever had . When we noted signs of interest in any young couple ? coming Ns ith the loved one to morning service was generally a pretty sure indication ? we used to wait hopefully . Sometimes we heard of the engagement of some young couple outside the church , and we would race home to mother with the news and wonder wistfully if they would ask father to marry them . We would have made a grand publicity staff for him , if we had known what publicity meant . And if there seemed to be dull times in the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow we never placed much hope in father 's prayers . We took them for granted . But mother was different . Her prayers were specific . She asked right out for things she needed , whereas father wandered about a good deal in his petitions , and used phrases that did not seem to mean anything particularly . But when affairs verged on the stringent in the home , we would snuggle up to mother and whisper : " Pray for a wedding , mother . " And mother prayed for the wedding , and it frequently came . So we had strong faith in her prayers . She never tried to fool herself about those prayers . She knew she was praying for material comforts for her family , and she told the Lord so right out plain . It convinced me that we got better results when we acted square with the Lord and did not attempt to deceive Him with specious motives . Many times mother was too tired and weak to drag herself about the house ; but it would have offended the congregation horribly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were expected to do our own washing and ironing and sewing . It never ceased to be their money , you see . They did not figure that father really earned that salary . They thought they gave it to him as a testimonial of their religion , and they considered themselves mighty nice folks to give it to him at all . I remember once sitting in a meeting of the Ladies ' Aid in a city where an hour was spent in wrangling over the fact that the minister 's wife had asked for a new tea-kettle for her kitchen . The parsonage was furnished , and the tea-kettle had sprung a leak . To me the important fact was that it had never occurred to her to go down to the ten-cent store and buy a new one for herself . I would have boiled water in the dishpan before I would have humiliated myself by sitting through that session of argument as to whether the parsonage kitchen was to he endowed with a new tea-kettle . They looked upon it as extremely careless on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but that teakettle cost too high a price to have afforded me any satisfaction , if it had been my kitchen . But she was a minister 's wife , and she had been a minister 's daughter , and so the fact that she was practically a pensioner on the congregation did not occur to her . Father never seemed to have the knack of getting ahead . He did not know how to cultivate the men who could have procured for him the better appointments in the larger cities . We had the places no one else wanted , and father accepted them without a murmur . He did his work quietly and conscientiously , and never learned the art of bragging about it or reading glowing reports at the quarterly conferences Charlie says you have to pull wires for the best places at Conference the same as you do in political conventions . Father never complained . He believed that the Lord knew what He was doing when He gave him mighty stony ground to work on . It did n't seem to me that the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lack of initiative . Our position as children of the minister was a negative one . Charlie could not play baseball or football as these were not considered nice recreations for a minister 's son . As a minister 's daughter , I occupied much the same position in society in the different towns in which we lived as a parsnip does in the vegetable garden . A parsnip is a good , sensible vegetable , useful to fill out or to season soup ; but who wants a parsnip as a delicacy or a treat A young man will think twice before he braves the terrors of a minister 's parlor to call on the minister 's daughter . If he has the courage to do so , he is not generally the man her friends would select for her . If he is of the noble , high-browed , and negative type , he is not the man she would choose for herself . For a minister 's daughter has her dreams of ro-mance ' too . If she could choose for herself , you might be surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business man who will bring home , without the need of appeals from the pulpit , a salary that will pay the bills comfortably and have a little left over . About the only class of men we had an opportunity to meet were the impecunious ministers . I remember once at Conference , when mother took me because we lived near the Conference city and I needed some dental work done , that I saw an old minister superannuated . He did not want to be superannuated . He made a pitiful appeal to the bishop in front of the audience . He had no other means of livelihood to turn to . He had been preaching the gospel , as well as he could , since he was twenty . The bishop did not like to do it . I heard him tell father that " dead timber " must he dug out of the Conference . Father winced , and I knew what he was thinking of , for he knew that he , too , was becoming " dead timber , " and that some day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the dead timber must be removed if there was to be a healthy growth in the church , but I could not reconcile myself to the conditions that made dead timber out of once thriving and sturdy material , Once in a while we had good charges . The salary was paid regularly and we found an appreciation in the congregation that tended to raise our self-respect . And then what Charlie called the " game law " would run out on us ? our term was up ? and we had to move on like the tramp in the park . Sometimes I have asked as to these conditions among other ministers ' daughters . I find that practically the same conditions and the same rebellion in them exist in every denomination . Sometimes I strike colorless creatures , made so by colorless and repressed environment , and they are shocked at my inquiry and ask anxiously and plaintively after the state of my soul . I remember once how I startled such a young woman when she told me sweetly that it was God 's will that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you think we blame the Almighty for a lot of things He is not responsible for ? " I asked her . She shrank from me as if I had uttered blasphemy . Once my mother 's sister sent her a pink-silk waist . It was very becoming , and she wore it to a church social . But the congregation complained that a pink-silk waist was not dignified for a minister 's wife , and she had to dye it black before she wore it again . Mother did not belong to her family ; she belonged to her congregation . We all loved her in the pink waist , but she did not dare to wear it in the face of the disapproval of the congregation . No salary was included for her in the contract , but she was expected to work just as hard as father in her public career as a minister 's wife , and to keep up her full share of the business of being a wife and mother as well . Religion in the small town always afforded me much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the same . The Presbyterians quarrelled constantly with the Methodists , and both were on cool terms with the Baptists . All of them picked on the Catholics , and everybody considered the Episcopalians " stuck up . " There are faction fights all the year around , and the yearly revivals are the grand clearing-houses of emotion . People in all the churches sort of saved up for the revival , and all differences of opinion were held in abeyance until the revivals closed , when they broke out again fiercer than ever . They would bring i an expensive evangelist to preach and a good old exhorter to bring the mourners to the bench after the sermon had melted them . The motion pictures , however , have crowded the revivals pretty close of late years as an emotional outlet . Of course , we as minister 's children would not have been allowed to attend motion pictures . We were barred from all healthy recreation , and the joys of religion had to suffice for the minister 's family . Sometimes we would encounter the worn-out ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They became colpurters . Others called them book-agents . They were not generally successes at the business , and sometimes their wives had to try sewing or selling extracts and perfumes from door to door ? the last mile-stone on the road to despair . When I would see mother drop her work and sit looking out of the window on days when things had been going wrong , I knew she was wondering whether she could ever sell extracts and perfumes . We missed most of our happiness because we were always at the beck and call of the congregation . We never owned ourselves , either individually or as a family . The only woman I ever knew who had the courage to insist on being merely the wife of the minister and not the parish aid was a young woman who had a profession of her own and could have gone out and earned twice as much as her husband earned when he began . But she had the courage of her convictions , and her husband is a minister in a prominent city church now at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old days . Nobody expected a minister to earn much . Yet sometimes a yearning for the old days in the shabby parsonage , crowded with children and filled with affection , comes over inc . I had a friend who was to be married . There was no time for wedding plans , for the wedding-trip was to be a journey to a foreign land as an adjunct to an important business affair . She was a minister 's daughter , and she instantly caught my meaning when suggested that she hunt up the poorest minister she could find to officiate . " Remember those happy days when a generous wedding fee brought joy to the family ? " I said . So we telephoned to the Board of Missions for a list of the ministers in the small charges . We found one at the edge of the city . And as we stepped into the shabby little parsonage parlor our delighted eyes roved about and telegraphed the message , " We have found the place just like home . " We recognized the tidies and the faded pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valiant move ? and the sofa over the worn spot in the carpet to hide it . It looked just like home , and it took the place of home to that bride , for the minister had the calm , strong , serene face of the patient , overworked minister in a small charge . His wife took the bride by the hand and kissed her and wished her happiness , just as I have seen my mother do scores of times to the brides who had stood in our shabby parlor . It did my heart good to see that wife 's face light up when the young husband handed her a modest little roll of bills , There was enough there for a whole new spring outfit , and we hoped with all our hearts that she would get it . I saw the delicate face of a fifteen-year-old girl from behind the parlor door , and I saw her beam as she looked at the money in her mother 's hand ? just as I used to beam when mother had a ten-dollar fee instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was lined like father 's . I saw the shadow on the brow of his wife like that mother had ? the shadow that came from the fear of being dug out as dead timber . Some day we shall see these things all as they should be ? strong , virile , and abiding . And then the minister 's wife and daughter may emerge from their shackles the Tyranny of the Congregation .
