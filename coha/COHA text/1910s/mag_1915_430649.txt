 | WHENEVER and however the Great War ends , the international trade rivalry which it has temporarily and partially interrupted will begin again with greater energy than before because of the necessity of repairing damages and regaining lost ground . Those Americans who have tried to find some selfish consolation in the thought that the United States would benefit by the disaster which has befallen all the other great powers are doomed to disappointment . The money we have received from the sale of food products and munitions will by no means compensate for the present loss of our normal trade with the outside world . Cotton has been left on Southern fields because it would not pay to pick , and Northern factories of export articles have been obliged to shut down . Nor is there any prospect of advantage to us in the future . In the first place the purchasing power of all the belligerent nations will be reduced for many years to come . In the second place the war has inflamed local patriotism and revived national jealousies , and this feeling will interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutrality has offended both sides . It is particularly distressing to note the growing hostility which is manifested toward the United States in the British press all over the world . Before the war the relations between English speaking countries were becoming increasingly friendly and they were beginning to realize how much they had in common and how much mutual benefit they might derive by closer intercourse . Our traditional animosity toward England dating from the Revolutionary and the Civil War had died down and the British Government had since the time of the Spanish War treated the United States with great consideration . But now a decided change of disposition is manifested toward us . We gather from reading the papers of England and still more of the dominions that the sympathy with the Allied cause shown by the great majority of the American people , the generosity of America in relieving distress in Belgium , France and Serbia , the favor shown to the Allies in supplying them with unlimited munitions of war and our toleration of British interference with neutral commerce without regard to international law , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the usual perfunctory note of congratulation was sent to the Kaiser on his birthday and that we failed to issue a paper protest against the violation of Belgian neutrality . But however unjust we may think the British feeling we have to recognize its existence and the fact that it will have an effect on future trade relations . The war has accomplished a miracle in the unification of the British Empire and will compel its reorganization upon new lines . The oversea dominions have this time generously sent their sons to France and Turkey to die in a quarrel about which they were never consulted , but they will not consent to be so ignored in the future . They will insist upon their right to be heard hereafter on questions affecting the whole empire and the mother country on her part must make some concessions to their opinions and desires . Up to the war England had stuck to her traditional faith in free trade in spite of the fact that her industries were suffering from the invasion of goods made in protected Germany . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , out of loyalty to the Mother Country , granted differential duties in favor of British products ; still , the importations from Germany were before the war increasing more rapidly than from the United Kingdom , in spite of this handicap . The war , however , has at last given the distrest British manufacturer the chance he has been longing for , and he is certainly making the most of it . He realizes that he can do more than the British soldier to destroy the power of Germany , and his patriotism inspires him to greater exertions than he has hitherto made at the instigation of selfinterest alone . To kill off a half a million of her soldiers will not permanently disable Germany because her natural increase in population is nearly a million a year . But to destroy her foreign commerce will deprive twenty millions of their living . The Krupp machinery is more dreaded in England than the Krupp guns . As long as the war lasts and Britannia rules the waves German competition can be eliminated , but peace must come some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm hold of the markets of the empire and of the outside world the competition will begin again , and perhaps with the same result . To forestall this , twenty-two organizations have been formed in England for the purpose of promoting British commerce and boycotting German goods . The names of some of them will indicate their object :  | " Union Jack Industries League , " " All British Trades Association , " " The Entente Trade League , " " The Anti-German Trading League , " " British Eggs , Ltd. , " " Anti-German League , Ltd. , " " Patriotic Cinema Lectures Association . " The AntiGerman League hopes soon to have a million members who have signed the following pledge : I hereby sincerely and conscientiously promise : ( a ) Not to purchase , use , or consume German or Austrian goods of any kind whatever . ( b ) Not to employ a German for either domestic or commercial purposes . ( c ) Not to place contracts with any German owned or controlled company , trust , or corporation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( d ) To boycott and assist in the boycotting of any trader who persists in stocking German or Austrian goods while British goods of equal quality and price are available . ( e ) To hold no intercourse socially or commercially with Germans , and to ostracise from all respectable society every British-born woman who marries a German subject . The members of the Australian parliament have all taken a vow never to buy any goods of German origin . The Russian Novoe Vremya advocates a permanent anti-German boycott league of all the Allies and the United States . French and Italian papers are urging a Quadruple Customs Union . But in spite of the efforts of press and societies to create a public sentiment opposed to trade with Germany , it has been found impossible to prevent it even in time of war , when patriotic feeling is most intense . Coal has been shipped from England to Krupp since the war began , and British copper , tea , coffee and cocoa have continued to get into Germany by way of Sweden or Holland in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this opportunity to recover their commercial prestige and to develop their manufactories so as to be independent of any other nation is shown by the following passage , which I quote from W. H. Dawson 's article , " The Campaign Against German Trade , " in the November number of the Fortnightly Review : Now , in a most unexpected way , the chance of a century has come to us , for whatever the political results of the war may be the economic results for ourselves may prove immensely advantageous . For the country which has so long been menacing our industry and commerce has suddenly become a country with which for the time being we may not trade , even if we would ; its industries are paralysed ; its argosies have been swept from the seas ; and most of the markets in which its greatest conquests had been achieved are open to us as never before . To improve the opportunities thus offered is the great task and duty of the hour , and upon the vigour , intelligence , and foresight shown by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future course of our economic development and prosperity for generations depend . Of course , the English have no desire to profit by the misfortunes of their allies , but nevertheless it adds to their present advantage that the region now devastated by the German arms , Belgium , Luxemburg and northern France , is , next to Germany , the strongest competitor of Great Britain on the continent , in agriculture and manufacture . It is evident that the enmity which has been aroused by the present war will be carried over to the trade war which will follow it , and that in this commercial conflict , which will be longer and much more serious in its effect upon the fate of nations , it will be still more difficult , perhaps impossible , for us to maintain our neutrality . Whether Germany will be permanently crippled by the war and be forced to retire from the markets of the world can not be known for some years yet . But it is certain , unless the Allies suffer a severe defeat , that England . will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The British Empire has been enlarged during the year of war by the acquisition of territory amounting to nearly twenty times the area of the United Kingdom . This might be regarded as a gain to American commercial opportunities if England continues her former policy of opening her Crown colonies on equal terms to the trade of the world , but it is not probable that this liberal policy will be maintained much longer . In fact , the Government has definitely broken with the free trade doctrine , for last month the ministry of all parties asked Parliament to pass a tariff law for the avowed purpose of restricting imports . The self-governing dominions of the British Empire are not likely longer to continue acquiescent to an arrangement which permits , for example , England to buy her wheat from the United States whenever it is cheaper than in Canada , while Canada bars out American machinery by a tariff wall in order to protect the British manufacturer . We may then expect to see , as a result of the war , the formation of some sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also including its present Allies . In that case the United States would have to decide the momentous question of whether we should go into it or stay out . If we decided not to go into the union , or if England refused to admit us , we would be shut out of most of the markets of the world or enter them only under the handicap of differential duties . Such a customs union ? it would be offensive to use in this connection the customary term Zollverein ? would control all of Africa and Australasia , most of Asia and a large part of Europe and North America . The only undeveloped countries that would be open to our trade on equal terms would be Latin-America and for the present China minus Manchuria , Mongolia and Shantung , which are already under the sway of the Allied Powers . But it would be borrowing trouble from the indefinite future to worry now lest the present military alliance should develop later into a customs union of such a form and extent as to be inimical to American  | interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , directed primarily against Germany , not against the United States . But of course the systematic cultivation of a popular preference in favor of " home-made " products must , to some extent , interfere with the introduction of foreign goods whatever their source , and it would be a mistake for us to assume that , because the people of the British Empire have conceived a prejudice against Germany , they would be glad to see the United States take her place . Just now they doubtless would buy American goods in preference to German , but they are hoping soon to get along without either . We must understand that the " war on German trade " is not being waged for the benefit of American trade , and any attempt on our part to take advantage of the prevalent anti-German feeling is apt to be resented . How some of the Australians regard our timid efforts in this direction may be seen by the following quotation from the Sydney Bulletin , which , after complaining of the United States for sending tea , copper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : The same obliging country is anxious to supply Australia with any goods it may require , and in an endeavor to secure the old-time business of Germany is even sending to this country an exhibition ship , loaded with every sort of article judged to be saleable hereabouts . Meanwhile , presumably to help on the sales , and with the object generally of obscuring the issues , the United States puts up from time to time some dreary bore to say that blood is thicker than water , and that the United States should join in as a belligerent on the side of Britain . Thus Dr. Eliot , an exUniversity Professor , lately reiterated the proposition about blood and water , and wound up with the customary tiring statement that his folk should " join in . " As a matter of blunt fact , the United States ca n't join in , because it has nothing to join in with . Its army consists of a mere rag-tag crowd of 84,000 volunteers , partly white . Its navy is indifferent in ships , and in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to leave off work now and again to dine with the American Admiral and waste valuable time listening to long , wordy orations about blood and water , it would be a nuisance . The only way in which the United States are capable of effectively " joining in " is by refraining from selling war material to our enemies . Until they do this , every good Australian will regard the bloodand-water talk as merely the hot-air of a Yankee salesman , whose business principles , so far from having any preferent claim on us , are supplying us with very excellent reasons why they should be cut out altogether . In order to replace German goods the British manufacturer needs first to know what they are . Accordingly British agents all over the world have been requested to send in the articles " made in Germany " which have the greatest sale in their respective localities . These are put on exhibition in the cities of the United Kingdom so that the manufacturers may examine and imitate them as nearly as possible . An invaluable aid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament passed soon after the declaration of war , authorizing English firms to take over German patents and trademarks . The Scientific American of November 14 says of this : At least one hundred of the more valuable patented products which Germans have developed only after the most painstaking research and the expenditure of vast sums are likely to be made by British firms who have contributed in their development not one whit of intellectual effort or a single penny in money . The situation in trademarks is equally serious . Thus the valuable trademark " Pebeco " for a tooth paste manufactured by Beiersdorf &; Co. of Hamburg ; the mark " Aspirin , " the name of a well-known drug manufactured by Bayer &; Co. of Germany ; the trade name " Formamint , " owned by von Wulfing of Berlin , and other marks , made priceless by sound business methods , are likely to appear upon British equivalents . This raises some perplexing ethical questions . The objection has been made that the assumption of a patent or trademark is the same thing as the confiscation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare , but this argument is not likely to have much weight in view of the disregard shown by the Germans for the rules of civilized warfare . It is probably impossible to lay down any general rule to cover all the cases . Everybody would agree that it would be contrary to public interest that the manufacture of such a medicine as salvarsan should be stopped because it is controlled by a German patent , but , on the other hand , the assumption of a trade name which owes its value solely to advertising and business enterprise and is not necessary for the preparation of the article seems very much like what our cousins oversea are fond of calling a " Yankee trick . " But we do not have to decide upon the justice of the practise , since our American manufacturers are removed from temptation . The privilege of using German patents is confined to countries at war with Germany . The war disclosed the fact that we were as dependent upon England for rubber as England upon Germany for chemicals . Our newspapers raised a howl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crude rubber from her colonies and our ' State Department was beseeched to remonstrate . It is hard to see what grounds we have for a protest . The British Government has a perfect right to keep its own rubber now when it is badly needed at home , and any criticism should be directed at those who have failed to see to it that we had a supply of our own to fall back upon . It is the old story of the ant and the butterfly , of  | the wise and foolish virgins . The lesson is costly ; let 's hope we profit by it . According to the Rubber Club of America we lost about $250,000 a day because we have been content to buy instead of raise our rubber . The price of caout-chouc went up from forty-five to ninety cents a pound and the industry in which we take our greatest pride , the automobile business , which amounts to $450,000,000 a year , was seriously threatened when for two months last fall not a pound of crude rubber came forward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its importation on the guarantee of American rubber manufacturers that none of it should reach Germany . In 1914 the rubber raised on plantations , chiefly British , furnished more than half the world 's supply and was worth about $65,000,000 . Next year will be more profitable , for the price is higher , the crop is greater and the acquisition of Togo , Kamerun and Kaiser Wilhelm 's Land gives Great Britain command of the German sources of supply . But the rubber tree is on trial , for synthetic caout-chouc has been made both in England and Germany , and it only remains to be seen whether a raw material can be found cheap enough to compete with the cultivated product . But whether the rubber of the future be natural or artificial , America is equally " out of it , " for we have neither the plantations or the laboratories capable of producing it , and so have to pay tribute to those countries which have had more forethought . It has long been evident that the wild trees of the African and South American forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lash fell more heavily on the backs of the natives of Belgian Kongo and Putumayo , but it only drew forth blood instead of the desired increase in the flow of the latex . So the English and Germans , foreseeing the famine , began to prepare for it by planting rubber trees in their tropical possessions . This was some fifteen years ago , and now Great Britain has 600,000 acres of rubber plantations and Germany 50,000 . The United States , which uses half the world 's output of rubber , is practically producing none , altho we have good land for it in the Philippines , Hawaii and Porto Rico . Besides our own colonies , Mexico , Central America and the West Indies would have welcomed the American planter . But the policy of the present Administration in Mexico has not been such as to encourage Americans to attempt the development of the resources of the countries south of us . " You go at your own risk and if you get into trouble do n't expect any help from us , " has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look beyond the borders of the United States for business opportunities . Needless to say , our competitor countries , Great Britain and Germany , take quite the opposite view of the duty of a government to its commercial pioneers . One other tropical product must be mentioned in this connection , and that is the meat of the coconut , known in commerce as copra . This was once thought only fit for soap fat , but the chemist with the aid of a catalytic agent succeeded in transforming the evil-smelling oil into a solid white and wholesome fat , and it has become one of the chief ingredients in margarine and other substitutes for butter and lard in cooking and table use . This simple chemical reaction which any schoolboy ? of the Macaulay caliber ? could write upon the blackboard , has been worth hundreds of millions to Europe . Germany has been paying out forty million dollars a year for copra and it was sold for a great deal more . The margarine industry has developed to immense proportions in Great Britain , but still it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands , and they had to import 150,000,000 pounds of margarine a year , chiefly from Germany and Denmark . This amounts to more than a third of her butter imports . The coconut grows close to the seashore and here is where the tropical archipelagoes have the advantage , for the smaller the islands the greater the coast line . The sixteen hundred islands of the Philippines with the help  | of Guam , Samoa , Hawaii and Porto Rico , might be made to supply us with all the vegetable fats we need within ten years if we start in now with the systematic planting of coconut groves as the Germans and English have done . The Philippines , even with their present inefficient methods , provide one-fourth of the world 's supply of copra , worth $12,000,000 a year . As civilization advances and population become more dense , the inhabitants of temperate zones become necessarily more dependent on the tropics . Where the sunshine falls straightest and the rain falls heaviest there the food of the future will be produced . In the various lists that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , two items stand out conspicuously , for they are usually the only foods which have not risen in price . These are sugar and bananas , both tropical carbohydrates . No nation can call itself independent unless it has command of the seven C 's : coffee , cacao , copra , cotton , cane and caout-chouc . Of cotton we have enough and to spare . Our sugar supply under the Stars and Stripes is less than half of what we need , and less than half of this is grown on the continent in either beets or cane . For the other C 's we must depend upon our outlying possessions or foreign countries . Germany , France and the United Kingdom are destitute of all these requisites of modern civilization and it is their struggle for territories where tropical and semi-tropical products could be grown that has involved them in war . First France and England came into conflict over the cotton land of Egypt , but war was avoided by a compromise between them which gave Egypt to England and Morocco to France . Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened war , but thought better of it and sought compensation in Anatolia . Here she was again checkmated thru a combination of Russia and Great Britain , who divided up Persia between them and so shut off from its outlet the German Bagdad railroad . Consequently the German Government has been teaching the natives of its African possessions how to grow cotton , copra and coffee . The history of the sugar industry is especially interesting in this connection , for it illustrates both the points under consideration , first , the importance of tropical dependencies and second the possibility of developing other sources of food supply thru applied botany and chemistry . The beet sugar business , like many another advance in civilization , owes its origin to war . Napoleon , finding that Great Britain as mistress of the seas had shut off the sugar supply of Europe , instigated an inquiry to ascertain if there were not some possible source at home . Such a source was found in the beet , but it seemed absurd to suppose that a root with a slightly sweetish taste could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tropics . But the beet was put thru a course of eugenics with the result that in the course of a hundred years its sugar content was raised from six per cent to sixteen or even twenty , and today the world gets 6,300,000 tons of sugar from beets in comparison with 8,400,000 from cane . The American farmer who buys a sack of sugar beet seed marked " Made in Germany " knows that every one of the little brown seeds has a certified pedigree of a hundred generations in which not one ancestor has fallen below the high standard of quality . This is more than can be claimed by the House of Lords . Napoleon 's spirit , if it continues to take an interest in mundane politics and rete ; ns its former prejudices , must have rejoiced to see the British West Indies ruined by the sugar beet and the United Kingdom made dependent upon the continent for its sugar supply . In 1908 , German exported to England beet sugar to the value of more than $60 , - 000,000 . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and international agreements this had been cut down before the war by half , and now the United Kingdom refuses to buy any sugar from neutral nations unless assured that it is not " made in Germany . " Efforts are being made to utilize the waste land of the United Kingdom for the cultivation of sugar beets . It will , however , take time for the development of the industry in England , and for the present our sugar planters in Hawaii , Porto Rico and Cuba should find a good market in England , France and Russia . Germany and Austria-Hungary , anticipating a long war , soon shut off the exportation of sugar . This left them with a stock on hand sufficient to last two years , and in the meantime the fields formerly used for beets were put to growing cereals for the army . This and similar shifts will make these countries practically self-sustaining in the matter of food in spite of their large population and poor land . England , having stuck to her free-trade principle of buying and selling in the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now absolutely dependent on foreign commerce and would be starved out in a few months if she should lose command of the sea . One other instance of the achievement of economic independence thru applied science is the production of alcohol for manufacturing and fuel . We have been fighting the Standard Oil Company with legislation ; the Germans have been fighting it with potatoes , and these have proved the better weapons . Germany , like the United Kingdom , is destitute of petroleum , and she can not now import the gasoline necessary to keep her army automobiles running . But this possibility has been foreseen , and the Government has for several years required that the motor vehicles which might be taken over for military purposes in time of war should be provided with interchangeable carbureters so that either gasoline or alcohol could be used . A hundred million gallons of fuel alcohol were on hand when the war began and more is made from potatoes and sugar beets . In the United States one of the chief difficulties in the way of developing the chemical industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the denatured alcohol bill by Congress a few years ago has not done what was expected of it in the way of remedying this deficiency . Possibly we will find in the infra palm , which grows abundantly in the Philippines and Central America , a future source of the cheap alcohol necessary for many industries . We will naturally draw upon the tropics for fuel and food as the years go by . The increased importation of fruits such as pineapples and dates gives a hint of future conditions . The war has taught the world by the worst of object lessons that economic independence is not less important than political independence , in fact that the two go together . If for instance Germany thru her systematic agriculture and synthetic chemistry had not been largely selfsupporting she could not have endured for a year the cutting off of her commerce by enemies on every side . It will never happen again , we hope , that the existence of a nation will depend upon its self-sufficiency , but its prosperity will always depend upon it . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries for the necessities of life we must first develop our internal resources with the help of applied science and , second , make use of such tropical possessions as we now hold or can acquire . Then with this firm basis of self-support we can cultivate trade with other commercial countries by reciprocity and can compete with them on equal terms in the open markets of the world .
