INTO the Federal army ? the army that freed the slaves ? a little boy was sold . Many in both armies were younger in years , smaller and more frail of body than he ; his weakness was more pitiable than that of the youngest and smallest of them all , for his was of the mind . Cornelius Garvin at seventeen was a child in a man 's body ? a chaser of butterflies , a Barnaby Budge . ? And this boy was stolen that he might be sold into war for whatever price he would bring . " Traffickers in human blood , " his abductors were called by the mayor of Troy , in a letter to Governor Seymour , of New York . For although Cornelius Garvin 's mother was but a washerwoman who could neither read nor write , friendless save for neighbors as poor as herself , yet so fiercely determined was she in her search for her son that servants and doorkeepers , guards and secretaries were brushed aside while she forced her way into the presence of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To them she told her story ? such a story as , once heard , was never forgotten . Mayors and governors , major - generals and private soldiers , grand juries , secret - service agents , editors , foreign diplomats ? even Abraham Lincoln , the President of the United States ? worked and grieved and fretted and raged over the fate of this little Irish boy , a mother 's only child . In Troy , New York , in 1862 , the war ? as it did everywhere else ? bore down hard . The heaviest burden was upon the very poor ; the prices of the commonest necessaries of life became too dear for some to pay . Among those forced by hunger to walk that bitter road that lies " over the hills to the poorhouse " were Mrs. Catherine Garvin and Cornelius , her son . Besides the question of food , the widow was at her wit 's end to solve another problem ? that of longer keeping her boy " Con " at home . Martin Kane ? now a sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven or twelve ? remembers his old neighbors well . " The Garvins ? I ca n't mind the time when they did n't live next door to us in the other side of the double house in Reade 's Alley . Us boys ? my brothers and I and the other boys in the alley ? used to play with Con , and be in and out of Mis ' Garvin 's house , and playin ' in the back yard . and out by Richardson 's Pond all the time . Con , he was older and bigger and stronger than us ; maybe that 's why we liked to play with him . And he 'd do about anything any of us told him to . He did n't say much ? just laughed a lot at nothin ' at all ? and there was a look to his eyes like the look of windows in an empty house . I mind one night he smashed Jimmy O'Bry'n 's fiddle , and laughed ? just crushed it in his hands ; he did n't know there was any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his straw mattress out onto the doorstep and set fire to it , au. ' he laughed at that , too . I guess it was then that Mis ' Garvin gave up trying to keep him home . " And so the County House out in the hills opened its doors and took them in . Spring came , and Mrs. Garvin went back to see if the world outside the red brick walls would let her live in it again . It was ruled that once a month she might call at the County House and see her boy . One time she called and found that he was gone . After that Catherine Garvin 's life pivoted on one point and went round and round ; she never turned aside , never lost sight of that one objective point ? to find Con . Where she got her first clue no one knows , but suddenly she hurried down to New York City . When she came back she went straight to Captain John Arts , the Superintendent of County Poor , He did not know that Con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible interview . These two were old enemies , for she had been " troublesome " at the poorfarm ; but now , in her grief and anger , she was beside herself ? savage as some wild creature of the forest that had been deprived of its young . Captain Arts , in. a statement which he gave to the newspapers months afterward , wrote that Mrs. Garvin told him : " I was in New York looking for Con when I met three rowdies from South Troy . They asked me if I was looking for Con . I said I was . They said , " You need not look for him ; he has gone for a soldier . " ' " The statement goes on : " She said that these rowdies had sold him for $300 . Then she charged that Keeper Taber had sold Con as a substitute for himself or a friend . " Captain Arts , in his fragmentary account of Mrs. Garvin 's accusation , implies that , in one breath , she had . charged two separate perpetrators with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems reasonable to infer , was that the three men of South Troy had acted in collusion with Keeper Taber of the County House . Perhaps this was her suspicion only ; maybe the South Troy men had tried thus to shift the blame . After such an accusation it was open and endless war between Con 's mother and the Superintendent of the County Pnor . Catherine Garvin 's unexpected meeting with the three young thugs suggests a sorry picture ? that of the lonely little woman 's eager greeting to the familiar faces from home . Had they met her Connie ? See her as she awaits the answer ? the thin , worn body in the plain black dress , polished and green and rusty brown with time , the more rusty bonnet that perched far back on the knob of gray-streaked hair ; a little woman , who peers up into the hard faces and whose eyes anxiously follow every uneasy shift , every sidelong glance of the three . The crowds that had been so confusing but a moment ago are forgotten ; those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unfelt , unseen . She has eyes only for the three who had known Con back home . Then came their brutal answer : " You need n't look for him ; he has gone for a soldier ! " Perhaps she was stunned , bewildered for the moment , and let them walk away . More in character would be the guess that she screamed and tried to seize them , and that they brokeaway and lost themselves in the crowd , leaving behind them a helpless little woman crying something about her Con , who had been stolen to be made a soldier . Cornelius Garvin was not the first nor the only person to be sold into the army . Less than a month before his abduction the draft had been put into operation , and the riots to resist it had failed . Any man whose name had been drawn from the wheel might purchase exemption by the payment of three hundred dollars , but it was cheaper to hire ? or buy ? a substitute . At once a horde of depraved men became brokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business of immense profits of which the money paid to the brokers by drafted men for substitutes was the smallest part . Many of the Northern states , made desperate by ineffectual efforts to fill their quotas of recruits , began to offer greater and greater bounties to induce enlistments ; county , state , and national bounties totaled to a tempting sum ? in New York as high as $725 . It was this money that brought out the small-sized army of bounty-brokers . To their call rose the scum of the country . The idle , the dissolute , the criminal , flocked to the brokers , who enlisted them , shared with them the cash bounties , and then , by bribery ? stupendous in its extent ? corrupted guards and officials into permitting their recruits to escape and he enlisted again and again from other districts or from cities near by . Many were of course firmly caught and forced into the army , but of those who never saw a musket there were many more . Surgeons were bribed into accepting the aged , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forge papers on which bounty might be collected for recruits who had never existed . It was a gold-yielding Klondike . And this went on for months unchecked by the authorities , who seem to have been stupefied by the enormity of it all , or blinded to it by their own harassments . Worst of all , boys of fourteen and fifteen were drugged and enlisted , bounty-brokers and women of the streets swearing that they were the parents of these minors and that they gave the necessary consent ; foreigners unable to speak English suddenly found themselves in the army ? they knew not how ; old men were made drunk , their white hair and beards dyed , and themselves started for the battle-fields and camps . Yet such as these could come to their senses , communicate with friends , and eventually escape . But for poor , helpless Con Garvin there could come no such unclouding of the mind . Back in Troy his mother took up the search for him . She could not wait for the promised investigation by the Superintendent of County Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him and bring him home . Sergeant Kane. her old neighbor , remembers how she came night after night to his mother , and cried and moaned , or shrilly poured out a torrent of invective against those who had stolen her little boy ? that was the woman of her . In the daytime she did not weep ; she worked harder than most men have ever worked , washing clothes , cleaning offices ? anything that would bring money enough to enable her to look for her boy . In November she reported the ease to the War Department ; weeks passed , and there had been nothing done . Then , in some unrecorded manner , she discovered that Con had been enlisted into the Fifty-second Regiment , New York Volunteers . How she managed to make this discovery is one of the most remarkable . most inexplicable features of her story . With this information she went to Washington , straight to Abraham Lincoln . Perhaps then for the first time she knew real hope . No one in trouble had ever left the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friendly clasp of a great , strong hand . To him she poured out her story ? volubly , doubtless , probably with weeping and with calls to the Virgin and to all the saints to bless him and requite him . And the President , stooping under his own too great burden , bent a little lower that he might take upon his shoulders her burden , too . He gave her a pass , good throughout the army , and a letter to the Secretary of War in which he asked that she be given aid in the search for her son . Secretary Stanton wrote an order for the discharge of Cornelius Garvin , and Mrs. Garvin was sent to Colonel Lafayette C. Baker , Provost Marshal of the War Department . A detective was detailed to accompany her to the Army of the Potomac , then in the vicinity of Brandy Station . She went at once to the camp of the Fifty-second New York Regiment , but she could not find Con . No such person was there ? that was all : no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly comprehended the meaning of the words . Then , day after day , week after week , she searched the army , camp by camp , regiment by regiment , sent here , sent there ; now certain , as some pitying , over-sanguine informant directed her , that within the hour she would surely find him ; now utterly disheartened , all but hopeless , and exhausted by her search . There were no battles , but there was worse ? disease ; and there were days when she looked in terror into rows of dead faces beside trenches cut in the frozen ground , or in almost equal terror walked up and down , hour after hour , past rows of countless hospital cots , now starting forward at some fancied resemblance , now pausing to catch again some delirious cry which for the moment she had thought to have been Con 's . The weather was bitterly cold , yet there were heavy rains that froze as they fell . She obtained food and shelter where and when she could . Over and over again she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never grew old ? at camp-fires and in officers ' mess-tents , at headquarters and among the baggage trains , until the whole army must have buzzed with the story of Con Garvin . At last Catherine Garvin , worn out , disheartened , her money almost gone , gave up and went back to Troy , Her search had failed in the army , but she indomitably began over again from the other end . She went back to her washing and to the cleaning of offices , but when she could she told Con 's story , until slowly , little by little , she set a-turning the mills of the gods . That same month , January , the district attorney of Troy , John H. Colby ? to whom Mrs. Garvin had taken letters in which many prominent men , asserting that a great wrong had been committed , demanded that he investigate ? presented the ease to the grand jury . Almost at the same time a search , instituted by Major-General Hancock , was begun in the army by the War Department . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect that " on or about September 7th , 1863 , as your petitioner is informed , the keeper of the County House sold said Cornelius into the army for between $300 and $100 . " She told that she had made search for him , and had found that he had entered the Fifty-second Regiment , New York Volunteers , but had been " transferred " therefrom . Then , Your petitioner called at the County House and made inquiries . Was informed by wife of keeper that her son , the said Cornelius , was gone ; that you ' ( meaning your petitioner ) ' must not feel sorry for him , as he was no benefit to you . ' That said keeper drew from his pocket a wallet and said to your petitioner , This is the money that I got for him . Look at this ' ? holding it up to your petitioner . " Presumably this unsupported statement did not constitute sufficient evidence , for the grand jury refused to indict . The district attorney later wrote to Captain Arts : " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I do not know of any evidence or ground of suspicion tending in any manner whatever to implicate. you or Mr. Taber with his alleged abduction . " Thus , by the grand jury 's action , the names of Captain Arts and Keeper Taber , of the County House , were completely cleared . But the investigation did nothing toward finding Con . The search conducted in January by the War Department was much more satisfactory ? as far as it went . It was proved that- " Cornelius Garvin ? it is supposed under an assumed name ? did enlist in the United States service in the city of New York on or about the 8th day of September , 1863 ; was sent to Rikers Island , New York Harbor ; left Rikers Island about the middle of September , 1863 , in the steamer Daniel Webster ; arrived at Alexandria , Virginia ; thence was forwarded to Mitchells Station , Virginia , - where he joined the Fifty-second Regiment , New York Volunteers , on or about the 23d day of September , 1863 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncoutroverted , but beyond it all is a maze of conflicting testimony , contradictions , false certificates , and bewilderment . So much , however , had been proved that an official investigation was begun in March , 1864 , and the inquiry developed the feeble and profitless theory that one John Garvey , a substitute , aged nineteen ? rejected because of partial insanity and sent from Mitchells Station , September 24th , 1863 , to Camp Convalescent , Alexandria ? was none other than Cornelius Garvin ; because , " in the recollection of the late surgeon 's clerk , the personal appearance of this man conforms precisely ' to Garvin 's . " Very good ; but Camp Convalescent 's records contain no such name as John Garvey . Who John Garvey was , and what his fate may have been , seems never to have been further investigated , and so the discovery of his loss was of no aid toward the finding of the lost Cornelius Garvin , after all . Then the War Department went in for affidavits and statements of men who claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her own account made a collection , too . Brought together , these certificates are so many sticks that have but vigorously stirred an already muddied pool ? save in one particular : by their aid a sight , at one point , is to be had of the bottom , and at that point Iies Company I , of the Fifty-second . Six privates certified to Mrs. Garvin that " we have seen Cornelius Garvin , known him , and could identify him . And we hereby state to the best of our opinion that he is in the Fifty-second Regiment , New York Volunteers , at present " February 14 , 1864 . Whereupon cute Samuel White , evidently to discredit the signers of that statement , certified that these men had been transferred to another regiment in September , 1863 , and had left him and Cornelius Garvin with the Fifty-second ; but that ha , Samuel White , had not seen Garvin since leaving Mitchells Station . Concerning Samuel White 's testimony the War Department 's memorandum reads : " The certificate . . . is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forgery . The name Samuel White does not appear on the books or returns , . . ? but the name of Emanuel White is found there , and his signature . . . is so unlike the signature of the appended certificate as to entirely preclude the belief that both were written by the same person . " The vicious circle went round and round . But it seems evident that black work was somewhere being done to obstruct the search . On May 16th , 1864 , one Townsell Shapman , at " Queen Street Hostal , " Virginia , certified ; " I have seen Corneles Garvin in the 52nd N. Y. Vols. ten Days ago in Co . I , Captain George Dignan IDegenerl gave him a different name so that his mother could not get him wen she was at the Regt . Last Winter I being of the same Regt. in company FL " First Lieutenant Wm . J. Rechenstein , Company C , certified , in Washington , May 21st , 1864 : " I saw the son of Catherine Garvin at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Private Fredrick Rolf , in the U. S. A. General Hospital , Albany , March 14th , 1865 , certified that he was acquainted with Cornelius Garvin , of his own company and regiment ? I , Fifty-second ? and that he had seen him engaged with the enemy at Spottsylvania , Virginia , May 1Sth , 1864 ; had seen him struck in the head by a ball , carried to the rear , " and I believe the wound to have been mortal . " Thus two privates and an officer of the Fifty-second , widely separated from each other in time and locality when they made their statements , certified to having seen Cornelius Garvin in the Fifty-second Regiment between the 6th and the 18th of May , 1864 . But across the face of each certificate is the War Department 's memorandum : " This certificate is false " ; because , " The most reliable information shows that Cornelius Garvin disappeared from the Fifty-second Regiment , New York Volunteers , during the month of November . 1863 ; search was made for him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March . " Search was made and the case officially investigated : ergo , in January and March he could not have been there ! However , " the most reliable information " does seem reliable indeed ? no less than the affidavit of a fellow-townsman and fellow-soldier as well . Emerson E. Purdy swore that he had known Cornelius Garvin in Troy , had been with him on Rikers Island , and had been assigned with him to the Fifty-second Regiment , which they had joined at Mitchells Station , Virginia . Garvin , under an assumed name ( what it was the deponent does not know ) , had been assigned to Company I ; had remained for about three months ; and then , on the first march of the Mine Run campaign , November , 1863 , had fallen out , " and I have not seen him since . " Purdy and several men of the Fifty-second Regiment identified Cornelius Garvin 's photograph as that of a boy called by the nickname of " Watches " or " Watchless , " who , until he disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. But , " if this be true , " says the official report , " Cornelius Garvin was not enrolled in the company even under an assumed name , for the rolls of this and other companies have been carefully examined and the men present recognized , and the names of those absent from any cause whatever have been identified with parties other than the person known as ' Watches ' or Watehless ' or Garvin . " The War Department rests its case . With Mrs. Garvin , during the year and a half that the War Department searched and investigated , fate had dealt almost as unkindly as with her boy . The first blow fell in April , when Attorney A. A. Lee , employed by the United States government to conduct , in Troy , an investigation of the kidnapping charge , told the story of Con 's last day at the County House . " Stokes an inmate swears that on a Saturday in the latter part of August , Garvin and himself were picking up potatoes ; that Garvin obtained an old tree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cripple , could not pursue , but he gave the alarm . James Ellis pursued , but could not catch Garvin . . . . L. Owens , in charge of the department , said that it was a common thing for Garvin to run away and be brought back . . . . The evidence was addressed to the solution of but one question , to wit , Was Garvin enlisted into the United States service , and if so , by whom ? The evidence fails to establish either branch of the proposition . On the contrary , it tends strongly to refute the wicked charges . " Police-sergeant Kane , the Garvins ' onetime neighbor , was recently shown the old newspaper account of Attorney Lee 's investigation . He laughed . " Stokes ? Poor old Johnny Stokes : I mind him well , too . Crazier'n Con ever was . ITs boys met Johnny down by the pond one day . B-bo-boys ! ' he yells , ' I-1 jest 1-1-lost a t-thousand fish-h-h-hooks in that h-hole Well , if Johnny Stokes swore that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazes did Con want o ' a free to climb over a fence like that'n was at the County House ? Why , of course he ran away . Maybe he climbed through the hole in the pond where Johnny lost his thousand fish-hooks ! " Then , serious again : " But we always believed Con Garvin was kidnapped , and that 's what I 'll always believe . " Catherine Garvin believed that , too . She went to New York City that April of 1864 and enlisted dangerous aid ? the press . The city newspapers avidly caught up the story : " A mother in search of her deranged son . . stolen from a lunatic asylum " ; " The innumerable meshes of red tape . . . have hitherto defied her efforts to obtain redress and the restoration of her son " ; " Taken out by a heartless scoundrel of a keeper , brought to this city , and regularly sold as a subatitnte into the Fifty-second Regiment . " These articles , presently copied by the Troy papers , brought upon Catherine Garvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gersham Taber had , to their minds , been pilloried long enough ; it was time to turn and defend themselves . Captain Arts deemed it his duty to present the following statement . It began : " This woman 's real name is Daly " ? and her whole sorry story was soon told . Perhaps it is the just painting of her character , perhaps the pen was wielded by an over-angry man ; but the statement did much in Troy to discredit Catherine Garvin and her search . They , mother and son ? the statement said ? were very troublesome , exceedingly quarrelsome , especially the woman . Mrs. Garvin had been in the habit of going from the County House to Troy and neighboring cities with Con and begging money on pretense of procuring medical aid for him . ( Did Captain John Arts know that it was pretense ? Might there not still have been hope in this uneducated woman 's heart that , with proper care , her son could be made well ? ) An order prohibit-ing them from going to the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unruly and troublesome , until , in March , 1863 , she was dismissed ; she took her boy with her . In ten days they were back . Her face was bruised ; " Con did it , " she said . Neighbors had interfered , or he would have murdered her . So Con was taken back into the County House , and his mother went to lire in Troy . Once a month she might visit her son . She was to receive a dollar a week from the county . In August Captain Arts saw in the records of the police court that Catherine Garvin Daly ? married the preceding month ? had had her husband , a worthless ex-soldier , arrested for non-support . Sixty days for Daly . ( When released , he went back to the army and was not heard from again . ) In view of this second marriage , the county 's dollar-a-week charity to Mrs. Garvin ? she never called herself Mrs. Daly ? was withdrawn ; when its restoration was denied her , she grew abusive and Captain Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the statement , there followed the accusation that Con had been kidnapped . The statement ends : " I will only add that I believe this woman to be a very dangerous impostor , bent on begging money and hoarding it up , besides being of a wicked and evil disposition , as is shown by the manner in which she worked up her grudges against me , for refusing her further relief , into the basest fabrications , none of which have the least foundation in truth . " This was oil , not upon the troubled waters , but upon the flames , for Troy had long been the seat of a war over the Garvin case ? a war of rival newspapers . The Troy Daily Whig stoutly upheld its political party 's county officers ; the Daily Press as stoutly , and more bellicosely , supported Mrs. Garvin ? the kernel , caught between the upper and the nether millstones , which they furiously ground and ground . But she could not read . so perhaps it did not matter so much , after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the town , and sympathy became tinged with suspicion , so that little gifts of money , in excess of wages earned , were withheld . It even became harder for Catherine Garvin to obtain work , and she was able to go less and less often to Virginia to run down dues . Now and then there came to her , through the newspapers , wild thrills of hope , such as these : " Washington , April 29 . ? Telegram : ' Mayor Thorn , Troy , N. Y. Has the boy Con Garvin arrived in Troy yet ? ( Signed ) L. C. Baker , Colonel and Agent , War Department . ' From this it is inferred that the boy is on his way home . " " Con Garvin has turned up down in the Army of the Potomac . He is expected home to-day . " But " to-day " became yesterday , and still he did not come . The New York Daily News , on May 26 , 1864 , printed a strange story . It told that Cornelius Garvin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , and , in charge of an officer , had been sent to Washington on his way home , but " again disappeared , and there is apparently no trace of him . The boy 's mother . . . has laid the case before the British Minister , and he has written to Consul Archibald , in this city , who in turn has communicated with Mayor Thorn , of Troy . Strenuous efforts are being made to obtain the facts of the suspicious second abduction of the lad . " This second abduction seems to be but a figment from some space-writer 's brain , for there is no hint of such a thing in the records of the War Department . And Con did not come home . When Catherine Garvin could , she went to New York City , to Washington , to Virginia . Each journey was begun in the hope that this time she would be given her boy to bring back with her ; each journey ended in a home-coming more lonely than the last . The army was not in winter quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over miles of country . Camps had given place to bivouacs , skirmishes to battles ; the wards of the winter hospitals , with their sheltered cots , had changed to the terrible field hospitals ? barn floors and stifling tents and the bare , hard ground . The sufferers were no longer siek men ; they were men with wounds , each man a horror to himself and to all who must look on him . Catherine Garvin followed the army ; stood for hours by the roadside trying to glimpse each face as the troops in thousands marched past ; waited with the non-combatants until the rolling musketry should for the time be done ; joined the parties that by night searched the battle-fields and brought the wounded in . Over and over again went the old weary round ; over and over again told the story of her boy who had been sold for the price he would bring . Colonel Baker wrote of her : " The persistency of purpose , the undying hope and affection of the sorrowing mother for her simple Con , ' were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or write , she always carried in her apron a large number of letters and other memoranda from prominent officers and others , given to aid her search . Yet she could , as if by intuition or the inspiration of her love , place her hand upon any of the documents she desired to use and repeat their contents . And whenever she found interested listeners to her mournful story she would select the particular document she wanted and give its statements . After exhausting the subject , she would sit in a musing mood , gazing into vacancy for several moments , and then roused from her reverie , gather up her treasure of manuscripts , and exclaiming , My poor Con ! I must go and find him ! ' she would start again on her journey among the regiments of the Union army . " Through it all it was this same Colonel Baker who remained her most stanch friend , her too impetuous , too partisan ally . It was Colonel Baker who hotly charged that Captain Degencr , Company I of the Fifty-second , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assumed name , but , instead of prosecuting the search as directed by his commanding officer , had attempted to intimidate by threats of punishment those privates of his company who were disposed to assist Mrs. Garvin and others engaged in the search . Colonel Baker did more than make impotent accusations . Upon the arrival of the Fifty-second in Washington , he placed Captain Degener under arrest " to await a further development of facts , " and vowed that in prosecuting his investigation of Con 's abduction he would spare neither time nor means in order to " bring to speedy justice all those engaged in this inhuman and diabolical outrage . " Colonel Baker 's sympathy and indignation seem rather to have got the best of his good judgment , , for the Department of Military Justice promptly reported to the Secretary of War that Colonel Baker admitted that his charges rested entirely upon information received from Mrs. Garvin , and it appeared to be a foregone conclusion of " this unfortunate woman " that Captain Degener was in some way concerned in the abduction and concealment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered proof of the fact . " Her excitement on the subject of Captain Degener 's supposed complicity in the matter is so intense as to amount almost to insanity , and tends to impair the force of her unsupported statements . . . . It is therefore recommended . that Captain Degener be discharged without delay . " And it was hot-headed Colonel Baker who wrote , June 3 , 1865 , to the Mayor of Troy , that while the testimony elicited by one of his detectives in May , 1864 , did not " directly implicate " the Superintendent of County Poor , yet enough had been shown to satisfy him that the boy could not have escaped without the direct knowledge and connivance of the superintendent . But the grand jury long before had declared Captain Arts and Keeper Taber to be immaculate of blame , and it is but fair to say here that every indication points to the innocence of these men . Captain John Arts , a soldier , honorably retired because of his wounds , is well remembered and highly spoken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt as to the blamelessness of Captain Arts , so is there no doubt as to the kidnapping and selling of Con , even though the charge was never conclusively proved and the abductors were never found . It is almost a certainty that Con did leave the County House as " Johnny " Stokes described ; perhaps he was enticed ; probably , after he had run away to follow some whim of his blighted mind , he was picked up ? stolen ? by brokers or their agents on the lookout for substitutes . Sold by some one he certainly was , and that some onebought , by bribes , the officials who passed him into the army . Cornelius Garvin , unaided , never could have passed an honest , competent examination . " I can not conceive how it would be possible for said Garvin to pass any examining surgeon or mustering officer , " wrote Dr. C. L. Hubbell , surgeon for the Enrolling Board , Fifteenth District , New York , " inasmuch as he always appeared to mo to be nearly , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw him into conversation when he was an inmate of the County House , and never elicited anything more than a simple laugh peculiar to the worst form of lunacy . " But on September 7 , 1863 , be was enlisted into the Federal army , joined his regiment at Mitchells Station , Virginia ? and disappeared . Perhaps , and perhaps , and perhaps ? nothing but conjectures and speculations . To the many let there be added two more ? conjectures that are here made for the first time : Perhaps Con Garvin wandered out between the pickets and into the Confederate army , and fought there under the other American flag , and fell , and now lies among the gray at the south side of some blood-stained field . Or perhaps the war ended and found him still in the gray ranks , which , disbanding , left him , a chaser of butterflies , to wander farther and farther south , Perhaps he wanders there to-day , old now , bent and shaken ; an old man who " laughs loudly at nothing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes like the look of windows in an empty house . " After the war Mrs. Garvin went back to Troy . Policeman Kane pityingly tells how she still sought her boy ? here , there , wherever rumor placed him ? for twenty years . " All of a sudden , " says Policeman Kane , " she went hack to Ireland . Maybe she had been told Con was there . We heard after a while that she was dead . . . . Con ? Nobody 'll ever know ? except that she never found him . "
