txt Dr. Alexis Carrel of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , who received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1912 , is the first to announce a great scientific discovery in 1913 . In the current issue of The Journal of Experimental Medicine , the official organ of the Rockefeller Institute , dated Jan. 1 , he predicts , as the result of a series of experiments which have been in progress since 190T , the possibility of healing a cutaneous wound in less than a day and the repair of a broken leg in four days . It is declared on the highest authority that this is perhaps the most important of the young scientist 's many wonderful surgical and biological discoveries , as well as the culmination of his laboratory work . Although Dr. Carrel does not mention it in his preliminary report , the assertion is also made that the reparative process may become applicable not only in cases where the tissues have been divided , as in knife wounds , but in cases where large areas of tissue have been destroyed in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest discovery is the result of speculation as to the manner in which ' cells multiply and thus effect the growth of tissue . If it were possible , he argued , to become possessed of this knowledge , it ought to be possible , also . to promote this proliferation of cells and the consequent growth of connective tissue by artificial means . His important discovery is almost concealed beneath this innocuous caption : " Artificial Activation of the Growth in Vitro of Connective Tissue . " Aided by knowledge of the fact that growth of the body is dependent in many respects on the more or less mysterious activities of some of the ductless glands ? the thyroid , for instance  --  he applied a mixture of thyroid extract and macerated portions of other organs of the body to cutaneous wounds . The results were wonderful , almost miraculous . They bear out the scientist 's statement that " if the rate of the reparation of tissues ivere activated ten times only , a cutaneous wound would heal in less than twenty-four hours , and a fracture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After attempting experiments on live animals , he found that the laboratory work could be carried on much more effectively . and it could be observed more carefully , by using tissues which had been removed from animals and kept alive in suitable media in glass jars . , This was done , and the specimens were treated with pulp of various strengths made from extract of the thyroid gland and macerated sections of the spleen , liver , heart , muscle , kidney , blood corpuscles , &c.; Some of the specimens were treated with the thyroid extract alone , and others with various combinations of the extracts or r ulp of the organs mentioned . Some specimens of connective tissue were kept in a solution of blood plasma alone , and these were known as " controls . " They were simply used as standards of comparison to show the difference in growth between them and the specimens which were kept in the different extracts which , it was hoped , would promote notable reparative action . The results exceeded Dr. Carrel 's expectations in most cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the combinations of extracts , it was found that the increase in growth was thirty times greater in twenty-four hours than in one of the " control " specimens . The most active extract was found to be that prepared from embryonal tissue . This increased the growth forty times more than that of a " control " specimen of tissue preserved in a solution of normal plasma in the same length of time . In other words , if this ' were the practical application of Dr. Carrel 's discovery to a wound that would heal normally in forty days , it would really heal in one day under the application of the proper extracts . The different extracts used in the experiments showed healing powers ranging from three to forty times greater than normal plasma . Here is what Dr. Carrel says in regard to his reasons for beginning these experi-ments : " If the factors that bring about the multiplication of cells and the growth of tissues were discovered , It would perhaps become possible to activate artificially the process of repair . Then aseptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the rate of the reparation of tissues were activated ten times only , a cutaneous wound would heal in less than twenty-four hours , and a fracture of the leg would be cured in four or five days . " It is permissible to think that this hypothesis is not unreasonable . Jacques Loeb , in his fundamental experiments on artificial parthenogenesis , ( non-sexual reproduction , ) has demonstrated that cell division can be induced by slight changes in the composition of the sea water in which the sea urchin 's eggs are placed . " It might even he supposed that certain modifications of the milieu intSrieur ( interior medium ) - of the tissues of mammals would bring about the multiplication of their cells . " In 1907 and 1908 I began , therefore , to study the processes of reparation of small cutaneous wounds and the action of a great many substances on the rate of their cicatrization . It was found that the proliferation of epithelium and of connective tissue was activated under certain conditions by dressings made with the pulp of tissues and organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutaneous wounds of the dog brought about the formation of exuberant granulations .

The external coat of an artery preserved  --  in cold storage in a mixture of thyroid gland and Locke 's solution , and transplanted afterward into a dog 's carotid. ( artery , ) underwent an enormous hypertrophy ( growth . ) " Dr. Carrel then gives the scientific details of his experiments in 1911 and 1912 , after be had found a way to cultivate living tissues outside the bodies from which they were taken .
