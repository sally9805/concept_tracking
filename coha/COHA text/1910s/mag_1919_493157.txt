December 3r , 1919 THE NEW third places we thought he did . However , he lived the fourth place . But it was n't quite accurate to say his sister married the law partner of the man Who enforces the dry law . She married the cousin of the Superintendent of City Streets . But this man had , at any rate , been a politician high in the councils of Tammany . Unfortunately , however , it was in the days when Richard Croker was a young man . And on the present occasion he was in bed With tonsilitis . But the travelling salesman did n't let that news discourage us . We tried a second politician close to the seat of power . We tried other politicians . Before our search ended we had also tried two hotels , an Assyrian restaurant , a converted stable , a deputy coroner 's office , and a roadhouse in whose c ? tIrtyard the travelling salesman assured us he had Played as a boy of seven . We had twice left our Coach , and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots , to arrive , once , at a deserted warehouse ? the second time on the threshold of a Salvation Army mission . And , we had come , finally , 1 ? The Red Grasshopper . It was a spot the travelmIg salesman had forgotten about entirely . We should never have had any of this bother , he said , if only he 'd thought about it in the first place . Here , in the Red Grasshopper , our long trail ended . It was time it ended . We had exhausted al , 1 but a little of the three hours at our disposal . The debt to our driver had reached proportions of which we had no knowledge . The driver himself . W45 in bad temper . The thin man with the parcels , rebellious . But even as we entered , The Red Grass- a ? PPer promised hospitality . People were laughing a , : , 11:1 dancing . There was a fire on the open hearth .

REPUBLIC I 4 I News from the Sick Room B EWILDERED observers of current natural phenomena in a disordered and confused world had begun to think that the peak of topsyturviness had been reached when the so long despised Mexican dollar came to be worth in the open market $1.05 in United States gold currency , and at the same time the British gold sovereign , so long the world 's standard of coin values , declined to $3.70 . Before the puzzled analysts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were snatched to a new high level of bewildderment by the public appearance of the Honorable Albert Bacon Fall , a Senator from New Mexico , on the steps of the White House , certifying to President Wilson 's mental competency . Nothing queerer ever happened in Washington . And the queerest part of it all is that it was taken quite as a matter of course . Nothing has so vividly shown the state of mind into which Washington has fallen . Mr. Fall 's disclosure was treated as a matter of large public import . After his pronouncement for the benefit of the press , at the White House , he was swiftly translated to the Republican cloak room in the Senate wing of the Capitol and there subjected to a critical cross examination by the lawyers and doctors of the.Senate . They took turns at him . It was an amazing performance . " How long were you in his bedroom ? Was anybody else there ? Did she say anything ? In what position did you find the President ; lying down or sitting up or propped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands with you ? Which hand did he use ? Did you see his other hand , or did he try to use it ? Did you see him move his body or his legs ? How did he look ? How long did he talk and how long did you talk ? Was his voice clear and his utterance unimpeded ? How do you mean , husky ; do you mean his voice was hoarse , or that it was thick ? " ( much detail on this point ) and so on and so on and so on , until all the bones had been picked clean . In point of fact , not the least illuminating aspect of Mr. Fall 's revelations was his disclosure of how vaguely he had seen what he had seen . It took him some time to remember whether the President had offered his left hand or his right hand to be shaken . There were minor discrepancies between Mr. Hitchcock 's report and Mr. Fall 's report . The whole amazing , incredible episode has a value and an interest as disclosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which their decision are taken for our guidance and direction . " You are old , Father William , " the young man said , " Your hair has become very white ; And yet you incessantly stand on your head ? Do you think , at your age , it 's quite right ? " " In my youth , " Father William replied to his son , " I feared it might injure the brain ; But now that I 'm perfectly sure I have none , Why , I do it again and again . " Long ago Washington was dubbed the City of Conversation . It talks about itself . It loves gossip . The present condition and situation provide rich pasturage . The motive power of the great creaking unwieldy government machine has temporarily broken down and the engine of government grinds slowly along under its own momentum . There is wholly lacking any sense of headship or direction . The departments carry on a minimum of necessary routine at such a pace that movement is barely discernible . Congress is no better posture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . The Senate virtually as a body is a candidate for President . It had to adjourn for lack of a quorum the other day while the Republican National Committee was in session here . The Senators are divided on the League of Nations and the Treaty . Fifteen of them wo n't have it at any price or in any form . Eighty Senators are willing to ratify the League and Treaty with and without reservations . The vote rejecting the League was based on politics . The final vote was taken while each side hoped the other would give in . There is hardly a man in the Senate who is really vitally interested in the League because they all believe that the great bulk of the people at home do not care at all whether it lives or dies . All of the news that comes to Washington from the country is that the League has been entirely supplanted in the public mind and popular interest by the pressing and immediate industrial and domestic problems of everyday living . That is one reason why the " bitter-enders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of the League and Treaty into the campaign . They feel it will be perfectly safe to flog a dead horse all about over the country next summer and autumn . The House has not an idea to bless itself with . This condition it candidly avows . It is under the present leadership of a group of old-timers who were deposed from power ten years ago by their own party associates as even at that time too reactionary and dwellers in the political Dark Ages . The Honorable Joseph W. Fordney , chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , went back home // to Michigan during the recent Congressional recess and the reporters at Saginaw came to meet him . As the report of this interview was telegraphed to the eastern papers , he said in substance and effect : " Things were never in better shape for us . We can look forward confidently . The Republican party has a number of candidates for President to choose from . There is a choice between those two eminent statesmen , the Honorable Warren G. Harding , of Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think Senator Watson is the greatest orator in the world . " Mr. Fordney does not believe in feeding the folks back home on raw meat . No man or group of men here is thinking effectively or constructively about reconstruction problems . To find a path out of the present woods of our confusion we must look elsewhere than to Washington as it is at this juncture . A general paralysis has come upon it since Mr. Wilson fell ill . He had made himself so completely the center of authority in the seven years of his PresideneY that when he became disabled bewilderment and confusion followed . Since 1912 the mainspring 0f national government has been under Mr. Wilsons hat . He was the Government . He decided . He indicated the direction . The other executive ago ' cies of government carried out his decisions . He went to Paris and carried the headship of affairs there . He came home and went to bed and the seat and center of executive authority became his bedfellow on his couch of illness . before a Senate Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State , has testified President Wilson since September . Dispatches were printed in the newspapers on Capitol author . ity that Mr. Lansing and Mr. Fletcher , the am ' bassador to Mexico , had seen and approved Sell ' ator Fall 's resolution which provided for breaking off diplomatic relations with Mexico and that t d the resolution was being put through the Senate with State Department sanction . President Wilson dined to approve Mr. Fall 's resolution and r ? id the Senate through Mr. Fall and Mr. Hitchcne ' that he hoped it would not pass . Then Mr. Lana ing denied that he or the State Department ha been privy to Senator Fall 's proposal or had favor ' ed its adoption . Mr. Garfield , the fuel administrator , resigns and is called before a Senate Committee to tell t.n Why He declines to give the committee a copy ? f letter of resignation , but does say : " I believe represent the real opinion of the President , in dile , matter , that is , if I were able to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There Mr. Ggr ' December 31 , 1919 THE NEW field touched the heart and core of the present situation . If Mr. Wilson could only be seen and consulted much might be done . That yearning has been the undertone of Washington for seven years ; simply , it has become clamorous now . Mr. Wilson issues a statement from the White House to say that the hope of Republican leaders of the Senate that he would presently make some move which will relieve the situation with regard to the Treaty is entirely without foundation ; that he has no compromise or concession in mind . Immediately certain Senators publicly through the medium of the press , question whether the statement was really written by the President , " or by some Cheap politician assuming to speak the President 's mind . " Others cast doubt upon the validity of the White House utterance by prefacing their comments with the phrase , " if the President is correctly quoted ? " This is done to bewilder and confuse the Public mind further and make the course of orderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gladstone , a politician himself and much ex-Posed through his long life to other politicians , dedaredtoward the end of his career : " I always u ? 14 that politicians are the men whom , as a rule , it I 'S most difficult to comprehend . For my own Part I never have thus understood , or thought I understood , above one or two . " th , 13ut do not despair of the Republic . The only ag one can be sure about in a crisis or situation ? r l tondition at Washington is that it is not unpre-cedented ; it has happened before . Washington can not be seen intelligently or to any effect without z background . It produces crises and , periods of welter and confusion in such regularly recurring c 0Yeles as to be almost susceptible to the formulation f a law of natural phenomena . Certainly the sons and descendants of Jeremiah have rended their gar-m ents , beat their breasts , and made loud lamenta-tlil before the Capitol and the White House after wieth of our war periods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lerment as they sit now , saying to one another , W ' Y as there ever such an extraordinary situation ? as there ever such another mess as we find our- t es in now ? Was there ever such another set oot'l d ? Its , knaves and incompetents in command of is i r destinies ? " The answer is : There was . This th uot the first time that the wind has moaned rough the rigging . For proof : : 4t Washington , in 1869-70 , every intelligent about the Government prepared to go . The pearl he ? P le would have liked to go , too , for they stood i r4Pless before the chaos ; some laughed and some the ell ; all were disgusted ; but they had to content einselves by turning their backs and going to work harder than ever on their railroads and foundries . They were strong enough to carry even their politics . Only the helpless remained in Washington . " " Dissolution of ties in every direction marked the dissolution of temper , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed ridicule . Senators quarreled with each other , and no one objected , but they picked quarrels also with the Executive , and threw every Department into confusion . " " The political dilemma was as clear in 1870 as it was likely to be in 1970 . The system of 1789 had broken down and with it the eighteenth centry fabric of a priori or moral principles . Politicians had tacitly given it up . Grant 's administration marked the avowal . Nine-tenths of men 's political energies must henceforth be wasted on expedients to piece out ? to patch ? or , in vulgar language , to tinker ? the political machine as often as it broke down . Such a system , or want of system , might last centuries , if tempered by an occasional revolution or civil war ; but as a machine , it was , or soon would be , the poorest in the world ? the clumsiest ? the most inefficient . " " One might search the whole list of Congress , judiciary , and Executive during the twenty-five years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The period was poor in purpose and barren in results . . . no public administrator achieved enough good reputation to preserve his memory for twenty years . A number of them achieved bad reputations , or damaged good ones that had been gained in the Civil War . On the whole , even for Senators , diplomats , and Cabinet officers , the period was wearisome and stale . " And much more to the same effect , from that keenest of commentators , Mr. Henry Adams , who lived in Washington for fifty years in the vain pursuit of an education . What Washington is this winter , it has been , and fearfully will be again . It is always saved and rescued from the morasses into which it falls by the common sense of the people at home . Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country .
