Formerly of the Peabody Muse= of American Ethnology . Harvard University , and the Ethnologist of the recent Anglo-American Polar Expedition IN the last days of January the sun came hack to my Eskimos and me , after an absence of about eleven weeks . The period of darkness had not been at all tedious ; neither the natives nor I had felt the depression that the want of sunlight is supposed to bring . Nevertheless we were all glad to see the red disk showing a third of its surface at noon over the hills to the south . I climbed the highest knoll within reach , with the result that I saw two-thirds of the new sun . By the first week in February I felt myself growing a little restless ; two months of fresh air and stale fish had accumulated more surplus energy than could he gotten rid of in the rather tame occupation of fishing through a hole in the ice , or in taking short runs ahead of the dog teams to visit our neighbors twenty or forty miles away . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days ' trip inland to where the only other white VOL . CXX ? No 717. - 57man in the country , Mr. Harrison , the English geographer , was living with his hired native families . At his kind invitation I might have stayed there a considerable while had not food been running rather low with him . He had flour , tea , coffee , sugar , and some other civilized edibles , but his stock was running so low that it evidently could not last till spring . Though his pancakes tasted good , I never feasted on one without seeing in my mind 's eye the little store of twenty-five-dollar sacks of flour growing smaller at my every bite . It was with almost as good an appetite and a much better conscience that I returned to the raw fish diet of Tuktu , yaktok . About this time a travelling Eskimo gave me half a pound of salt to eat with my fish , but I found I had quite gotten over the salt-eating habit so far as raw or cooked fish was concerned . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than does the carnivorous dog . deleted material open before the Indians reached the door , the latter frequently took to flight , or at least the Eskimos thus got a chance for their lives . For this reason it was always the custom that everybody should run out of the house whenever a dog barked . Even now , although it is some eighteen years since the last bloodshed took place ( and since the Hudson 's Boy Company purchased peace between the peoples by blankets and copper kettles given the Indian relatives of those then recently killed in battle with the Eskimos ) , the custom is maintained . The practice seems to be more a habit , a matter of good form , than any indication of present distrust of the Indians , for the two groups are now on excellent terms . The fourth day at Kangianik dawned clear , and we started on our uneventful way , to reach Herschel Island in seventeen days . Unfortunately for narrative purposes , an Eskimo knows so well bow to travel safely and comfortably under the worst conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may freeze , but all there is to do is to pull your hand out of the warm mitten , rub whatever portion of your face happens to be getting stiff , and put the hand back in the mitten again before the fingers have had time to freeze ? for freezing a finger is serious , though a frost-bitten nose is little worse than a sunburnt one . One gets pretty thirsty , but this can he alleviated by the eating of a little snow ? or that has been my own experience , though many travellers consider the practice unsafe . At night the snow-house is dry , warm , and comfortable , and too substantial to be blown away by the wind , as tents sometimes are . Nothing happens except that a few miles of trail are left behind each day . A competently managed journey is as uninteresting as the history of a country at peace with its neighbors ; and of all travellers in the world none adapts means to an end better than the Eskimo . We reached Herschel Island toward the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with nothing to tell of the trip except the number of days it had taken . At the island there was , sure enough , news of the Duchess of Bedford . In November , while I was still at Shingle Point , a sled had arrived at the policestation from the expedition , which was wintering at Flaxman Island , about two hundred miles to the westward . It was known at Herschel that I was then only sixty miles ( or three days ' journey ) away , but Mr. Leitingwell , Mr. Storkerson , and their team of dogs were so worn out by the trip down from Flaxman that they did not make the attempt to reach me ? especially as Eskimo report reached them that I was well off and likely to continue so . They had spent Thanksgiving with Captain Leavitt aboard his ship Narwhal , which was the only whaler wintering at Herschel ( or anywhere in the western Arctic ) , and had then gone back to Flaxman Island , merely leaving word for me as to the whereabouts of the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed to me an interesting thing to make a trip to her and back ; besides , I was out of writing materials and photographic supplies . Although the whaler was short of provisions and the police had little to spare , both Captain Leavitt and Sergeant Fitzgerald assisted me in securing dogs and supplies for the trip . This was the first journey of the winter on which I used white men 's food . The travelling conditions were so much better than they had been in the fall that the trip which had taken Mr. Lefiingwel/ thirty-five days we made in nine . My fellow traveller this time was an immigrant from Bering Strait , and proved a good companion . He was the first Christianized native I travelled with . He used to say his prayers before going to bed and at meal-times . In this he differed markedly from most of the Eskimos . as he did also in being a thief and a liar . But he was energetic , resourceful , and good-tempered , and those are the things that matter on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanders of the expedition , Captain Mikkelsen and Mr. Leffingwell , off on an ice-exploring trip to the northward , and with them the ship 's mate , Mr. Storkerson . The Duchess cf Bedford had been crushed by the ice the previous Mareh ( this was April ) , and the crew were living on shore under the command of the expedition 's surgeon , Dr. Howe . That the ship was lost immediately changed my plans for the remainder of the year , for it was now impossible to proceed to the eastward in the summer , as had been planned . I therefore determined to devote the rest of my time in the north to investigating ethnological and archaeological conditions on the north coast of Alaska . I therefore made a hasty trip to Herschel Island to return my borrowed sled and dogs . The ship 's quartermaster , Mr. William Hickey , made this trip with me , and we accomplished it in a trifle less than a month , getting back on the 17th of May , or two days before the return of the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been told , it is not necessary to give much space to the period from my joining it in May till I separated from it again in July . The chief activity in the mean time was the excavating on Flaxman Island of a number of ancient . ruins and the recovery from them of various specimens of more or less scientific value . The first week of July I accompanied a party under Captain Mikkelsen 's command to the mouth of the Colville River , at which point I separated from them for the purpose of a scientific exploration of the Jones and other islands near Beecher Point . The expedition at this time had no other work on hand , so Captain Mikkelsen detailed two of the sailors , William Hickey and Max Fiedler , to assist me . We had an Eskimo skin-boat ( umiak ) , owned and commanded by our Flaxman Island friend Sakhawanna , so there were altogether four of us to voyage along the string of coast islands in search of ruins , relics , and dead men 's bones ? for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest stay was on that one of the Jones Islands known to the natives as Pingok , or the Island of Little Hills . Here we found ruins of unknown age left by people who built their houses largely with the bones of whales to take the place of timbers . The present Eskimos tell that before the time when their grandfathers were boys ( and that is as for as Eskimo chronology ever goes ) this island was already deserted , though their grandfathers had the tradition that there once lived here a people who hunted exclusively the monstrous bow-head whale , and who were men of prowess and remarkable sea manshi p . In a measure o u r excavations confirmed this tradition , as does even a walk along the beach , which may be said to be strewn with the bones of the bow-head whale . Of course many a student of folklore will say that it is not unlikely that the story of ancient whale-bunters may have been deduced from the presence of the bones , and that they rather explain the origin than prove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery made on the north coast of Alaska has a relation to the present methods of personal decoration now used by the natives of Alaska , the most significant feature of which is the wearing of lip-buttons , or labrets , by the men . The present custom is that when a boy is fourteen or sixteen years of age holes are pierced in his lower lip , one below each corner of the mouth . A small wooden plug is at first inserted to keep the hole from growing together , and month by month a bigger and bigger plug is used , till finally the openings are half an inch in diameter . At this point the young man begins to wear stone or ivory plugs . These ornaments are put in from the inside ordinarily as one might insert a button into a shirt front . Usually the two buttons worn are each of a different sort , while sometimes only one of the holes is filled , and in summer men are occasionally met with who wear no buttons at all . When a visitor is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one does not feel dressed without them . In preparing for sleep they are usually removed . It seems probable to ethnologists that this custom of wearing labrets is borrowed by the Eskimo from the Indians of southern Alaska . But these Indians wear one labret only , and that in the centre of the lower lip , while the Eskimos as far east as Cape Bathurst wear two uniformly , and east of the Coppermine River the practice of piercing the lips is unknown . Murdock , however , in 1882 found some traditions at Point Barrow that pointed to the wearing long ago by the Eskimos of labrets of the single Indian type , and he also secured three specimens that looked as if they were centre-lip labrets . In one of our excavations some two hundred and fifty miles east of Point Barrow we found five centre labrets , thus showing that they were probably worn in former days along the north coast , and showing further that among the Eskimos , as elsewhere , fashions change in dress and ornament . It had been my intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain there till the first whaling-ships should pass eastbound for the Beaufort Sea fishing-grounds . Unfortunately for our work among the islands , but fortunately for the whalers , ice conditions to the west of us at Point Barrow were that summer the best in years , and the Belvedere , first of the Arctic fleet , hove in sight at three o'clock in the morning on July 26th , two weeks before we had expected her . Greatly to the delight of the sailors and our Eskimo friend , we succeeded in paddling our boat far enough seaward to be seen and picked up . We received a warm welcome on hoard from Captain Cottle , his wife , and his officers , whom I had met the previous summer at Herschel Island . By noon we reached Flaxman Island , and sent Max Fiedler and Sakhawanna ashore , while Mr. Hickey and I proceeded to Herschel to continue our archeological work at that point , intending to remain there till fall and then take passage for San Francisco by one of the outbound whalers . We had been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing news reached us from Macpherson lip the Mackenzie . Major Arthur Jarvis , the new commander of the Mounted Police in the north , arrived from there August 4th , bringing the report that a definite statement had been sent up the Mackenzie by the Hudson 's Bay Company 's mail steamer to the effect that Captain Mikkelsen , Mr. Leffingwell , and Mr. Storkerson were all dead ? lost on the ice-exploring expedition . The story had been told in great detail and was given on my authority , who was supposed to have reported the tragedy on my visit to IIerschel in April . Almost simultaneously with Major Jarvis , Captain Mikkelsen arrived on a whaler he had boarded at Flaxman Island . The news of his own and his comrades ' supposed death disturbed him greatly , for unless special efforts were made to overtake and contradict these reports that were now on their way up the Mackenzie , the relatives and friends of all three concerned would believe them dead , till the whalers should reach port in November . On account of my being somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as to the practicability of forestalling these up - river despatches . As they had been sent from Macpherson July 24th and were already half-way to their destinatien at Athabasca Landing , Alberta , the first week in September , there was evidently but one hope ? that of crossing the coast ranges of the Rockies and descending the Bell and Porcupine rivers to the telegraph offices and settlements on the Yukon . This I volunteered to do , partly because Captain Mikkelsen was very anxious that the safety of his party should become known , and partly because the trip looked in perspective difficult enough to he interesting . Twelve hours from the final reaching of this decision , Captain Porter 's engines were whistling us their farewell salute as we sailed our little whale-boat from the harbor , bound for the mouth of the Mackenzie sixty miles away . On the way east nothing happened beyond the sudden springing up of a gale that made our boat dangerous in the incapable hands of its Indian steersman ? for I was taking passage hack to Fort Macpherson in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was manned by Indians , who are ( the best of them ) poor sailors as compared with the Eskimos , When once the river mouth was attained we had favoring northerly winds , and reached Macpherson in six days , thus establishing , by travelling day and night , a new record for either summer or winter travel between Herschel and Macpherson , an estimated distance of 260 miles . At Macpherson guides had to be hired and supplies bought for the hundred-mile portage to the Bell River . The police stationed at the fort , Mr. Firth of the Hudson 's Bay Company , and ( especially ) Mr. Harvey for Hyslop &; Nagle , all did their utmost to see that I was well provided . But this was a time when no Indians were at the fort , and , although one of them was sick , I had to take with me two of the Indians with whom I had come in the boat from Herschel . Carrying seventy pounds each and with two dogs carrying forty-pound packs , we set off . The sick Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that for the first three days both Joseph and I carried more than our seventy pounds . A great deal of reading may fail to impress the stay-at-home with the fact that the arctic summer is a much worse season for travel than the arctic winter , but a very little actual experience puts the matter beyond debate . The good three weeks that now separated me frntn Rampart House on the Porcupine were the least like fun of any trip I have so far undertaken . To begin with , the journey was to be so long that we could carry no tent , nor anything much but food and the axe and rope for constructing a raft on the Bell . Crossing the mountains it rained every day and every night ? except one night , when it snowed . I had an oilskin coat that had been waterproof the year before ; the Indians , with their sore chests and racking cough , had not even a make-believe waterproof . But one thing we did have was our mosquito-nets . Under these we slept soaking wet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzing fog of mosquitoes that hung over us as thick as the drizzling rain . It . took a hit over five days to reach stony by its roar is , on the whole , a trying experience . Of course the Hudson 's Bay men had told me there sore no " impossible " rapids in the Porcupine " if one used ordinary care . " But was this using ordinary care ? drifting in the dark into what might as easily be the unsafe as the safe side of a ! possible " rapid I believe I did the thinking outlined in the above paragraph ? at least I might have done so if I had had the time . As it was , I was no inure than fully awake when I was in the swirl . I threw myself flat on my little heap of mail and other belongings on the centre of the raft , to protect them from loss in case the raft held out . Then there followed a series of bumps upon what were apparently rounded boulders . A moment later the raft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stuck also with its back end ; then it began to rise on edge as if to tip over . When , however . I threw myself and my armful of mail parcels and food upon the rising side of the raft it paused in its tilt as if thinking what to do . At that moment the front endof the raft loosened again and swung down stream ; then the rear end was freed also , and the raft floated into quiet water . The " adventure " was over , and I worked the raft landward to sleep the rest of the night on shore . This experience netted me a little river wisdom , and made me temper my impatience to drifting eighteen instead of twenty-four hours per day . Those eighteen-hour days were even longer than the watch indicated . The occasional sight of such animals along the river bank as deer , moose , and wolves was rather diverting if they appeared in one of the odd half-hours of sunlight ; but I found it hard to be interested in anything when shivering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could not have afforded time for hunting if I had , though I might have shot with ease a moose that first watched me from tho bank and then swam to within a few feet of my raft to investigate me . This happened , too , at a time when my food was getting rather low . The following day , however ( my sixth day on the river ) , I came to the first signs of human habitations ? a cache of dry moose-meat on a platform of poles at the mouth of a little river . I took a few pounds of meat and left in payment a silk handkerchief . The days following the finding of the moose-meat caches I watched sharply and rather eagerly for people or the traces of them along the banks . Every curve that brought a new reach of the river into view held the promise of cabin or vamp . Several times , near dawn or dusk especially , the fog films on the hillsides simulated the wreaths of smoke from wigwam fires and were sources of cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening of August 28th , a group of huts appeared on the right bank , and I paddled the raft ashore . But the village was deserted , its inhabitants off somewhere hunting or fishing . All the houses were locked except one that was building and had as yet no roof ; in that I took up my lodging nevertheless . The next morning I made a great fire ? not to cook , but to sit beside while I ate my breakfast of dried moose-meat . The building of a fire proved a fortunate thing for me , for it brought the most welcome sight of my travelling experience ? an Indian running along the beach to catch me just as I was pushing my raft from shore . He was from a fishing-village of tents half a mile away and so situated that I should probably have missed it had they not seen my smoke and sent this messenger . When I got to the village every one of twenty men , women , and children seemed overjoyed to see me , but none of them were half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gorging on fresh fish and berries I emerged sufficiently from the stupor Of pure joy into which I was fallen , to remember that the Yukon was still some distance away , and announced my intention of proceeding forthwith on my raft to Rampart HOUR ? , which was now not far distant . But one of the Indians , who spoke good English , told me that I could not safely go any farther on so small a raft as I had , but must have one twice as big to pass without capsizing in the Boiling Tea Kettle rapid just below . The whole camp professed their willingness to help me enlarge the raft , but said that at best rafting through the " Tea Kettle " was serious VaL . CXX. ? No , 711. - 5Sbusiness , while a canoe can keep out of the current and pass safely . I therefore hired a bark canoe built , for one man , and in it its owner and I proceeded down the river . It felt more dangerous , but doubtless was safer than the old raft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing was so crazy that sitting in it is best compared to a tightrope performance , while its birch-bark sides were so fragile that it sprang a leak every time the boat was subjected to the strain of going through even a slight rapid . But where the river twists like a rope through the elbow-shaped gorge of the " Tea Kettle " everything went well , for we hugged the inside shore and were in quiet water , while a raft would inevitably be drawn into the centre of the current . When I had seen the rapid and the eafion that leads to it I felt that through no merit of my own I had escaped an adventure whose value for narrative purposes would have become vested exclusively in my literary executor . Just above Rampart House we fell in with Harry Linklater , an old Hudson 's Bay man , who , with his family , joined us for the rest of the tvay to the trading post ? some six miles . Here Daniel Cadzow ? whose generous hospitality is the brightest spot in every journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge . Although there were still two hundred miles to the Yukon , all the difficulties of the trip were over . The journey had so far covered six or seven hundred miles and lasted twenty-four days , eleven of which had been spent on the raft between the farewell to the Indian guides on the Bell and the meeting with people on the Porcupine . From Rampart House I travelled comfortably in Mr. Linklater 's boat , for he was going to Fort Yukon anyway , and hastened his departure for my sake . The morning of September 4th I was on board the magnificent river steamer Hanna going up-stream toward Dawson , while my most urgent despatches were going down-stream with the Koyukuk to be cabled over the government 's telegraph lines from Fort Gibson . As I found out later , the news of the safety of our ice party was wired from Gibson thirty-six hours after the sending out from Athabasca Landing the report of their supposed death .                   @ @
