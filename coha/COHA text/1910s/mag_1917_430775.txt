 | John Cowper Powis , writing in the New York Times , has spoken of Mr. Edgar Lee Masters as " the natural child of Walt Whitman , the only poet with true Americanism in his bones . " While conceding Mr. Masters ' " true Americanism " and granting that a kinship exists between the two poets to the extent that both have worked in American material and with points of view and methods distinctly their own , we may , I think , find it interesting to inquire further into the degree of similarity existing between this so-called father and son . Such an inquiry will , I feel sure , show that two men could scarcely be farther apart in either their technique or their interpretation of life . Not only does the diffuse , rambling manner that so often disfigures Whitman 's work contrast sharply with Masters ' restraint and sense of form ; there is an equal contrast between the types of musical effect which the two men display . Both have written in free verse and in metrical , rimed and unrimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was apt to be cramped in both substance and form . His real music ? and there is no music more subtle in American poetry ? is found in his free verse , not everywhere indeed , nor often , but in a few such poems as " When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom 'd " and passages like the apostrophe to Night in the " Song of Myself . " Mr. Masters , on the other hand , has never , in his free verse , found the secret of such music as the above , or perhaps he has not sought it . His lines have a trenchancy , a high penetrating and explosive power , that harmonizes better with their subject matter than would more delicate music . For his true musical effects Masters turns to the rimed form , and here he often succeeds admirably , as in the spirited ballad that closes his latest volume . He finds nothing in the rimed stanza , as Whitman unquestionably found , to shackle thought and expression .  | But these divergences in the technique of verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divergences in the philosophies of the two men . How far the attitude of each is due to the spirit and trend of his times and how far to his temperament , no one can say . Unquestionably America has traveled far in the half century that separates the two , and in a degree each speaks the language of his times . Yet to take each as a full expression of his times , to regard Whitman as the prophet of a journey begun at sunrise and Masters as the recorder of the journey 's end , would be to paint our national changes of half a century blacker than they really are . The difference must be largely one of temperament . Walt Whitman was , of course , a self-appointed prophet . Coming into his full powers in the Civil War period , when the nation was fighting for ideals and when democracy seemed animated by a new impulse even before the older Jeffersonian impulse had died , ' Whitman rode on the very crest of the wave , putting an altogether fresh enthusiasm into his songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except indeed the experience of the past ? to feel sanguine for the future . The country , at infinite material sacrifice , had rallied to an ideal , and , the war over , there returned from the camps to the fields " The bravest , readiest , clearest-eyed Straight-walking men in the world , And symbolical of a Republic That is worthy the name ! " And so Whitman became the prophet of a sort of quest , wherein the seeker was the soul of the individual and of the nation , and the goal was a free personal development on the one hand , and on the other , democracy and brotherhood . For fifty years America has gone upon its way , and now comes Mr. Masters to chronicle its progress . He finds it , or so he tells us , groping about the corners of a blind alley . In answer to Whitman 's promise of a free and noble development of the individual he offers Winston Prairie , the middle western town which by its smug commonplaceness crushed out the hopeful young soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brotherhood and democracy he pictures the greed of  | Spoon River and the plutocracy of Chicago . The dream that thrilled Whitman in the sixties has had but sorry fulfillment , and in so far as the nation has actually fallen off from its ideals and aims of fifty years ago , Masters and Whitman may be taken as expressing something of the spirit of their respective periods . The difference , however , is one much more of temperament than of environment . Whitman , as every one knows , was a sort of philosophical optimist . Holding a priori that the universe was sound at core and throughout , he found in everything either good or promise of good ' . Nothing in the natural course of things was evil , no , nor ugly . And along with this very cheerful conception of a universe good already and moving under an irresistible impulse to better , there went , as is almost necessary with such a belief , a kind of two-dimensioned vision , a habit of viewing phenomena without looking behind them . In one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences that befall human life , tragic and happy , commonplace and sublime , and declares them all a part of the perfect whole , equally worthy of song . But into the history and causes of tragedy , into the frustration of spirits as earnestly aspiring as his , he does not care to go . Such exploration would prove damaging to his complacent optimism . He prefers to follow out his a priori theory , singing the triumphant journey of the soul through the universe and the coming of the millennium . It is at this point that we find the most radical difference between Whitman and Masters . Whitman has his eye continually upon broad expanses and far distances , the land of his quest . Masters , too often perhaps , sees nothing but enclosing walls . Whitman is the romanticist , swung aloft by his triumphant imagination ; Masters is the scientist , a sworn devotee of facts , confessing no a priori theories . I say confessing , because I suspect Mr. Masters of being almost as predisposed to pessimism as was Walt Whitman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalism of Mr. Hardy 's novel , " Jude the Obscure , " have , I believe , the sum and substance of the philosophy that pervades " The Great Valley " and " Spoon River Anthology . " They will recall the hero 's early  | aspirations and his earnest effort toward their realization ; his gradual sinking under the weight of his own native weakness and the force of circumstance , until he dies , a hopelessly crushed man . All this happens in Chicago and Winston Prairie and Spoon River no less than in England , and Mr. Masters has made it his special province . His whole philosophy he thus states interrogatively : " You see it comes to this , dear queen : Can a man or woman alive escape The granite 's edges or ditch 's mire , The thorny thickets or marsh 's gas , Or the traps one thinks would never be set Except for the fox or wolf ? . . And his next poem answers the question in the negative . Is this a generalizati- from the poet 's observation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as tenaciously as Whitman did to its exact reverse ? Probably the answer is , both ; for the facts one sees are largely what one is predisposed to see . Masters is predisposed to see the weakness that is in human nature and the tragedy that pursues it , and he finds , of course , plenty of both . The dark side is surely there ; and if the bright side is there too , Masters finds it less interesting and has little to say of it . It was this bright side that appealed to Whitman , or rather , Whitman had little concern with objective reality , bright or dark . He was interested primarily in himself and found in himself the solution of the cosmos , working always from within outward . He enfolded the universe , so to speak , within his colossal ego , and as tragedy staid its hand from him , the universe was to him glorious and happy . To Whitman the world was a pageant , to be enjoyed ; to Masters it is a drama , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , I think , lies the germ of the difference between the two men : in Whitman 's romantic egoism and Masters ' penetrating , though darkly tainted , objectivity .
