IT is impossible to live in Chambers without knowing ' something of the other tenants in the house . I know much even of several who were centuries or generations before my time , and I could not help it if I wanted to , for the London County Council has set up a plaque to their memory on our front wall . Not that I want to help it . I take as much pride in my direct descent from Pepys and Etty as others may in an ancestor on the Mayflower or with the Conqueror ; while if it had not been for J. and his interest in the matter , we might not yet boast the plaque that gives us distinction in our shabby old street , though , to do us full justice , its list of names should be lengthened by at least one , perhaps the most distinguished . I have never understood why Bacon was left out . Only the pedant would disown so desirable a tenant for the poor reason that the house has been rebuilt since his day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I regret to say , he waited to move in until after the Diary ended , so that we do not figure in its pages . Nor , during his tenancy , does he figure anywhere except in the parish accounts , which is more to his credit than our entertainment . Etty was considerate , and put on record his " peace and happiness " in our chambers , but I have no proof that he appreciated their beauty . If he liked to walk on our leads in the evening and watch the sun set behind Westminster , he turned his back on the river at the loveliest hour of all . It was his habit as Academician to work like a student at night in the Royal Academy Schools , then in Trafalgar Square ? an admirable habit , but one that took him away just when he should have stayed . For when evening transformed the Thames and its banks into Whistler 's " Fairyland , " he , like Paul Revere , hung out a lantern from his studio window , as a signal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fetch his and protect him from the robbers ( ) Nur quarter , which had not then the best of reputations . Three generations of artists climbed our stairs to drink tea and eat muffins with Etty , but they showed the same ignorance of the Thames , all except Turner , who thought there was no finer scenery on any river in Italy , and who wanted to capture our windows from Etty and make them his own , but who , possibly because he could not get them , never painted the Thames as it was and is . One other painter did actually capture the windows on the First Floor , and , in the chambers that are now the Pro-. fessor 's , Stanfield manufactured his marines , and there too , they say , Humphrey Davy made his safety lamps . We do not depend solely on the past for our distinguished tenants . Some of the names which in my time have been modestly inscribed inside our vestibule , later generations may find on the plaque we make a parade of on our outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to count Mr. Edmund Gosse as " one of us . " Then we have had a novelist or two , whose greatness I shrink from putting to the test by reading their novels , and also one or more actors ; but fame fades from the mummer on the wrong side of the footlights . We still have the Architect who , if the tenants were taken at his valuation , would , I fancy , head our new list . He is not only an architect , but , like Etty , ? like J. , for that matter , ? an Academician . He carries off the dignity with great stateliness , conscious of the vast gulf fixed between him and tenants with no initials after their name . Moreover , he belongs to that extraordinary generation of now elderly Academicians who were apparently chosen for their good looks , as Frederick 's soldiers were for their size . The stoop that has come to his shoulders with years but adds to the impressiveness of his carriage . His air of superiority is a continual reminder of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His " Aoh , good mornin ' , " as he passes , is a kindness , a few words from him a favor rarely granted , and there is no insolent familiar in the house who would dare approach him . Royalty , Archbishops , University dignitaries , - are his clients , and it would seem presumption for the mere untitled to approach him with a commission . His office is run on dignified lines in keeping with the exalted sphere in which he practices . A parson of the Church of England is his chief assistant . A notice on his front door warns the unwary that " No Commercial Traveller need apply , " and implies that others had better not . William Penn is probably the only creature in the house who ever had the courage to ' enter the academic precincts unbidden . William was a cat of infinite humor , and one of his favorite jests was to dash out of our chambers and down the stairs whenever he had the chance : not because he wanted to escape , ? he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because he knew that one or all of us would dash after him . If he was not caught in time , he added to the jest by pushing through the Academician 's open door and hiding somewhere under the academic nose ; and I am certain that nobody had a keener sense of the audacity of it than William himself , More than once a young assistant , trying to repress a grin and to look as serious as if he were handing us over a design for a dean* , restored William to his family ; and once , on a famous occasion when we were starting , already late , for the Law Courts and the witness-box , the Architect relaxed so far as to pull William out from among the academic drawing-boards and smile as he presented him to J. , following in pursuit . Even Jove sometimes unbends ; but when Jove is a near neighbor it is wiser not to presume up:in his unbending , and we have never given the Architect reason to regret his moment of weakness . Whatever the Architect thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square , whose front door faces ours on the third floor . Mr. Square is under no necessity of assuming an air of superiority , so patent to everybody in the house is his right to it . If anything , he shrinks from asserting himself . He had been in his chambers a year ? coming a few months " after the fire " ? before I knew him by sight , though by reputation he is known to everybody from one end of the country to the other . Not only is there excitement in our house when the police officer appears on our staircase with a warrant for his arrest for murder , but all the United Kingdom thrills and waits with us for the afternoon 's Police Report . In the neighborhood I am treated with almost as much respect as when I have played a leading part in the Law Courts . The milkman and the postman stop me in the street , the little fruiterer round the corner and the young ladies at the Temple of l'omona in the Strand detain me in giving me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crime . What if the murder is only technical , Mr. Square 's arrest a matter of form , and his discharge immediate ? The glory is in his position , which makes the technical murder an achievement to be envied by every true-born Briton . For he is Referee at the Imperial Boxing Club , and therefore the most important person in the empire , except perhaps the winning jockey at the Derby or the captain of the winning football team . The Prime Minister ? Royalty itself ? would not shed a brighter lustre on our ancient house , and there could be no event of greater interest than the fatal " accident " in the ring for which Mr. Square is held technically responsible . Ile shares his chambers with Mr. Savage , who is something in the Bankruptcy Court . With them we have not so much as the undesirable intimacy that comes from mutual complaint , and such is their amiability that William , in his most outrageous intrusions , never roused from them a remonstrance . I am forced to admit that William was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his adventures . He often beguiled me at midnight upon the leads , that he might enjoy my vain endeavors to entice him home with the furry monkey tied to the end of a string , which during the day never failed to bring him captive to my feet . By his mysterious disappearances he often drove J. ? whose heart is tender , and who adored him ? out of his bed at unseemly hours and down into the street , where , in pyjamas and slippers , and the door banged-to behind him , he became an object of suspicion . On one of these occasions , a policeman ma- terialized suddenly from nowhere and turned a bull 's eye on him . " Have you seen a cat about ? " J. asked . " Seen a cat ? Oi 've seen millions on ' em , " said the policeman . " Whot sort o ' cat ? " he added . " A common tabby cat , " said J. " Look ' ere , " said the policeman , " where do you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who retained his presence of mind and his latch-key . " Aoh , Oi begs your parding , sir , " said the policeman . " Oi did n't see you , sir , in the dim light , sir , but you know , sir , there 's billions o ' tabby cats about ' ere of a night , sir . But if Oi find yours , sir , Oi 'll fetch ' im ' ome to you , sir . S'night , sir . Thank ee , sir . " When the kitchen door was opened the next morning , William was discovered innocently curled up in his blanket . And yet , when he again disappeared at bedtime a week or ? two later , J. was again up before daybreak , sure that he was on the doorstep breaking his heart because he could not get in . This time I followed into our little hall , and Augustine after me . She was not then as used to our ways as she is now , and I still remember her sleepy bewilderment when she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search by putting on knickerbockers and long stockings , and her appeal to me : " Mais pourquoi en bieyelelle ? " Why indeed ? But there was no time for explanation . We were interrupted by an angry but welcome wail from behind the opposite door , and we understood that William was holding us responsible for getting himself locked up in Mr. Square 's Chambers . A brand-new pale pink silk quilt on Mr. Square 's bed had appealed to him as more luxurious than his own blanket , and he had profited by Mr. Square 's absence to spend half the night on it , leaving behind him a faint impression of his dear grimy little body . Even then Mr. Square remained as magnanimously silent as if he shared our love for William and pride in his performances . All we know of Mr. Square and Mr. Savage , in addition to their fame and modesty , we have learned from their old man , Tom . He is a sailor by profession , and for long steward on Mr. Savage 's yacht . He clings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pottering about in his blue reefer and brass buttons , Mr. Savage 's little top floor , that adjoins ours and opens out on the leads we share between us , looks more than ever like a ship 's quarter-deck . He is sociable by nature and overflows with kindliness for everybody . He is always smiling , whatever he may be doing or wherever I may meet him , and he has a child 's fondness for sweet things . He is never without a lemon-drop in his mouth , and he keeps his pockets full of candy . As often as the opportunity presents itself , he presses handfuls upon Augustine , whom he and his wife ceremoniously call " Madam , " and to whom he confides the secrets of the household . At times I have feared that his confidences to Augustine , and the tenderness of his attentions , were too marked , and that his old wife , who is less liberal with her smiles , disapproved . Over the grille that separates our leads from his , he gossips by the hour with Augustine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meeting her in the street , he has gallantly invited her into a near public to " ' ave a drink , " an invitation which she , with French scorn for the British substitute for the cafe , would disdain to accept . To other tributes of his affection , however , she does not object . On summer evenings he sometimes lays a plate of salad or stewed fruit at our door , rings , runs , and then from out a loophole of a window by his front door , watches the effect when she finds it , and is horribly embarrassed if I find it by mistake . In winter his offering takes the shape of a British mince-pie or a slice of plum pudding ; and , on a foggy morning , when she comes home from market , he will bring her a glass of port from Mr. Square 's cellar . He is always ready to lend her a little oil , or milk , or sugar , in an emergency . Often he is useful in a more urgent crisis . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut our door on the leads , and make everything shipshape almost before I know it is raining . He has even broken in for me when I have come home late without a key , and by my knocking and ringing have roused up everybody in the whole house except Augustine . Mrs. Tom , much as she may disapprove , is as kindly in her own fashion ; she is quite learned in medicine , and knows an old-fashioned remedy for every ailment . She has seen Augustine triumphantly through an accident ; she has cured Marcel , Augustine 's husband , of a quinsy ; and she rather likes to he called upon for advice . She is full of little amiabilities . She never gets a supply of eggs fresh from the country , at a reasonable price , without giving me a chance to secure a dozen or so ; and when her son , a fisherman , comes up to London , she always reserves a portion of his present of fish for me . I could not ask for kindlier neighbors , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was very near having friendship thrust upon me , however , by the First Floor Back , Mrs. Eliza Short ; an elderly lady of generous proportions and flamboyant tastes , " gowned " elaborately by Jay , and as elaborately " wigged " by Truefitt . The latest fashions and golden hair can not conceal the ravages of time , and , as a result of her labors , she looks tragically like the unwilling wreck of a Lydia Thomp- OUR TENANTS SOS son Blonde . I may be wrong , she may never have trod the boards , and yet nothing save the theatre could account for her appearance . The most assiduous of her visitors , as I meet them on the stairs , is an old gentleman as carefully made up in his way , an amazing little dandy , whom I fancy as somebody in the front row applauding rapturously when Mrs. Eliza Short , in tights and golden locks , came pirouetting down the stage . I should have been inclined to weave a pretty romance about them as the modern edition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not become impossible to associate romance of any kind with her . Our acquaintance was begun by my drinking tea in her chambers the morning " after the fire , " of which she profited unfairly by putting me on her visiting list . She was not at all of Montaigne 's opinion that " incuriosity " is a soft and sound pillow to rest a well-composed head upon . On the contrary , it was evident that for hers to rest in comfort she must first see every room in our chambers and examine into all my domestic arrangements . I have never been exposed to such a battery of questions . I must say for her that she was more than ready to pay me in kind . Between her questions she gave me a vast amount of information for which I had no possible use , and she could not pass me on the stairs , or in the hall , or on the street , where much of her time was spent , without stopping me with some equally irrelevant piece of confidence . I positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation was already strained when Jimmie rushed to the rescue . One day when she had been out since ten o'clock in the morning , she returned to find him locked up in her chambers alone with her bird . That the bird was still hopping about its cage was to me the most mysterious feature in the whole affair , for Jimmie was a splendid sportsman . After his prowls in the garden ho only too often left behind him a trail of feathers and blood-stains all the way up the three flights of our stairs . But if the bird had not escaped , Mrs. Short could hardly have been more furious . She demanded Jimmie 's life , and when it was refused , insisted on his banishment . She threatened him with poison and me with exposure to the Landlord . For days the Housekeeper was sent flying backwards and forwards between Mrs. Short 's chambers and ours , bearing threats and defiances . Jimmie , who knew as well as I did what was going on , rejoiced , and from then until his untimely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always running down or up ? without stopping in front of her door , giving one unearthly howl , then flying ; and never by chance did he pay the same little attention to any one of the other tenants . Mrs. Short does not allow me to forget her . As her voice is deep and harsh , and thunders through the house when she buttonholes somebody else , or says good-by to a friend at her door , I hear her far more frequently than I care to ; as she has a passion for strong scent , I often smell her when I do not see her at all ; and as in our little quarter we all patronize the same tradesmen , I am apt to run into her , not only on our stairs , but in the dairy , or the Temple of Pomona , or further afield , at the Post Office . Then , however , we both stare stonily into vacancy , failing to see each other , and during the sixteen years since that first burst of confidence , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an admirable arrangement which I owe wholly to Jimmie . With her neighbors on the other side of the hall , Mrs. Short has nothing in common except permanency as tenant . Her name and the sign of the Church League faced each other on the first floor when we came to our chambers ; they face each other still . The League , with a display of hospitality that should put the Architect to shame , bids everybody enter without knocking . Once , when we wanted to rent a room in the house next door , which belongs to the League , I accepted this Christian invitation . I was confronted by a tall , solemn-faced young man , who informed me that the Secretary was " engaged in prayer " ; and , though I repeated my visit , I never got further than the inner hall . As I could not catch the Secretary in his less professional moments , and as his devotions did not soften his heart to the extent of a penny off the rent , which we thought extortionate , there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with the League . The Solicitor of the Ground Floor Front has been with us a short time , but he succeeded the old insurance agent , whom nothing save death could have removed , and for years before lie lived no farther away than Peter the Great 's house across the street , where he would be still , had it not been torn down over his head to make way for the gaudy new building which foretells the beginning of the end of our ancient street . In the Ground Floor Back , change for long was continual . It was the office of a theatrical agent , of a Music Hall syndicate , of . a newspaper correspondent , of a publisher who piled his books in the windows , and made it look so like a shop , which is against the rules of the house , that his disappearance seemed his just reward . After this a steamship company took possession , bringing suggestions of sunshine and spice with the exotic names of its vessels and the far-away southern ports for which they sailed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed many young men and women whom I would meet in couples , whis. poring on the stairs , or going home at dusk , hand in hand . Tender little idyls sprang up in our sober midst . But the staff of young lovers hit upon the roof as trysting-place at the luncheon hour , running races and playing tag up there , and almost tumbling through our sky . light . Cupid , sporting overhead with wings exchanged for hob-nailed boots , was unendurable , and I had to call in the Landlord 's Agent . He is the unfortunate go-between in all the tenants ' differences and difficulties : a large , flabby , shy , nervous man , designed by nature for anything rather than much communication with his fellow men , and decreed by fate and his calling to communicate with them constantly in their most disagreeable moods and phases . Half my fury evaporated at sight of his troubled face , and I might have endured the races and games of tag , could I have foreseen that , almost as soon as he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its departure . The Professor who then came in has been there ever since , and is so exemplary a tenant that I hope that there will be no more changes in the Ground Floor Back . I suspect him of making his amusements his chief business in life , as it is said a man should , and as the Briton certainly does . He hunts in the season , and , as he always motors down to the meet , he is apt to put on his red coat and white breeches before he starts , and they give the last touch of respectability to our respectable house . He is an ardent automobilist , and his big motor at our door suggests wealth as well as respectability . But his most ambitious achievement is ballooning , to which he owes a fame in our quarter only less than Mr. Square 's . We all watch eagerly , with a feeling of proprietorship , for the balloons on the afternoons when balloon races and trials start from the Crystal Palace or Ranelagh . I have caught our little fruiterer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chance customers ; and on those days I am absorbed in the sporting columns of the afternoon paper which , at other times , I pass over unread . He has now but to fly to complete his triumph , and the pride of our house in him . Restlessness also prevails in the Second Floor Back , and as we are immediately above , we suffer the more . First , an Honorable occupied the chambers . His title was an unfailing satisfaction to the Agent and the Housekeeper , who dwelt upon it unctuously every time they mentioned him . I am not learned in Debrett and Burke and may not have appreciated its value , but he might have been Honorable ten times over and it would not have reconciled me to him as neighbor . He was quite sure , if I was not , that he was a great deal better than anybody else , and he had the Briton 's independent way of asserting it . He slammed behind him every door he opened , and when the stairs were barricaded by himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass , he failed to see us as completely as if we had been Mr. Wells 's Invisible Man . He went to the city in the morning , and was away all day , even an Honorable being sometimes compelled to pretend to work . But this was no relief . During his absence his servants availed themselves of the opportunity to assert their independence , which they did with much vigor . When they were not slamming doors , they were singing hymns , until Mrs. Eliza Short , from her chambers below , and we from ours above , in accord the first and only time for years , joined in protest and drove the Agent to the unpleasant task of remonstrating with an Honorable . The Honorable was followed by a Maitre d'HOtel , Adolf by name , an Anglicized German , with mustaches like the Kaiser 's , and the swagger of a drum-major . He treated our house as if it was the dining-room under his command , locking and unlocking the street door , turning on and out the lights on the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of us . He littered up the hall with his children and his children 's perambulators and hobby-horses , just where we all had to stumble over them to get in or out . Nobody 's taxi tooted so loud as his ; not even the Honorable 's door shut with such a bang . Augustine 's husband being also something in the same profession , they both despised the Adolfs for putting on airs though no better than themselves , while the Adolfs despised them for not having attained the same splendid heights , and the shaking of my rugs out of the back windows was seized upon as the excuse for open warfare . Augustine said it was there they should be shaken according to the law in Paris , which she thought good enough for London . Mrs. Adolf protested that the shaking sent all the dust into her rooms . Augustine , whose English is small , and what there is of it not beyond reproach , called Mrs. Adolf " silly fou , " which must have been annoying , or harangued her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suspected an offense in every word . Mrs. Adolf wrote to the Agent , to the Landlord , to me , ? she declared she would summons me to the County Court . Between letters she watched at her window for the rugs and , reinforced by her servant and her charwoman , made faces at Augustine , who has a nice sense of justice , and a temper that does not permit her , with Elizabeth Bennet 's father , to be satisfied by laughing in her turn at those who have made sport of her . I trembled for the consequences . But at the critical moment , Adolf was promoted to the more splendid height of Manager and a large salary ; the taxi was replaced by a motor car of his own ; Mrs. Adolf arrayed herself in muslin and lace for the washtub , in nothing less elegant than velvet for the street ; and they left our old-fashioned Chambers for the marble halls and gilded gorgeousness of the modern mansion . Of the several tenants after the Adolfs , I seem to remember little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do as I would be done by , and to keep out of their way , but accident was always throwing us together , to our mutual indignation . There was the bachelor , whose atrocious cook filled our chambers with the rank odors of smoked herrings and burned meat , and whose deserted lady-love filled the stairs with lamentations . There was the young married couple into whose bath-tub ours overflowed . There was the accidental actress , whose loud voice and heavy boots were the terror not only of our house but of the street , whose telephone rang from morning till night , whose dog howled all evening when he was left alone , as he usually was , and whose rehearsals in her rooms interrupted the work in ours with ear-piercing yells of " Murder " and " Villain . " But I can not recall them all , so rapidly did they come and go . We began to fear that the life of the tenant was as Tristram Shandy described the life of man , a shifting from sorrow to sorrow . We lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious cause for complaint , not a murmur could be wrung from the tenant below , or , for that matter , from a tenant in the house . All , like true Britons , refused to admit the possibility of interests in common , and would not stir a hand , however pressing the danger , so long as they were not disturbed . If our chambers reeked with smoke and the smell of burning wood , they accepted the information with calm indifference because theirs did not . Nor did it serve as a useful precedent if , as it happened , smoke and smell were traced again to a fire smouldering , as it had been for nobody knew how long , in the cellar of the adjoining house , separated from ours only by the " party wall " belonging to both : that ingenious contrivance of the builder for creating ill-will between next-door neighbors . They declined to feel the banisters loose under their grasp , or to see the wide gap opened in the same " party wall " after the fall of the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations , and made us believe for a moment that London was emulating Messina or San Francisco . And I must add , so characteristic was it , that the Agent dismissed our fears as idle , and that the surveyor , sent at our request by the County Council , laughed us to scorn . But we laughed best , for we laughed last . A second surveyor ordered the wall to be pulled down as unsafe , and rebuilt , and the Agent in the end found it prudent to support the banisters with iron braces . When , after many trials and tribulations , Mr. Allan took the Second Floor Back , we thought the Millennium had come . He was a quiet man , employed in the morning , so we were told , in writing a life of Chopin , and in the evening , as we heard for ourselves , in playing Chopin divinely . The piano is an instrument calculated to convert an otherwise harmless neighbor into a nuisance , but of him it made a delight . He was waited upon by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the length of felt slippers in the house , who never slammed doors nor sang , who never even whistled at his work . An eternity of peace seemed to open out before us ; but , as they say in novels , it was not to be . Our confidence in Mr. Allan was first shaken by his ringing us up one night , or rather one early morning , at an hour when , in ' fly experience , a ring at the door-bell means either a fire or an American cablegram , merely to ask us when we proposed to go to bed ; and it struck me then , and still strikes me , as an unjustifiable exhibition of nerves . Had I borne malice , I should not have had to wait long for my revenge , nor to plan it myself . Not many days later , Mr. Allan 's servant , watering the flowers on the open balcony at Mr. Allan 's window , watered by mistake the new Paris bonnet of the lady of the Ground Floor Back , who was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Allan 's chambers , the wreck in her hand . The servant opened to her knock , but she insisted on seeing the master . " I have come , Allan , to tell you what I think of the conduct of your servant , " she said when the master appeared . " Yes , I call you Allan , for I mean to talk to you as man to man , " which she proceeded to do . I did not hear the talk , but it was almost a week before I heard the piano again . Poor Mr. Allan ! And this proved a trifle to the worse humiliation he was soon to endure . As I sat with a book by my lamp one evening before dinner , shrieks from his chambers and a crash of crockery sent me rushing to the door and out upon the landing , with Augustine at my heels . Old Tom and his wife arrived there simultaneously , and , looking cautiously over the banisters , I saw an anxious crowd looking up as cautiously from the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intermingled with more riotous crashing of china . The Housekeeper , urged by the crowd below , crept all unwilling to Mr. Allan 's door and knocked . The door was flung open and , before she ventured to " beg pardon but the noise disturbed the other tenants , " Mr. Allan 's hitherto well-behaved servant greeted her with a volley of bloodcurdling epithets and the smash of every pane of glass in the upper panel of the door , and down she fled again . He bolted out after her , but looking up and catching a glimpse of Tom peacefully sucking a lemon-drop , he became so personal that Tom and his wife retreated hastily , and for the first time the smile faded from the old man 's face . In a moment 's lull I heard Mr. Allan 's voice , low and entreating , then more curses , more crashes ? I should not have thought there was so much glass and crockery to be broken in the whole house . Presently a policeman appeared , and then a second . The door was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crockery . Mr. Allan spoke to them , and then , like a flash , the servant was there too . " I dare you to let them come in ! " he yelled , so loud he could be heard from the top to the bottom of the house . " I dare you to let them come in ! I dare you to give me in charge ! I dare you ! I dare you ! " And Mr. Allan did not dare , that was the astonishing part of it . And he never lost his temper . He argued with the policemen , he pleaded with the servant , while one group on our landing and another on the ground floor waited anxiously . The policemen did not desert us , but stood guard on the second floor , which was a reassurance , until gradually the yells were lowered , the crashes came at longer intervals , and at last , I suppose in sheer exhaustion , the servant relapsed into his usual calm , Mr. Allan " sported his oak , " and I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Housekeeper spent the evening on the stairs , gossiping at every door . There was not much to learn from her . A mystery was hinted ? many mysteries were hinted ? not a shred was left to Mr. Allan 's reputation . The truth I do not know to this moment . I only know that before the seven days of our wonder were over , the Agent , more careworn than ever if that were possible , made a round of visits in the house , giving to each tenant an ample and abject apology written by Mr. Allan . At the end of the quarter , the Second Floor Back was again to let . We should have parted with Mr. Allan less light-heartedly could we have anticipated what was in store for us . He was no sooner gone than the Suffragettes came in . I have no quarrel on political grounds with the Suffragettes . Theoretically , I believe that women of property ? and position should have their vote ; but I think it a lesser evil for them to do without it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for men , and to grant it on any other conditions would be an indignity . I state the fact to explain that I am without prejudice . I do not argue , for , to tell the truth , shocking as it may be , I am not keen one way or the other . Life for me has grown crowded enough without politics , and years have lessened the ardor for abstract justice that was mine when , in my youth , I wrote the Life of Mary Wollstonecraft , and militant Suffragettes as yet were not . Ours are of the most militant variety , and it is not their fault if the world by this time does not know what this means . Even so , on general principles , I should have no grievance against them . Every woman is free to make herself ridiculous , and it is none of my business if my neighbors choose to make a public spectacle of themselves by struggling in the arms of policemen , or going into hysterics at meetings where nobody wants them ; if they like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or if it amuses them to slap and whip unfortunate ministers who , physically , could easily convince them of their inferiority . But when they make themselves a nuisance to me personal . ly , I draw the line . And they are a nuisance to me . They have brought pandemonium into our quarter , where once all was pleasantness and peace . Of old , if the postman , the milkman , a messenger boy , and one or two stray dogs and children lingered in our street , we thought it a crowd ; since the corn . ing of the Suffragettes , I have seen the same street packed solid with a horde of the most degenerate creatures in London , summoned by them " to rush the House of Commons . " They have ground their hurdy-gurdies at our door , Heaven knows to what end ; vans covered with their posters have obstructed our crossing . Motor-cars adorned with their flags have missed fire and exploded in our street ; and they have had themselves photographed as sandwiches on our terrace . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women chargin* in like a mob or stealing out like conspirators . Their badges , their sandwich-boards , their banners , lie about in our hall , so much in everybody 's way that I sympathized with the infuriated tenant whom I caught one night kicking the whole collection into the cellar . They talk so hard on the stairs that often they pass their own door and come on to ours , bringing Augustine from her work and disturbing me at mine , for she can never open to them without poking her head into my room to tell me , " Encore une sale Suffragette ! " In their chambers they never stop chattering , and their high shrill treble penetrates through the floor , and reaches us up above . The climax came with their invasion of our roof . This roof , built " after the fire , " is a modern invention designed for the torture of whoever lives underneath . It is flat , with a beautiful view to be had among the chimney-pots and telephone-wires ; it is so thin that a pigeon could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is covered with gravel , every sound is accompanied by a scrunching warranted to set the strongest nerves in a quiver . We had already been obliged to represent to the Agent that it was not intended for the Housekeeper 's afternoon parties or young people 's games of tag , that there were other , more suitable , places where postmen could take a rest , or our actress recite her lines , or lovers do their courting amid the smuts . Our patience , indeed , had been so tried in one way or another , that at the first sound from above , at any hour of the day or night , J. was full tilt after the trespassers , and they were retreating before the eloquence of his attack . It was in a corner of this roof , just above the studio , and in among wood-inclosed cisterns , that the Suffragettes elected to send off fire-balloons which , in some way best known to themselves , were to impress mankind with the necessity of granting them the vote . The first balloon floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dropping , happily , into the Thames , when J. , straight from his printing-press , in blouse , sleeves rolled up , arms and hands black with ink , a cap set sideways , was on the roof , and the Secretary of the Militants , and a young man in the brown suit and red tie that denote the Socialist , in their hands matches and spirits of wine , were flying downstairs . I was puzzled to account for their meekness , unless it was that never before had they seen anybody so inky , never before listened to language so picturesque and American . J. , without giving them time to take breath , called in the Landlord 's Agent , supported by the Landlord 's Solicitor , and they were con- vinced of the wisdom of promising not to do it again . And of course they did . A week later the Prime Minister was unveiling a statue or performing some equally innocent function in the gardens below our window , when the Suffragettes , from the roof of near worksheds , demanded of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We follow the movement with such small zest that when we were first aware that something out of the common was going on in our quarter , the . two heroines were already in the arms of policemen , where of late so much of the Englishwoman 's time has been spent , and heads were at every window up and down our street , housekeepers at every door , butchers ' and bakers ' boys grouped on the sidewalk , one or two tradesmen 's carts drawn up in the gutter , battalions of policemen round the corner . The women , no doubt , to-day boast of the performance as a bold strike for freedom , and recall with pride the sensation it created . At this point I lost sight of the conflict on the roof below , for , from the roof above , a balloon shot upwards , so high that only the angels could have read the message it bore . The familiar scrunching , though strangely muffled , was heard , and J. , again in blouse and ink , was up and away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found six women , each with a pair of shoes at her side , and her feet drawn up under her , squatting in a ring behind the cisterns , bending over a can of spirits of wine , and whispering and giggling like school-girls . " It wo n't go off , " they giggled , and the next minute all chance of its ever going off was gone , for J. had seized the balloon and torn it to tatters . " You have destroyed our property , " shrieked a venerable little old lady , thin and gaunt , with many wrinkles and straggling gray hair . He told her that was what he had intended to do . " But it cost ten shillings , " she squeaked in a tremor of rage , and with an attempt at dignity ; but it is as hard to be dignified as Corporal Trim found it to be respectful , when one is sitting squat upon the ground . A younger woman , golden-haired , in big hat and feathers , whom the others called Duchess , demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider his costume and his inkiness I wonder he had not been asked it long before . " You can go downstairs and find out , " he said , " but down you go ! " There was a moment 's visible embarrassment , and they drew their stocking-feet closer up under them . J. , in whom they had left some few shreds of the politeness which he , as a true American , believes is woman 's due , considerately looked the other way . As soon as they were able to rise up in their shoes , they altogether lost their heads . The Housekeeper and the Agent , summoned in the mean time , were waiting as they began to crawl down the straight precipitous ladder from the roof . In an agony of apprehension , the women clutched their skirts tight about them , protesting and scolding the while . The little old lady tried to escape into our chambers , one or two stood at the top of the stairs , cutting off all approach , the others would not budge from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcel , endeavored to get past them and up to us , but they would not give way an inch . Finally in despair , J. gently collected them and pushed them down the stairs toward their own door . " We will have you arrested for assault ! " the little old lady shrieked . " We charge you with assault and battery , " the golden-haired lady reechoed from below . And we heard no more , for at last , with a sigh of relief , J. could get to our door , and shut out the still ascending uproar . But that was not the end of it . If you can believe it , they were on the roof again within an hour , getting themselves and their megaphone photographed , for the fight for freedom would not be half so sweet without the publicity of portraits in the press . And we were besieged with letters . One Suffragette wrote that an apology was due ? yes , J. replied , due to him . A second lectured him on the offense given to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a Suffragette is not to cease to be a snob , and warned him that the Duchess ? who was the golden-haired lady and may have had the bluest blood of England in her veins , but looked more like one of the Gaiety Girls from whom the stock of the British nobility has been so largely replenished ? and the Duke intended to consult their Solicitor if regret were not expressed . And the Landlord 's Agent called , and the Landlord 's Solicitor followed , and a Police Inspector was sent from Scotland Yard for facts , and he reprimanded J. for one mistake ? not having locked the door on the inside when they were out ; and the insurance people wanted to know about fire-balloons , and everybody with any possible excuse came down upon us , except the police officer with the warrant to arrest J. for assault and battery . Well , it is all over now . If the Suffragettes still hatch their plots under our roof , they are denied the use of it for carrying them out . They leave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charm of an old house like ours has returned to it , and outwardly the tenants cultivate the repose and dignity incumbent upon them as the descendants of Bacon and Pepys , and the inheritors of a great past .
