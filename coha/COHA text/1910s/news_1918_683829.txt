txt THE CITY AS GROCER . A Protest and a Denial of Charges of Profiteering . To the Evictor of The New York Tim e8 : Since the appointing of Federal food boards , we have heard much of profiteering . The statement in the daily press that Commissioner Day is preparing to start a chain of stores to sell butter , eggs ; potatoes at cost is nothing but the city " profiteering " at the expense of the retail grocers of this city . So far , all the investigating , as well as the charge made in certain quarters that the retail grocers were charging exhorbitant profits have never yet been proved , in fact the reverse . In all this socialistic cry for the city to go into the buying and selling of food at cost , it seems strange that the authorities can not see that the retail grocers could sell cheaper if they had no rent , rates , and overhead expenses to pay . For the city to go into the business of selling food is most unfair to the retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgement of the loyalty and support the retailers have given the Food Administration . The retail grocers are being called on to make sacrifices in the way of reducing their already too meagre profits , subscribe to Liberty Loans , Red Cross Funds , and any number of their sons have gone across , while they themselves have come across in many ways ; but to have to meet competition so one-sided as that of the latest move of the city authorities is such as to call for strong opposition on the part of the grocers . I do n't suppose that much good will come from . any protest of the grocers , yet I think that the commission should hear in no uncertain tones from the grocers disapproving of this most unfair competition . CHAS . THORPE . Secretary New York Retail Grocers ' Association . New York , April 5 , 1518 , REFORMED WOMAN 'S PARTY . Why It Changed Its Mind on an Important Question . To the Editor of The New York Times : So many people seem to be interested in the changed policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstand the motives that led to it that it seems wise to explain the matter more fully than has yet been done . The officers of the City Suffrage Part/ have repeatedly declared that the nonpartisan policy maintained by the organization was a temporary measure adopted to give its women members time to study and think before they affiliated with any of the political parties . The great campaign of education for citizenship which we have conducted throughout the city has been facilitated by the nonpartisan attitude of our officers and leaders , since we have reached all classes of women and the women of all parties , who believed that we were impartial in presenting the principles of all the parties . Our organization as an organization is still nonpartisan , a fact our critics seem to overlook . In it the women of all parties may meet and discuss all public questions from their various standpoints : through it they may unite to take action on all kinds of nonpartisan and humanitarian measures . The policy of the party was changed for two reasons : First , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May 18 , after which they will naturally take a greater interest in politics ; and , second , bee:luso there is a demand from the political parties  --  all of them  --  for our trained women to serve as political leaders and captains . We believe that women used to organization work should take these positions , yet we found our own women no loyal to  --  the Woman Suffrage Party and so bound to it by affection that it was an ordeal for them to resign office in it to give their services elsewhere . We have , therefore , felt it our duty to give them perfect freedom to serve both the city party and the political party of their choice . We believe that women and men should work together in the parties for the good of the community , not that women should form a political party for themselves . Personally , I do not believe in any kind of a woman 's party . In view of all these facts , we feel that we have done the right thing , the patriotic thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from outside groups of people , but because of conditions that developed within our own ranks . MARI " GARRETT ITA Y. New York , April d , 1918 . Would Follow Gorgas . To the Editor of The Not , York Times : " A Line Officer " writes in your issue of March : 11 , that he considers higher rank far the medical men in the Unite States Army unnecessary , and that it would be better if they were not a part of the United States Army at all . Ho suggests it be made an outside organization , like the Red Cross . What he has decided about the Ordnance . Quartermaster and Engineer Corps we have yet to learn . There 's the fear , too , that ho may take a seunner against the staff . rossLbly this " Line Officer " has not read his statistics carefully in the casualties today , which are heaviest among officers not oC. ' the lino , but of tho Medical Corps . The only two Victoria crosses with two bars have been won by medical officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own United States of having the first Medal of Honor for gallantry in action awarded by the Congress to a surgeon of the Medical Corps ; and to Leonard Wood as an assistant surgeon while commanding a detachment of infantry . As nearly every medical and surgical man of eminence has offered himself for the service , the Medical Corps will be more efficient than ever before , and since Gorgas has the rank to make himself heard , let us follow his counsels . SISTER OP TWO LINE OFFICERS IN FRANCE . Little Rock , Ark. , April 3 , 1018 . The Women to Serve Abroad . To the Editor of The New York Times : The ruling that no army wives shall be accepted for service abroad is probably the re ? suit of an effort to forestall an imaginary rush to France by hordes of loving women . It Is , of course , a reflection not only on the women , but on their husbands , to believe that they have no common sense or patriotism , and that they would permit a spasm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The published articles which say that the presence of a wife in the same country depresses and worries a husband , while only " vivacious " unmarried women near the front contribute to sustain the morale of troops , are too inane to discuss . Almost all the women in the country today who can go abroad will be disqualified under this rule , and they are the ones who have most at stake , who would give themselves most whole-heartedly to the work to be done . This Is not a plea to be allowed to live in France in Idleness . No sane person would choose the war zone for a residence now . To cross one must pass certain requirements and sign a contract for six months , which adequately protects the Government from Inefficiency . It is only Justice and wisdom to give every one the chance to compete for the privilege of service . Let those go who can servo best . Personal relationships should have no place in a crisis like this . D. C. F. Corpus Christi , Texas , April 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The New York Times : Another incomprehensible order has just been issued by our Government , that forbidding any publication of the casualties among our soldiers In France . General March 's explanation for omitting the addresses of our men killed , wounded , or missing gave a degree of reasonableness to that order , but this latest dictum seems to be the height of folly . Are we who have given sons , brothers , our nearest and dearest , to bo denied tho right of a full and free knowledge of what is happening to them ? The Government has undertaken to notify by telegraph the family or nearest friend of every soldier or sailor killed , wounded , or captured , but this will prove a well-nigh impossible task when our boys get into such heavy fighting as has taken place lately and thousands give up their precious lives in order that we at home may be saved .
