txt Evidence that William R. Hearst 's Independence League is working in close harmony with Tammany came to light yesterday , when it was learned that the Word had gone out among the Independence League members to bolt the Fusion judiciary candidates at the primaries to-morrow and write in on the ballots instead the candidates selected by the Tammany Designating Committee . Tile Independence League has already indorsed Bartow S. Weeks and Eugene J. Philbin , the Tammany candidates for Supreme Court Justice . Justice Philbin and Benjamin F. Cardozo are the Fusion candidates . The Independence Leaguers have likewise been requested to substitute the name of Judge Warren W. Foster , the Democratic nominee , in place of that of Charles C. Nott , Jr. , the Fusion candidate for Judge of General Sessions , and Robert L. Luce , the Tammany candidate for Judge of the City Court , in place of the Fusion candidate , William L. Ransom . At the seine time the Independence League'voters have been asked to vote for Charles E. Gehring for Borough President in place of Marcus M. Marks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League candidate for Mayor , is in favor of the changes . He said yesterday that the men to be sub= stituted were better qualified in every way to fill the places than the men designated by the Fusion Committee . Mr. Allen said also that there was treachery in the Judicial Committee of the Independence League and that that was the cause of the trouble at the meeting of the Designating Committee when it adjourned h:3 disorder . Allen Charges Treachery . He said he made a fight for the candidates he favored , at the meeting , but that the two tellers returned different counts of the vote and that by the time the date of the adjourned meeting had come around , John J. Hopper , the Chairman of the committee , had won over enough votes to make the designations of Nott and Ransom prevail . The attitude of Mr. Allen splits the Independence League into two factions . The names proposed by him will nave to be written on the primary ballot In the space reserved for that purpose , but he said he had enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mayor merely a " filler in " he said : " I do n't think It becomes me to say anything about it at this time , tor I have been merely designated , riot noralnated , If 1 am nominated at the pritnarIes at which tile voters will nave a chance to express their wishes , then 1 may have something to say . The Fusion Committee errs when it thinks a man is nominated who is only designated . " If the changes suggested by Mr. Allen are made by a majority or the voters to-morrow the league will have practically its oW7/ city and judiciary ticket in the field , ' ' ' having already designated its own candidates fdr Mayor , Controller and President of the Aldermen . Contrary to expectations , John Purroy Mitchel did not arrive in the City last night . At his home it was said that he was expected on the Albany night boat , which should arrive here this morning at 6 o'clock . Johnson Attacks Lustgarten . Fire Commissioner Joseph Johnson , who was the manager of Mayor Gaynor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a statement attacking John Purroy Mitchel , the Fusion candidate for Mayor , predicted that Mr. Mitchel woul4 withdraw from the Fusion ticket by Oct. 1 and that George would be substituted . Mr. Johnson denied that the third party movement was dead , and he defended the action of the Gaynor managers who voted to substitute the name of Mr. for that of Mayor Gaynor at the head of the third party ticket . He said the managers of the party intended to keep Mr. 's name there , notwithstanding Mr. 's refusal to be a candidate against Mr. Mitchel and the fact that William Lustgarten and others in the Gaynor organization had announced their intention of going over to the Fusionists , Mr. Johnson also attacked Mr. Lustgarten for deserting the Gaynor cause before the Mayor 's " body was cold , " and he intimated that court *proceedings might be brought against Mr. Lustgarten for the recovery of lists which he said disappeared when Mr. Lustgarten quit the Gaynor headquarters . Maps , he said , had been returned , but the lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Our substitution of Mr. has , of course . Infuriated aapgood'a crowd . They are chagrined because the Mayor 's death has not really helped them . For a moment , to the unthinking , it appeared as if It might . They say nasty things about Mr. Schiff . Mr. Ridder , Mr. Appleton , and the rest of us . But Mr. was not offended . On the contrary , he appeared to me to be deeply moved at the thought that we regarded him as the heir to the Gaynor sentiment . And he said so in his written reply . Why does n't Rapgood rage against Mr , I do not deny that that element which may be described as political camp followers may go to Mitchel , but they n-Ill leave Mitchel just as quickly as they went to him . But never will those who truly respected , loved . and followed Mayor Gaynor transfer their hearts to the dead man 's meanest enemy . And as sure as Gaynor Is dead and Mitchel lives , the Republicans of this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose cowardly attempt to retract his real subway views in fare of an election clearly Indicates his shallow and dangerous character . Who will vote for Mitchel ? The civil employes of New York , whose welfare he has constantly blocked ? The police or firemen , who cried out to him on behalf of their children for a decent living salary ? The liberal element of the community , who think the poor man has as much right to a saloon back door as the rich man to the club front door ? Ms employes in the United States Treasury Department , whose wages he has just reduced ? The suburbanites , whom he has had clinging to Subway straps for four years ? Surely , none of these ! Does any one doubt , with the Roosevelt shadow overhanging them , that Republicans will hesitate to vote for McCall ? When he has recovered from his grief , ask William R. Willcox , Republican and Subway authority , what he thinks of Mitchel . Then . in Heaven 's name , who will vote for him ? Mitchel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of McCall and Murphr . Then why should we hesitate on account of the Mayor 's death ? Rather should we lose not a second to commemorate him by saving Fusion from Mitchel . Let the World and other detractors of the late Mayor rage , but It is they , not us , who are bringing on a Tammany victory by stiffening this narrow young egotist into thinking that Providence has helped him in the passContinued on Pogo 2 . HEARST LEAGUE TURNS TO TAMMANY // lag away of a man ha once referred to as " His Slippery Honor . " Mitchel must go . The inexorable logic of the situation demands lt . The whole city will see it before another week has gone . As to the contemptible insinuations concerning my reeking Murphy again , I wish some one would make it to my face on a lonely road . Put George where he rightfully belongs , at the head instead of the tail of this anti-Tammany cause , and the followers or the late Mayor , who really followed him , will tear Tammany to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the meantime Mr. 's name stands actually substituted for Mayor Gaynor 's on our petitions , already secured . look for no difficulty in Mr. 's final acceptance . He will not be embarrassed by Mr. Mitchers existence on the ticket by the 1st of October . Representatives of sixty-three of the Gaynor organizations will meet at Mr. Lustgarten 's office to-day and consider the proposal of going over to the Fusion cause in a body . , Mr. Lustgarten Is strongly in favor of this action , but it was said that he would not be able to control more than a few of the organizations . Here is Mr. Johnson 's statement concerning Mr. Lustgarten : Lustgarten , who was employed as a clerk at the Gaynor headquarters , is one of that swarm of political parasites who only Stay with a cause as long as It has blood In it . They loved Mayor Gaynor ! But his body was not cold before they crawled swiftly toward the living Mitchel , who had just said the Mayor was a " Tammany decoy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of insect , transferred his affections during the night . Mayor Gaynor 's body had not reached land before he had made hie jump to the Mayor 's worst calumniator . I tear a poor reception in the Mitchel camp awaits this ready young traitor . When Lustgarten disappeared a lot of maps and lists disappeared with him . The maps were returned after I got a Headquarters detective on the job . Also I talked with Charlie Farnum of Fusion headquarters , who assured me he would aid me in the return of the property . Mr. Lustgarten explained last week that he had taken the maps from the Gaynor headquarters by mistake , and that as soon as he learned that Commissioner Johnson desired them he returned thorn at once . As for the lists , he said they were his property , and he saw no reason why they should be returned . FEAR PRIMARY FRAUDS . Glynn Orders Harburger to See That Voters ' Rights Are Preserved .
