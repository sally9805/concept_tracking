" " She predicted I 'm to fall in love with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None but the residents consider Mount Mark , Iowa , much of a town , and those who are honest among them admit , although reluctantly , that Mount Mark can boast of far more patriotism than good judgment ! But the very most patriotic of them all has no word of praise for the ugly little red C. , B. &; Q. railway station . If pretty is as pretty does , as we have been told so unpleasantly often , then the station is handsome enough , but as an ornament to the commonwealth it is a dismal failure ,  - -  low , smoky and dust-grimed . In winter its bleakness and bareness add to the chill of the rigorous Iowa temperature , and in summer the sap oozing through the boards is disagreeably suggestive of perspiration . The waiting-room itself is " cleaned " every day , and yet the same dust lies in the corners where it has lain for lo , these many years . And as for the cobwebs , their chief distinction lies in their ripe old age . If there were only seven spiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least a majority of them must have found their way to Mount Mark station in South-eastern Iowa . Mount Mark is anything but proud of the little station . It openly scoffs at it , and sniffs contemptuously at the ticket agent who bears the entire C. , B. &; Q. reputation upon his humble shoulders . At the same time , it certainly does owe the railroad and the state a debt of gratitude for its presence there . It is the favorite social rendezvous for the community ! Only four passenger trains daily pass through Mount Mark , not including the expresses , which rush haughtily by with no more than a scornful whistle for the sleepy town , and in return for this indignity , Mount Mark cherishes a most unchristian antipathy toward those demon fliers . But the " passengers " ah , that is a different matter . The arrival of a passenger train in Mount Mark is an event -- something in the nature of a C. , B. &; Q. " At Home , " and is always attended by a large and enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lacking are the proverbial " light refreshments ! " So it happened that one sultry morning , late in the month of August , there was the usual flutter of excitement and confusion on the platform and in the waiting-room of the station . The habitues were there in force . Conspicuous among them were four gaily dressed young men , smoking cigarettes and gazing with lack-luster eyes upon the animated scene , which evidently bored them . All the same , they invariably appeared at the depot to witness this event , stirring to others no doubt , but incapable of arousing the interest of these life-weary youths . They comprised the Slaughter-house Quartette , and were the most familiar and notorious characters in all the town . The Daily News reporter , in a well-creased , light gray suit and tan shoes , and with eye-glasses scientifically balanced on his aquiline nose , was making pointed inquiries into the private plans of the travelers . The Daily News reporters in Mount Mark always wear well-creased , light gray suits and tan shoes , and always have eye-glasses scientifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it is managed , but there lies the fact . Perhaps The News includes these details in its requirements of applicants . Possibly it furnishes the gray suits and the tan shoes , and even the eye-glasses . Of course , the reporters can practise balancing them scientifically ,  - -  but how does it happen that they always have aquiline noses ? At any rate , that is the Mount Mark type . It never varies . The young woman going to Burlington to spend the week-end was surrounded with about fifteen other young women who had come to " see her off . " She had relatives in Burlington and went there very often , and she used to say she was glad she did n't have to exchange Christmas presents with all the " friends " who witnessed her arrivals and departures at the station . Mount Mark is a very respectable town , be it understood , and girls do not go to the station without an excuse ! The Adams Express wagon was drawn close to the track , and the agent was rushing about with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishments . The telegraph operator was gazing earnestly out of his open window , and his hands were busily moving papers from one pigeon-hole to another , and back again . Old Harvey Reel , who drove the hotel bus , was discussing politics with the man who kept the restaurant , and the baggage master , superior and supremely dirty , was checking baggage with his almost unendurably lordly air . This was one of the four daily rejuvenations that gladdened the heart of Mount Mark . A man in a black business suit stood alone on the platform , his hands in his pockets , his eyes wandering from one to another of the strange faces about him . His plain white ready-made tie proclaimed his calling . " It 's the new Methodist preacher , " volunteered the baggage master , crossing the platform , ostensibly on business bound , but really to see " who all " was there . " I know him . He 's not a bad sort . " " They say he 's got five kids , and most of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ordered me a dress suit to pay my respects in when they get here . I want to be on hand early to pick me out a girl . " " Yah , " mocked the telegraph operator , bobbing his head through the window , " you need to . They tell me every girl in Mount Mark has turned you down a'ready . " But the Methodist minister , gazing away down the track where a thin curl of smoke announced the coming of Number Nine , and Prudence ,  - -  heard nothing of this conversation . He was not a handsome man . His hair was gray at the temples , his face was earnest , only saved from severity by the little clusters of lines at his eyes and mouth which proclaimed that he laughed often , and with relish . " Train going east ! " The minister stood back from the crowd , but when the train came pounding in a brightness leaped into his eyes that entirely changed the expression of his face . A slender girl stood in the vestibule , leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloved hand . When the train stopped she leaped lightly from the steps , ignoring the stool placed for her feet by the conductor . " Father ! " she cried excitedly and small and slight as she was , she elbowed her way swiftly through the gaping crowd . " Oh , father ! " And she flung her arms about him joyously , unconscious of the admiring eyes of the Adams Express man , and the telegraph operator , and old Harvey Reel , whose eyes were always admiring when girls passed by . She did not even observe that the Slaughterhouse Quartette looked at her unanimously , with languid interest from out the wreaths of smoke they had created . Her father kissed her warmly . " Where is your baggage ? " he asked , a hand held out to relieve her . " Here ! " And with a radiant smile she thrust upon him a box of candy and a gaudy-covered magazine . " Your suit-case , " he explained patiently . " Oh ! " she gasped . " Run , father , run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did run , but Prudence , fleeter-footed , out-distanced him and clambered on board , panting . When she rejoined her father her face was flushed . " Oh , father , " she said quite snappily , " is n't that just like me ? " " Yes , very like , " he agreed , and he smiled . " Where is your umbrella ? " Prudence stopped abruptly . " I do n't know , " she said , with a stony face . " I ca n't remember a blessed thing about the old umbrella . Oh , I guess I did n't bring it , at all . " She breathed long in her relief . " Yes , that 's it , father , I left it at Aunt Grace 's . Do n't you worry about it . Fairy 'll bring it to-morrow . Is n't it nice that we can count on Fairy 's remembering ? " " Yes , very nice , " he said , but his eyes were tender as he looked down at the little figure beside him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a funny name , father ? Why do they call it Mount Mark ? " " I do n't know . I had n't thought to inquire . We turn here , Prudence ; we are going north now . This is Main Street . The city part of the town -- the business part -- is to the south . " " It 's a pretty street , is n't it ? " she cried . " Such nice big maples , and such shady , porchy houses . I love houses with porches , do n't you ? Has the parsonage a porch ? " " Yes , a big one on the south , and a tiny one in front . The house faces west . That is the college there . It opens in three weeks , and Fairy can make freshmen all right , they tell me . I wish you could go , too . You have n't had your share of anything -- any good thing , Prudence . " " Well , I have my share of you , father , " she said comfortingly . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molasses ,  - -  though one would n't think it to look at me . Fairy gained a whole inch last week at Aunt Grace 's . She was so disgusted with herself . She says she 'll not be able to look back on the visit with any pleasure at all , just because of that inch . Carol said she ought to look back with more pleasure , because there 's an inch more of her to do it ! But Fairy says she did not gain the inch in her eyes ! Aunt Grace laughed every minute we were there . She says she is all sore up and down , from laughing so much . " " We have the house fixed up pretty well , Prudence , but of course you 'll have to go over it yourself and arrange it as you like . But remember this : You are not allowed to move the heavy furniture . I forbid it emphatically . There is n't enough of you for that . " " Yes , I 'll remember ,  - -  I think I will . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I must go to a trustees ' meeting at two o'clock , but we can get a good deal done before then . Mrs. Adams is coming to help you this afternoon . She is one of our Ladies , and very kind . There , that is the parsonage ! " Prudence gazed in silence . Many would not have considered it a beautiful dwelling , but to Prudence it was heavenly . Fortunately the wide , grassy , shaded lawn greeted one first . Great spreading maples bordered the street , and clustering rose-bushes lined the walk leading up to the house . The walk was badly worn and broken to be sure ,  - -  but the roses were lovely ! The grass had been carefully cut ,  - -  the father-minister had seen to that . The parsonage , to Prudence 's gratified eyes , looked homey , and big , and inviting . In fact , it was very nearly gorgeous ! It needed painting badly , it is true . The original color had been a peculiar drab , but most of it had disappeared long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . There were many windows , and the well-known lace curtains looked down upon Prudence tripping happily up the little board walk , or so it seemed to her . " Two whole stories , and an attic besides ! Not to mention the bathroom ! Oh , father , the night after you wrote there was a bathroom , Constance thanked God for it when she said her prayers . And I could n't reprove her , for I felt the same way about it myself . It 'll be so splendid to have a whole tub to bathe in ! I spent half the time bathing this last week at Aunt Grace 's . A tub is so bountiful ! A pan is awfully insufficient , father , even for me ! I often think what a trouble it must be to Fairy ! And a furnace , too ! And electric lights ! Do n't you think there is something awe-inspiring in the idea of just turning a little knob on the wall , and flooding a whole room with light ? I do revel in electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited a long time for it , and we 've been very patient indeed , but , between you and me , father , I am most mightily glad we 've hit the luxury-land at last . I 'm sure we 'll all feel much more religious in a parsonage that has a bathroom and electric lights ! Oh , father ! " He had thrown open the door , and Prudence stood upon the threshold of her new home . It was not a fashionable building , by any means . The hall was narrow and long , and the staircase was just a plain businesslike staircase , with no room for cushions , and flowers , and books . The doors leading from the hall were open , and Prudence caught a glimpse of three rooms furnished , rather scantily , in the old familiar furniture that had been in that other parsonage where Prudence was born , nineteen years before . Together she and her father went from room to room , up-stairs and down , moving a table to the left , a bed to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a cozy luncheon for two in the " dining-room . " " Oh , it is so elegant to have a dining-room , " breathed Prudence happily . " I always pretended it was rather fun , and a great saving of work , to eat and cook and study and live in one room , but inwardly the idea always outraged me . Is that the school over there ? " " Yes , that 's where Connie will go . There is only one high school in Mount Mark , so the twins will have to go to the other side of town ,  - -  a long walk , but in good weather they can come home for dinner.  - -  I 'm afraid the kitchen will be too cold in winter , Prudence , it 's hardly more than a shed , really . Maybe we'd --  --  " " Oh , father , if you love me , do n't suggest that we move the stove in here in winter ! I 'm perfectly willing to freeze out there , for the sake of having a dining-room . Did I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exminster ? Well , she asked us a riddle , ' When is a dining-room not a dining-room ? ' And she answered it herself , ' When it 's a little pig-pen . ' And I felt so badly about it , but it did look like a pig-pen , with stove here , and cupboard there , and table yonder , and -- oh , no , father , please let me freeze ! " " I confess I do not see the connection between a roomful of furniture and a pig-pen , but Carol 's wit is often too subtle for me . " " Oh , that 's a lovely place over there , father ! " exclaimed Prudence , looking from the living-room windows toward the south . " Is n't it beautiful ? " " Yes . The Avery family lives there . The parents are very old and feeble , and the daughters are all -- elderly -- and all school-teachers . There are four of them , and the youngest is forty-six . It is certainly a beautiful place . See the orchard out behind , and the vineyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of children outside of school hours , I am told , so we must keep an eye on Connie.  - -  Dear me , it is two o'clock already , and I must go at once . Mrs. Adams will be here in a few minutes , and you will not be lonely . " But when Mrs. Adams arrived at the parsonage , she knocked repeatedly , and in vain , upon the front door . After that she went to the side door , with no better result . Finally , she gathered her robes about her and went into the back yard . She peered into the woodshed , and saw no one . She went into the barn-lot , and found it empty . In despair , she plunged into the barn -- and stopped abruptly . In a shadowy corner was a slender figure kneeling beside an overturned nail keg , her face buried in her hands . Evidently this was Prudence engaged in prayer ,  - -  and in the barn , of all places in the world ! " A -- a -- a -- hem ! " stammered Mrs. Adams inquiringly . " Amen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prudence leaped to her feet . Her fair hair clung about her face in damp babyish tendrils , and her face was flushed and dusty , but alight with friendly interest . She ran forward eagerly , thrusting forth a slim and grimy hand . " You are Mrs. Adams , are n't you ? I am Prudence Starr . It is so kind of you to come the very first day , " she cried . " It makes me love you right at the start . " " Ye -- yes , I am Mrs. Adams . " Mrs. Adams was embarrassed . She could not banish from her mental vision that kneeling figure by the nail keg . Interrogation was written all over her ample face , and Prudence promptly read it and hastened to reply . " I do not generally say my prayers in the barn , Mrs. Adams , I assure you . I suppose you were greatly surprised . I did n't expect to do it myself , when I came out here , but -- well , when I found this grand , old , rambling barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Of course , I did n't specially designate the barn , but God knew what I meant , I am sure . " " But a barn ! " ejaculated the perplexed " member . " " Do you call that a blessing ? " " Yes , indeed I do , " declared Prudence . Then she explained patiently : " Oh , it is on the children 's account , you know . They have always longed for a big romantic barn to play in . We 've never had anything but a shed , and when father went to Conference this year , the twins told him particularly to look out for a good big barn . They said we 'd be willing to put up with any kind of a parsonage , if only we might draw a barn for once . You ca n't imagine how happy this dear old place will make them , and I was happy on their account . That 's why I could n't resist saying my prayers ,  - -  I was so happy I could n't hold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Adams looked at this parsonage girl in frank curiosity and some dismay , which she strongly endeavored to conceal from the bright-eyed Prudence . The Ladies had said it would be so nice to have a grown girl in the parsonage ! Prudence was nineteen from all account , but she looked like a child and -- well , it was not exactly grown-up to give thanks for a barn , to say the very least ! Yet this girl had full charge of four younger children , and was further burdened with the entire care of a minister-father ! Well , well ! Mrs. Adams sighed a little . " You are tired , " said Prudence sympathetically . " It 's so hot walking , is n't it ? Let 's sit on the porch until you are nicely rested . Is n't this a lovely yard ? And the children will be so happy to have this delicious big porch . Oh , I just adore Mount Mark already . " " This is a fine chance for us to get acquainted , " said the good woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been some ill feeling in the Ladies ' Aid Society concerning the reception of Prudence . After the session of Conference , when the Reverend Mr. Starr was assigned to Mount Mark , the Ladies of the church had felt great interest in the man and his family . They inquired on every hand , and learned several interesting items . The mother had been taken from the family five years before , after a long illness , and Prudence , the eldest daughter , had taken charge of the household . There were five children . So much was known , and being women , they looked forward with eager curiosity to the coming of Prudence , the young mistress of the parsonage . Mr. Starr had arrived at Mount Mark a week ahead of his family . The furniture had been shipped from his previous charge , and he , with the assistance of a strong and willing negro , had " placed it " according to the written instructions of Prudence , who had conscientiously outlined just what should go in every room . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of their aunt , and Prudence had come on a day in advance of the others to " wind everything up , " as she had expressed it . But to return to the Ladies ,  - -  the parsonage girls always capitalized the Ladies of their father 's church , and indeed italicized them , as well . And the irrepressible Carol had been heard to remark , " I often feel like exclamation-pointing them , I promise you . " But to return once more . " One of us should go and help the dear child , " said Mrs. Scott , the president of the Aids , when they assembled for their business meeting , " help her , and welcome her , and advise her . " " I was thinking of going over , " said one , and another , and several others . " Oh , that will not do at all , " said the president ; " she would be excited meeting so many strangers , and could not properly attend to her work . That will never do , never , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " " I move that the president appoint a committee of one to help Miss Prudence get settled , and welcome her to our midst , " said Mrs. Barnaby , secretly hoping that in respect for her making this suggestion honoring the president , the president would have appreciation enough to appoint Mrs. Barnaby herself as committee . The motion was seconded , and carried . " Well , " said Mrs. Scott slowly , " I think in a case like this the president herself should represent the society . Therefore , I will undertake this duty for you . " But this called forth a storm of protest and it became so clamorous that it was unofficially decided to draw cuts ! Which was done , and in consequence of that drawing of cuts , Mrs. Adams now sat on the front porch of the old gray parsonage , cheered by the knowledge that every other Lady of the Aid was envying her ! " Now , just be real sociable and tell me all about yourself , and the others , too , " urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one of you . Tell me everything . " " There is n't much to tell , " said Prudence , smiling . " There are five of us ; I am the oldest , I am nineteen . Then comes Fairy , then the twins , and then the baby . " " Are the twins boys , or a boy and a girl ? " " Neither , " said Prudence , " they are both girls . " " More girls ! " gasped Mrs. Adams . " And the baby ? " " She is a girl , too . " And Prudence laughed . " In short , we are all girls except father . He could n't be , of course , or I suppose he would , for our family does seem to run to girls . " " Prudence is a very nice name for a minister 's daughter , " said Mrs. Adams suggestively . " Yes , for some ministers ' daughters , " assented Prudence . " But is sadly unsuitable for me . You see , father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't arrived . They had two names all picked out months ahead ,  - -  Prudence and John Wesley . That 's how I happen to be Prudence . They thought , as you do , that it was an uplifting name for a parsonage baby.  - -  I was only three years old when Fairy was born , but already they realized that they had made a great mistake . So they decided to christen baby number two more appropriately . They chose Frank and Fairy ,  - -  both light-hearted , happy , cheerful names.  - -  It 's Fairy , " Prudence smiled reflectively . " But things went badly again . They were very unlucky with their babies . Fairy is Prudence by nature , and I am Fairy . She is tall and a little inclined to be fat . She is steady , and industrious , and reliable , and sensible , and clever . In fact , she is an all-round solid and worthwhile girl . She can do anything , and do it right , and is going to be a college professor . It is a sad thing to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? Especially when she is so dignified and grand . But one simply ca n't tell beforehand what to expect , can one ? " Father and mother were quite discouraged by that time . They hardly knew what to do . But anyhow they were sure the next would be a boy . Every one predicted a boy , and so they chose a good old Methodist name ,  - -  Charles . They hated to give it John Wesley , for they had sort of dedicated that to me , you know ,  - -  only I happened to be Prudence . But Charles was second-best . And they were very happy about it , and -- it was twin girls ! It was quite a blow , I guess . But they rallied swiftly , and called them Carol and Lark . Such nice musical names ! Father and mother were both good singers , and mother a splendid pianist . And Fairy and I showed musical symptoms early in life , so they thought they could n't be far wrong that time . It was a bitter mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start . Carol can carry a tune if there 's a strong voice beside her , but Lark can hardly tell the difference between Star Spangled Banner and Rock of Ages . " The neighbors were kind of amused by then , and mother was very sensitive about it . So the next time she determined to get ahead of Fate . ' No more nonsense , now , ' said mother . ' It 's almost certain to be a boy , and we 'll call him William after father ,  - -  and Billy for short . ' We all liked the name Billy , mother especially . But she could n't call father anything but William ,  - -  we being parsonage people , you know . But she kept looking forward to little Billy ,  - -  and then they changed it in a hurry to Constance . And after that , father and mother gave the whole thing up as a bad job . There are n't any more of us . Connie settled the baby business in our family . " Mrs. Adams wiped her eyes , and leaned weakly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I swan ! " was all she could say at that moment . While giving herself time to recover her mental poise she looked critically at this young daughter of the parsonage . Then her eyes wandered down to her clothes , and lingered , in silent questioning , on Prudence 's dress . It was a very peculiar color . In fact , it was no color at all , no named color . Prudence 's eyes had followed Mrs. Adams ' glance , and she spoke frankly . " I suppose you 're wondering if this dress is any color ! Well , I think it really is , but it is n't any of the regular shades . It is my own invention , but I 've never named it . We could n't think of anything appropriate . Carol suggested ' Prudence Shade , ' but I could n't bring myself to accept that . Of course , Mrs. Adams , you understand how parsonage people do with clothes ,  - -  handing them down from generation unto generation . Well , I did n't mind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of a sudden Fairy grew up and out and around , and one day when I was so nearly out of clothes I hardly felt that I could attend church any more , she suggested that I cut an old one of hers down for me ! At first I laughed , and then I was insulted . Fairy is three years younger than I , and before then she had got my handed-downs . But now the tables were turned . From that time on , whenever anything happened to Fairy 's clothes so a gore had to be cut out , or the bottom taken off ,  - -  they were cut down for me . I still feel bitter about it . Fairy is dark , and dark blues are becoming to her . She handed down this dress , it was dark blue then . But I was not wanting a dark blue , and I thought it would be less recognizable if I gave it a contrasting color . I chose lavender . I dyed it four times , and this was the result . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she could control her voice . " Yes ,  - -  unfortunately for Connie . They do it on purpose to escape the handed-downs ! They wo n't even have hair ribbons different . And the result is that poor Connie never gets one new thing except shoes . She says she can not help thanking the Lord in her prayers , that all of us outwear our shoes before we can outgrow them.  - -  Connie is only nine . Fairy is sixteen , and the twins are thirteen . They are a very clever lot of girls . Fairy , as I told you , is just naturally smart , and aims to be a college professor . Lark is an intelligent studious girl , and is going to be an author . Carol is pretty , and lovable , and kind-hearted , and witty ,  - -  but not deep . She is going to be a Red Cross nurse and go to war . The twins have it all planned out . Carol is going to war as a Red Cross nurse , and Lark is going , too , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both going to marry soldiers ,  - -  preferably dashing young generals ! Now they can hardly wait for war to break out . Connie is a sober , odd , sensitive little thing , and has n't decided whether she wants to be a foreign missionary , or get married and have ten children.  - -  But they are all clever , and I 'm proud of every one of them . " " And what are you going to be ? " inquired Mrs. Adams , looking with real affection at the bright sweet face . But Prudence laughed . " Oh , dear me , Mrs. Adams , seems to me if I just get the others raised up properly , I 'll have my hands full . I used to have aims , dozens of them . Now I have just one , and I 'm working at it every day . " " You ought to go to school , " declared Mrs. Adams . " You 're just a girl yourself . " " I do n't want to go to school , " laughed Prudence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of father and the girls , with Fairy to keep me balanced ! I read , but I do not like to study.  - -  No , you 'll have to get along with me just the way I am , Mrs. Adams . It 's all I can do to keep things going now , without spending half the time dreaming of big things to do in the future . " " Do n't you have dreams ? " gasped Mrs. Adams . " Do n't you have dreams of the future ? Girls in books nowadays dream --  --  " " Yes , I dream , " interrupted Prudence , " I dream lots ,  - -  but it 's mostly of what Fairy and the others will do when I get them properly raised . You 'll like the girls , Mrs. Adams , I know you will . They really are a gifted little bunch ,  - -  except me . But I do n't mind . It 's a great honor for me to have the privilege of bringing up four clever girls to do great things ,  - -  do n't you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what more a body could want . " " It seems to me , " said Mrs. Adams , " that I know more about your sisters than I do about you . I feel more acquainted with them right now , than with you . " " That 's so , too , " said Prudence , nodding . " But they are the ones that really count , you know . I 'm just common little Prudence of the Parsonage ,  - -  but the others ! " And Prudence flung out her hands dramatically . CHAPTER II THE REST OF THE FAMILY It was Saturday morning when the four young parsonage girls arrived in Mount Mark . The elderly Misses Avery , next door , looked out of their windows , pending their appearance on Main Street , with interest and concern . It was a serious matter , this having a whole parsonage-full of young girls so close to the old Avery mansion . To be sure , the Averys had a deep and profound respect for ministerial households , but they were Episcopalians themselves , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of a widower-rector with five daughters , and no housekeeper . There was something blood-curdling in the bare idea . The Misses Avery considered Prudence herself rather a sweet , silly little thing . " You have some real nice people in the Methodist church , " Miss Dora had told her . " I dare say you will find a few of them very likeable . " " Oh , I will like them all , " said Prudence quickly and seriously . " Like them all ! " echoed Miss Dora . " Oh , impossible ! " " Not for us , " said Prudence . " We are used to it , you know . We always like people . " " That is ridiculous , " said Miss Dora . " It is absolutely impossible . One ca n't ! Of course , as Christians , we must tolerate , and try to help every one . But Christian tolerance and love are --  --  " " Oh , excuse me , but -- really I ca n't believe there is such a thing as Christian tolerance , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and -- that is all we need . " Then leaning forward : " What do you do , Miss Avery , when you meet people you dislike at very first sight ? " " Keep away from them , " was the grim reply . " Exactly ! And keep on disliking them , " said Prudence triumphantly . " It 's very different with us . When we dislike people at first sight , we visit them , and talk to them , and invite them to the parsonage , and entertain them with our best linen and silverware , and keep on getting friendlier and friendlier , and -- first thing you know , we like them fine ! It 's a perfectly splendid rule , and it has never failed us once . Try it , Miss Avery , do ! You will be enthusiastic about it , I know . " So the Misses Avery concluded that Prudence was very young , and could n't seem to quite outgrow it ! She was not entirely responsible . And they wondered , with something akin to an agony of fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Therefore the Misses Avery kept watch at their respective windows , and when Miss Alice cried excitedly , " Quick ! Quick ! They are coming ! " they trooped to Miss Alice 's window with a speed that would have done credit to the parsonage girls themselves . First came the minister , whom they knew very well by this time , and considered quite respectable . He was lively , as was to be expected of a Methodist minister , and told jokes , and laughed at them ! Now , a comical rector ,  - -  oh , a very different matter , it was n't done , that 's all ! At any rate , here came the Methodist minister , laughing , and on one side of him tripped a small earnest-looking maiden , clasping his hand , and gazing alternately up into his face , and down at the stylish cement sidewalk beneath her feet . On the other side , was Fairy . The Misses Avery knew the girls by name already , having talked much with Prudence . " Such a Fairy ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but wordlessly . For Fairy for very nearly as tall as her father , built upon generous lines , rather commanding in appearance , a little splendid-looking . Even from their windows they could discern something distinctly Juno-like in this sixteen-year-old girl , with the easy elastic stride that matched her father 's , and the graceful head , well carried . A young goddess ,  - -  named Fairy ! Behind them , laughing and chattering , like three children , as they were , came the twins with Prudence , each with an arm around her waist . And Prudence was very little taller than they . When they reached the fence that bordered the parsonage , the scene for a moment resembled a miniature riot . The smaller girls jumped and exclaimed , and clasped their hands . Fairy leaned over the fence , and stared intently at this , their parsonage home . Then the serious little girl scrambled under the fence , followed closely by the lithe-limbed twins . A pause , a very short one ,  - -  and then Prudence , too , was wriggling beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papa , " cried Fairy , " I 'm too fat . " And a second later she was running gracefully across the lawn toward the parsonage . The Methodist minister laughed boyishly , and placing his hands on the fence-post , he vaulted lightly over , and reached the house with his daughters . Then the Misses Avery , school-teachers , and elderly , looked at one another . " Did you ever ? " whispered the oldest Miss Avery , and the others slowly shook their heads . Now , think ! Did you ever see a rector jumping a three-wire fence , and running full speed across his front yard , in pursuit of a flying family ? It may possibly have occurred ,  - -  we have never seen it . Neither had the Misses Avery . Nor did they ever expect to . And if they had seen it , it is quite likely they would have joined the backsliders at that instant . But without wasting much time on this gruesome thought , they hurried to a window commanding the best view of the parsonage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched , and listened . There was plenty to hear ! From the parsonage windows came the sound of scampering feet and banging doors . Once there was the unmistakable clatter of a chair overturned . With it all , there was a constant chorus of " Oh , look ! " " Oh ! Oh ! " " Oh , how sweet ! " " Oh , papa ! " " Oh , Prudence ! " " Look , Larkie , look at this ! " Then the thud of many feet speeding down the stairs , and the slam of a door , and the slam of a gate . The whole parsonage-full had poured out into the back yard , and the barn-lot . Into the chicken coop they raced , the minister ever close upon their heels . Over the board fence they clambered to the big rambling barn , and the wide door swung closed after them . But in a few seconds they were out once more , by the back barn door , and over the fence , and on to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms recklessly around whoever was nearest , and made a thorough tour of the bit of pasture-land . For some moments they leaned upon the dividing fence and gazed admiringly into the rich orchard and vineyard of the Avery estate . But soon they were skipping back to the parsonage again , and the kitchen door banged behind them . Then the eldest Miss Avery closed the window overlooking the parsonage and confronted her sisters . " We must just make the best of it , " she said quietly . But next door , the gray old ugly parsonage was full to overflowing with satisfaction and happiness and love . The Starrs had never had an appointment like this before . They had just come from the village of Exminster , of five hundred inhabitants . There the Reverend Mr. Starr had filled the pulpits of three small Methodist churches , scattered at random throughout the country ,  - -  consideration , five hundred dollars . But here ,  - -  why , Mount Mark had a population of fully three thousand , and a business academy , and the Presbyterian College ,  - -  small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand and inspiring sound . And Mr. Starr had to fill only one pulpit ! It was heavenly , that 's what it was . To be sure , many of his people lived out in the country , necessitating the upkeep of a horse for the sake of his pastoral work , but that was only an advantage . Also to be sure , the Methodists in Mount Mark were in a minority , and an inferiority ,  - -  Mount Mark being a Presbyterian stronghold due to the homing there of the trim and orderly little college . But what of that ? The salary was six hundred and fifty dollars and the parsonage was adorable ! The parsonage family could see nothing at all wrong with the world that day , and the future was rainbow-tinted . Every one has experienced the ecstatic creepy sensation of sleeping in a brand-new home . The parsonage girls reveled in the memory of that first night for many days . " It may be haunted for all we know , " cried Carol deliciously . " Just think , Connie , there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting --  --  " " Carol ! " When the family gathered for worship on that first Sabbath morning , Mr. Starr said , as he turned the leaves of his well-worn Bible , " I think it would be well for you girls to help with the morning worship now . You need practise in praying aloud , and -- so we will begin to-day . Connie and I will make the prayers this morning , Prudence and Carol to-morrow , and Fairy and Lark the next day . We will keep that system up for a while , anyhow . When I finish reading the chapter , Connie , you will make the first prayer . Just pray for whatever you wish as you do at night for yourself . I will follow you . " Connie 's eyes were wide with responsibility during the reading of the chapter , but when she began to speak her voice did not falter . Connie had nine years of good Methodist experience back of her ! " Our Father , who art in Heaven , we bow ourselves before Thy footstool in humility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Saviour . Bless us this day , and cause Thy face to shine upon us . Blot out our transgressions , pardon our trespasses . Wash us , that we may be whiter than snow . Hide not Thy face from the eyes of Thy children , turn not upon us in wrath . Pity us , Lord , as we kneel here prostrate before Thy majesty and glory . Let the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts , be acceptable in Thy sight , O Lord , our strength and our Redeemer . And finally save us , an unbroken family around Thy throne in Heaven , for Jesus ' sake . Amen . " This was followed by an electric silence . Prudence was biting her lips painfully , and counting by tens as fast as she could . Fairy was mentally going over the prayer , sentence by sentence , and attributing each petition to the individual member in the old church at Exminster to whom it belonged . The twins were a little amazed , and quite proud . Connie was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they themselves should do not quite so well when their days came . But in less than a moment the minister-father began his prayer . His voice was a little subdued , and he prayed with less fervor and abandon than usual , but otherwise things went off quite nicely . When he said , " Amen , " Prudence was on her feet and half-way up-stairs before the others were fairly risen . Fairy stood gazing intently out of the window for a moment , and then went out to the barn to see if the horse was through eating . Mr. Starr walked gravely and soberly out the front door , and around the house . He ran into Fairy coming out the kitchen door , and they glanced quickly at each other . " Hurry , papa , " she whispered , " you ca n't hold in much longer ! Neither can I ! " And together , choking with laughter , they hurried into the barn and gave full vent to their feelings . So it was that the twins and Connie were alone for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connie , " said Carol approvingly . " Yes . I think I did myself , " was the complacent answer . " But I intended to put in , ' Keep us as the apple of Thy eye , hold us in the hollow of Thy hand , ' and I forgot it until I had said ' Amen . ' I had a notion to put in a post-script , but I believe that is n't done . " " Never mind , " said Carol , " I 'll use that in mine , to-morrow . " It can not be said that this form of family worship was a great success . The twins were invariably stereotyped , cut and dried . They thanked the Lord for the beautiful morning , for kind friends , for health , and family , and parsonage . Connie always prayed in sentences extracted from the prayers of others she had often heard , and every time with nearly disastrous effect . But the days passed around , and Prudence and Carol 's turn came again . Carol was a thoughtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nearly " verbal repetitions " as any prayers could be . So on this morning , after the reading of the chapter , Carol knelt by her chair , and began in her customary solemn voice : " Oh , our Father , we thank Thee for this beautiful morning . " Then intense silence . For Carol remembered with horror and shame that it was a dreary , dismal morning , cloudy , ugly and all unlovely . In her despair , the rest of her petition scattered to the four winds of heaven . She could n't think of another word , so she gulped , and stammered out a faint " Amen . " But Prudence could not begin . Prudence was red in the face , and nearly suffocated . She felt all swollen inside , she could n't speak . The silence continued . " Oh , why does n't father do it ? " she wondered . As a matter of fact , father could n't . But Prudence did not know that . One who laughs often gets in the habit of laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in . Finally , Prudence plunged in desperately , " Dear Father " as she usually began her sweet , intimate little talks with God ,  - -  and then she paused . Before her eyes flashed a picture of the " beautiful morning , " for which Carol had just been thankful ! She tried again . " Dear Father , "  - -  and then she whirled around on the floor , and laughed . Mr. Starr got up from his knees , sat down on his chair , and literally shook . Fairy rolled on the lounge , screaming with merriment . Even sober little Connie giggled and squealed . But Carol could not get up . She was disgraced . She had done a horrible , disgusting , idiotic thing . She had insulted God ! She could never face the family again . Her shoulders rose and fell convulsively . Lark did not laugh either . With a rush she was on her knees beside Carol , her arms around the heaving shoulders . " Do n't you care , Carrie , " she whispered . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't cry , Carrie . " But Carol would not be comforted . She tried to sneak unobserved from the room , but her father stopped her . " Do n't feel so badly about it , Carol , " he said kindly , really sorry for the stricken child ,  - -  though his eyes still twinkled , " it was just a mistake . But remember after this , my child , to speak to God when you pray . Remember that you are talking to Him . Then you will not make such a blunder.  - -  So many of us , " he said reflectively , " ministers as well as others , pray into the ears of the people , and forget we are talking to God . " After that , the morning worship went better . The prayers of the children changed ,  - -  became more personal , less flowery . They remembered from that time on , that when they knelt they were at the feet of God , and speaking direct to Him . It was the hated duty of the twins to wash and dry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was always given up to story-telling , for Lark had a strange and wonderful imagination , and Carol listened to her tales with wonder and delight . Even Connie found dish-doing hours irresistible , and could invariably be found , face in her hands , both elbows on the table , gazing with passionate earnestness at the young story-teller . Now , some of Lark 's stories were such weird and fearful things that they had seriously interfered with Connie 's slumbers , and Prudence had sternly prohibited them . But this evening , just as she opened the kitchen door , she heard Lark say in thrilling tones : " She crept down the stairs in the deep darkness , her hand sliding lightly over the rail . Suddenly she stopped . Her hand was arrested in its movement . Ice-cold fingers gripped hers tightly . Then with one piercing shriek , she plunged forward , and fell to the bottom of the stairs with a terrific crash , while a mocking laugh --  --  " The kitchen door slammed sharply behind Prudence as she stepped into the kitchen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lark 's unfortunate heroine . Even Carol started nervously , and let the plate she had been solemnly wiping for nine minutes , fall to the floor . Lark gasped , and then began sheepishly washing dishes as though her life depended on it . The water was cold , and little masses of grease clung to the edges of the pan and floated about on the surface of the water . " Get fresh hot water , Lark , and finish the dishes . Connie , go right up-stairs to bed . You twins can come in to me as soon as you finish . " But Connie was afraid to go to bed alone , and Prudence was obliged to accompany her . So it was in their own room that the twins finally faced an indignant Prudence . " Carol , you may go right straight to bed . And Lark -- I do not know what in the world to do with you . Why do n't you mind me , and do as I tell you ? How many times have I told you not to tell weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting , mild stories ? " " Prudence , as sure as you live , I ca n't ! I start them just as mild and proper as can be , but before I get half-way through , a murder , or death , or mystery crops in , and I ca n't help it . " " But you must help it , Lark . Or I shall forbid your telling stories of any kind . They are so silly , those wild things , and they make you all nervous , and excitable , and --  Now , think , Larkie , and tell me how I shall punish you . " Lark applied all the resources of her wonderful brain to this task , and presently suggested reluctantly : " Well , you might keep me home from the ice-cream social to-morrow night . " But her face was wistful . " No , " said Prudence decidedly , to Lark 's intense relief . " I ca n't do that . You 've been looking forward to it so long , and your class is to help with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would be too mean . Think of something else . " " Well , you might make me wash and dry the dishes all alone -- for a week , Prudence , and that will be a bad punishment , too , for I just despise washing dishes by myself . Telling stories makes it so much -- livelier . " " All right , then , " said Prudence , relieved in turn , " that is what I will do . And Carol and Connie must not even stay in the kitchen with you . " " I believe I 'll go to bed now , too , " said Lark , with a thoughtful glance at her two sisters , already curled up snugly and waiting for the conclusion of the administering of justice . " If you do n't mind , Prudence . " Prudence smiled a bit ruefully . " Oh , I suppose you might as well , if you like . But remember this , Lark : No more deaths , and murders , and mysteries , and highway robberies . " " All right , Prudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked slowly down-stairs she heard Lark starting in on her next story : " Once there was a handsome young man , named Archibald Tremaine ,  - -  a very respectable young fellow . He would n't so much as dream of robbing , or murdering , or dying . " Then Prudence smiled to herself in the dark and hurried down . The family had been in the new parsonage only three weeks , when a visiting minister called on them . It was about ten minutes before the luncheon hour at the time of his arrival . Mr. Starr was in the country , visiting , so the girls received him alone . It was an unfortunate day for the Starrs . Fairy had been at college all morning , and Prudence had been rummaging in the attic , getting it ready for a rainy-day and winter playroom for the younger girls . She was dusty , perspirey and tired . The luncheon hour arrived , and the girls came in from school , eager to be up and away again . Still the grave young minister sat discoursing upon serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust and perspiration , she was good to look upon . The Reverend Mr. Morgan realized that , and could not tear himself away . The twins came in , shook hands with him soberly , glancing significantly at the clock as they did so . Connie ran in excitedly , wanting to know what was the matter with everybody , and were n't they to have any luncheon ? Still Mr. Morgan remained in his chair , gazing at Prudence with frank appreciation . Finally Prudence sighed . " Do you like sweet corn , Mr. Morgan ? " This was entirely out of the line of their conversation , and for a moment he faltered . " Sweet corn ? " he repeated . " Yes , roasting-ears , you know ,  - -  cooked on the cob . " Then he smiled . " Oh , yes indeed . Very much , " he said . " Well , " she began her explanation rather drearily , " I was busy this morning and did not prepare much luncheon . We are very fond of sweet corn , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have for luncheon , sweet corn and butter . We have n't even bread , because I am going to bake this afternoon , and we never eat it with sweet corn , anyhow . Now , if you care to eat sweet corn and butter , and canned peaches , we 'd just love to have you stay for luncheon with us . " The Reverend Mr. Morgan was charmed , and said so . So Prudence rushed to the kitchen , opened the peaches in a hurry , and fished out a clean napkin for their guest . Then they gathered about the table , five girls and the visiting minister . It was really a curious sight , that table . In the center stood a tall vase of goldenrod . On either side of the vase was a great platter piled high with sweet corn , on the cob ! Around the table were six plates , with the necessary silverware , and a glass of water for each . There was also a small dish of peaches at each place , and an individual plate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Prudence made no apologies . She was a daughter of the parsonage ! She showed the Reverend Mr. Morgan to his place as graciously and sweetly as though she were ushering him in to a twenty-seven course banquet . " Will you return thanks , Mr. Morgan ? " she said . And the girls bowed their heads . The Reverend Mr. Morgan cleared his throat , and began , " Our Father , we thank Thee for this table . " There was more of the blessing , but the parsonage girls heard not one additional phrase ,  - -  except Connie , who followed him conscientiously through every word . By the time he had finished , Prudence and Fairy , and even Lark , had composed their faces . But Carol burst into merry laughter , close upon his reverent " Amen , "  - -  and after one awful glare at her sister , Prudence joined in . This gaiety communicated itself to the others and soon it was a rollicking group around the parsonage table . Mr. Morgan himself smiled uncertainly . He was puzzled . More , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breath , she gasped out an explanation . " You were just -- right , Mr. Morgan , to give thanks -- for the table ! There 's nothing -- on it -- to be thankful for ! " And the whole family went off once more into peals of laughter . Mr. Morgan had very little appetite that day . He did not seem to be so fond of sweet corn as he had assured Prudence . He talked very little , too . And as soon as possible he took his hat and walked hurriedly away . He did not call at the parsonage again . " Oh , Carol , " said Prudence reproachfully , wiping her eyes , " how could you start us all off like that ? " " For the table , for the table ! " shrieked Carol , and Prudence joined in perforce . " It was awful , " she gasped , " but it was funny ! I believe even father would have laughed . " A few weeks after this , Carol distinguished herself again , and to her lasting mortification . The parsonage pasture had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ministers , the outgoing incumbent having kept neither horse nor cow . As may be imagined , the little pasture had been taxed to the utmost , and when the new minister arrived , he found that his field afforded poor grazing for his pretty little Jersey . But a man living only six blocks from the parsonage had generously offered Mr. Starr free pasturage in his broad meadow , and the offer was gratefully accepted . This meant that every evening the twins must walk the six blocks after the cow , and every morning must take her back for the day 's grazing . One evening , as they were starting out from the meadow homeward with the docile animal , Carol stopped and gazed at Blinkie reflectively . " Lark , " she said , " I just believe to my soul that I could ride this cow . She 's so gentle , and I 'm such a good hand at sticking on . " " Carol ! " ejaculated Lark . " Think how it would look for a parsonage girl to go down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one to see , " protested Carol . And this was true . For the parsonage was near the edge of town , and the girls passed only five houses on their way home from the meadow ,  - -  and all of them were well back from the road . And Carol was , as she had claimed , a good hand at " sticking on . " She had ridden a great deal while they were at Exminster , a neighbor being well supplied with rideable horses , and she was passionately fond of the sport . To be sure , she had never ridden a cow , but she was sure it would be easy . Lark argued and pleaded , but Carol was firm . " I must try it , " she insisted , " and if it does n't go well I can slide off . You can lead her , Lark . " The obliging Lark boosted her sister up , and Carol nimbly scrambled into place , riding astride . " I 've got to ride this way , " she said ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other way . If I see any one coming , I 'll slide for it . " For a while all went well . Lark led Blinkie carefully , gazing about anxiously to see that no one approached . Carol gained confidence as they proceeded , and chatted with her sister nonchalantly , waving her hands about to show her perfect balance and lack of fear . So they advanced to within two blocks of the parsonage . " It 's very nice , " said Carol , " very nice indeed ,  - -  but her backbone is rather -- well , rather penetrating . I think I need a saddle . " By this time , Blinkie concluded that she was being imposed upon . She shook her head violently , and twitched the rope from Lark 's hand ,  - -  for Lark now shared her sister 's confidence , and held it loosely . With a little cry she tried to catch the end of it , but Blinkie was too quick for her . She gave a scornful toss of her dainty head , and struck out madly for home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cow 's neck , and hung on for dear life , while Lark , in terror , started out in pursuit . " Help ! Help ! " she cried loudly . " Papa ! Papa ! Papa ! " In this way , they turned in at the parsonage gate , which happily stood open ,  - -  otherwise Blinkie would undoubtedly have gone through , or over . As luck would have it , Mr. Starr was standing at the door with two men who had been calling on him , and hearing Lark 's frantic cries , they rushed to meet the wild procession , and had the unique experience of seeing a parsonage girl riding flat on her stomach on the neck of a galloping Jersey , with another parsonage girl in mad pursuit . Blinkie stopped beside the barn , and turned her head about inquiringly . Carol slid to the ground , and buried her face in her hands at sight of the two men with her father . Then with never a word , she lit out for the house at top speed . Seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been done , the three men sat down on the ground and burst into hearty laughter . Lark came upon them as they sat thus , and Lark was angry . She stamped her foot with a violence that must have hurt her . " I do n't see anything to laugh at , " she cried passionately , " it was awful , it was just awful ! Carrie might have been killed ! It -- it --  --  " " Tell us all about it , Lark , " gasped her father . And Lark did so , smiling a little herself , now that her fears were relieved . " Poor Carol , " she said , " she 'll never live down the humiliation . I must go and console her . " And a little later , the twins were weeping on each other 's shoulders . " I would n't have cared , " sobbed Carol , " if it had been anybody else in the world ! But -- the presiding elder ,  - -  and - -  the president of the Presbyterian College ! And I know the Presbyterians look down on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And riding a cow ! Oh , Larkie , if you love me , go down-stairs and get me the carbolic acid , so I can die and be out of disgrace . " This , however , Lark stoutly refused to do , and in a little while Carol felt much better . But she talked it over with Prudence very seriously . " I hope you understand , Prudence , that I shall never have anything more to do with Blinkie ! She can die of starvation for all I care . I 'll never take her to and from the pasture again . I could n't do it ! Such rank ingratitude as that cow displayed was never equaled , I am certain . " " I suppose you 'll quit using milk and cream , too , " suggested Prudence . " Oh , well , " said Carol more tolerantly , " I do n't want to be too hard on Blinkie , for after all it was partly my own fault . So I wo n't go that far . But I must draw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers ! " CHAPTER III THE LADIES ' AID " It 's perfectly disgusting , I admit , father , " said Prudence sweetly , " but you know yourself that it very seldom happens . And I am sure the kitchen is perfectly clean , and the soup is very nice indeed , if it is canned soup ! Twins , this is four slices of bread apiece for you ! You see , father , I really feel that this is a crisis in the life of the parsonage --  --  " " How long does a parsonage usually live ? " demanded Carol . " It would n't live long if the ministers had many twins , " said Fairy quickly . " Ouch ! " grinned Connie , plagiarizing , for that expressive word belonged exclusively to the twins , and it was double impertinence to apply it to one of its very possessors . " And you understand , do n't you , father , that if everything does not go just exactly right , I shall feel I am disgraced for life ? I know the Ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know they think it wicked and ridiculous to leave the raising of four bright spirits in the unworthy hands of a girl like me . I know they will all sniff and smile and -- Of course , twins , they have a perfect right to feel , and act , so . I am not complaining . But I want to show them for once in their lives that the parsonage runs smoothly and sweetly . If you would just stay at home with us , father , it would be a big help . You are such a tower of strength . " " But unfortunately I can not . People do not get married every day in the week , and when they are all ready for it they do not allow even Ladies ' Aids to stand in their way . It is a long drive , ten miles at least , and I must start at once . And it will likely be very late when I get back . But if you are all good , and help Prudence , and uphold the reputation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ,  - -  share and share alike . " This was met with such enthusiasm that he added hastily , " But wait ! It may be only a dollar ! " Then kissing the various members of the parsonage family , he went out the back door , barnward . " Now , " said Prudence briskly , " I want to make a bargain with you , girls . If you 'll stay clear away from the Ladies , and be very good and orderly , I 'll give you all the lemonade and cake you can drink afterward . " " Oh , Prudence , I 'm sure I ca n't drink much cake , " cried Carol tragically , " I just ca n't imagine myself doing it ! " " I mean , eat the cake , of course , " said Prudence , blushing . " And let us make taffy after supper ? " wheedled Carol . Prudence hesitated , and the three young faces hardened . Then Prudence relented and hastily agreed . " You wo n't need to appear at all , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though you were model children . " " Yes , " said Carol tartly , " the kind the members used to have ,  - -  which are all grown up , now ! And all moved out of Mount Mark , too ! " " Carol ! That sounds malicious , and malice is n't tolerated here for a minute . Now ,  - -  oh , Fairy , did you remember to dust the back of the dresser in our bedroom ? " " Mercy ! What in the world do you want the back of the dresser dusted for ? Do you expect the Ladies to look right through it ? " " No , but some one might drop something behind it , and it would have to be pulled out and they would all see it . This house has got to be absolutely spotless for once ,  - -  I am sure it will be the first time . " " And the last , I hope , " added Carol sepulchrally . " We have an hour and a half yet , " continued Prudence . " That will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Connie , you 'd better go right out in the field and play . I 'll call you a little before two , and then you must go quietly upstairs , and dress -- just wear your plain little ginghams , the clean ones of course ! Then if they do catch a glimpse of you , you will be presentable.  - -  Yes , you can take some bread and sugar , but hurry . " " You may take , " said Fairy . " Yes , of course , may take is what I mean.  - -  Now hurry . " Then Prudence and Fairy set to work again in good earnest . The house was already well cleaned . The sandwiches were made . But there were the last " rites , " and every detail must be religiously attended to . It must be remembered that the three main down-stairs rooms of the parsonage were connected by double doors ,  - -  double doors , you understand , not portieres ! The front room , seldom used by the parsonage family , opened on the right of the narrow hallway . Beyond it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parsonage girls only called " living-room " when they were on their Sunday behavior ,  - -  ordinarily it was the sitting-room , and a cheery , homey , attractive place it was , with a great bay window looking out upon the stately mansion of the Averys . To the left of the living-room was the dining-room . The double doors between them were always open . The other pair was closed , except on occasions of importance . Now , this really was a crisis in the life of the parsonage family , if not of the parsonage itself . The girls had met , separately , every member of the Ladies ' Aid . But this was their first combined movement upon the parsonage , and Prudence and Fairy realized that much depended on the success of the day . As girls , the whole Methodist church pronounced the young Starrs charming . But as parsonage people , well , they were obliged to reserve judgment . And as for Prudence having entire charge of the household , it must be acknowledged that every individual Lady looked forward to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the situation . They were coming to see for themselves ! Yes , it was undoubtedly a crisis . " There 'll be a crowd , of course , " said Fairy . " We 'll just leave the doors between the front rooms open . " " Yes , but we 'll close the dining-room doors . Then we 'll have the refreshments all out on the table , and when we are ready we 'll just fling back the doors carelessly and -- there you are ! " So the table was prettily decorated with flowers , and great plates of sandwiches and cake were placed upon it . In the center was an enormous punch-bowl , borrowed from the Averys , full of lemonade . Glasses were properly arranged on the trays , and piles of nicely home-laundered napkins were scattered here and there . The girls felt that the dining-room was a credit to them , and to the Methodist Church entire . From every nook and corner of the house they hunted out chairs and stools , anticipating a real run upon the parsonage . Nor were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrayed in their plain little ginghams , clean , before the first arrivals were ushered up into the front bedroom , ordinarily occupied by Prudence and Fairy . " There 's Mrs. Adams , and Mrs. Prentiss , and Mrs. --  --  , " began Connie , listening intently to the voices in the next room . " Yes , " whispered Carol , " peek through the keyhole , Lark , and see if Mrs. Prentiss is looking under the bed for dust . They say she --  --  " " You 'd better not let Prudence catch you repeating --  --  " " There 's Mrs. Stone , and Mrs. Davis , and --  --  " " They say Mrs. Davis only belongs to the Ladies ' Aid for the sake of the refreshments , and --  --  " " Carol ! Prudence will punish you . " " Well , I do n't believe it , " protested Carol . " I 'm just telling you what I 've heard other people say . " " We are n't allowed to repeat gossip , " urged Lark . " No , and I think it 's a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drake told me that Miss Varne joined the Methodist church as soon as she heard the new minister was a widower so she --  --  " " Carol ! " Carol whirled around sharply , and flushed , and swallowed hard . For Prudence was just behind her . " I -- I -- I --  " but she could get no further . Upon occasion , Prudence was quite terrible . " So I heard , " she said dryly , but her eyes were hard . " Now run down-stairs and out to the field , or to the barn , and play . And , Carol , be sure and remind me of that speech to-night . I might forget it . " The girls ran quickly out , Carol well in the lead . " No wedding fee for me , " she mumbled bitterly . " Do you suppose there can be seven devils in my tongue , Lark , like there are in the Bible ? " " I do n't remember there being seven devils in the Bible , " said Lark . " Oh , I mean the -- the possessed people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it means . Somehow I just ca n't help repeating --  --  " " You do n't want to , " said Lark , not without sympathy . " You think it 's such fun , you know . " " Well , anyhow , I 'm sure I wo n't get any wedding fee to-night . It seems to me Prudence is very -- harsh sometimes . " " You can appeal to father , if you like . " " Not on your life , " said Carol promptly and emphatically ; " he 's worse than Prudence . Like as not he 'd give me a good thrashing into the bargain . No ,  - -  I 'm strong for Prudence when it comes to punishment ,  - -  in preference to father , I mean . I ca n't seem to be fond of any kind of punishment from anybody . " For a while Carol was much depressed , but by nature she was a buoyant soul and her spirits were presently soaring again . In the meantime , the Ladies of the Aid Society continued to arrive . Prudence and Fairy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many merry words . It was not difficult for them , they had been reared in the hospitable atmosphere of Methodist parsonages , where , if you have but two dishes of oatmeal , the outsider is welcome to one . That is Carol 's description of parsonage life . But Prudence was concerned to observe that a big easy chair placed well back in a secluded corner , seemed to be giving dissatisfaction . It was Mrs. Adams who sat there first . She squirmed quite a little , and seemed to be gripping the arms of the chair with unnecessary fervor . Presently she stammered an excuse , and rising , went into the other room . After that , Mrs. Miller tried the corner chair , and soon moved away . Then Mrs. Jack , Mrs. Norey , and Mrs. Beed , in turn , sat there ,  - -  and did not stay . Prudence was quite agonized . Had the awful twins filled it with needles for the reception of the poor Ladies ? At first opportunity , she hurried into the secluded corner , intent upon trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she gasped , and clutched frantically at the arms of the chair . For she discovered at once to her dismay that the chair was bottomless , and that only by hanging on for her life could she keep from dropping through . She thought hard for a moment ,  - -  but thinking did not interfere with her grasp on the chair-arms ,  - -  and then she realized that the wisest thing would be to discuss it publicly . Anything would be better than leaving it unexplained , for the Ladies to comment upon privately . So up rose Prudence , conscientiously pulling after her the thin cushion which had concealed the chair 's shortcoming . " Look , Fairy ! " she cried . " Did you take the bottom out of this chair ?  - -  It must have been horribly uncomfortable for those who have sat there !  - -  However did it happen ? " Fairy was frankly amazed , and a little inclined to be amused . " Ask the twins , " she said tersely , " I know nothing about it . " At that moment , the luckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she , without seeing , because she had a peculiar skipping run that was quite characteristic and unmistakable . " Carol ! " she called . And Carol paused . " Carol ! " more imperatively . Then Carol slowly opened the door , she was a parsonage girl and rose to the occasion . She smiled winsomely ,  - -  Carol was nearly always winsome . " How do you do ? " she said brightly . " Is n't it a lovely day ? Did you call me , Prudence ? " " Yes . Do you know where the bottom of that chair has gone ? " " Why , no , Prudence -- gracious ! That chair !  - -  Why , I did n't know you were going to bring that chair in here -- Why ,  - -  oh , I am so sorry ! Why in the world did n't you tell us beforehand ? " Some of the Ladies smiled . Others lifted their brows and shoulders in a mildly suggestive way , that Prudence , after nineteen years in the parsonage , had learned to know and dread . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And why did you take it ? " " Why we wanted to make --  --  " " You and Lark ? " " Well , yes ,  - -  but it was really all my fault , you know . We wanted to make a seat up high in the peach tree , and we could n't find a board the right shape . So she discovered -- I mean , I did -- that by pulling out two tiny nails we could get the bottom off the chair , and it was just fine . It 's a perfectly adorable seat , " brightening , but sobering again as she realized the gravity of the occasion . " And we put the cushion in the chair so that it would n't be noticed . We never use that chair , you know , and we did n't think of your needing it to-day . We put it away back in the cold corner of the sitting -- er , living-room where no one ever sits . I 'm so sorry about it . " Carol was really quite crushed , but true to her parsonage training , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . But Prudence smiled at her kindly . " That was n't very naughty , Carol , " she said frankly . " It 's true that we seldom use that chair . And we ought to have looked . " She glanced reproachfully at Fairy . " It is strange that in dusting it , Fairy -- but never mind . You may go now , Carol . It is all right . " Then she apologized gently to the Ladies , and the conversation went on , but Prudence was uncomfortably conscious of keen and quizzical eyes turned her way . Evidently they thought she was too lenient . " Well , it was n't very naughty , " she thought wretchedly . " How can I pretend it was terribly bad , when I feel in my heart that it was n't ! " Before long , the meeting was called to order , and the secretary instructed to read the minutes . " Oh , " fluttered Miss Carr excitedly , " I forgot to bring the book . I have n't been secretary very long , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Adams tartly . " How do you expect to keep to-day 's minutes ? " demanded the president . " Oh , I am sure Miss Prudence will give me a pencil and paper , and I 'll copy them in the book as soon as ever I get home . " " Yes , indeed , " said Prudence . " There is a tablet on that table beside you , and pencils , too . I thought we might need them . " Then the president made a few remarks , but while she talked , Miss Carr was excitedly opening the tablet . Miss Carr was always excited , and always fluttering , and always giggling girlishly . Carol called her a sweet old simpering soul , and so she was . But now , right in the midst of the president 's serious remarks , she quite giggled out . The president stared at her in amazement . The Ladies looked up curiously . Miss Carr was bending low over the tablet , and laughing gaily to herself . " Oh , this is very cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , it is just real cunning . " Fairy sprang up , suddenly scarlet . " Oh , perhaps you have one of the twins ' books , and they 're always scribbling and --  --  " " No , it is yours , Fairy . I got it from among your school-books . " Fairy sank back , intensely mortified , and Miss Carr chirped brightly : " Oh , Fairy , dear , did you write this little poem ? How perfectly sweet ! And what a queer , sentimental little creature you are . I never dreamed you were so romantic . May n't I read it aloud ? " Fairy was speechless , but the Ladies , including the president , were impatiently waiting . So Miss Carr began reading in a sentimental , dreamy voice that must have been very fetching fifty years before . At the first suggestion of poetry , Prudence sat up with conscious pride ,  - -  Fairy was so clever ! But before Miss Carr had finished the second verse , she too was literally drowned in humiliation . " My love rode out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning light . My love rode out of the dim unknown , Into my heart to claim his own . My love rode out of the yesterday , Into the now ,  - -  and he came to stay . Oh , love that is rich , and pure , and true , The love in my heart leaps out to you . Oh , love , at last you have found your part ,  --  To come and dwell in my empty heart . " Miss Carr sat down , giggling delightedly , and the younger Ladies laughed , and the older Ladies smiled . But Mrs. Prentiss turned to Fairy gravely . " How old are you , my dear ? " And with a too-apparent effort , Fairy answered , " Sixteen ! " " Indeed ! " A simple word , but so suggestively uttered . " Shall we continue the meeting , Ladies ? " This aroused Prudence 's ire on her sister 's behalf , and she squared her shoulders defiantly . For a while , Fairy was utterly subdued . But thinking it over to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameful in a sixteen-year-old girl writing sentimental verses . Silly , to be sure ! But all sixteen-year-olds are silly . We love them for it ! And Fairy 's good nature and really good judgment came to her rescue , and she smiled at Prudence with her old serenity . The meeting progressed , and the business was presently disposed of . So far , things were not too seriously bad , and Prudence sighed in great relief . Then the Ladies took out their sewing , and began industriously working at many unmentionable articles , designed for the intimate clothing of a lot of young Methodists confined in an orphans ' home in Chicago . And they talked together pleasantly and gaily . And Prudence and Fairy felt that the cloud was lifted . But soon it settled again , dark and lowering . Prudence heard Lark running through the hall and her soul misgave her . Why was Lark going upstairs ? What was her errand ? And she remembered the wraps of the Ladies , up-stairs , alone and unprotected . Dare she trust Lark in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ladies ' Aid would arouse her better nature , and prevent catastrophe . To be sure , her mission might be innocent , but Prudence dared not run the risk . Fortunately she was sitting near the door . " Lark ! " she called softly . Lark stopped abruptly , and something fell to the floor . " Lark ! " There was a muttered exclamation from without , and Lark began fumbling rapidly around on the floor talking incoherently to herself . " Lark ! " The Ladies smiled , and Miss Carr , laughing lightly , said , " She is an attentive creature , is n't she ? " Prudence would gladly have flown out into the hall to settle this matter , but she realized that she was on exhibition . Had she done so , the Ladies would have set her down forever after as thoroughly incompetent , she could not go ! But Lark must come to her . " Lark ! " This was Prudence 's most awful voice , and Lark was bound to heed . " Oh , Prue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a minute . Ca n't you wait just five minutes ? Let me run up-stairs first , wo n't you ? Then I 'll come gladly ! Wo n't that do ? " Her voice was hopeful . But Prudence replied with dangerous calm : " Come at once , Lark . " " All right , then , " and added threateningly , " but you 'll wish I had n't . " Then Lark opened the door ,  - -  a woeful figure ! In one hand she carried an empty shoe box . And her face was streaked with good rich Iowa mud . Her clothes were plastered with it . One shoe was caked from the sole to the very top button , and a great gash in her stocking revealed a generous portion of round white leg . Poor Prudence ! At that moment , she would have exchanged the whole parsonage , bathroom , electric lights and all , for a tiny log cabin in the heart of a great forest where she and Lark might be alone together . And Fairy laughed . Prudence looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to the wretched girl . " What have you been doing , Lark ? " The heart-break expressed in the face of Lark would have made the angels weep . Beneath the smudges of mud on her cheeks she was pallid , and try as she would , she could not keep her chin from trembling ominously . Her eyes were fastened on the floor for the most part , but occasionally she raised them hurriedly , appealingly , to her sister 's face , and dropped them again . Not for worlds would she have faced the Ladies ! Prudence was obliged to repeat her question before Lark could articulate a reply . She gulped painfully a few times ,  - -  making meanwhile a desperate effort to hide the gash in one stocking by placing the other across it , rubbing it up and down in great embarrassment , and balancing herself with apparent difficulty . Her voice , when she was able to speak , was barely recognizable . " We -- we -- we are making -- mud images , Prudence . It -- it was awfully messy , I know , but -- they say -- it is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect -- the -- the Ladies to see us . " " Mud images ! " gasped Prudence , and even Fairy stared incredulously . " Where in the world did you get hold of an idea like that ? " " It -- it was in that -- that Mother 's Home Friend paper you take , Prudence . " Prudence blushed guiltily . " It -- it was modeling in clay , but -- we have n't any clay , and -- the mud is very nice , but -- Oh , I know I look just -- horrible . I -- I -- Connie pushed me in the -- puddle -- for fun . I -- I was vexed about it , Prudence , honestly . I -- I was chasing her , and I fell , and tore my stocking ,  - -  and - -  and - -  but , Prudence , the papers do say children ought to model , and we did n't think of -- getting caught . " Another appealing glance into her sister 's face , and Lark plunged on , bent on smoothing matters if she could . " Carol is -- is just fine at it , really . She -- she 's making a Venus de Milo , and it 's good . But we ca n't remember whether her arm is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous gulp , and by furious blinking Lark managed to crowd back the tears that would slip to the edge of her lashes . " I -- I 'm very sorry , Prudence . " " Very well , Lark , you may go . I do not really object to your modeling in mud , I am sure . I am sorry you look so disreputable . You must change your shoes and stockings at once , and then you can go on with your modeling . But there must be no more pushing and chasing . I 'll see Connie about that to-night . Now --  --  " " Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! What in the world is that ? " This was a chorus of several Ladies ' Aid voices ,  - -  a double quartette at the very least . Lark gave a sharp exclamation and began looking hurriedly about her on the floor . " It 's got in here ,  - -  just as I expected , " she exclaimed . " I said you would be sorry , Prue ,  - -  Oh , there it is under your chair , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the box again . " This was greeted with a fresh chorus of shrieks . There was a hurried and absolute vacation of that corner of the front room . The Ladies fled , dropping their cherished sewing , shoving one another in a most Unladies-Aid-like way . And there , beneath a chair , squatted the cause of the confusion , an innocent , unhappy , blinking toad ! " Oh , Larkie ! " This was a prolonged wail . " It 's all right , Prue , honestly it is , " urged Lark with pathetic solemnity . " We did n't do it for a joke . We 're keeping him for a good purpose . Connie found him in the garden ,  - -  and - -  Carol said we ought to keep him for Professor Duke ,  - -  he asked us to bring him things to cut up in science , you remember . So we just shoved him into this shoe box , and -- we thought we 'd keep him in the bath-tub until morning . We did it for a good purpose , do n't you see we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outraged , but even in that critical moment , justice insisted that Lark 's arguments were sound . The professor had certainly asked the scholars to bring him " things to cut up . " But a toad ! A live one !  - -  And the Ladies ' Aid ! Prudence shivered . " I am sure you meant well , Larkie , " she said in a low voice , striving hard to keep down the bitter resentment in her heart , " I know you did . But you should not have brought that -- that thing -- into the house . Pick him up at once , and take him out-of-doors and let him go . " But this was not readily done . In spite of her shame and deep dismay , Lark refused to touch the toad with her fingers . " I ca n't touch him , Prudence ,  - -  I simply ca n't , " she whimpered . " We shoved him in with the broom handle before . " And as no one else was willing to touch it , and as the Ladies clustered together in confusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other room , Prudence brought the broom and the not unwilling toad was helped to other quarters . " Now go , " said Prudence quickly , and Lark was swift to avail herself of the permission . Followed a quiet hour , and then the Ladies put aside their sewing and walked about the room , chatting in little groups . With a significant glance to Fairy , Prudence walked calmly to the double doors between the dining-room and the sitting-room . The eyes of the Ladies followed her with interest and even enthusiasm . They were hungry . Prudence slowly opened wide the doors , and -- stood amazed ! The Ladies clustered about her , and stood amazed also . The dining-room was there , and the table ! But the appearance of the place was vastly different ! The snowy cloth was draped artistically over a picture on the wall , the lowest edges well above the floor . The plates and trays , napkin-covered , were safely stowed away on the floor in distant corners . The kitchen scrub bucket had been brought in and turned upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed punch bowl , full to overflowing with fragrant lemonade . And at the table were three dirty , disheveled little figures , bending seriously over piles of mud . A not-unrecognizable Venus de Milo occupied the center of the table . Connie was painstakingly at work on some animal , a dog perhaps , or possibly an elephant . And --  --  The three young modelers looked up in exclamatory consternation as the doors opened . " Oh , are you ready ? " cried Carol . " How the time has flown ! We had no idea you 'd be ready so soon . Oh , we are sorry , Prudence . We intended to have everything fixed properly for you again . We needed a flat place for our modeling . It 's a shame , that 's what it is . Is n't that a handsome Venus ? I did that !  - -  If you 'll just shut the door one minute , Prudence , we 'll have everything exactly as you left it . And we 're as sorry as we can be . You can have my Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If you 'll just shut the door one minute , Prudence , we 'll have everything exactly as you left it . " Prudence silently closed the doors , and the Ladies , laughing significantly , drew away . " Do n't you think , my dear , " began Mrs. Prentiss too sweetly , " that they are a little more than you can manage ? Do n't you really think an older woman is needed ? " " I do not think so , " cried Fairy , before her sister could speak , " no older woman could be kinder , or sweeter , or more patient and helpful than Prue . " " Undoubtedly true ! But something more is needed , I am afraid ! It appears that girls are a little more disorderly than in my own young days ! Perhaps I do not judge advisedly , but it seems to me they are a little -- unmanageable . " " Indeed they are not , " cried Prudence loyally . " They are young , lively , mischievous , I know ,  - -  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ever since they were born , and I ought to know them . They are unselfish , they are sympathetic , they are always generous . They do foolish and irritating things ,  - -  but never things that are hateful and mean . They are all right at heart , and that is all that counts . They are not bad girls ! What have they done to-day ? They were exasperating , and humiliating , too , but what did they do that was really mean ? They embarrassed and mortified me , but not intentionally ! I ca n't punish them for the effect on me , you know ! Would that be just or fair ? At heart , they meant no harm . " It must be confessed that there were many serious faces among the Ladies . Some cheeks were flushed , some eyes were downcast , some lips were compressed and some were trembling . Every mother there was asking in her heart , " Did I punish my children just for the effect on me ? Did I judge my children by what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me ? " And the silence lasted so long that it became awkward . Finally Mrs. Prentiss crossed the room and stood by Prudence 's side . She laid a hand tenderly on the young girl 's arm , and said in a voice that was slightly tremulous : " I believe you are right , my dear . It is what girls are at heart that really counts . I believe your sisters are all you say they are . And one thing I am very sure of ,  - -  they are happy girls to have a sister so patient , and loving , and just . Not all real mothers have as much to their credit ! " CHAPTER IV A SECRET SOCIETY Carol and Lark , in keeping with their twin-ship , were the dearest of chums and comrades . They resembled each other closely in build , being of the same height and size . They were slender , yet gave a suggestion of sturdiness . Carol 's face was a delicately tinted oval , brightened by clear and sparkling eyes of blue . She was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends readily , and was always considered the " most popular girl in our crowd "  - -  whatever Carol 's crowd at the time might be . But she was not extremely clever , caring little for study , and with no especial talent in any direction . Lark was as nearly contrasting as any sister could be . Her face was pale , her eyes were dark brown and full of shadows , and she was a brilliant and earnest student . For each other the twins felt a passionate devotion that was very beautiful , but ludicrous as well . To them , the great rambling barn back of the parsonage was a most delightful place . It had a big cow-shed on one side , and horse stalls on the other , with a " heavenly " haymow over all , and with " chutes " for the descent of hay ,  - -  and twins ! In one corner was a high dark crib for corn , with an open window looking down into the horse stalls adjoining . When the crib was newly filled , the twins could clamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow window , and holding to the ledge of it with their hands , drop down into the nearest stall . To be sure they were likely to fall ,  - -  more likely than not ,  - -  and their hands were splinter-filled and their heads blue-bumped most of the time . But splinters and bumps did not interfere with their pursuit of pleasure . Now the twins had a Secret Society , of which they were the founders , the officers and the membership body . Its name was Skull and Crossbones . Why that name was chosen perhaps even the twins themselves could not explain , but it sounded deep , dark and bloody ,  - -  and so was the Society . Lark furnished the brain power for the organization but her sister was an enthusiastic and energetic second . Carol 's club name was Lady Gwendolyn , and Lark 's was Sir Alfred Angelcourt ordinarily , although subject to frequent change . Sometimes she was Lord Beveling , the villain of the plot , and chased poor Gwendolyn madly through corn-crib , horse stalls and haymow . Again she was the dark-browed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fierce lion lying in wait for the approaching damsel . The old barn saw stirring times after the coming of the new parsonage family . " Hark ! Hark ! " sounded a hissing whisper from the corn-crib , and Connie , eavesdropping outside the barn , shivered sympathetically . " What is it ! Oh , what is it ? " wailed the unfortunate lady . " Look ! Look ! Run for your life ! " Then while Connie clutched the barn door in a frenzy , there was a sound of rattling corn as the twins scrambled upward , a silence , a low thud , and an unromantic " Ouch ! " as Carol bumped her head and stumbled . " Are you assaulted ? " shouted the bold Sir Alfred , and Connie heard a wild scuffle as he rescued his companion from the clutches of the old halter on which she had stumbled . Up the haymow ladder they hurried , and then slid recklessly down the hay-chutes . Presently the barn door was flung open , and the " Society " knocked Connie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , and scurried under the fence and into the chicken coop . A little later , Connie , assailed with shots of corncobs , ran bitterly toward the house . " Peaking " was strictly forbidden when the twins were engaged in Skull and Crossbones activities . And Connie 's soul burned with desire . She felt that this secret society was threatening not only her happiness , but also her health , for she could not sleep for horrid dreams of Skulls and Crossbones at night , and could not eat for envying the twins their secret and mysterious joys . Therefore , with unwonted humility , she applied for entrance . She had applied many times previously , without effect . But this time she enforced her application with a nickel 's worth of red peppermint drops , bought for the very purpose . The twins accepted the drops gravely , and told Connie she must make formal application . Then they marched solemnly off to the barn with the peppermint drops , without offering Connie a share . This hurt , but she did not long grieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth they meant by " formal application . " Finally she applied to Prudence , and received assistance . The afternoon mail brought to the parsonage an envelope addressed to " Misses Carol and Lark Starr , The Methodist Parsonage , Mount Mark , Iowa , " and in the lower left-hand corner was a suggestive drawing of a Skull and Crossbones . The eyes of the mischievous twins twinkled with delight when they saw it , and they carried it to the barn for prompt perusal . It read as follows : " Miss Constance Starr humbly and respectfully craves admittance into the Ancient and Honorable Organization of Skull and Crossbones . " The twins pondered long on a fitting reply , and the next afternoon the postman brought a letter for Connie , waiting impatiently for it . She had approached the twins about it at noon that day . " Did you get my application ? " she had whispered nervously . But the twins had stared her out of countenance , and Connie realized that she had committed a serious breach of secret society etiquette . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened it . It was decorated lavishly with skulls and crossbones , splashed with red ink , supposedly blood , and written in the same suggestive color . " Skull and Crossbones has heard the plea of Miss Constance Starr . If she present herself at the Parsonage Haymow this evening , at eight o'clock , she shall learn the will of the Society regarding her petition . " Connie was jubilant ! In a flash , she saw herself admitted to the mysterious Barnyard Order , and began working out a name for her own designation after entrance . It was a proud day for her . By the time the twins had finished washing the supper dishes , it was dark . Constance glanced out of the window apprehensively . She now remembered that eight o'clock was very , very late , and that the barn was a long way from the house ! And up in the haymow , too ! And such a mysterious bloody society ! Her heart quaked within her . So she approached the twins respectfully , and said in an offhand way : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me know when you 're ready , and I 'll go right along with you . " But the twins stared at her again in an amazing and overbearing fashion , and vouchsafed no reply . Connie , however , determined to keep a watchful eye upon them , and when they started barnward , she would trail closely along in their rear . It was a quarter to eight , and fearfully dark , when she suddenly remembered that they had been up-stairs an unnaturally long time . She rushed up in a panic . They were not there . She ran through the house . They were not to be found . The dreadful truth overwhelmed her ,  - -  the twins were already in the haymow , the hour had come , and she must go forth . Breathlessly , she slipped out of the back door , and closed it softly behind her . She could not distinguish the dark outlines of the barn in the equal darkness of the autumn night . She gave a long sobbing gasp as she groped her way forward . As she neared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haymow over her head , deep groans as of a soul in mortal agony . Something had happened to the twins ! " Girls ! Girls ! " she cried , forgetting for the moment her own sorry state . " What is the matter ? Twins ! " Sepulchral silence ! And Connie knew that this was the dreadful Skull and Bones . Her teeth chattered as she stood there , irresolute in the intense and throbbing darkness . " It 's only the twins , " she assured herself over and over , and began fumbling with the latch of the barn door ,  - -  but her fingers were stiff and cold . Suddenly from directly above her , there came the hideous clanking of iron chains . Connie had read ghost stories , and she knew the significance of clanking chains , but she stood her ground in spite of the almost irresistible impulse to fly . After the clanking , the loud and clamorous peal of a bell rang out . " It 's that old cow bell they found in the field , " she whispered practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stepped into the blackness of the barn , found the ladder leading to the haymow and began slowly climbing . But her own weight seemed a tremendous thing , and she had difficulty in raising herself from step to step . She comforted herself with the reflection that at the top were the twins ,  - -  company and triumph hand in hand . But when she reached the top , and peered around her , she found little comfort ,  - -  and no desirable company ? A small barrel draped in black stood in the center of the mow , and on it a lighted candle gave out a feeble flickering ray which emphasized the darkness around it . On either side of the black-draped barrel stood a motionless figure , clothed in somber black . On the head of one was a skull , not a really skull , just a pasteboard imitation , but it was just as awful to Connie . On the head of the other were crossbones . " Kneel , " commanded the hoarse voice of Skull , in which Connie could faintly distinguish the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hear the will of Skull and Crossbones , " chanted Crossbones in a shrill monotone . Then Skull took up the strain once more . " Skull and Crossbones , great in mercy and in condescension , has listened graciously to the prayer of Constance , the Seeker . Hear the will of the Great Spirit ! If the Seeker will , for the length of two weeks , submit herself to the will of Skull and Crossbones , she shall be admitted into the Ancient and Honorable Order . If the Seeker accepts this condition , she must bow herself to the ground three times , in token of submission . " " There 's no ground here , " came a small faint voice from the kneeling Seeker . " The floor , madam , " Skull explained sternly . " If the Seeker accepts the condition , to submit herself absolutely to the will of Skull and Crossbones for two entire weeks , she shall bow herself three times . " Constance hesitated . It was so grandly expressed that she hardly understood what they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got to do everything Lark and I tell you for two weeks , " she said in her natural voice . Then Constance bowed herself three times ,  - -  although she lost her balance in the act , and Carol forgot her dignity and gave way to laughter , swiftly subdued , however . " Arise and approach the altar , " she commanded in the shrill voice , which yet gave signs of laughter . Constance arose and approached . " Upon the altar , before the Eternal Light , you will find a small black bow , with a drop of human blood in the center . This is the badge of your pledgedom . You must wear it day and night , during the entire two weeks . After that , if all is well ; you shall be received into full membership . If you break your pledge to the Order , it must be restored at once to Skull and Crossbones . Take it , and pin it upon your breast . " Constance did so ,  - -  and her breast heaved with rapture and awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame of the " Eternal Light " was suddenly extinguished , and Carol exclaimed , " The ceremony is ended . Return , damsel , to thine abode . " A sound of scampering feet ,  - -  and Constance knew that the Grand Officials had fled , and she was alone in the dreadful darkness . She called after them pitifully , but she heard the slam of the kitchen door before she had even reached the ladder . It was a sobbing and miserable neophyte who stumbled into the kitchen a few seconds later . The twins were bending earnestly over their Latin grammars by the side of the kitchen fire , and did not raise their eyes as the Seeker burst into the room . Constance sat down , and gasped and quivered for a while . Then she looked down complacently at the little black bow with its smudge of red ink , and sighed contentedly . The week that followed was a gala one for the twins of Skull and Crossbones . Constance swept their room , made their bed , washed their dishes , did their chores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ancient and Honorable . The twins were gracious but firm . There was no arguing , and no faltering . " It is the will of Skull and Crossbones that the damsel do this , " they would say . And the damsel did it . Prudence did not feel it was a case that called for her interference . So she sat back and watched , while the twins told stories , read and frolicked , and Constance did their daily tasks . So eight days passed , and then came Waterloo . Constance returned home after an errand downtown , and in her hand she carried a great golden pear . Perhaps Constance would have preferred that she escape the notice of the twins on this occasion , but as luck would have it , she passed Carol in the hall . " Gracious ! What a pear ! Where did you get it ? " demanded Carol covetously . " I met Mr. Arnold down-town , and he bought it for me . He 's very fond of me . It cost him a dime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beauty ? " And Connie licked her lips suggestively . Carol licked hers , too , thoughtfully . Then she called up the stairs , " Lark , come here , quick ! " Lark did so , and duly exclaimed and admired . Then she said significantly , " I suppose you are going to divide with us ? " " Of course , " said Connie with some indignation . " I 'm going to cut it in five pieces so Prudence and Fairy can have some , too . " A pause , while Carol and Lark gazed at each other soberly . Mentally , each twin was figuring how big her share would be when the pear was divided in fives . Then Lark spoke . " It is the will of Skull and Crossbones that this luscious fruit be turned over to them immediately . " Constance faltered , held it out , drew it back . " If I do , I suppose you 'll give me part of it , anyhow , " she said , and her eyes glittered . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ancient and Honorable takes , it never gives . " For a moment Constance wavered . Then she flamed into sudden anger . " I wo n't do it , so there ! " she cried . " I think you 're mean selfish pigs , that 's what I think ! Taking my very own pear , and -- but you wo n't get it ! I do n't care if I never get into your silly old society , you do n't get a bite of this pear , I can tell you that ! " And Constance rushed up-stairs and slammed a door . A few seconds later the door opened again , and her cherished badge was flung down upon Skull and Crossbones . " There 's your old black string smeared up with red ink ! " she yelled at them wildly . And again the door slammed . Carol picked up the insulted badge , and studied it thoughtfully . Lark spoke first . " It occurs to me , Fair Gwendolyn , that we would do well to keep this little scene from the ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as always , Brave Knight , " was the womanly retort . And the twins betook themselves to the haymow in thoughtful mood . A little later , when Prudence and Fairy came laughing into the down-stairs hall , a white-faced Constance met them . " Look , " she said , holding out a pear , divided into three parts , just like Gaul . " Mr. Arnold gave me this pear , and here 's a piece for each of you . " The girls thanked her warmly , but Prudence paused with her third almost touching her lips . " How about the twins ? " she inquired . " Are n't they at home ? Wo n't they break your pledge if you leave them out ? " Constance looked up sternly . " I offered them some half an hour ago , and they refused it , " she said . " And they have already put me out of the society ! " There was tragedy in the childish face , and Prudence put her arms around this baby-sister . " Tell Prue all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constance shook her head . " It ca n't be talked about . Go on and eat your pear . It is good . " " Was it all right ? " questioned Prudence . " Did the twins play fair , Connie ? " " Yes , " said Constance . " It was all right . Do n't talk about it . " But in two days Constance repented of her rashness . In three days she was pleading for forgiveness . And in four days she was starting in on another two weeks of pledgedom , and the desecrated ribbon with its drop of blood reposed once more on her ambitious breast . For three days her service was sore indeed , for the twins informed her , with sympathy , that she must be punished for insubordination . " But after that , we 'll be just as easy on you as anything , Connie , " they told her . " So do n't you get sore now . In three days , we 'll let up on you . " A week passed , ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon when the twins sat in the haymow looking out upon a mellow world . Constance was in the yard , reading a fairy story . The situation was a tense one , for the twins were hungry , and time was heavy on their hands . " The apple trees in Avery 's orchard are just loaded , " said Lark aimlessly . " And there are lots on the ground , too . I saw them when I was out in the field this morning . " " Some of the trees are close to our fence , too , " said Carol slowly . " Very close . " Lark glanced up with sudden interest . " That 's so , " she said . " And the wires on the fence are awfully loose . " Carol gazed down into the yard where Constance was absorbed in her book . " Constance ought n't to read as much as she does , " she argued . " It 's so bad for the eyes . " " Yes , and what 's more , she 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time is nearly up . " " That 's so , " said Lark . " Let 's call her up here . " This was done at once , and the unfortunate Constance walked reluctantly toward the barn , her fascinating story still in her hand . " You see , they 've got more apples than they need , and those on the ground are just going to waste , " continued Carol , pending the arrival of the little pledge . " The chickens are pecking at them , and ruining them . " " It 's criminal destruction , that 's what it is , " declared Lark . Connie stood before them respectfully , as they had instructed her to stand . The twins hesitated , each secretly hoping the other would voice the order . But Lark as usual was obliged to be the spokesman . " Damsel , " she said , " it is the will of Skull and Crossbones that you his ye to yonder orchard ,  - -  Avery 's , I mean ,  - -  and bring hither some of the golden apples basking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connie , startled out of her respect . Carol frowned . Connie hastened to modify her tone . " Did they say you might have them ? " she inquired politely . " That concerns thee not , ' t is for thee only to render obedience to the orders of the Society . Go out through our field and sneak under the fence where the wires are loose , and hurry back . We 're awfully hungry . The trees are near the fence . There is n't any danger . " " But it 's stealing , " objected Connie . " What will Prudence --  --  " " Damsel ! " And Connie turned to obey with despair in her heart . " Bring twelve , " Carol called after her , " that 'll be four apiece . And hurry , Connie . And see they do n't catch you while you 're about it . " After she had gone , the twins lay back thoughtfully on the hay and stared at the cobwebby roof above them . " It 's a good thing Prudence and Fairy are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or we 'd catch it , " assented Carol . " But I do n't see why ! The Averys have too many apples , and they are going to waste . I 'm sure Mrs. Avery would rather let us have them than the chickens . " They lay in silence for a while . Something was hurting them , but whether it was their fear of the wrath of Prudence , or the twinges of tender consciences ,  - -  who can say ? " She 's an unearthly long time about it , " exclaimed Lark , at last . " Do you suppose they caught her ? " This was an awful thought , and the girls were temporarily suffocated . But they heard the barn door swinging beneath them , and sighed with relief . It was Connie ! She climbed the ladder skilfully , and poured her golden treasure before the arch thieves , Skull and Crossbones . There were eight big tempting apples . " Hum ! Eight , " said Carol sternly . " I said twelve . " " Yes , but I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise through the grapevines , so I got what I could and ran for it . There 's three apiece for you , and two for me , " said Connie , sitting down sociably beside them on the hay . But Carol rose . " Damsel , begone , " she ordered . " When Skull and Crossbones feast , thou canst not yet share the festive board . Rise thee , and speed . " Connie rose , and walked soberly toward the ladder . But before she disappeared she fired this parting shot , " I do n't want any of them . Stolen apples do n't taste very good , I reckon . " Carol and Lark had the grace to flush a little at this , but however the stolen apples tasted , the twins had no difficulty in disposing of them . Then , full almost beyond the point of comfort , they slid down the hay-chutes , went out the back way , climbed over the chicken coops , not because it was necessary , but because it was their idea of amusement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farthest corner of the field they crawled under the fence , cut through a neighboring potato patch , and came out on the street . Then they walked respectably down the sidewalk , turned the corner and came quietly in through the front door of the parsonage . Prudence was in the kitchen preparing the evening meal . Fairy was in the sitting-room , busy with her books . The twins set the table conscientiously , filled the wood-box , and in every way labored irreproachably . But Prudence had no word of praise for them that evening . She hardly seemed to know they were about the place . She went about her work with a pale face , and never a smile to be seen . Supper was nearly ready when Connie sauntered in from the barn . After leaving the haymow , she had found a cozy corner in the com-crib , with two heavy lap robes discarded by the twins in their flight from wolves , and had settled down there to finish her story . As she stepped into the kitchen , Prudence turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was frightened . " Are you sick , Prue ? " she gasped . Prudence did not answer . She went to the door and called Fairy . " Finish getting supper , will you , Fairy ? And when you are all ready , you and the twins go right on eating . Do n't wait for father ,  - -  he is n't coming home until evening . Come up-stairs with me , Connie ; I want to talk to you . " Connie followed her sister soberly , and the twins flashed at each other startled and questioning looks . The three girls were at the table when Prudence came into the dining-room alone . She fixed a tray-supper quietly and carried it off up-stairs . Then she came back and sat down by the table . But her face bore marks of tears , and she had no appetite . The twins had felt small liking for their food before , now each mouthful seemed to choke them . But they dared not ask a question . They were devoutly thankful when Fairy finally voiced their interest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's worse than that , " faltered Prudence , tears rushing to her eyes again . " Why , Prudence ! What in the world has she done ? " " I may as well tell you , I suppose , you 'll have to know it sooner or later . She -- went out into Avery 's orchard and stole some apples this afternoon . I was back in the alley seeing if Mrs. Moon could do the washing , and I saw her from the other side . She went from tree to tree , and when she got through the fence she ran . There 's no mistake about it , she confessed . " The twins looked up in agony , but Prudence 's face reassured them . Constance had told no tales . " I have told her she must spend all of her time up-stairs alone for a week , taking her meals there , too . She will go to school , of course , but that is all . I want her to see the awfulness of it . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thief -- just yet ! I said we must get used to the idea of it first . She is heartbroken , but -- I must make her see it ! " That was the end of supper . No one attempted to eat another bite . After the older girls had gone into the sitting-room , Carol and Lark went about their work with stricken faces . " She 's a little brick not to tell , " whispered Lark . " I 'm going to give her that pearl pin of mine she always liked , " said Carol in a hushed voice . " I 'll give her my blue ribbon , too , she loves blue so . And to-morrow I 'll take that quarter I 've saved and buy her a whole quarter 's worth of candy . " But that night when the twins went up to bed , they were doomed to disappointment . They had no chance of making it up with Constance . For Prudence had moved her small bed out of the twins ' room , and had placed it in the front room occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to Constance , but Prudence went in with them to say good night to her . The twins broke down and cried as they saw the pitiful little figure with the wan and tear-stained face . They threw their arms around her passionately and kissed her many times . But they went to bed without saying anything . Hours later , Lark whispered , " Carol ! are you asleep ? " " No . I ca n't go to sleep somehow . " " Neither can I. Do you think we 'd better tell Prudence all about it ? " Carol squirmed in the bed . " I -- suppose we had , " she said reluctantly . " But -- it 'll be lots worse for us than for Connie , " Lark added . " We 're so much older , and we made her do it . " " Yes , and we ate all the apples , " mourned Carol . " Maybe we 'd better just let it go , " suggested Lark . " And we 'll make it up to Connie afterwards , " said Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away , Carol . " " You see that you do n't . " But it was a sorry night for the twins . The next morning they set off to school , with no chance for anything but a brief good morning with Connie ,  - -  given in the presence of Prudence . Half-way down the parsonage walk , Carol said : " Oh , wait a minute , Lark . I left my note-book on the table . " And Lark walked slowly while Carol went rushing back . She found Prudence in the kitchen , and whispered : " Here -- here 's a note , Prudence . Do n't read it until after I 've gone to school ,  - -  at ten o'clock you may read it . Will you promise ? " Prudence laughed a little , but she promised , and laid the note carefully away to wait the appointed hour for its perusal . As the clock struck ten she went to the mantle , and took it down . This is what Carol had written : " Oh , Prudence , do please forgive me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punish me any way you like , and I 'll be glad of it . It was all my fault . I made her go and get the apples for me , and I ate them . Connie did n't eat one of them . She said stolen apples would not taste very good . It was all my fault , and I 'm so sorry . I was such a coward I did n't dare tell you last night . Will you forgive me ? But you must punish me as hard as ever you can . But please , Prudence , wo n't you punish me some way without letting Lark know about it ? Please , please , Prudence , do n't let Larkie know . You can tell Papa and Fairy so they will despise me , but keep it from my twin . If you love me , Prudence , do n't let Larkie know . " As Prudence read this her face grew very stern . Carol 's fault ! And she was ashamed to have her much-loved twin know of her disgrace . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , and thrust the note hastily into her dress . It was Lark , and she flung herself wildly upon Prudence , sobbing bitterly . " What is the matter , Lark ? " she tried , really frightened . " Are you sick ? " " Heartsick , that 's all , " wailed Lark . " I told the teacher I was sick so I could come home , but I 'm not . Oh , Prudence , I know you 'll despise and abominate me all the rest of your life , and everybody will , and I deserve it . For I stole those apples myself . That is , I made Connie go and get them for me . She did n't want to . She begged not to . But I made her . She did n't eat one of them ,  - -  I did it . And she felt very badly about it . Oh , Prudence , you can do anything in the world to me ,  - -  I do n't care how horrible it is ; I only hope you will . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you ? Oh , spare me that , Prudence , please . That 's my last request , that you keep it from Carol . " Prudence was surprised and puzzled . She drew the note from her pocket , and gave it to Lark . " Carol gave me that before she went to school , " she explained . " Read it , and tell me what you are driving at . I think you are both crazy . Or maybe you are just trying to shield poor Connie . " Lark read Carol 's note , and gasped , and -- burst out laughing ! The shame , and bitter weeping , and nervousness , had rendered her hysterical , and now she laughed and cried until Prudence was alarmed again . In time , however , Lark was able to explain . " We both did it , " she gasped , " the Skull and Crossbones . And we both told the truth about it . We made her go and get them for us , and we ate them , and she did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she advised me not to . All the way to school this morning , we kept advising each other not to say a word about it . But I intended all the time to pretend I was sick , so I could come and confess alone . I wanted to take the punishment for both of us , so Carol could get out . I guess that 's what she thought , too . Bless her little old heart , as if I 'd let her he punished for my fault . And it was mostly my fault , too , Prue , for I mentioned the apples first of all . " Prudence laughed , it was really ludicrous . But when she thought of loyal little Connie , sobbing all through the long night , the tears came to her eyes again . She went quickly to the telephone , and called up the school building next door to the parsonage . " May I speak to Constance Starr , Mr. Imes ? " she asked . " It is very important . This is Prudence , her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried , " Oh , you blessed little child , why did n't you tell me ? Will you forgive me , Connie ? I ought to have made you tell me all about it , but I was so sorry , I could n't bear to talk much about it . The twins have told me . You 're a dear , sweet , good little darling , that 's what you are . " " Oh , Prudence ! " That was all Connie said , but something in her voice made Prudence hang up the receiver quickly , and cry bitterly ! That noon Prudence pronounced judgment on the sinners , but her eyes twinkled , for Carol and Lark had scolded each other roundly for giving things away ! " Connie should have refused to obey you , " she said gently , holding Connie in her arms . " She knew it was wrong . But she has been punished more than enough . But you twins ! In the first place , I right now abolish the Skull and Crossbones forever and ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . And you must go over to the Averys this afternoon , and tell them about it , and pay for the apples . And you must send all of your spending money for the next month to that woman who is gathering up things for the bad little children in the Reform School ,  - -  that will help you remember what happens to boys and girls who get in the habit of taking things on the spur of the moment ! " The twins accepted all of this graciously , except that which referred to confessing their sin to their neighbors . That did hurt ! The twins were so superior , and admirable ! They could n't bear to ruin their reputations . But Prudence stood firm , in spite of their weeping and wailing . And that afternoon two shamefaced sorry girls crept meekly in at the Averys ' door to make their peace . " But about the Skull and Crossbones , it 's mostly punishment for me , Prue , " said Connie regretfully , " for the twins have been in it ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at all ! And I wanted them to call me Lady Magdalina Featheringale . " And Connie sighed . CHAPTER V THE TWINS STICK UP FOR THE BIBLE Prudence had been calling on a " sick member . " Whenever circumstances permitted she gladly served as pastoral assistant for her father , but she always felt that raising the family was her one big job , and nothing was allowed to take precedence of it . As she walked that afternoon down Maple Street ,  - -  seemingly so-called because it was bordered with grand old elms , she felt at peace with all the world . The very sunshine beaming down upon her through the huge skeletons of the leafless elms , was not more care-free than the daughter of the parsonage . Parsonage life had been running smoothly for as much as ten days past , and Prudence , in view of that ten days ' immunity , was beginning to feel that the twins , if not Connie also , were practically reared ! " Mount Mark is a dear old place ,  - -  a duck of a place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry there 's a five-year limit for Methodist preachers . I should truly like to live right here until I am old and dead . " Then she paused , and bowed , and smiled . She did not recognize the bright-faced young woman approaching , but she remembered just in time that parsonage people are marked characters . So she greeted the stranger cordially . " You are Miss Starr , are n't you ? " the bright-faced woman was saying . " I am Miss Allen ,  - -  the principal of the high school , you know . " " Oh , yes , " cried Prudence , thrusting forth her hand impulsively , " oh , yes , I know . I am so glad to meet you . " Miss Allen was a young woman of twenty-six , with clear kind eyes and a strong sweet mouth . She had about her that charm of manner which can only be described as winsome womanliness . Prudence gazed at her with open and honest admiration . Such a young woman to be the principal of a high school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tremendously clever . But Prudence did not sigh . We ca n't all be clever , you know . There must be some of us to admire the rest of us ! The two walked along together , chatting sociably on subjects that meant nothing to either of them . Presently Miss Allen stopped , and with a graceful wave of her hand , said lightly : " This is where I am rooming . Are you in a very great hurry this afternoon ? I should like to talk to you about the twins . Will you come in ? " The spirits of Prudence fell earthward with a clatter ! The twins ! Whatever had they been doing now ? She followed Miss Allen into the house and up the stairs with the joy quite quenched in her heart . She did not notice the dainty room into which she was conducted . She ignored the offered chair , and with a dismal face turned toward Miss Allen . " Oh , please ! What have they been doing ? Is it very awful ? " Miss Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look so distressed . It 's nothing at all . They have n't been doing anything . I just want to discuss them on general principles , you know . It 's my duty to confer with the parents and guardians of my scholars . " Immensely relieved , Prudence sank down in the chair , and rocked comfortably to and fro a few times . General principles , ah , blessed words ! " I suppose you know that Carol is quite the idol of the high school already . She is the adored one of the place . You see , she is not mixed up in any scholastic rivalry . Lark is one of the very best in her class , and there is intense rivalry between a few of the freshmen . But Carol is out of all that , and every one is free to worship at her shrine . She makes no pretensions to stand first . " " Is she very stupid ? " Prudence was disappointed . She did so want both of her twins to shine . " Stupid ! Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar , much better than the average . Our first pupils , including Lark , average around ninety-six and seven . Then there are others ranging between ninety and ninety-four . Carol is one of them . The fairly good ones are over eighty-five , and the fairly bad ones are over seventy-five , and the hopeless ones are below that . This is a rough way of showing how they stand . Lark is a very fine scholar , really the best in the class . She not only makes good grades , she grasps the underlying significance of her studies . Very few freshmen , even among the best , do that . She is quite exceptional . We hope to make something very big and fine of Larkie . " Prudence 's eyes shone with motherly pride . She nodded , striving to make her voice natural and matter-of-fact as she answered , " Yes , she is bright . " " She certainly is ! Carol is quite different , but she is so sweet-spirited , and vivacious , and -- un-snobbish , if you know what that means -- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , idolize her . She is very witty , but her wit is always innocent and kind . She never hurts any one 's feelings . And she is never impertinent . The professors are as crazy about her as the scholars , forgive the slang . Did the twins ever tell you what happened the first day of school ? " " No ,  - -  tell me . " Prudence was clearly very anxious . " I shall never forget it . The freshmen were sent into the recitation room to confer with Professor Duke about text-books , etc . Carol was one of the first in the line , as they came out . She sat down in her seat in the first aisle , with one foot out at the side . One of the boys tripped over it . ' Carol , ' said Miss Adams gently , ' you forgot yourself , did n't you ? ' And Carol 's eyes twinkled as she said , ' Oh , no , Miss Adams , if I had I 'd still be in the recitation room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were agonized . " How hateful of her ! " " Do n't the twins tell you little things that happen at school ,  - -  like that , for instance ? " " Never ! I supposed they were perfectly all right . " " Well , here 's another . Twice a week we have talks on First Aid to the Injured . Professor Duke conducts them . One day he asked Carol what she would do if she had a very severe cold , and Carol said , ' I 'd soak my feet in hot water and go to bed . My sister makes me . ' " Miss Allen laughed again , but Prudence was speechless . " Sometimes we have talks on normal work , practical informal discussions . Many of our scholars will be country school-teachers , you know . Miss Adams conducts these normal hours . One day she asked Carol what she would do if she had applied for a school , and was asked by the directors to write a thesis on student discipline , that they might judge of her and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Lark to write it for me . ' " Even Prudence laughed a little at this , but she said , " Why do n't you scold her ? " " We talked it all over shortly after she entered school . Miss Adams did not understand Carol at first , and thought she was a little impertinent . But Professor Duke and I stood firm against even mentioning it to her . She is perfectly good-natured about it . You know , of course , Miss Starr , that we really try to make individuals of our scholars . So many , many hundreds are turned out of the public schools all cut on one pattern . We do not like it . We fight against it . Carol is different from others by nature , and we 're going to keep her different if possible . If we crush her individuality , she will come out just like thousands of others ,  - -  all one pattern ! Miss Adams is as fond of Carol now as any one of us . You understand that we could not let impudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . She is always respectful and courteous . But she is spontaneous and quick-witted , and we are glad of it . Do you know what the scholars call Professor Duke ? " " Professor Duck , " said Prudence humbly . " But they mean it for a compliment . They really admire and like him very much . I hope he does not know what they call him . " " He does ! One day he was talking about the nobility system in England . He explained the difference between dukes , and earls , and lords , etc. , and told them who is to be addressed as Your Majesty , Your Highness , Your Grace and so on . Then he said , ' Now , Carol , if I was the king 's eldest son , what would you call me ? ' And Carol said , ' I 'd still call you a Duck , Professor , it would n't make any difference to me . ' " Prudence could only sigh . " One other time he was illustrating phenomena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boys to mention the word ,  - -  phenomenon , you know . The boy could n't think of it . Professor gave three or four illustrations , and still the boy could n't remember it . ' Oh , come now , ' professor said , finally , ' something unusual , something very much out of the ordinary ! Suppose you should see a blackbird running a race down the street with a sparrow , what would you call it ? ' The boy could n't imagine , and professor said , ' What would you call that , Carol ? ' Carol said , ' A bad dream . ' " Prudence smiled wearily . " Sometimes we have discussions of moral points . We take turns about conducting them , and try to stimulate their interest in such things . We want to make them think , every one for himself . One day Professor Duke said , ' Suppose a boy in this town has a grudge against you ,  - -  unjust and unfair . You have tried one thing after another to change his attitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , on every occasion . Remember that you have tried every ordinary way of winning his good will . Now what are you going to do as a last resort ? ' Carol said , ' I 'll tell papa on him . ' " Miss Allen laughed again , heartily . " It does have a disturbing effect on the class , I admit , and often spoils a good point , but Professor Duke calls on Carol every time he sees her eyes twinkle ! He does it on purpose . And Miss Adams is nearly as bad as he . One day she said , ' Suppose you have unintentionally done something to greatly irritate and inconvenience a prominent man in town . He knows you did it , and he is very angry . He is a man of sharp temper and disagreeable manners . You know that he will be extremely unpleasant and insulting if you go to him with explanations and apologies . What are you going to do ? ' ' I think I 'll just keep out of his way for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope she does n't talk like that to you , Miss Allen . " Instantly Miss Allen was grave . " No , she does not , I am so sorry . " Leaning forward suddenly , she said , " Miss Starr , why do the twins dislike me ? " " Dislike you ! " echoed Prudence . " Why , they do not dislike you ! What in the world makes you think --  --  " " Oh , yes indeed they do ,  - -  both of them . Now , why ? People generally like me . I have always been popular with my students . This is my second year here . Last year the whole high school stood by me as one man . This year , the freshmen started as usual . After one week , the twins changed . I knew it instantly . Then other freshmen changed . Now the whole class comes as near snubbing me as they dare . Do you mean to say they have never told you about it ? " " Indeed they have not . And I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They like everybody . " " Christian tolerance , perhaps , " smiled Miss Allen ruefully . " But I want them to like me personally and intimately . I can help the twins . I can do them good , I know I can . But they wo n't let me . They keep me at arm 's length . They are both dear , and I love them . But they freeze me to death ! Why ? " " I ca n't believe it ! " " But it is true . Do n't they talk of their professors at home at all ? " " Oh , often . " " What do they say of us ? " " Why , they say Miss Adams is a perfectly sweet old lamb ,  - -  they do not mean to be disrespectful . And they say Professor Duke is the dearest duck ! They almost swear by ' Professor Duck ' ! " " And what do they say of me ? " Prudence hesitated , thinking hard . " Come now , what do they say ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , they have said that you are very pretty , and most unbelievably smart . " " Oh ! Quite a difference between sweet old lamb , and the dearest duck , and being very pretty and smart ! Do you see it ? " " Yes , " confessed Prudence reluctantly , " but I had n't thought of it before . " " Now , what is wrong ? What have I done ? Why , look here . The twins think everything of Professor Duke , and I am sure Carol deliberately neglects her science lessons in order to be kept in after school by him . But though she hates mathematics ,  - -  my subject , she works at it desperately so I ca n't keep her in . She sits on Mr. Duke 's table and chats with him by the hour . But she passes me up with a curt , ' Good night , Miss Allen . ' " " And Larkie , too ? " " Lark is worse than Carol . Her dislike is deeper-seated . I believe I could win Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving after school , and try my best . But just as she begins to thaw , Lark invariably comes up to see if she is ready to go home , and she looks at both of us with superior icy eyes . And Carol freezes in a second . Ordinarily , she looks at me with a sort of sympathetic pity and wonder , but Lark is always haughty and nearly contemptuous . It is different with the rest of the class . It is nothing important to them . The twins are popular in the class , you know , and the others , realizing that they dislike me , hold aloof on their account . " " I ca n't fathom it , " said Prudence . " Now , Professor Duke is very brilliant and clever and interesting . And he does like Carol tremendously ,  - -  Larkie , too . He says she is the cleverest girl he ever knew . But Carol is his favorite . But he does not like teaching , and he has not the real interests of the scholars at heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research work at a big salary . That is what he loves . That is where his interests lie . But this year , being idle , and his uncle being on the school board here , he accepted this place as a sort of vacation in the meanwhile . That is all it means to him . But I love teaching , it is my life-work . I love the young people , and I want to help them . Why wo n't the twins give me a chance ? Surely I am as attractive as Professor Duke . They are even fond of Miss Adams , whom most people consider rather a sour old maid . But they have no use for me . I want you to find out the reason , and tell me . Will you do it ? They will tell you if you ask them , wo n't they ? " " I think so . It is partly my fault . I am very strict with them about saying hateful things about people . I do not allow it . And I insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make them . So they have just kept it to themselves . But I will do my best . " One would have thought that Prudence carried the responsibility for the entire public-school system of the United States upon her shoulders that night , so anxious were her eyes , so grave her face . Supper over , she quietly suggested to Fairy that she would appreciate the absence of herself and Connie for a time . And Fairy instantly realized that the twins must be dealt with seriously for something . So she went in search of Connie , and the two set out for a long walk . Then Prudence went to the kitchen where the twins were washing the dishes , and as usual , laughing immoderately over something . Prudence sat down and leaned her elbows on the table , her chin in her palms . " I met Miss Allen to-day , " she said , closely observing the faces of the twins . A significant glance flashed between them , and they stiffened instantly . " She 's very pretty and sweet , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , " agreed Lark without any enthusiasm . " Such pretty hair , " added Carol dispassionately . " She must be very popular with the scholars , " suggested Prudence . " Yes , most of them are fond of her , " assented Lark . " She has rather winsome manners , I think , " said Carol . " Which of your professors do you like best ? " queried Prudence . " Duck , " they answered unanimously , and with brightening faces . " Why ? " " Because he is a duck , " said Carol , and they all laughed . But Prudence returned to the charge without delay . " Do you like Miss Allen ? " She was going through these questions with such solemnity that the twins ' suspicions had been aroused right at the start . What had Miss Allen told their sister ? Again that significant flash from twin to twin . " She certainly has very likeable ways , " said Lark shrewdly . " But do you like her ? " insisted Prudence . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted Carol . " What is unusual about the circumstances ? " Prudence wanted to know . " Look here , Prudence , what did Miss Allen tell you ? Was she complaining about us ? We 've been very nice and orderly , I 'm sure . " Lark was aggrieved . " She was n't complaining . She likes you both . But she says you do not like her . I want to know why . " " Well , if you must know , Miss Allen is a heretic , " snapped Lark . Then Prudence leaned back in her chair and gazed at the flushed faces of the twins for two full minutes . " A -- a -- a what ? " she ejaculated , when power of speech returned to her . " Heretic , " said Carol with some relish . " A heretic ! You know what heresy is , do n't you ? We 'll tell you all about it if you like , now you 've got things started . " " We did n't tell you before because we thought you and father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretic . But do n't you worry ,  - -  Miss Allen has n't influenced us any . " " We have n't given her a chance , " said Carol , with her impish smile . " Go on , " begged Prudence . " Tell me . You 're both crazy , I see that . But tell me ! " " Well , " began Lark , for Carol always relegated the story-telling to her more gifted twin , " we 've suspected Miss Allen right from the start . They used to have Bible reading every morning in school , one chapter , you know , and then the Lord 's prayer . After the first week , Miss Allen dropped it . We thought that was a -- a suspicious circumstance . " " Phenomenally so , " said Carol darkly . " But we kept our suspicions to ourselves , and we did n't come across anything else for several days . We would n't condemn anybody on -- on circumstantial evidence , Prue . We 're very fair-minded , you know . " " In spite of being twins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it ? " Prudence inquired , frowning at Carol . " Oh , nothing , " admitted Carol , driven into a corner . " I just wanted to make it emphatic . " " Go on , Lark . " " Well , there 's a girl at school named Hattie Simpson . You do not know her , Prue . We do n't associate with her . Oh , yes , we like her very well , but she is n't parsonage material . " " She 's a goat , " put in Carol . " You need n't frown , Prue , that 's Bible ! Do n't you remember the sheep and the goats ? I do n't know now just what it was they did , but I know the goats were very -- very disreputable characters ! " " Go on , Lark . " " Well , her folks are atheists , and she 's an atheist , too . You know what an atheist is , do n't you ? You know , Prue , Mount Mark is a very religious town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it seems the Simpsons are the only atheists here . Hattie says people look down on her terribly because of it . She says the church folks consider them , the Simpsons , that is , the dust on their shoes , and the crumbs off the rich man 's table . She got that terribly mixed up , but I did n't correct her . " " I think she did very well for an atheist , " said Carol , determined not to be totally overlooked in this discussion . " What has all this to do with Miss Allen ? " " Well , one day Hattie was walking home from school with us , and she was telling us about it ,  - -  the dust on their shoes , etc. ,  - -  and she said she liked Miss Allen better than anybody else in town . I asked why . She said Miss Allen believed the same things the Simpsons believe , only Miss Allen dare n't say so publicly , or they would put her out of the school . She said Miss Allen said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , and the ones outside the church are nearly always good and moral and kind . She said Miss Allen joined the Presbyterian church here because most of the school board are Presbyterians . She said Miss Allen said she did n't care if people were Catholics or Jews or atheists or -- or just ordinary Protestants , so long as they were kind to one another , and went about the world doing good works . And that 's why Miss Allen would n't read the Bible and say the Lord 's prayer in school . " " What do you think of that ? " demanded Carol . " Is n't that heresy ? She 's as bad as the priest and Levite , is n't she ? " " Did you ask Miss Allen about it ? " " No , indeed , we 've just ignored Miss Allen ever since . We have watched her as closely as we could since then , to see if we could catch her up again . Of course she has to be careful what she says in school , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly plain case , no doubt about it . " " And so you went among the other freshmen influencing them , and telling tales , and criticizing your --  --  " " No indeed , Prue , we would n't ! But you know it says in the Bible to beware of false doctrines and the sowers of bad seed , or something like that --  " " And we bewared as hard as we could ! " grinned Carol . " We have tried to explain these things to the other freshmen so Miss Allen could not lead them into -- into error . Oh , that 's Christian Science , is n't it ? Well , Minnie Carlson is a Christian Scientist and she talks so much about falling into error that -- honestly --  --  " " We ca n't tell error from truth any more , " interjected Carol neatly . " And so I hope you wo n't punish us if we accidentally vary from the truth once in a while . " This was quite beyond Prudence 's depth . She knew little of Christian Science save that it was a widely accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Miss Allen again . " But , twins , do you think it was kind , and Christian , and -- and like parsonage girls , to accept all this against Miss Allen without giving her a chance to defend herself ? " " As I told you , Prue , we have watched her very close since then . She has never come right out in the open , she would n't dare ,  - -  but she has given herself away several times . Nothing can get by us when we 're on the watch , you know ! " Prudence knew . " What did Miss Allen say ? " The twins thought seriously for a while . " Oh , yes , Lark , " suggested Carol finally , " do n't you remember she said the Bible was an allegory ? " " What ? " " Yes , she did . She was explaining to the English class what was meant by allegory , and she said the purpose of using allegory was to teach an important truth in a homely impressive way that could be remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible was one . And you know yourself Prue , that the Bible is Gospel truth , and -- I mean , it is so ! I mean --  --  " " What she means , " said Lark helpfully , " is that the Bible is not just a pretty way of teaching people to be good , but it 's solid fact clear through . " " That 's very well expressed , Lark , "  - -  Prudence herself could not have expressed it half so well ! " But how do you twins understand all these things so thoroughly ? " " Oh , you know Mrs. Sears is our Sunday-school teacher , and she 's always hot on the trail of the higher critics and heretics . She explained all about the -- the nefarious system to us one Sunday . She says the higher critics try to explain away the Bible by calling it allegory . So we were ready for Miss Allen there . And whenever anything came up at school , we would ask Mrs. Sears about it on Sunday ,  - -  without mentioning names of course . She 's very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thinks we 're sure to be deaconesses , at the very least . But Carol said she would n't be a deaconess , she was going to be a Red Cross nurse and go to war . That stumped Mrs. Sears for a while , and then she said we could be Red Cross Deaconess nurses . " " I wo n't , " said Carol , " because the deaconess uniforms are n't as stylish as the Red Cross nurses ' . I think I 'll look pretty fine in a white uniform with a stiff little cap and a red cross on my arm . Red crosses make a very pretty decoration , do n't you think they do , Lark ? " " What else did Miss Allen say at school ? " Prudence demanded , leading the twins back to the subject . " Well , one day she said , you know she gives uplifting little moral talks quite often , Prue . Sometimes she tells us stories with inspiring points . She 's really a moral person , I believe . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Carol , " for I do want to be friendly enough with her to ask if she uses anything on her complexion to keep it so rose-leafy . If she does , I 'll have some of it , if it takes all my next year 's clothes ! " Lark laughed . " A rose-leaf complexion will be a poor substitute for --  --  " " Oh , for goodness ' sake , twins , come back to Miss Allen . I am going right up to her house this minute , to ask her about it , and explain --  --  " " She 's the one to do the explaining , seems to me , " said Carol belligerently . " We 've got to stick up for the Bible , Prue , it 's our business . " " And I do n't think you should tell her , it may hurt her feelings , " urged Lark . " Have heretics feelings ? " queried Carol . " I suppose it 's a feeling of --  --  " " Carol ! Will you quit talking for a minute ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense , she 's no proper teacher and -- and she 'll have to be put out of the high school . And if she does n't believe it , she 's a martyr ! I 'm going to find out about it at once . Do you want to come with me ? " " I should say not , " said the twins promptly . " I think you 're very foolish to go at all , " added Lark . " I would n't go for a dollar , " declared Carol . " It 'd be very interesting to see how a heretic feels , but I do n't care to know how ordinary Christians feel when they fall into their hands . I 'm not aching to see Miss Allen to-night . " So Prudence set forth , conscientiously , in the darkness . A brave and heroic thing for Prudence to do , for she was a cowardly creature at heart . Miss Allen heard her voice in the lower hall , and came running down-stairs to meet her . " Come up , " she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prudence was fairly inside the door , she demanded , " What is it ? Did you find out ? Is it my fault ? " Then Prudence blushed and stammered , " Why -- it sounds -- silly but -- they think you are a -- heretic . " Miss Allen gasped . Then she laughed . Then she walked to her dressing-table and picked up a long hatpin . " Will you kindly jab this into me ? " she said . " I 'm having a nightmare . " Prudence explained in detail . At first Miss Allen laughed , it must be confessed . Then she grew very sober . " It is really my fault , " she said , " for I should have remembered that young people read a ton of meaning into a pound of words . Of course , I am not guilty , Miss Starr . Professor Duke and Miss Adams can swear to that . They call me Goody-goody . They say I am an old-fashioned apostle , and they accuse me of wanting to burn them both at the stake ! Now , sit down and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad , so glad , that this sweet-faced , bright-eyed woman was an " ordinary Christian , " and not a " priest and a Levite ! " " About the allegory business , it is very simple . What I said was this ,  - -  'The Bible is full of allegory . ' I did not say , ' The Bible is allegory . ' I said the Bible is full of allegory , and so it is . The parables , for instance ,  - -  what are they ? Do you see the difference ?  - -  But it is really more serious about poor little Hattie Simpson . As the twins told you , her parents are atheists . Her father is a loud-voiced , bragging , boastful , coarse-hearted fellow . Hattie herself does not know what her parents believe , and what they do not . She simply follows blindly after them . She thinks she is an eyesore in Mount Mark because of it . She resents it bitterly , but she feels the only decent thing for her to do is to stand by her folks . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make friends with her , for I truly pity her . She has no friends , she slinks about as though constantly ashamed of herself . She trusts no one , herself least of all . I tried to draw her out , and with partial success . She told me how she feels about it all . I said , ' Hattie , wo n't you let some one -- some minister , who knows how -- tell you about Christianity , and explain to you what Christians really believe ? ' ' No , ' she said passionately , ' I 'll stand by my folks . ' Then I saw she was not ready yet . I said , ' Well , perhaps it is just as well for the present , for you are too young now to take any definite stand for yourself . It is true , ' I told her , ' that many church members are not Christians , and are bad immoral people , as your father says . They are not Christians . And it is true that many outside of the church are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' And then I said , ' Do n't worry your head just now about whether people are Catholics or Jews or Protestants , or what they are . Just try to love everybody , and try to grow up to be such a sweet , kind , loving woman that you will be a blessing to the world . And what is more , ' I said , ' do not puzzle your head now about why some believe the Bible , and some do not . Just wait . When you are older , you shall go into things for yourself , and make your own decision . ' " Prudence nodded . " I think you were very sweet about it , " she said . " I wanted to win her confidence in the hope that some time , a little later , I myself may show her what Christ is to us , and why we love the Bible . But I did fight shy of the real point , for fear I might anger her and put a barrier between us . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pave the way for what I may be able to do later on . Do you see ? I have had several talks with her , but she is not ready . She is just a child , stubbornly determined to stand with her folks , right or wrong . I am trying now to cultivate the ground , I say nothing to make her dislike or distrust me . I did not think of her telling it to others ,  - -  and telling it wrong ! Surely no one but the twins could have read so much into it ! " " Well , " and Prudence smiled , " you know we are parsonage people ! We have to stick up for the Bible , as Carol says . " " Oh , and about the Bible reading , " said Miss Allen suddenly , " I have nothing to do with that . As you know , there are Jews and Catholics and Christian Scientists and every branch of Protestant represented in our little school . The Jews and Christian Scientists are in a minority . The Jews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too few to be influential . With a Catholic teacher , the Catholics were quite willing to have it . With a Protestant teacher , the Protestants were strong for it . But there was always friction -- one side objecting -- so the school board ruled it out entirely . I did not explain this to the scholars . I did not want our young people to know of the petty bickering and scrapping going on among the elders in the town . So I simply said that hereafter we would dispense with the Bible reading . But it was the direct order of the board . I argued against it , so did Professor Duke , so did Miss Adams . But as it happens , we are all three Presbyterians ! It did no good . " Then as Prudence rose to go home , she asked eagerly , " Do you think the twins will like me now ? " " I do n't see how in the world they can help it , " declared Prudence , smiling ; " indeed , they admitted they were only too anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to stick up for the Bible ! I am so glad and relieved ! This is the first time I have gone heresy-hunting , and I was quite bowed down with the weight of it . And if ever I can help with poor little Hattie , will you let me know ? I must have the twins invite her to spend some Saturday with us . That 's the way I make the girls like people ,  - -  by being with them a great , great deal . " Just before she said good night , Prudence murmured hopefully , " I am sorry it happened , but it will be a good lesson for the twins . I am sure that after this , they will be less ready to listen to gossip , and more ready to give one the benefit of a doubt . It 's a great responsibility , this raising a family , Miss Allen -- and especially twins ! " CHAPTER VI AN ADMIRER It must be remembered that Prudence did not live in a sheltered and exclusive city home , where girls are rigidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know how things are managed in the " best homes " of the big cities , girls are sheltered from innocent open things , and , too often , indulge in really serious amusements on the quiet . But this was the Middle West , where girls are to be trusted . Not all girls , of course , but as a matter of fact , the girls who need watching , seldom get enough of it to keep them out of mischief . Out in Iowa , girls and boys are allowed to like each other , and revel in each other 's company . And it is good for both . Prudence was not a sentimental girl . Perhaps this was partly due to the fact that at the age when most girls are head-full of boy , Prudence was hands-full of younger sisters ! And when hands are full to overflowing , there is small likelihood of heads being full of nonsense . Prudence liked boys as she liked girls ,  - -  that was the end of it . Romance was to her a closed book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soul-stirring had not come to her yet . But Prudence was attractive . She had that indescribable charm that carries a deep appeal to the eyes , and the lips , and the hearts of men . Happily Prudence herself did not realize this . The first young man of Mount Mark to yield to the charms of Prudence was a serious-minded lawyer , nearly ten years her senior . This was just the type of man to become enraptured with Prudence . He gazed across at her solemnly during the church service . He waited patiently after the benediction until she finished her Methodist practise of hand-shaking , and then walked joyously home with her . He said little , but he gazed in frank enchantment at the small womanly girl beside him . " He 's not half bad , Fairy , " Prudence would confide to her sister when they were snug in their bed . " He 's not half bad at all . But at heart , he does n't approve of me . He does n't know that himself , and I certainly ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I am convinced that it is true . For instance , he thinks every one , especially women , should have a mission in life , a serious , earnest mission . I told him I did n't believe anything of the kind ,  - -  I think we are just supposed to live along from day to day and do what we can , and be happy , and not say mean things about one another . But he said he considered that I was fulfilling the noblest mission a woman could have . Now what do you reckon he meant by that , Fairy ? I 've been puzzling my brain over it for days and days . Anybody can tell I am not the sort of girl to have a mission ! Maybe he just said it to encourage me ,  - -  he 's a very encouraging sort of man . He 's very nice ,  - -  oh , very nice , indeed ! But is n't it a nuisance to have him tagging along home with me , when I might be having such a good time with you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man she prefers to go home with her family , without hurting his feelings ? Is there any way to turn a person down without letting him know it ? He 's so nice I would n't hurt his feelings for anything , but -- it 's such a bother ! I 'm too young for beaus , and since I 'm never going to get married it 's just a waste of time . " And Fairy screamed with laughter , but told Prudence she must solve her own love problems ! And Prudence , unwilling to give offense , and preferring self-sacrifice , endured his company until a gay young college lad slipped in ahead of him . " First come , first served , " was the motto of heartless Prudence , and so she tripped comfortably away with " Jimmy , " laughing at his silly college stories , and never thinking to give more than a parting smile at the solemn face she left behind . After Jimmy came a grocery clerk named Byron Poe Smith , and after him somebody else , and somebody else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought it " awfully amusing , Fairy , but I keep wondering what you and the twins are laughing about ! " But it was Fairy herself who brought a real disturbing element into the life of Prudence . One of the lightest-minded of the many light-minded college men , had been deeply smitten by the charms of dignified Fairy . He walked with her , and talked with her ,  - -  this young man was a great deal of a talker , as so pathetically many college men are ! He planned many little expeditions and entertainments for her amusement , and his own happiness . His name was Eugene Babler . " Oh , he talks a lot , " said Fairy coolly , " but he certainly shows one a good time , and that 's the point , you know ! " She came in from college one afternoon and rattled off this little tale to Prudence . " A few of us were on the campus to-day , and we decided to go down the creek to-morrow afternoon and take our suppers . There 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the boys will be Tom Angell , and Frank Morris , and Eugene Babler . And Professor Rayburn was there when we were talking about it , and so we asked him to go along , but we told him he must take a girl . And he said , ' I wonder if your sister would n't go ? I have only met her once , but perhaps on your recommendation , Miss Fairy --  --  ' and he paused with his breath in the air , inquiringly . So I said , ' Do you mean Prudence , or one of the twins ? ' He smiled very kindly and said , ' I mean Prudence . ' I said I was sure you would go , and so you 'll have to do it . It 's a great honor , Prue , for all the upper-class girls , and even the unmarried women on the Fac. are crazy about him . He 's so aloof , you know , and very intelligent . I swelled with pride at the public tribute to the parsonage ! " " Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I 'm sure he did n't mean me , Fairy . You must have misunderstood him . Why , I would n't know what to say to a professor , you know ! What is his line ? " " Bugs ! " cried Fairy . " He 's the biology man . And this is his first year here , and he 's very brilliant ,  - -  they say ! I 'm no authority on bugs myself . But anyhow every one just raves about him , and he showed very plainly that he was anxious to get acquainted with you , so you 'll have to go . " " But bugs ! " wailed Prudence . " What do I know about bugs ! Will he expect me to know how to divide them ,  - -  separate them , you know --  " " I suppose you mean dissect them , you poor child , " screamed Fairy . " Divide bugs ! If professor could hear you now , Prue , he would be sadly disillusioned . You must just trot up-stairs and get one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wo n't expect you to be an advanced buggist . He can give you points himself . Men do love to have girls appeal to their superior knowledge , and be admiring and deferent . Maybe he will ' divide one ' for you if you ask him ' please . ' " " I wo n't do it , " declared Prudence . " I do n't like bugs anyhow , and -- why , the very pictures of them in the twins ' books make me nervous . I wo n't do it . You can just tell him I do n't feel qualified to go . " " You 've got to go , " said Fairy sternly , " for I said you would , and he 's counting on it . He 's going to phone you this afternoon and ask you himself . You 've got to go . " At that instant , the telephone rang . " There 's professor ! " cried Fairy . " You tell him you are just delighted to go , and that you are so interested in bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver . " Hello , " she said , " this is the parsonage . " And then , a second later , she said , " Yes , this is Prudence . " After that she stood silent for some little time , with Fairy crouched beside her , trying to hear . Then spoke Prudence . " Yes , Fairy has been telling me . And it 's very kind of you , indeed , and I know I would enjoy it . But as I was telling Fairy , I do n't know a thing about bugs , and I do n't like them anyhow , so I 'm afraid you would find me rather stupid . " Fairy was striving to get a hand over her sister 's lips to stem the words , but Prudence eluded her . They were both somewhat astounded at the great peal of laughter which came over the telephone . " Good ! That 's just what I was hoping for ! You could n't have said anything that would give me greater pleasure . Then shall I come around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one o'clock ?  - -  Oh , that is very kind of you , Miss Starr . Good-by ! Do n't cultivate an interest in bugs between now and to-morrow , for my sake ! " The girls looked at each other doubtfully when the receiver was once more on its hook . " I 'm afraid he 's laughing at me , " said Prudence questioningly . " I should hope so , " cried Fairy . " What in the world did you say that for ? Could n't you have pretended to be interested ? Professor likes women to be dignified and intellectual and deep , and --  --  " " Then why on earth did he ask me to go ? " demanded Prudence . " Any one could tell to look at me that I 'm not dignified and intellectual and deep , and --  --  " " And I know he admired you , for he was so eager when he asked about you . Think how grand it would be to speak of ' my sister , Mrs. Professor Rayburn , ' and --  --  " " Do n't be silly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I am not , I hope you do not think for one minute that I 'd marry a buggist ! Gracious ! Goodness ! I 've a notion not to go a step ! I 'll call him up and --  --  " But Fairy only laughed . And after all , Prudence looked forward to the little outing in the glorious October woods with eager anticipation . It was seldom indeed that she indulged in merry-making away from the parsonage . Yet she was fond of gaiety . Long before one o'clock on that eventful day , she was ready . And her face was so bright , and her eyes so starry , that placid self-satisfied Fairy felt a twinge of something like envy . " You look like a creature from another world , Prue , " she said . " If Professor Rayburn has any sense in his bones , he will fall dead in love with you ,  - -  bugs or no bugs ! " " People do not have sense in their bones , Fairy , and -- and -- shall I say professor , or just plain Mister ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor . " " Then I shall say Mister , " said Prudence . " It will be so hard to enjoy myself if I keep remembering that he teaches bugs ! I might as well be at school . I shall say Mister . " And she did say " Mister , " and she said it so sweetly , and looked up into Professor Rayburn 's face so brightly , and with happiness so evident and so girlish , that the staid professor felt a quick unaccountable throbbing down somewhere beneath his coat . He did look eager ! There was no doubt of it . And he looked at Prudence , continuously . " Just like ordinary men , is n't he ? " whispered Fairy to Eugene Babler ,  - -  called " Babbie , " for short and for humiliation , for he enjoyed the reputation of being a " talker " even among college men ! The three young couples struck off briskly down the road , creek-ward , and Prudence followed sedately with her professor . " Fairy says it was perfectly disgusting of me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said comfortably . " But I thought maybe , you were one of those professors who like one thing so much they ca n't be interested in anything else . And I wanted to warn you . But I guess you are n't that kind , after all ? " " Oh , no , indeed , " he assured her fervently , looking deep into her blue eyes . " I like bugs , it is true . But really I like other things , one thing at least , much better . " " Is it a riddle ? " she inquired . " Am I supposed to guess ? " " It is n't a riddle , but you may guess . Think hard , now ! It 's a serious matter . Please do n't say ' food . ' " " If I get below seventy will I be put down a grade ? " she asked . Then with intense solemnity , " I guess girls . " They laughed together , youthfully . " You are right , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's the first time I ever got a hundred in anything in my life . I was very much accustomed to eighties when I was in school . I am very common and unbrilliant , " she assured him . " Fairy says you are perfectly horribly clever --  --  " She glanced up when she heard his exclamation , and laughed at his rueful face . " Oh , that is n't Fairy 's expression . She thinks brilliant and clever people are just adorable . It is only I who think them horrible . " Even Prudence could see that this did not help matters . " I -- I do not mean that , " she stammered . " I am sure you are very nice indeed , and we are going to be good friends , are n't we ? But I am such a dunce myself that I am afraid of real clever people . They are so superior . And so uninteresting , and -- oh , I do not mean that either . " Then Prudence laughed at her predicament . " I may as well give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nice and friendly and interesting , that I can hardly believe you are so clever . You are the nicest smart person I ever saw ,  - -  except my own family , I mean . " She smiled up at him deliciously . " Does that make it square ? " " More than square , " he said . " You are too complimentary . But the only thing that really counts to-day is whether we are going to be real good friends , as you suggested . We are , are n't we ? The very best and closest of friends ? " " Yes , " agreed Prudence , dimpling . " I like men to be my friends , nice men , I mean . But it is n't always safe . So many start out to be good friends , and then want to be silly . So a girl has to be very careful . But it 's perfectly safe with you , and so we can be the very best of friends . I wo n't need to be watchful for bad symptoms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't fall in love ? " he asked , and his voice was curious , as though she had hurt him . " Oh , of course , you 'll fall in love , " laughed Prudence . " All nice men do.  - -  But not with me ,  - -  that was what I meant I could n't imagine a buggy professor -- oh , I beg your pardon ! But the twins are so silly and disrespectful , and they thought it was such a joke that I should even look at a professor of biology that they began calling you the buggy professor . But they do not mean any harm by it , not the least in the world . They 're such nice sweet girls , but -- young , you know . Are your feelings hurt ? " she asked anxiously . " Not a bit ! I think the twins and I will be tremendously good friends . I 'm quite willing to be known as the buggy professor . But you were trying to explain why I could n't fall in love with you . I suppose you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , not that at all , " she hastened to assure him . Then she stopped . " Yes , " she said honestly , " that is true , too . But that is n't what I was trying to say . I was just saying that no one realizes any more than I how perfectly impossible it would be for a clever , grown-up , brilliant professor to fall in love with such an idiot as I am . That 's all . I meant it for a compliment , " she added , seeing he was not well pleased . He smiled , but it was a sober smile . " You said it was true that you did not wish me to be -- fond of you . Why ? Do n't you like me then , after all ? " Now , he realized that this was a perfectly insane conversation , but for the life of him , he could n't help it . Prudence was so alluring , and the sky was so warmly blue , the sunshine so mild and hazy , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense on such a day , with such a girl as this ? " Oh , I do like you very much indeed , " declared Prudence . " It 's a big relief , too , for I did n't expect to -- oh , I beg your pardon again , but -- well , I was scared when Fairy told me how remarkable you are . I did n't want to disgrace the parsonage , and I knew I would . But -- why , the reason I do not want you to fall in love with me ,  - -  that 's very different from being fond of me , I do want you to be that ,  - -  but when people fall in love , they get married . I 'm not going to get married , so it would be silly to fall in love , would n't it ? " He laughed heartily at the matter-of-factness with which this nineteen-year-old girl disposed of love and marriage . " Why are n't you going to be married ? " he inquired , foolishly happy , and showing more foolishness than happiness , just as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be ten or eleven years before Connie is fairly raised . " " Yes , but you wo n't be a Methuselah , in eleven years , " he smiled . " No , but you forget father . " " Forget father ! Are you raising him , too ? " " No , I 'm not raising him , but I 'm managing him . " But when he laughed , she hastened to add , " That is , I take care of him , and keep house for him , and remind him of things he forgets . " Then with girlish honesty , she added , " Though I must confess that he has to remind me of things I forget , oftener than I do him . I inherited my forgetfulness from father . I asked him once if he inherited his from grandfather , and he said he forgot whether grandfather was forgetful or not ! Father is very clever . So 's Fairy . And the twins are the smartest little things you ever saw ,  - -  and Connie , too . Connie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all are ,  - -  but me . It 's kind of humiliating to be the only stupid one in a family of smart folks . I suppose you 've no idea how it feels , and I ca n't explain it . But sometimes I think maybe I ought to go off and die , so the whole family can shine and sparkle together . As it is , there 's just a dull glow from my corner , quite pale and ugly compared with the brilliant gleams the others are sending out . " Said Professor Rayburn , " Ah , Prudence , the faint , sweet mellow glows are always beautiful . Not sparkling , perhaps , not brilliant ! But comforting , and cheering , and -- always to be trusted . It 's just these little corner-glows , like yours , that make life worth living . " This was rather deep for Prudence , but she felt instinctively that he was complimenting her . She thanked him sweetly , and said , " And after all , I do not really mind being the stupid one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can just live along comfortably , and people do not expect much of me . It would wear me all out to be as clever as Fairy , or as witty as Carol , or as studious as Lark . But I am most tremendously proud of them , I assure you . " If Professor Rayburn had continued along this interesting and fruitful line of conversation , all would have been well . " But it came just like a clap of thunder in the sunshine , " said Prudence to Fairy dramatically , as they sat in their room talking things over that night . " We were having a perfectly grand time , and I was just thinking he was as nice and interesting as if he did n't know one thing to his name , when -- Crash ! That 's how it happened . " Fairy wiped her eyes , and lay back weakly on the bed . " Go on , " she urged . " What happened ? " " He stopped right in the middle of a sentence about me , something real nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' Look , Miss Starr ! ' Then he got down on his knees and began cautiously scraping away the sticks and leaves . Then he fished out the most horrible , woolly , many-legged little animal I ever saw in my life . He said it was a giminythoraticus billyancibus , and he was as tickled over it as though he had just picked up a million-dollar diamond . And what do you suppose the weird creature did with it ? He wrapped it in a couple of leaves , and put his handkerchief around it and put it in his pocket !  - -  Do you remember when we were eating by the creek , and I got jam on my fingers ? He offered me his handkerchief to wipe it off ? Do you remember how I shoved him away , and shuddered ? I saw you look reprovingly at me ! That 's why ! Do you suppose I could wipe my fingers with a handkerchief that had been in one of his pockets ? " " It was n't the one that had the giminy billibus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only knows what had been in this one , an alligator , maybe , or a snake . He 's very fond of snakes . He says some of them are so useful . I try to be charitable , Fairy , and I believe I would give even Satan credit for any good there was in him ,  - -  but it is too much to ask me to be fond of a man who is fond of snakes . But that is not the worst . He put the giminy thing in his pocket , his left pocket ! Then he came on walking with me , on my right side . On my right side , Fairy , do you understand what that means ? It means that the giminy billibus , as you call it -- oh , I would n't swear to the name , Fairy , I do not claim to be smart , but I know how it looked ! Well , anyhow , name and all , it was on the side next to me . I stopped to look at a little stick , and switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at a bunch of dirt , and got on the wrong side again . Then I stopped , and then he did , and so we kept zig-zagging down the road . A body would have thought we were drunk , I suppose . Four times that man stopped to pick up some wriggling little animal , and four times he deposited his treasure in one of his various pockets . Do n't ask why it is impossible for me to be friends with such a being ,  - -  spare me that humiliation ! " But the fair daughter of the parsonage proved irresistibly attractive to the unfortunate professor , and he was not to be lightly shunted aside . He forsook the Presbyterian church , of which he was a member , and attended the Methodist meetings with commendable assiduity . After each service , he accompanied Prudence home , and never failed to accept her invitations , feebly given , to " come in a minute . " He called as often during the week as Propriety , in the voice of Prudence , deemed fitting . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Rayburn did not know this . Weeks passed , a month slipped away , and another . Professor Rayburn was considered a fixture in the parsonage household by all except Prudence herself , who chafed under her bondage . " I ca n't just blurt out that I think he 's a nuisance , " she mourned to Fairy . " Oh , if he 'd just do something disgusting so I could fire him off ,  - -  Pop ! Just like that . Would n't it be glorious ? " But the professor did not indulge in disgusting things , and Prudence continued to worry and fret . Then came a blessed evening when the minister and Fairy were away from home , and the twins and Connie were safely in their beds . Professor Rayburn sat with Prudence in the cozy living-room , and Prudence was charming , though quiet , and the professor was only human . Prudence had made tea , and as she rose to relieve him of his empty cup , he also rose to return it to the table . Laughing , they put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the saucer . Then when it was safely disposed of , Prudence turned toward him , still laughing at the silliness of it ,  - -  very alluring , very winsome . And Mr. Rayburn , unexpectedly to himself as to her , put his arms around her and kissed her . He was aghast at himself , once it was over , and Prudence , well , let us say frankly that Prudence was only relieved , for it came to her in a flash that this was the " disgusting thing " for which she had so fervently longed . " Mr. Rayburn ! " " That was very stupid and unpardonable of me , Prudence , " he said quickly , " I really did not think what I was doing . But you were so sweet , and -- I 'm awfully fond of you , Prudence , you know that . " Prudence looked at him thoughtfully . She felt that this hardly gave her the desired opening . So she waited , hoping he would commit himself further . More humbled by her unnatural silence , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man cares for a girl as I care for you , it is n't always easy for him to be sober and sensible . You should n't have been so -- so dear . " Prudence sighed happily . She was content . This gave her the long-desired cue . " Mr. Rayburn , " she said gently but decidedly , " I think you ought not to come here any more . " He walked over to her quickly , and stood beside the chair into which she had dropped when he kissed her . " Do n't say that , Prudence , " he said in a hurried low voice . " It is true , " she persisted , feeling somehow sorry , though she did not understand why she should feel so . " I -- I -- well , you know I -- you remember what I told you that first day , do n't you ? About getting married , and falling in love , and such things . It is true . I do n't want to love anybody , and I do n't want to get married , and Fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiled rather grimly . " Yes , I think it is -- remotely possible . " " Then that settles it , " she said comfortably . " And besides , I have such a lot to do that I can't -- well , bother -- spending so much time outside as I have with you . I 've been neglecting my work , and it is n't right . I have n't the time . " " Which is your way of saying that you do not like me , is n't it ? " Prudence stood up impulsively . " Oh , I like you , but --  " she threw out her hands expressively . He took them in his , tenderly , firmly . " But , Prudence , " he argued , " that is because the woman in you is n't awake . You may never love me -- a dismal possibility , but it is true . But do n't you think it only fair that you should give me a chance to try ? " " Oh , but that 's just the point , " she cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to run any risk , at all . I would n't marry you if I did love you -- I told you that right in the beginning . " He still held her hands in one of his , caressing them slowly with the other . " What is there about me that you do not like ? " he demanded suddenly . " There is something , I know . " And with her awful unbelievable honesty . Prudence told him . " Yes , " she said , " that is true . I hated to mention it , but there is something ! Mr. Rayburn , I just ca n't stand the bugs ! " " Good heavens ! The what ? " " The bugs ! I ca n't bear for you to be near me , because I keep wondering if there are bugs and things in your pocket . I 'm afraid they 'll get over on me . Even now it makes me shiver when you hold my hands , because I know you 've been handling the horrible little creatures with yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " And after you leave , I get down on my hands and knees and look over the floor , and examine the chairs , to see if any have crawled off ! It 's a terrible feeling , Mr. Rayburn . You know I told you I hated bugs.  - -  I 'm afraid I 've hurt your feelings , " she said sadly . " Where in the world did you get such an idea as that ? " he demanded rather angrily . " Do you think I have pet bugs to carry around with me for company ? " " No ,  - -  but do n't you remember the picnic ,  - -  and how you kept gathering them up in your handkerchiefs and putting them in your pockets ? And how I kept squirming around to get on the other side ,  - -  I was trying to get away from the bugs ! " " But , my heavens , Prudence , those were my field clothes . I do n't put bugs in these pockets , these are my Sunday togs ! " He smiled a little . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He found it humorous , and yet it hurt him . Such a little thing to prejudice a girl so strongly ,  - -  and one he liked so marvelously well ! " You might forget , and put them in these pockets , it 's a kind of habit with you , I suppose . And just plain washing wo n't take the idea of bugs off your hands . " " Prudence , you are only a girl ,  - -  a childish girl , but a very sweet one . I want you to like me . When you grow up , you are going to be a wonderfully good and lovely woman . I -- I am going to want you then . I know it . Let 's just be friends now , ca n't we -- until later -- for a long time yet ? I 'll promise on my word of honor never to put another bug in my pockets , or my handkerchiefs . But I ca n't promise not to touch them , for I have to do it in class . That 's how I earn my living ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rub them with cold cream , and powder them , and perfume them , before I ever come near you again . Wo n't that do ? " Prudence shook her head . " I know you are laughing at me , " she said , " but I always told you I was just a silly simpleton . And -- it is n't the bugs altogether . I -- I like it better to be with my sisters than --  --  " " Than with me ? I see . As I said , the woman of you is still sleeping . Well , we are young , and I will wait . I wo n't bother you any more for a long time , Prudence , but I sha n't forget you . And some day I will come back to you again . " He stared at her moodily . Then he put his hands beneath her elbows , and looked into her eyes searchingly . " You are a strange girl , Prudence . In some ways , you are so womanly , and in other ways so -- pitifully girlish ! All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sisters and your father , and --  But you will waken , and I wo n't hurry you . " Then he put his arms around her again , and whispered in her ear , " But I love you , Prudence , and -- if some one else should do the awakening -- it would hurt ! " Then he kissed her , and went away . But Prudence ran up-stairs , singing happily . " Oh , I feel like a caged-up bird that has broken loose , " she cried to her reflection in the mirror jubilantly . " Oh , what fun it will be to come home from church with Fairy and the twins , the way I used to do ! " CHAPTER VII LESSONS IN ETIQUETTE Connie was lying flat on her back near the register . The twins were sitting on the floor near her , hearing each other conjugate Latin verbs . And Prudence , with her darning basket , was earnestly trying to solve a domestic problem ,  - -  how to get three pairs of wearable stockings out of eleven hosiery remnants . So Fairy found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Glorious day , " she said , glancing impartially at her sisters . " Just glorious ! Why are you all hugging the register , may I ask ? It is perfect weather . Connie , you should be out-of-doors this minute , by all means . Twins , are n't you grown-up enough to sit on chairs , or wo n't your footies reach the floor ?  - -  Babbie , Eugene Babler , you know , is coming to spend the evening , Prudence . " " What is going on to-night ? " queried Prudence . " Nothing is going on . That 's why he is coming . It 's too cold to meander around outdoors these nights , and so we shall have to amuse ourselves inside as best we can . " The whole family came to attention at this . " Oh , goody ! " cried Connie . " Let 's make taffy , shall we , Fairy ? " " Certainly not . This is n't a children 's party . You 'll go to bed at eight o'clock as usual , Connie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question is , What shall it be ? " " Yes , " agreed Carol with enthusiasm ,  - -  Carol was always enthusiastic on the subject of something to eat . " Yes , indeed , that is the question . What shall we have ? " " You will likely have pleasant dreams , Carol , " was the cool retort . " Babbie did not invite himself to spend the evening with you , I believe . " " Do you mean to suggest , " demanded Lark with withering scorn , " that it is your intention to shut yourself up alone with this -- this creature , excluding the rest of us ? " " Yes , and have refreshments for just you two ? " cried Carol . Illustration : " Yes , and have refreshments for just you two ? " " That is my intention most certainly . The twins and Connie will not put in appearance at all . Prue will serve the refreshments , and will eat with us . Babbie and I shall spend the evening in the front room . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is much cheerier , and more homelike . " " Well , Babbie is n't a member of the family , you know , " said Fairy . " You are doing your best , " sniffed Carol . " Now , you girls must understand right off , that things are different here from what they were at Exminster . When boys came to the house there they came to have a good time with the whole family . But here it is very different . I 've been looking around , and I 've got on to the system . The proper thing is to receive callers privately , without the family en masse sitting by and superintending . That 's etiquette , you know . And one must always serve refreshments . More etiquette . Men are such greedy animals , they do not care to go places where the eats are n't forthcoming . " " Men ! Are you referring to this Babbling creature now ? " interposed Carol . " Ouch ! " said Lark . " But wo n't it be rather -- poky -- just sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Prudence doubtfully , ignoring the offended twins . " Oh , I dare say it will . But it 's the proper thing to do , " said Fairy complacently . " What are you going to do all evening ? " Connie wanted to know . " Just sit and look at each other and admire yourselves ? " The twins thought this very clever of Connie , so they both said " Ouch ! " approvingly . " Why , no , baby dear , " said Fairy good-naturedly . " We shall talk . Feast our souls with a flow of reason , you know . We shall converse . We shall hold pleasant intercourse . " " Would n't it be more fun to have the girls in for a little while ? " This from Prudence . " Oh , it might ,  - -  but it would n't be the proper thing at all . College men do not care to be entertained by babies . " " No , " snapped Lark , " the wisdom of babies is too deep for these -- these -- these men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite restored to amiability by it . " In embryo , " had been added to her vocabulary that very day in the biology class . It was only the sheerest good fortune which gave her the opportunity of utilizing it so soon . And Carol said " Ouch ! " with such whole-souled admiration that Lark 's spirit soared among the clouds . She had scored ! " And what shall we serve them ? " urged Prudence . " I suppose it would hardly do to -- pop corn , would it ? " " No , indeed . Popping corn is very nice for the twins and the little boys in the neighborhood . " Fairy smiled with relish as she saw the twins wince at this thrust . " But Babbie and I --  Oh , never ! It would n't do at all . Now , oyster stew and crackers ,  - -  I mean wafers ,  - -   - -   " " Oysters are fearfully expensive , Fairy , " objected the frugal Prudence . " Oh , we can stand it for once , " said Fairy easily . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra . Babbie is all the rage at school , and the girls are frantic with jealousy because I have cut everybody else out . To be honest about it , I ca n't understand it myself . Babbie 's such a giddy scatter-brained youngster , you 'd think he 'd prefer --  --  " " Do you like him , Fairy ? Do n't you think he 's tiresome ? He talks so much , it seems to me . " " To be sure I like him . He 's great fun . He 's always joking and never has a sensible thought , and hates study . He 's an amusing soul , I must say . He 's going to attend here a couple of years , and then study pharmacy . His father is a druggist in Ottumwa , and quite well off . The only reason Babbie came here instead of going to a big college in the East is because his father is a trustee . Trustees are in honor bound to send their offspring to the college they trustee ,  - -  just as ministers are obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if they short-weight and long-charge you , " put in Carol . " Carol ! " exclaimed Prudence reprovingly . " Well , we 'll serve oyster stew then . Will you eat in the dining-room ? " " No , we 'll eat on the little table in the front room ,  - -  informally , you know . You must get it ready , and arrange it nicely on the big tray . Then you must come to the door and say , ' Would n't you like a little oyster stew ? ' Say it carelessly , as if we always have something to eat before going to bed . And I 'll say , ' Oh , yes , Prudence , bring it right in . ' Then you bring it in , and we 'll all eat together.  - -  That 's the way to do it ! Babbie 's had dates with the very swellest girls in school , and he knows about such things . We must do it up brown ! " " Swell ! " mocked Lark . " Do it up brown ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . I 'm sure this young Babler is just the type of man to interest the modern college professor ! Swell ! Do it up brown ! " " Ouch ! " grinned Carol . " Now , will you twins run down-town for the oysters ? " asked Prudence briskly . " Who ? Us ? " demanded Lark , indignantly and ungrammatically . " Do you think we can carry home oysters for the -- the -- personal consumption of this Babbling young prince ? Not so ! Let Fairy go after the oysters ! She can carry them home tenderly and appreciatively . Carol and I ca n't ! We do n't grasp the beauty of that man 's nature . " " Oh , yes , twinnies , I think you 'll go , all right . Hurry now , for you must be back in time to help me get supper . Fairy 'll have to straighten the front room , and we wo n't have time . Run along , and be quick . " For a few seconds the twins gazed at each other studiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare for their errand . They whispered softly going through the upper hall . " We 'd better make a list , " said Carol softly . So with heads close together they wrote out several items on a piece of paper . " It 'll cost quite a lot , " objected Carol . " Thirty cents , anyhow . And Prudence 'll make us pay for the oysters , sure . Remember that . " " We 'd better let Connie in , too , " suggested Lark . Connie was hastily summoned , and the twins whispered explanations in her willing ears . " Good ! " she said approvingly . " It 'll serve ' em right . " " But it 'll cost money , " said Carol . " How much have you got ? " Then Connie understood why she had been consulted . The twins always invited her to join their enterprises when money was required . " A quarter , " she faltered . " Well , we 'll go shares , " said Lark generously . " We 'll pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if Prudence makes us pay for the oysters , you 'll have to pay a third . Will you do that ? " " Yes , indeed . " Connie was relieved . She did not always get off so easily ! " Twins ! You must hurry ! " This was Prudence at the bottom of the stairs . And the twins set off quite hurriedly . Their first tall was at the meat market . " A pint of oysters , " said Lark briefly . When he brought them to her , she smelled them suspiciously . Then Carol smelled . " Are these rotten oysters ? " she demanded hopefully . " No , " he answered , laughing . " Certainly not . " " Have you got any rotten ones ? " " No , we do n't keep that kind . " He was still laughing . The twins sighed and hurried next door to the grocer 's . " A nickel 's worth of pepper -- the strongest you have . " This was quickly settled -- and the grave-faced twins betook themselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly awful smell , " Lark explained soberly . " What kind of a smell ? " " We do n't care what kind , but it must be perfectly sickening . Like something rotten , or dead , if you have it . Something that will stay smelly for several hours ,  - -  but it must n't be dangerous , of course . " " What do you want it for ? " " We want it to put in a room to give it a horrible smell for an hour or so . " Lark winked at him solemnly . " It 's a joke , " she further elucidated . " I see . " His eyes twinkled . " I think I can fix you up . " A moment later he handed her a small bottle . " Just sprinkle this over the carpet . It wo n't do any harm , and it smells like thunder . It costs a quarter . " Carol frowned . " I suppose we 'll have to take it , " she said , " but it 's pretty expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money . " He laughed aloud . " I hate to have you get a good licking to-morrow , too ,  - -  but you 'll get it just the same , or I miss my guess . " When the twins arrived home , Fairy was just cutting the candy she had made . " It 's delicious , " she said to Prudence . " Here 's a nice dishful for you and the girls.  - -  Pitch in , twins , and help yourselves . It 's very nice . " The twins waved her haughtily away . " No , thank you , " they said . " We could n't eat that candy with relish . We are unworthy . " " All right , " Prudence put in quickly , as Fairy only laughed . " I 'll put it in the cupboard , and Fairy and I will eat it to-morrow . It 's perfectly fine ,  - -  simply delicious . " But the twins were not to be tempted . Before they went up-stairs , Lark inquired sarcastically : " I suppose , Fairy , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , no , " was the ready answer , " I 'll just wear my little green muslin . It 's old , but very nice and comfortable -- just right for an evening at home . " " Yes , " scoffed Carol , " and of course you are remembering that every one says it is the most becoming dress you have . " " Oh , yes , " laughed Fairy , " I 'm remembering that , all right . " Then the twins went up-stairs , but not to their own room at once . Instead they slipped noiselessly into the front bedroom , and a little later Carol came out into the hall and stood listening at the head of the stairs , as though on guard . " Be sure and leave quite a few stitches in , Lark , " she whispered once . " We want it to hang together until Babbie gets here . " That was all . Presently Lark emerged , and their own door closed behind them . " It 's a good thing father has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " asked Carol . And Lark agreed , absently . She was thinking of the oysters . As soon as they finished supper , Lark said , " Do n't you think we 'd better go right to bed , Prue ? We do n't want to taint the atmosphere of the parsonage . Of course , Fairy will want to wash the dishes herself to make sure they are clean and shining . " " Oh , no , " disclaimed Fairy , still good-naturedly . " I can give an extra rub to the ones we want to use ,  - -  that is enough . I do appreciate the thought , though , thanks very much . " So the twins plunged in , carefully keeping Connie beside them . " She has such a full-to-overflowing look , " said Carol . " If we do n't keep hold of her , she 'll let something bubble over . " Connie had a dismal propensity for giving things away ,  - -  the twins had often suffered from it . To-night , they were determined to forestall such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be sure it was ridiculously early , but they were all determined . " We feel weak under this unusual strain . Our nerves ca n't stand the tension . We really must retire to rest . Maybe a good night 's sleep will restore us to normal , " Lark explained gravely . Fairy only laughed . " Good ! " she cried . " Do go to bed . The only time I am sure of you is when you are in your beds . Do you mind if I tie you in , to make assurance doubly sure ? " But the twins and Connie had disappeared . " You keep your eyes open , Fairy , " Prudence whispered melodramatically . " Those girls do not look right . Something is hanging over our heads . " And she added anxiously , " Oh , I 'll be so disappointed if things go badly . This is the first time we 've ever lived up to etiquette , and I feel it is really a crisis . " Fairy was a little late getting up-stairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters ' room . They were all in bed , breathing heavily . She walked from one to another , and stood above them majestically . " Asleep ! " she cried . " Ah , Fortune is kind . They are asleep . How I love these darling little twinnies ,  - -  in their sleep ! " An audible sniff from beneath the covers , and Fairy , smiling mischievously , went into the front room to prepare for her caller . The bell rang as she was dressing . Prudence went to the door , preternaturally ceremonious , and ushered Mr. Babler into the front room . She turned on the electric switch as she opened the door . She was too much impressed with the solemnity of the occasion to take much note of her surroundings , and she did not observe that the young man sniffed in a peculiar manner as he entered the room . " I 'll call Fairy , " she said demurely . " Tell her she need n't primp for me , " he answered , laughing . " I know just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdened to laugh . She smiled hospitably , and closed the door upon him . Fairy was tripping down the stairs , very tall , very handsome , very gay . She pinched her sister 's arm as she passed , and the front room door swung behind . But she did not greet her friend . She stood erect by the door , her head tilted on one side , sniffing , sniffing . " What in the world ? " she wondered . Then she blushed . Perhaps it was something he had used on his hair ! Or perhaps he had been having his suit cleaned ! " Oh , I guess it 's nothing , after all , " she stammered . But Eugene Babler was strangely quiet . He looked about the room in a peculiar questioning way . " Shall I raise a window ? " he suggested finally . " It 's rather -- er -- hot in here . " " Yes , do , " she urged . " Raise all of them . It's -- do you -- do you notice a -- a funny smell in here ? Or am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , there is a smell , " he said , in evident relief . " I thought maybe you 'd been cleaning the carpet with something . It 's ghastly . Ca n't we go somewhere else ? " " Come on . " She opened the door into the sitting-room . " We 're coming out here if you do not mind , Prue . " And Fairy explained the difficulty . " Why , that 's very strange , " said Prudence , knitting her brows . " I was in there right after supper , and I did n't notice anything . What does it smell like ? " " It 's a new smell to me , " laughed Fairy , " but something about it is strangely suggestive of our angel-twins . " Prudence went to investigate , and Fairy shoved a big chair near the table , waving her hand toward it lightly with a smile at Babbie . Then she sank into a low rocker , and leaned one arm on the table . She wrinkled her forehead thoughtfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very suspicious about it . It was not at all natural --  --  " " Excuse me , Fairy , " he said , ill at ease for the first time in her knowledge of him . " Did you know your sleeve was coming out ? " Fairy gasped , and raised her arm . " Both arms , apparently , " he continued , smiling , but his face was flushed . " Excuse me just a minute , will you ? " Fairy was unruffled . She sought her sister . " Look here , Prue ,  - -  what do you make of this ? I 'm coming to pieces ! I 'm hanging by a single thread , as it were . " Her sleeves were undoubtedly ready to drop off at a second 's notice ! Prudence was shocked . She grew positively white in the face . " Oh , Fairy , " she wailed . " We are disgraced . " " Not a bit of it , " said Fairy coolly . " I remember now that Lark was looking for the scissors before supper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on talent , is n't it ? Do n't look so distressed , Prue . Etiquette itself must be subservient to twins , it seems . Do n't forget to bring in the stew at a quarter past nine , and have it as good as possible ,  - -  please , dear . " " I will , " vowed Prudence , " I'll -- I 'll use cream . Oh , those horrible twins ! " " Go in and entertain Babbie till I come down , wo n't you ? " And Fairy ran lightly up the stairs , humming a snatch of song . But Prudence did a poor job of entertaining Babbie during her sister 's absence . She felt really dizzy ! Such a way to introduce Etiquette into the parsonage life . She was glad to make her escape from the room when Fairy returned , a graceful figure in the fine blue silk ! She went back to the dining-room , and painstakingly arranged the big tray for the designated moment of its entrance ,  - -  according to etiquette . Fairy and Babbie in the next room talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing , smiled in sympathy . She herself thought it would be altogether stupid to be shut up in a room alone with " just a man " for a whole evening ,  - -  but etiquette required it . Fairy knew about such things , of course . A little after nine , she called out dismally , " Fairy ! " And Fairy , fearing fresh disaster , came running out . " What now ? What --  --  " " I forget what you told me to say , " whispered Prudence wretchedly , " what was it ? The soup is ready , and piping hot ,  - -  but what is it you want me to say ? " Fairy screamed with laughter . " You goose ! " she cried . " Say anything you like . I was just giving you a tip , that was all . It does n't make any difference what you say . " " Oh , I am determined to do my part just right , " vowed Prudence fervently , " according to etiquette and all . What was it you said ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low voice , " Would n't you like a little nice , hot , oyster stew ? " Prudence repeated it after her breathlessly . So Fairy returned once more , and soon after Prudence tapped on the door . Then she opened it , and thrust her curly head inside . " Would n't you like a little nice , hot , oyster stew ? " she chirped methodically . And Fairy said , " Oh , yes indeed , Prudence ,  - -  this is so nice of you . " The stew was steaming hot , and the three gathered sociably about the table . Prudence was talking . Fairy was passing the " crackers , "  - -  Prudence kicked her foot gently beneath the table , to remind her that etiquette calls them " wafers . " So it happened that Babbie was first to taste the steaming stew . He gasped , and gulped , and swallowed some water with more haste than grace . Then he toyed idly with spoon and wafer until Prudence tasted also . Prudence did not gasp . She did not cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt eyes ,  - -  a world of pathos in the glance . But Fairy did not notice . " Now , please do not ask me to talk until I have finished my soup , " she was saying brightly , " I simply can not think and appreciate oyster stew at the same time . " Then she appreciated it ! She dropped her spoon with a great clatter , and jumped up from the table . " Mercy ! " she shrieked . " It is poisoned ! " Babbie leaned back in his chair and laughed until his eyes were wet . Prudence 's eyes were wet , too , but not from laughter ! What would etiquette think of her , after this ? " What did you do to this soup , Prudence ? " demanded Fairy . " I made it ,  - -  nothing else , " faltered poor Prudence , quite crushed by this blow . And oysters forty cents a pint ! " It 's pepper , I think , " gasped Babbie . " My insides bear startling testimony to the presence of pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critical examination of the oysters . She found them literally stuffed with pepper , there was no doubt of it . The twins had done deadly work ! Their patience , at least , was commendable , it seemed that not one oyster had escaped their attention . The entire pint had been ruined by the pepper . " Revenge , ye gods , how sweet , " chanted Fairy . " The twins are getting even with a vengeance ,  - -  the same twins you said were adorable , Babbie . " It must be said for Fairy that her good nature could stand almost anything . Even this did not seriously disturb her . " Do you suppose you can find us some milk , Prue ? And crackers ! I 'm so fond of crackers and milk , are n't you , Babbie ? " " Oh , I adore it . But serve a microscope with it , please . I want to examine it for microbes before I taste . " But Prudence did better than that . She made some delicious cocoa , and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the amiable Mrs. Adams . The twins were very fond of pear preserves , and had been looking forward to eating these on their approaching birthday . They were doomed to disappointment ! The three had a merry little feast , after all , and their laughter rang out so often and so unrestrainedly that the twins shook in their beds with rage and disappointment . Mr. Starr came in while they were eating , and joined them genially . But afterward , when Prudence realized that etiquette called for their retirement , her father still sat complacently by the register , talking and laughing . Prudence fastened her eyes upon him . " Well , I must honestly go to bed , " she said , gazing hypnotically at her father . " I know you will excuse me . I must store up my strength to deal with the twins in the morning . " She got up from her chair , and moved restlessly about the room , still boring her father with her eyes . He did not move . She paused beside him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , " she said gaily , " we must put our heads together , and think out a proper punishment for the awful creatures . " Her hand was uplifting , and Mr. Starr rose with it . Together they left the room with cordial good nights , and inviting Mr. Babler to " try the parsonage again . " Prudence listened outside the twins ' door , and heard them breathing loudly . Then she went to her own room , and snuggling down beneath the covers , laughed softly to herself . " Etiquette ! " she gurgled . " Etiquette ! There 's no room for such a thing in a parsonage ,  - -  I see that ! " It speaks well for the courage of Babbie , and the attractions of Fairy , that he came to the parsonage again and again . In time he became the best of friends with the twins themselves , but he always called them " the adorables , " and they never asked him why . The punishment inflicted upon them by Prudence rankled in their memories for many months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in the ingenuity she displayed . The twins considered themselves very nearly as grown-up as Fairy , and the fact that she was a young lady , and they were children , filled their hearts with bitterness . They never lost an opportunity of showing their independence where she was concerned . And with marvelous insight , Prudence used Fairy as her weapon of punishment ,  - -  in fact , the twins called Fairy the " ducking-stool " for many days . " The offense was against Fairy , " said Prudence , with a solemnity she did not feel , " and the reparation must be done to her . For three weeks , you must do all of her bedroom work , and run every errand she requires . Moreover , you must keep her shoes well cleaned and nicely polished , and must do every bit of her darning ! " The twins would have preferred whipping a thousand times . They felt they had got a whipping 's worth of pleasure out of their mischief ! But a punishment like this sat heavily upon their proud young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically immune from their pranks . But Prudence did not bother her head about etiquette after that experience . " I 'm strong for comfort , " she declared , " and since the two can not live together in our family , I say we do without etiquette . " And Fairy nodded in agreement , smiling good-naturedly . CHAPTER VIII THE FIRST DARK SHADOW OF WINTER Prudence and Fairy stood in the bay window of the sitting-room , and looked out at the thickly falling snow . Already the ground was whitely carpeted , and the low-branched peach trees just outside the parsonage windows were beginning to bow down beneath their burdens . " Is n't it beautiful , Prudence ? " whispered Fairy . " Is n't it beautiful ? Oh , I love it when it snows . " " Yes , and you love it when the sun shines , too , " said Prudence , " and when it rains , and when the wind is blowing . You have the soul of a poet , that 's what is the matter with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fairy turned abruptly from the window . " Do n't talk for a minute , Prue ,  - -  I want to write . " So Prudence stood quietly in the window , listening to the pencil scratching behind her . " Listen now , Prue ,  - -  how is this ? " Fairy had a clear expressive voice , " a bright voice , " Prudence called it . And as she read her simple lines aloud , the heart of Prudence swelled with pride . To Prudence , Fairy was a wonderful girl . " Good night , little baby earth , going to sleep , Tucked in your blankets , all woolly and deep . Close your tired eyelids , droop your tired head , Nestle down sweetly within your white bed . Kind Mother Sky , bending softly above , Is holding you close in her bosom of love . Closely she draws the white coverlets warm , She will be near you to shield you from harm . Soon she will set all her candles alight , To scatter the darkness , and save you from fright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , that nothing your slumbers may mar . Rest , little baby earth , rest and sleep tight , The winter has come , and we bid you good night . " Fairy laughed , but her face was flushed . " How is that ? " she demanded . " Oh , Fairy , " cried Prudence , " it is wonderful ! How can you think of such sweet little things ? May I have it ? May I keep it ? Oh , I think it is perfectly dear -- I wish I could do that ! I never in the world would have thought of baby earth going to sleep and Mother Sky tucking her in white blankets.  - -  I think you are just wonderful , Fairy ! " Fairy 's eyes were bright at the praise , but she laughed as she answered . " You always think me and my scribbles perfection , Prue ,  - -  even the love verses that shocked the Ladies ' Aid . You are a bad critic . But does n't the snow make you think -- pretty things , Prudence ? Come now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thinking ? " " I was just wondering if Connie wore her rubbers to school , and if father remembered to take his muffler . " Fairy burst into renewed laughter . " Oh , you precious , old , practical Prudence , " she gurgled . " Rubbers and mufflers , with such a delicious snowfall as this ! Oh , Prudence , shame upon you . " Prudence was ashamed . " Oh , I know I am a perfect idiot , Fairy , " she said . " I know it better than anybody else . I am so ashamed of myself , all the time . " Then she added rather shyly , " Fairy , are you ashamed of me sometimes ? When the college girls are here , and you are all talking so brilliantly , are n't you kind of mortified that I am so stupid and dull ? I do not care if outsiders do think I am inferior to the rest of you , but -- really I do not want you to be ashamed of me ! I -- oh , I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never will , but -- it would hurt if I thought you and the twins were going to find me -- humiliating . " Prudence was looking at her sister hungrily , her lips drooping , her eyes dark . For a long instant Fairy stared at her incredulously . Then she sprang to her feet , her face white , her eyes blazing . " Prudence Starr , " she cried furiously , " how dare you say such things of us ? Do you think we are as despicable as all that ? Oh , Prudence , I never was so insulted in all my life ! Ashamed of you ! Ashamed -- Why , we are proud of you , every one of us , daddy , too ! We think you are the finest and dearest girl that ever lived . We think -- Oh , I think God Himself must be proud of a girl like you , Prudence Starr ! Ashamed of you ! " And Fairy , bursting into tears , rushed wildly out of the room . For all her poetical nature , Fairy was usually self-restrained and calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her so tempest-tossed , and now , greatly disturbed , yet pleased at the passionate avowals , she hurried away in search of her sister . She needed no more assurance of her attitude . So the twins and Connie came into an empty room , and chattered away to themselves abstractedly for an hour . Then Prudence came down . Instantly Connie was asked the all-important question : " Are your feet wet ? " Connie solemnly took three steps across the room . " Hear me sqush , " she said proudly . She did sqush , too ! " Constance Starr , I am ashamed of you ! This is positively wicked . You know it is a law of the Medes and Persians that you change your shoes and stockings as soon as you come in when your feet are wet . Do it at once . I 'll get some hot water so you can soak your feet , too . And you shall drink some good hot peppermint tea , into the bargain . I 'll teach you to sit around in wet clothes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , do n't be so fussy , " said Connie fretfully , " wet feet do n't do any harm . " But she obligingly soaked her feet , and drank the peppermint . " Are your feet wet , twins ? " " No , " said Lark , " we have better judgment than to go splashing through the wet old snow.  - -  What 's the matter with you , Carol ? Why do n't you sit still ? Are your feet wet ? " " No , but it 's too hot in this room . My clothes feel sticky . May I open the door , Prudence ? " " Mercy , no ! The snow is blowing a hurricane now . It is n't very hot in here , Carol . You 've been running outdoors in the cold , and that makes it seem hot . You must peel the potatoes now , twins , it 's time to get supper . Carol , you run up-stairs and ask papa if he got his feet wet . Between him and Connie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter time ! " " You go , Lark , " said Carol . " My head aches . " " Do you want me to rub it ? " asked Prudence , as Lark skipped up-stairs for her twin . " No , it 's just the closeness in here . It does n't ache very bad . If we do n't have more fresh air , we 'll all get something and die , Prudence.  - -  I tell you that . This room is perfectly stuffy.  - -  I do not want to talk any more . " And Carol got up from her chair and walked restlessly about the room . But Carol was sometimes given to moods , and so , without concern , Prudence went to the kitchen to prepare the evening meal . " Papa says his feet are not wet , and that you are a big simpleton , and -- Oh , did you make cinnamon rolls to-day , Prue ? Oh , goody ! Carrie , come on out ! Look , she made cinnamon rolls . " Connie , too , hastened out to the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the watchful Prudence . " I just know you are going to be sick , Connie ,  - -  I feel it in my bones . And walking out in that cold kitchen in your bare feet ! You can just drink some more peppermint tea for that , now . " " Well , give me a cinnamon roll to go with it , " urged Connie . " Peppermint is awfully dry , taken by itself . " Lark hooted gaily at this sentiment , but joined her sister in pleading for cinnamon rolls . " No , wait until supper is ready . You do not need to help peel the potatoes to-night , Carol . Run back where it is warm , and you must not read if your head aches . You read too much anyhow . I 'll help Lark with the potatoes . No , do not take the paper , Carol ,  - -  I said you must not read . " Then Lark and Prudence , working together , and talking much , prepared the supper for the family . When they gathered about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you beginning to feel sick ? Do you feel like sneezing , or any thing ?  - -  Connie 's awfully naughty , papa . Her feet were just oozing water , and she sat there in her wet shoes and stockings , just like a stupid child.  - -  Are n't you going to eat any supper , Carol ? Are you sick ? What is the matter ? Does your head still ache ? " " Oh , it does n't ache exactly , but I do not feel hungry . No , I am not sick , Prudence , so do n't stew about it . I 'm just not hungry . The meat is too greasy , and the potatoes are lumpy . I think I 'll take a cinnamon roll . " But she only picked it to pieces idly . Prudence watched her with the intense suspicious gaze of a frightened mother bird . " There are some canned oysters out there , Carol . If I make you some soup , will you eat it ? " This was a great concession , for the canned oysters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head impatiently . " I am not hungry at all , " she said . " I 'll open some pineapple , or those beautiful pickled peaches Mrs. Adams gave us , or -- or anything , if you 'll just eat something , Carrie . " Still Carol shook her head . " I said I was n't hungry , Prudence . " But her face was growing very red , and her eyes were strangely bright . She moved her hands with unnatural restless motions , and frequently lifted her shoulders in a peculiar manner . " Do your shoulders hurt , Carol ? " asked her father , who was also watching her anxiously . " Oh , it feels kind of -- well -- tight , I guess , in my chest . But it does n't hurt . It hurts a little when I breathe deep . " " Is your throat still sore , Carol ? " inquired Lark . " Do n't you remember saying you could n't swallow when we were coming home from school ? " " It is n't sore now , " said Carol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining-room quickly . " Shall I put flannel on her chest and throat , father ? " asked Prudence nervously . " Yes , and if she gets worse we will call the doctor . It 's probably just a cold , but we must --  --  " " It is n't diphtheria , papa , you know that , " cried Prudence passionately . For there were four reported cases of that dread disease in Mount Mark . But the pain in Carol 's chest did grow worse , and she became so feverish that she began talking in quick broken sentences . " It was too hot !  - -  Do n't go away , Larkie !  - -  Her feet were wet , and it kept squshing out.  - -  I guess I 'm kind of sick , Prue.  - -  Do n't put that thing on my head , it is strangling me !  - -  Oh , I ca n't get my breath ! " And she flung her hand out sharply , as though to push something away from her face . Then Mr. Starr went to the telephone and hurriedly called the doctor . Prudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink flannel nightgown . " Go out in the kitchen , girls , and shut the door , " she said to her sisters , who stood close around the precious twin , so suddenly stricken . " Fairy ! " she cried . " Go at once . It may be catching . Take the others with you . And keep the door shut . " But Lark flung herself on her knees beside her twin , and burst into choking sobs . " I wo n't go , " she cried . " I wo n't leave Carrie . I will not , Prudence ! " " Oh , it is too hot , " moaned Carol . " Oh , give me a drink ! Give me some snow , Prudence . Oh , it hurts ! " And she pressed her burning hands against her chest . " Lark , " said her father , stepping quickly to her side , " go out to the kitchen at once . Do you want to make Carrie worse ? " And Lark , cowed and quivering , rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll carry her up-stairs to bed , Prue , " said her father , striving to render his voice natural for the sake of the suffering oldest daughter , whose tense white face was frightening . Together they carried the child up the stairs . " Put her in our bed , " said Prudence . " I'll -- I'll -- if it 's diphtheria , daddy , she and I will stay upstairs here , and the rest of you must stay down . You can bring our food up to the head of the stairs , and I 'll come out and get it . They ca n't take Carol away from the parsonage . " " We will get a nurse , Prudence . We could n't let you run a risk like that . It would not be right . If I could take care of her properly myself , I --  --  " " You could n't , father , and it would be wicked for you to take such chances . What would the -- others do without you ? But it would not make any difference about me . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm such a healthy girl there will be no danger . But she must not be shut alone with a nurse . She would die ! " And Carol took up the words , screaming , " I will die ! I will die ! Do n't leave me , Prudence . Do n't shut me up alone . Prudence ! Prudence ! " Down-stairs in the kitchen , three frightened girls clung to one another , crying bitterly as they heard poor Carol 's piercing screams . " It is pneumonia , " said the doctor , after an examination . And he looked at Prudence critically . " I think we must have a nurse for a few days . It may be a little severe , and you are not quite strong enough . " Then , as Prudence remonstrated , " Oh , yes , " he granted , " you shall stay with her , but if it is very serious a nurse will be of great service . I will have one come at once . " Then he paused , and listened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't you send those girls away for the night , to some of the neighbors ? It will be much better . " But this the younger girls stubbornly refused to do . " If you send me out of the house when Carol is sick , I will kill myself , " said Lark , in such a strange voice that the doctor eyed her sharply . " Well , if you will all stay down-stairs and keep quiet , so as not to annoy your sister , " he consented grudgingly . " The least sobbing , or confusion , or excitement , may make her much worse . Fix up a bed on the floor down here , all of you , and go to sleep . " " I wo n't go to bed , " said Lark , looking up at the doctor with agonized eyes . " I wo n't go to bed while Carol is sick . " " Give her a cup of something hot to drink , " he said to Fairy curtly . " I wo n't drink anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I wo n't eat a bite of anything until Carol is well . I wo n't sleep , either . " The doctor took her hand in his , and deftly pushed the sleeve above the elbow . " You can twist my arm if you like , but I wo n't eat , and I wo n't drink , and I wo n't sleep . " The doctor smiled . Swiftly inserting the point of his needle in her arm , he released her . " I wo n't hurt you , but I am pretty sure you will be sleeping in a few minutes . " He turned to Fairy . " Get her ready for bed at once . The little one can wait . " An hour later , he came down-stairs again . " Is she sleeping ? " he asked of Fairy in a low voice . " That is good . You have your work cut out for you , my girl . The little one here will be all right , but this twin is in nearly as bad shape as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larkie , too ! " " Oh , she is not sick . But she is too intense . She is taking this too hard . Her system is not well enough developed to stand such a strain very long . Something would give way ,  - -  maybe her brain . She must be watched . She must eat and sleep . There is school to-morrow , is n't there ? " " But I am sure Lark will not go , Doctor . She has never been to school a day in her life without Carol . I am sure she will not go ! " " Let her stay at home , then . Do n't get her excited . But make her work . Keep her doing little tasks about the house , and send her on errands . Talk to her a good deal . Prudence will have her hands full with the other twin , and you 'll have all you can do with this one . I 'm depending on you , my girl . You must n't fail me . " That was the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in delirium most of the time , calling out , crying , screaming affrightedly . And Lark crouched at the foot of the stairs , hands clenched passionately , her slender form tense and motionless . It was four in the afternoon , as the doctor was coming down from the sick room , that Fairy called him into the dining-room with a suggestive glance . " She wo n't eat , " she said . " I have done everything possible , and I had the nurse try . But she will not eat a bite . I -- I 'm sorry , Doctor , but I ca n't make her . " " What has she been doing ? " " She 's been at the foot of the stairs all day . She wo n't do a thing I tell her . She wo n't mind the nurse . Father told her to keep away , too , but she does not pay any attention . When I speak to her , she does not answer . When she hears you coming down , she runs away and hides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father make her eat ? If he commands her ? " " I do not know . I doubt it . But we can try . Here 's some hot soup ,  - -  I 'll call father . " So Lark was brought into the dining-room , and her father came down the stairs . The doctor whispered an explanation to him in the hall . " Lark , " said her father , gently but very firmly , " you must eat , or you will be sick , too . We need all of our time to look after Carol to-day . Do you want to keep us away from her to attend to you ? " " No , father , of course not . I wish you would all go right straight back to Carrie this minute and leave me alone . I 'm all right . But I ca n't eat until Carol is well . " Her father drew a chair to the table and said , " Sit down and eat that soup at once , Larkie . " Lark 's face quivered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . You do n't understand . I ca n't eat ,  - -  I really ca n't . Carrie 's my twin , and -- oh , father , do n't you see how it is ? " He stood for a moment , frowning at her thoughtfully . Then he left the room , signing for the doctor to follow . " I 'll send Prudence down , " he said . " She 'll manage some way . " " I must stay here until I see her eat it , " said the doctor . " If she wo n't do it , she must be kept under morphine for a few days . But it 's better not . Try Prudence , by all means . " So Prudence , white-faced , eyes black-circled , came down from the room where she had served her sister many weary hours . The doctor was standing in the center of the room . Fairy was hovering anxiously near Lark , rigid at the window . " Larkie , " whispered Prudence , and with a bitter cry the young girl leaped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderly . " Poor little Larkie , " she murmured , " poor little twinnie !  - -  But Carol is resting pretty well now , Lark . She 's coming through all right . She was conscious several times to-day . The first time she just looked up at me and smiled and whispered , ' Hard luck , Prue . ' Then a little later she said , ' Tell Larkie I 'm doing fine , and do n't let her worry . ' Pretty soon she spoke again , ' You make Lark be sensible , Prue , or she 'll be sick , too . ' Once again she started to say something about you , but she was too sick to finish . ' Larkie is such a --  , ' but that was as far as she could go . She was thinking of you all the time , Lark . She is so afraid you 'll worry and make yourself sick , too . She would be heartbroken if she was able to see you , and you were too sick to come to her . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she is conscious to-morrow , we 're going to bring you up a while to see her . She can hardly stand being away from you , I know . But you must get out-of-doors , and bring some color to your cheeks , first . It would make her miserable to see you like this . " Lark was still sobbing , but more gently now , and she still clung to her sister . " To-morrow , Prudence ? Honestly , may I go up to-morrow ? You 're not just fooling me , are you ? You would n't do that ! " " Of course I would n't . Yes , you really may , if you 'll be good and make yourself look better . It would be very bad for Carrie to see you so white and wan . She would worry . Have you been eating ? You must eat lots , and then take a good run out-of-doors toward bedtime , so you will sleep well . It will be a good tonic for Carol to see you bright and fresh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fresh and rosy when Carrie is sick ! " " It hurts ,  - -  but you are willing to be hurt for Carol 's sake ! You will do it on her account . It will do her so much good . Now sit down and eat your soup , and I 'll stay here a while and tell you all about her . I gave her the pansies you bought her , it was so sweet of you , too , Larkie . It must have taken every cent of your money , did n't it ? I suppose you ordered them over the telephone , since you would n't leave the house . When I told Carol you got them for her , she took them in her hand and held them under the covers . Of course , they wilted right away , but I knew you would like Carrie to have them close to her . '  - -  Oh , you must eat it all , Lark . It looks very good . I must take a little of it up to Carol ,  - -  maybe she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strong and bright and rosy -- for Carol -- wo n't you ? " " Yes , I will ,  - -  I 'll go and run across the field a few times before I go to bed . Yes , I 'll try my very best . " Then she looked up at the doctor , and added : " But I would n't do it for you , or anybody else , either . " But the doctor only smiled oddly , and went away up-stairs again , wondering at the wisdom that God has placed in the hearts of women ! Dreary miserable days and nights followed after that . And Prudence , to whom Carol , even in delirium , clung with such wildness that they dare not deny her , grew weary-eyed and wan . But when the doctor , putting his hand on her shoulder , said , " It 's all right now , my dear . She 'll soon be as well as ever , "  - -  then Prudence dropped limply to the floor , trembling weakly with the great happiness . Good Methodist friends from all over Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many gifts and delicacies and knick-knacks were sent in to tempt the appetite of the invalid , and the others as well . " You all need toning up , " said Mrs. Adams crossly , " you 've all gone clear under . A body would think the whole family had been down with something ! " Carol 's friends at the high school , and the members of the faculty also , took advantage of this opportunity to show their love for her . And Professor Duke sent clear to Burlington for a great basket of violets and lilies-of-the-valley , " For our little high-school song-bird , " as he wrote on the card . And Carol dimpled with delight as she read it . " Now you see for yourself , Prudence , " she declared . " Is n't he a duck ? " When the little parsonage group , entire , gathered once more around the table in the " real dining-room , " they were joyful indeed . It was a gala occasion ! The very best china and silverware were brought out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gratified the heart of a bishop , at the very least ! " Apple pie , with pure cream , Carol , " said Lark ecstatically , for apple pie with pure cream was the favorite dessert of the sweet-toothed twins . And Lark added earnestly , " And I do n't seem to be very hungry to-night , Carol ,  - -  I do n't want any pie . You shall have my piece , too ! " " I said I felt it in my bones , you remember , " said Prudence , smiling at Carol , " but my mental compass indicated Connie when it should have pointed to Carol ! And I do hope , Connie dear , that this will be a lesson to you , and impress upon you that you must always change your shoes and stockings when your feet are wet ! " And for the first time in many days , clear , happy-hearted laughter rang out in the parsonage . CHAPTER IX PRACTISING ECONOMY It was a dull dreary day early in December . Prudence and Fairy were sewing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to have all the scraps out of the way before Connie gets home , " said Prudence , carefully fitting together pieces of a dark , warm , furry material . " It has been so long since father wore this coat , I am sure she will not recognize it . " " But she will ask where we got it , and what shall we say ? " " We must tell her it is goods we have had in the house for a long time . That is true . And I made this fudge on purpose to distract her attention . If she begins to ask questions , we must urge her to have more candy . Poor child ! " she added very sympathetically . " Her heart is just set on a brand-new coat . I know she will be bitterly disappointed . If the members would just pay up we could get her one . November and December are such bad months for parsonage people . Coal to buy , feed for the cow and the horse and the chickens , and Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those last are not regular winter expenses , but they took a lot of money this year . Every one is getting ready for Christmas now , and forgets that parsonage people need Christmas money , too . November and December are always my bitter months , Fairy ,  - -  bitter months ! " Fairy took a pin from her mouth . " The velvet collar and cuffs will brighten it up a good bit . It 's really a pretty material . I have honestly been ashamed of Connie the last few Sundays . It was so cold , and she wore only that little thin summer jacket . She must have been half frozen . " " Oh , I had her dressed warmly underneath , very warmly indeed , " declared Prudence . " But no matter how warm you are underneath , you look cold if you are n't visibly prepared for winter weather . It 's a fortunate thing the real cold weather was so slow in coming . I kept hoping enough money would come in to buy her a coat for once in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one long enough , " put in Fairy . " This will be a bitter blow to her . And yet it is not such a bad-looking coat , after all . " And she quickly ran up a seam on the machine . " Here comes Connie ! " Prudence hastily swept a pile of scraps out of sight , and turned to greet her little sister with a cheery smile . " Come on in , Connie , " she cried , with a brightness she did not feel . " Fairy and I are making you a new coat . Is n't it pretty ? And so warm ! See the nice velvet collar and cuffs . We want to fit it on you right away , dear . " Connie picked up a piece of the goods and examined it intently . " Do n't you want some fudge , Connie ? " exclaimed Fairy , shoving the dish toward her hurriedly . Connie took a piece from the plate , and thrust it between her teeth . Her eyes were still fastened upon the brown furry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she inquired , as soon as she was able to speak . " Oh , we 've had it in the house quite a while , " said Prudence , adding swiftly , " Is n't it warm , Connie ? Oh , it does look nice , does n't it , Fairy ? Do you want it a little shorter , Connie , or is that about right ? " " About right , I guess . Did you ever have a coat like this , Prudence ? I do n't seem to remember it . ' " " Oh , no , it was n't mine . Take some more candy , Connie . Is n't it good ?  - -  Let 's put a little more fullness in the sleeves , Fairy . It 's more stylish this year.  - -  The collar fits very nicely . The velvet gives it such a rich tone . And brown is so becoming to you . " " Thanks , " said Connie patiently . " Was this something of yours , Fairy ? " " Oh , no , we 've just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in very handy right now , does n't it ? It 'll make you such a serviceable , stylish coat . Is n't it about time for the twins to get here , Prudence ? I 'm afraid they are playing along the road . Those girls get more careless every day of their lives . " " Well , if this did n't belong to one of you , whose was it ? " demanded Connie . " I know the twins never had anything like this . It looks kind of familiar to me . Where did it come from ? " " Out of the trunk in the garret , Connie . Do n't you want some more fudge ? I put a lot of nuts in , especially on your account . " " It 's good , " said Connie , taking another piece . She examined the cloth very closely . " Say , Prudence , is n't this that old brown coat of father 's ? " Fairy shoved her chair back from the machine , and ran to the window . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that Mrs. Adams coming this way ? I wonder --  --  " " No , it is n't , " answered Connie gravely . " It 's just Miss Avery getting home from school.  - -  Is n't it , Prudence ? Father 's coat , I mean ? " " Yes , Connie , it is , " said Prudence , very , very gently . " But no one here has seen it , and it is such nice cloth ,  - -  just exactly what girls are wearing now . " " But I wanted a new coat ! " Connie did not cry . She stood looking at Prudence with her wide hurt eyes . " Oh , Connie , I 'm just as sorry as you are , " cried Prudence , with starting tears . " I know just how you feel about it , dearest . But the people did n't pay father up last month , and nothing has come in for this month yet , and we 've had so much extra expense.  - -  I will have to wear my old shoes , too , Connie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't worth fixing , so I must wear them as they are.  - -  But maybe after Christmas we can get you a coat . They pay up better then . " " I think I 'd rather wear my summer coat until then , " said Connie soberly . " Oh , but you ca n't , dearest . It is too cold . Wo n't you be a good girl now , and not make sister feel badly about it ? It really is becoming to you , and it is nice and warm . You know parsonage people just have to practise economy , Connie , it ca n't be helped . Take some more fudge , dear , and run out-of-doors a while . You 'll feel better about it presently , I 'm sure . " Connie stood solemnly beside the table , her eyes still fastened on the coat , cut down from her father 's . " Can I go and take a walk ? " she asked finally . " May I , you mean , " suggested Fairy . " Yes , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , do go and take a walk , " urged Prudence promptly , eager to get the small sober face beyond her range of vision . " If I am not back when the twins get home , go right on and eat without me . I 'll come back when I get things straightened out in my mind . " When Connie was quite beyond hearing , Prudence dropped her head on the table and wept . " Oh , Fairy , if the members just knew how such things hurt , maybe they 'd pay up a little better . How do they expect parsonage people to keep up appearances when they have n't any money ? " " Oh , now , Prue , you 're worse than Connie ! There 's no use to cry about it . Parsonage people have to find happiness in spite of financial misery . Money is n't the first thing with folks like us . " " No , but they have pledged it , " protested Prudence , lifting her tear-stained face . " They must know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they keep their pledges ? They pay their meat bills , and grocery bills , and house rent ! Why do n't they pay for their religion ? " " Now , Prue , you know how things go . Mrs. Adams is having a lot of Christmas expense , and she thinks her four dollars a month wo n't really be missed . She thinks she will make it up along in February , when Christmas is over . But she forgets that Mrs. Barnaby with two dollars , and Mrs. Scott with five , and Mr. Walter with seven , and Mr. Holmes with three , and about thirty others with one dollar each , are thinking the same thing ! Each member thinks for himself , and takes no account of the others . That 's how it happens . " Prudence squirmed uncomfortably in her chair . " I wish you would n't mention names , Fairy , " she begged . " I do not object to lumping them in a body and wondering about them . But I ca n't feel right about calling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not really know which ones they are who did not pay . " " I was just giving names for illustrative purposes , " said Fairy quickly . " Like as not , the very ones I named are the ones who did pay . " " Well , get this stuff out of the way , and let 's set the table . Somehow I ca n't bear to touch it any more . Poor little Connie ! If she had cried about it , I would n't have cared so much . But she looked so -- heartsick , did n't she , Fairy ? " Connie certainly was heartsick . More than that , she was a little disgusted . She felt herself aroused to take action . Things had gone too far ! Go to church in her father 's coat she could not ! But they had n't the money . If Connie 's father had been at home , perhaps they might have reasoned it out together . But he had left town that morning , and would not be home until Saturday evening ,  - -  too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Prudence had said that Connie must be coated by Sunday ! She walked sturdily down the street toward the " city , "  - -  ironically so called . Her face was stony , her hands were clenched . But finally she brightened . Her lagging steps quickened . She skipped along quite cheerfully . She turned westward as she reached the corner of the Square , and walked along that business street with shining eyes . In front of the First National Bank she paused , but after a few seconds she passed by . On the opposite corner was another bank . When she reached it , she walked in without pausing , and the massive door swung behind her . Standing on tiptoe , she confronted the cashier with a grave face . " Is Mr. Harold in ? " she asked politely . Mr. Harold was the president of the bank ! It was a little unusual . " Yes , he is in , " said the cashier doubtfully , " but he is very busy . " " Will you tell him that Constance Starr wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very important ? " The cashier smiled . " The Methodist minister 's little girl , is n't it ? Yes , I will tell him . " Mr. Harold looked up impatiently at the interruption . " It 's the Methodist minister 's little daughter , and she says it is important for her to speak to you privately . " " Oh ! Probably a message from her father . Bring her in . " Mr. Harold was one of the trustees of the Methodist church , and prominent among them . His keen eyes were intent upon Connie as she walked in , but she did not falter . " How do you do , Mr. Harold ? " she said , and shook hands with him in the good old Methodist way . His eyes twinkled , but he spoke briskly . " Did your father send you on an errand ? " " No , father is out of town . I came on business ,  - -  personal business , Mr. Harold . It is my own affair . " " Oh , I see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , what can I do for you , Miss Constance ? " " I want to borrow five dollars from the bank , Mr. Harold ? " " You -- did Prudence send you ? " " Oh , no , it is my own affair as I told you . I came on my own account . I thought of stopping at the other bank as I passed , but then I remembered that parsonage people must always do business with their own members if possible . And of course , I would rather come to you than to a perfect stranger . " " Thank you ,  - -  thank you very much . Five dollars you say you want ? " " I suppose I had better tell you all about it . You see , I need a winter coat , very badly . Oh , very badly , indeed ! The girls were ashamed of me last Sunday , I looked so cold outside , though I was dressed plenty warm enough inside . I 've been looking forward to a new coat , Mr. Harold . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut down for me , from Prudence , or Fairy , or the twins . But this time there was n't anything to hand down , and so I just naturally counted on a new one . " Connie paused , and looked embarrassed . " Yes ? " His voice was encouraging . " Well , I 'll tell you the rest , but I hope you wo n't say anything about it , for I 'd feel pretty cheap if I thought all the Sunday-school folks knew about it.  - -  You see , the members need such a lot of money now just before Christmas , and so they did n't pay us up last month , and they have n't paid anything this month . And we had to get coal , and feed , and Larkie 's teeth had to be fixed , and Carol was sick , you remember . Seems to me Lark 's teeth might have been put off until after Christmas , but But Prudence and Fairy are making me one , out of an old coat of father 's ! " Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just nodded understandingly . " I do n't think I could wear a coat of father 's to church , it 's cut down of course , but -- there 's something painful about the idea . I would n't expect father to wear any of my clothes ! You can see how it is , Mr. Harold . Just imagine how you would feel wearing your wife 's coat !  - -  I do n't think I could listen to the sermons . I do n't believe I could be thankful for the mercy of wearing father 's coat ! I do n't see anything merciful about it . Do you ? " Mr. Harold did not speak . He gazed at Connie sympathetically , and shook his head . " It 's too much , that 's what it is . And so I thought I 'd just have to take things into my own hands and borrow the money . I can get a good coat for five dollars . But if the bank is a little short right now , I can get along with four , or even three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one made out of father 's . Do you think you can let me have it ? " " Yes , indeed we can . " He seemed to find his voice with an effort . " Of course we can . We are very glad to lend our money to responsible people . We are proud to have your trade . " " But I must tell you , that it may take me quite a while to pay it back . Father gives me a nickel a week , and I generally spend it for candy . There 's another nickel , but it has to go in the collection , so I ca n't really count that . I do n't believe father would let me neglect the heathen , even to pay for a winter coat ! But I will give you the nickel every week , and at that rate I can pay it back in a couple of years easy enough . But I 'd rather give the nickels as fast as I get them . It 's so hard to keep money when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes I have quite a lot of money ,  - -  as much as a quarter at a time , from doing errands for the neighbors and things like that . I 'll pay you as fast as I can . Will that be all right ? And the interest , too , of course . How much will the interest be on five dollars ? " " Well , that depends on how soon you repay the money , Connie . But I 'll figure it out , and tell you later . " " All right . I know I can trust you not to cheat me , since you 're a trustee . So I wo n't worry about that . " Mr. Harold drew out a bulky book from his pocket , and handed Connie a crisp new bill . Her eyes sparkled as she received it . " But , Connie , " he continued , " I feel that I ought to give you this . We Methodists have done a wicked thing in forgetting our November payments , and I will just give you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head decidedly . " Oh , no ! I 'll have to give it back , then . Father would not stand that , not for one minute . Of course , parsonage people get things given to them , quite a lot . And it 's a good thing , too , I must say ! But we do n't hint for them , Mr. Harold . That would n't be right . " She held out the bill toward him , with very manifest reluctance . " Keep it ,  - -  we 'll call it a loan then , Connie , " he said . " And you may pay me back , five cents at a time , just as is most convenient . " The four older girls were at the table when Connie arrived . She exhaled quiet satisfaction from every pore . Prudence glanced at her once , and then looked away again . " She has reconciled herself , " she thought . Dinner was half over before Constance burst her bomb . She had intended waiting until they were quite through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Are you going to be busy this afternoon , Prudence ? " she asked quietly . " We are going to sew a little , " said Prudence . " Why ? " " I wanted you to go down-town with me after school . " " Well , perhaps I can do that . Fairy will be able to finish the coat alone . " " You need n't finish the coat !  - -  I ca n't wear father 's coat to church , Prudence . It 's a -- it 's a -- physical impossibility . " The twins laughed . Fairy smiled , but Prudence gazed at " the baby " with tender pity . " I 'm so sorry , dearest , but we have n't the money to buy one now . " " Will five dollars be enough ? " inquired Connie , and she placed her crisp new bill beside her plate . The twins gasped ! They gazed at Connie with new respect . They were just wishing they could handle five-dollar bills so recklessly . " Will you loan me twenty dollars until after Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Where did you get this money , Connie ? " " I borrowed it ,  - -  from the bank , " Connie replied with proper gravity . " I have two years to pay it back . Mr. Harold says they are proud to have my trade . " Prudence was silent for several long seconds . Then she inquired in a low voice , " Did you tell him why you wanted it ? " " Yes , I explained the whole situation . " " What did he say ? " " He said he knew just how I felt , because he knew he could n't go to church in his wife 's coat.  - -  No , I said that myself , but he agreed with me . He did not say very much , but he looked sympathetic . He said he anticipated great pleasure in seeing me in my new coat at church next Sunday . " " Go on with your luncheon , twins , " said Prudence sternly . " You 'll be late to school.  - -  We 'll see about going down-town when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luncheon , and do n't talk about coats any more . " When Connie had gone back to school , Prudence went straight to Mr. Harold 's bank . Flushed and embarrassed , she explained the situation frankly . " My sympathies are all with Connie , " she said candidly . " But I am afraid father would not like it . We are dead set against borrowing . After -- our mother was taken , we were crowded pretty close for money . So we had to go in debt . It took us two years to get it paid . Father and Fairy and I talked it over then , and decided we would starve rather than borrow again . Even the twins understood it , but Connie was too little . She does n't know how heartbreaking it is to keep handing over every cent for debt , when one is just yearning for other things.  - -  I do wish she might have the coat , but I 'm afraid father would not like it . She gave me the five dollars for safekeeping , and I have brought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Connie must have her coat . This will be a good lesson for her . It will teach her the bitterness of living under debt ! Besides , Prudence , I think in my heart that she is right this time . This is a case where borrowing is justified . Get her the coat , and I 'll square the account with your father . " Then he added , " And I 'll look after this salary business myself after this . I 'll arrange with the trustees that I am to pay your father his full salary the first of every month , and that the church receipts are to be turned in to me . And if they do not pay up , my lawyer can do a little investigating ! Little Connie earned that five dollars , for she taught one trustee a sorry lesson . And he will have to pass it on to the others in self-defense ! Now , run along and get the coat , and if five dollars is n't enough you can have as much more as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear , if we have to mortgage the parsonage ! " CHAPTER X A BURGLAR 'S VISIT " Prue ! " A small hand gripped Prudence 's shoulder , and again came a hoarsely whispered : " Prue ! " Prudence sat up in bed with a bounce . " What in the world ? " she began , gazing out into the room , half-lighted by the moonshine , and seeing Carol and Lark shivering beside her bed . " Sh ! Sh ! Hush ! " whispered Lark . " There 's a burglar in our room ! " By this time , even sound-sleeping Fairy was awake . " Oh , there is ! " she scoffed . " Yes , there is , " declared Carol with some heat . " We heard him , plain as day . He stepped into the closet , did n't he , Lark ? " " He certainly did , " agreed Lark . " Did you see him ? " " No , we heard him . Carol heard him first , and she spoke , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was at our dresser , but he shot across the room and into the closet . He closed the door after him . He 's there now . " " You 've been dreaming , " said Fairy , lying down again . " We do n't generally dream the same thing at the same minute , " said Carol stormily . " I tell you he 's in there . " " And you two great big girls came off and left poor little Connie in there alone with a burglar , did you ? Well , you are nice ones , I must say . " And Prudence leaped out of bed and started for the door , followed by Fairy , with the twins creeping fearfully along in the rear . " She was asleep , " muttered Carol . " We did n't want to scare her , " added Lark . Prudence was careful to turn the switch by the door , so that the room was in full light before she entered . The closet door was wide open . Connie was soundly sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You see ? " said Prudence sternly . " I 'll bet he took our ruby rings , " declared Lark , and the twins and Fairy ran to the dresser to look . But a sickening realization had come home to Prudence . In the lower hall , under the staircase , was a small dark closet which they called the dungeon . The dungeon door was big and solid , and was equipped with a heavy catch-lock . In this dungeon , Prudence kept the family silverware , and all the money she had on hand , as it could there be safely locked away . But more often than not , Prudence forgot to lock it . Mr. Starr had gone to Burlington that morning to attend special revival services for three days , and Prudence had fifty whole dollars in the house , an unwonted sum in that parsonage ! And the dungeon was not locked . Without a word , she slipped softly out of the room , ran down the stairs , making never a sound in her bare feet , and saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . Quickly she flung it shut , pushed the tiny key that moved the " catch , " and was rushing up the stairs again with never a pause for breath . A strange sight met her eyes in the twins ' room . The twins themselves were in each other 's arms , sobbing bitterly . Fairy was still looking hurriedly through the dresser drawers . " They are gone , " wailed Carol , " our beautiful ruby rings that belonged to grandmother . " " Nonsense , " cried Prue with nervous anger , " you 've left them in the bathroom , or on the kitchen shelves . You 're always leaving them somewhere over the place . Come on , and we 'll search the house just to convince you . " " No , no , " shrieked the twins . " Let 's lock the door and get under the bed . " The rings were really valuable . Their grandmother , their mother 's mother , whom they had never seen , had divided her " real jewelry " between her two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had further divided her portion to make it reach through her own family of girls ! Prudence had a small but beautiful chain of tiny pearls . Fairy 's share consisted of a handsome brooch , with a " sure-enough diamond " in the center ! The twin rubies of another brooch had been reset in rings for Carol and Lark , and were the priceless treasures of their lives ! And in the dungeon was a solid gold bracelet , waiting until Connie 's arm should be sufficiently developed to do it justice . " Our rings ! Our rings ! " the twins were wailing , and Connie , awakened by the noise , was crying beneath the covers of her bed . " Maybe we 'd better phone for Mr. Allan , " suggested Fairy . " The girls are so nervous they will be hysterical by the time we finish searching the house . " " Well , let 's do the up-stairs then , " said Prudence . " Get your slippers and kimonos , and we 'll go into daddy 's room . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger girls clinging to her , and Fairy looking odd and disturbed , Prudence stopped abruptly and stared about the room curiously . " Fairy , did n't father leave his watch hanging on that nail by the table ? Seems to me I saw it there this morning . I remember thinking I would tease him for being forgetful . " And the watch was not there . " I think it was Sunday he left it , " answered Fairy in a low voice . " I remember seeing it on the nail , and thinking he would need it ,  - -  but I believe it was Sunday . " Prudence looked under the bed , and in the closet , but their father 's room was empty . Should they go farther ? For a moment , the girls stood looking at one another questioningly . Then -- they heard a loud thud down-stairs , as of some one pounding on a door . There was no longer any doubt . Some one was in the house ! Connie and the twins screamed again and clung to Prudence frantically . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and stay right here until morning , Prue . " But Prudence faced them stubbornly . " If you think I 'm going to let any one steal that fifty dollars , you are mistaken . Fifty dollars does not come often enough for that , I can tell you . " " It 's probably stolen already , " objected Fairy . " Well , if it is , we 'll find out who did it , and have them arrested . I 'm going down to telephone to the police . You girls must lock the door after me , and stay right here . " The little ones screamed again , and Fairy said : " Do n't be silly , Prue , if you go I 'm going with you , of course . We 'll leave the kiddies here and they can lock the door . They 'll be perfectly safe in here . " But the children loudly objected to this . If Prue and Fairy went , they would go ! So down the stairs they trooped , a timorous trembling crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called up the residence of the Allans , their neighbors across the street . After a seemingly never-ending wait , the kind-hearted neighbor left his bed to answer the insistent telephone . Falteringly Prudence explained their predicament , and asked him to come and search the house . He promised to be there in five minutes , with his son to help . " Now , " said Prudence more cheerfully , " we 'll just go out to the kitchen and wait . It 's quiet there , and away from the rest of the house , and we 'll be perfectly safe . " To the kitchen , then , they hurried , and found real comfort in its smallness and secureness . Prudence raked up the dying embers of the fire , and Fairy drew the blinds to their lowest limits . The twins and Connie trailed them fearfully at every step . When the fire was burning brightly , Prudence spoke with great assurance . " I 'll just run in to the dungeon and see for sure if the money is there . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ca n't rest until I know that money is safe . " " You 'll do nothing of the sort , " said Fairy , " you 'll stay right here and wait with us . I do not believe there 's any one in the house , either , but if there is , you sha n't run into him by yourself . You stay right where you are , and do n't be silly . Mr. Allan will do the investigating . " Every breath of wind against the windows drew startled cries from the younger girls , and both Fairy and Prudence were white with anxiety when they heard the loud voices of the Allans outside the kitchen door . Prudence began crying nervously the moment the two angels of mercy appeared before her , and Fairy told their tale of woe . " Well , there now , " Mr. Allan said with rough sympathy , " you just got scared , that 's all . Everything 's suspicious when folks get scared . I told my wife the other day I bet you girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on , Jim , and we 'll go over the house in a jiffy . " He was standing near the dining-room door . He lifted his head suddenly , and seemed to sniff a little . There was undoubtedly a faint odor of tobacco in the house . " Been any men in here to-night ? " he asked . " Or this afternoon ? Think , now ! " " No one , " answered Prudence . " I was alone all afternoon , and there has been no one in this evening . " He passed slowly through the dining-room into the hall , closely followed by his son and the five girls , already much reassured . As he passed the dungeon door he paused for a moment , listening intently , his head bent . " Oh , Mr. Allan , " cried Prudence , " let 's look in the dungeon first . I want to see if the money is safe . " Her hand was already on the lock , but he shoved her away quickly . " Is there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " No . We call it the dungeon , " laughed Prudence , her self-possession quite recovered . " It is right under the stairs , and not even a mouse could gnaw its way out , with this door shut . " " Who shut that door ? " he inquired , still holding Prudence 's hand from the lock . Then without waiting for an answer , he went on , " Let 's go back in the other room a minute . Come on , all of you . " In the living-room , he hurried to the telephone , and spoke to the operator in a low voice . " Call the police headquarters , and have them send two or three men to the Methodist parsonage , right away . We 've got a burglar locked in a closet , and they 'll have to get him out . Please hurry . " At this , the girls crowded around him again in renewed fear . " Do n't be scared , " he said calmly , " we 're all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a while . Now , tell me about it . How did you get him in the closet ? Begin at the beginning , and tell me all about it . " Carol began the story with keen relish . " I woke up , and thought I heard some one in the room . I supposed it was Prudence . I said , ' Prudence , ' and nobody answered , and everything was quiet . ' But I felt there was some one in there . I nudged Lark , and she woke up . He moved then , and we both heard him . He was fumbling at the dresser , and our ruby rings are gone . We heard him step across the room and into the closet . He closed the door after him , did n't he , Lark ? " " Yes , he did , " agreed Lark . " His hand was on the knob . " " So we sneaked out of bed , and went into Prudence 's room and woke her and Fairy . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we did n't waken her because we did n't want to frighten her . We woke the girls ,  - -  and you tell the rest , Prudence . " " We did n't believe her , of course . We went back into their room and there was no one there . But the rings were gone . While they were looking at the dresser , I remembered that I forgot to lock the dungeon door , where we keep the money and the silverware , and I ran down-stairs and slammed the door and locked it , and went back up . I did n't hear a sound down-stairs . " Mr. Allan laughed heartily . " Well , your burglar was in that closet after the money , no doubt , and he did n't hear you coming , and got locked in . Did you make any noise coming down the stairs ? " " No . I was in my bare feet , and I tried to be quiet because if there was any one in the house , I did not want him coming at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we looked in father 's room . I thought father had forgotten to take his watch with him , but it was n't there.  - -  Do you really think it was Sunday he forgot it , Fairy ? " " No , " said Fairy , " it was there this afternoon . The burglar 's got it in the dungeon with him , of course.  - -  I just said it was Sunday to keep from scaring the twins . " In a few minutes , they heard footsteps around the house and knew the officers had arrived . Mr. Allan let them into the house , four of them , and led them out to the hall . There could be no doubt whatever that the burglar was in the dungeon . He had been busy with his knife , and the lock was nearly removed . If the officers had been two minutes later , the dungeon would have been empty . The girls were sent up-stairs at once , with the Allan boy as guard , as guard , without regard for the fact that he was probably more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapped briskly on the dungeon door . Then he clicked his revolver . " There are enough of us to overpower three of you , " he said curtly . " And we have men outside the house , too . If you make any disturbance , we shall all fire the instant the door is opened . If you put your firearms on the floor , and hold both hands over your head , you 'll be well treated . If your hands are not up , we fire on sight . Get your revolvers ready , boys . " Then the officer opened the door . Evidently the burglar was wise enough to appreciate the futility of fighting against odds . Perhaps he did not wish to add the charge of manslaughter to that of robbery . Certainly , he did not feel himself called to sudden death . At any rate , his hands were above his head , and in less than a second he was securely manacled . The chief officer had been eying him closely . " Say ! " he exclaimed . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did not answer . " By jove ! " shouted the officer . " It is ! Call the girls down here , " he ordered , and when they appeared , gazing at the burglar with mingled admiration , pity and fear , he congratulated them with considerable excitement . " It 's Limber-Limb Grant , " he explained . " There 's a reward of five hundred dollars for him . You 'll get the money , as sure as you 're born . " Then he turned again to the burglar . " Say , Grant , what 's a fellow like you doing on such a fifth-rate job as this ? A Methodist parsonage is not just in your line , is it ? " Limber-Limb laughed sheepishly . " Well , " he explained good-naturedly , " Chicago got too hot for me . I had to get out in a hurry , and I could n't get my hands on any money . I had a fine lot of jewels , but I was so pushed I could n't use them . I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks said Mount Mark was so fast asleep it did not even wake up long enough to read the daily papers . I heard about this parsonage bunch , and knew the old man had gone off to get more religion . This afternoon at the station I saw a detective from Chicago get off the train , and I knew what that meant . But I needed some cash , and so I was n't above a little job on the side . I never dreamed of getting done up by a bunch of preacher 's kids . I went upstairs to get those family jewels I 've heard about , and one of the little ones gave the alarm . I already had some of them , so I came down at once . I stopped in the dungeon to get that money , and first thing I knew the door banged shut . That 's all . You 're welcome to the five hundred dollars , ladies . Some one was bound to get it sooner or later , and I 'm partial to the ladies , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new class . At that moment , in Chicago , he had in storage , a hundred thousand dollars ' worth of jewels , which he could not dispose of on the pressure of the moment . The law was crowding him close , and he was obliged to choose between meeting the law , or running away from it . He ran . He reached Mount Mark , and trusted to its drowsiness for concealment for a few weeks . But that afternoon the arrival of a detective gave him warning , and he planned his departure promptly . A parsonage occupied by only five girls held no terrors for him , and with fifty dollars and a few fairly good jewels , a man of his talent could accomplish wonders . But Mount Mark had aroused from its lethargy . Limber-Limb Grant was in the hands of the law . Mr. Starr had been greatly interested in the accounts of the evangelistic services being held in Burlington . The workers were meeting with marked success , and Mr. Starr felt he should get in touch with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Burlington . There he sought out a conveniently located second-class hotel , and took up residence . He attended the services at the tabernacle in the afternoon and evening , and then went to bed at the hotel . He slept late the next morning . When he finally appeared , he noticed casually , without giving it thought , that the clerk behind the desk looked at him with marked interest . Mr. Starr nodded cheerfully , and the clerk came at once from behind the desk to speak to him . Two or three other guests , who had been lounging about , drew near . " We 've just been reading about your girls , sir , " said the clerk respectfully . " It 's a pretty nervy little bunch ! You must be proud of them ! " " My girls ! " ejaculated Mr. Starr . " Have n't you seen the morning paper ? You 're Mr. Starr , the Methodist minister at Mount Mark , are n't you ? " " I am ! But what has happened to my girls ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Starr was greatly agitated . He showed it . But the clerk could not lose this opportunity to create a sensation . It was a chance of a life-time . " Why , a burglar got in the parsonage last night , " he began , almost licking his lips with satisfaction . " The twins heard him at their dresser , and when he stepped into the closet they locked him in there , and yelled for the rest of the family . But he broke away from them , and went , down-stairs and climbed down into the dungeon to get the money . Then Prudence , she ran down-stairs alone in the dark , and locked him in the dungeon ,  - -  pushed him down-stairs or something like that , I believe ,  - -  and then telephoned for the police . And she stayed on guard outside the dungeon until the police got there , so he could n't get away . And the police got him , and found it was Limber-Limb Grant , a famous gentleman thief , and your girls are going to get five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Starr and his suit-case were in a taxicab speeding toward Union Station , and within eight minutes he was en route for Mount Mark , white in the face , shaky in the knees , but tremendously proud in spirit . Arriving at Mount Mark , he was instantly surrounded by an exclamatory crowd of station loungers . " Ride , sir ? Glad to take you home for nothing , " urged Harvey Reel . Mount Mark was enjoying more notoriety than ever before in the two hundred years of its existence . The name of Prudence was upon every tongue , and her father heard it with satisfaction . In the parsonage he found at least two-thirds of the Ladies ' Aid Society , the trustees and the Sunday-school superintendent , along with a miscellaneous assortment of ordinary members , mixed up with Presbyterians , Baptists and a few unclassified outsiders . And Prudence was the center of attraction . She was telling the " whole story , " for perhaps the fifteenth time that morning , but she broke off when her father hurried in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she cried , " they must n't praise me . I had no idea there was a burglar in the house when I ran down the stairs , and if I had n't been careless and left the dungeon unlocked the money would have been in no danger , and if the twins had n't wakened me I would n't have known there was a burglar about the place , and if Fairy had n't kept me from rushing out to the dungeon to see if the money was safe , he would have got away , and -- it took the policemen to get him out . Oh , I know that is not very grammatical , father , but it 's just as true as if it were ! And I honestly ca n't see that much credit is due me . " But Mount Mark did not take it so calmly . And as for the Methodist church , well , the Presbyterian people used to say there was " no living with those Methodists , since the girls caught a burglar in the parsonage . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view . Pictures of the parsonage and the church were in all the papers for miles around , and at their very next meeting the trustees decided to get the piano the Sunday-school had been needing for the last hundred years ! When the five hundred dollars arrived from Chicago , Prudence felt that personally she had no real right to the money . " We must divide it , " she insisted , " for I did n't earn it a bit more than any of the others . But it is perfectly glorious to have five hundred dollars , is n't it ? Did you ever have five hundred dollars before ? Just take it , father , and use it for whatever we need . It 's family money . " But he would not hear of this . " No , " he said , " put it in the bank , Prudence , for there will come a time when you will want money very badly . Then you will have it . " " Let 's divide it then ,  - -  a hundred for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls nor their father would consent to this . But when Prudence stood very firm , and pleaded with them earnestly , they decided to divide it . " I will deposit two hundred and fifty dollars for the four younger ones , " he said , " and that will leave you as much . " So it was settled , and Prudence was a happy girl when she saw it safely put away in the bank . " We can get it whenever we really need it , you know , " she told her father joyfully . " It 's such a comfort to know it 's there ! I feel just like a millionaire , I am sure . Do you think it would be all right to send Limber-Limb Grant a letter of thanks for it ? We were horribly scared , but -- well , I for one am willing to be horribly scared for such a lot of money as that ! " CHAPTER XI ROMANCE COMES Sometimes , Methodists , or Presbyterians or heretics , whatever we may be , we are irresistibly impelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However slight the cause ,  - -  still that cause was predestined from the beginning of time . A girl may by the sheerest accident , step from the street-car a block ahead of her destination , an irritating incident . But as she walks that block she may meet an old-time friend , and a stranger . And that stranger , ah , you can never convince the girl that her stepping from the car too soon was not ordered when the foundations of the world were laid . Even so with Prudence , good Methodist daughter that she was . We ask her , " What if you had not gone out for a ride that morning ? " And Prudence , laughing , answers , " Oh , but I had to go , you see . " " Well , " we continue , " if you had not met him that way , you could have met him some other way , I suppose . " " Oh , no , " declares Prudence decidedly , " it had to happen just that way . " After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very simple . Across the street from the parsonage was a little white cottage set back among tall cedars . In this cottage lived a girl named Mattie Moore ,  - -  a common , unlovely , unexciting girl , with whom Romance could not apparently be intimately concerned . Mattie Moore taught a country school five miles out from town , and she rode to and from her school , morning and evening , on a bicycle . Years before , when Prudence was young and bicycles were fashionable , she had been intensely fond of riding . But as she gained in age , and bicycles lost in popularity , she discarded the amusement as unworthy a parsonage damsel . One evening , early in June , when the world was fair to look upon , it was foreordained that Prudence should be turning in at the parsonage gate just as Mattie Moore whirled up , opposite , on her dusty wheel . Prudence stopped to interchange polite inanities with her neighbor , and Mattie , wheeling the bicycle lightly beside her , came across the street and stood beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , of the coming summer , of Mattie 's school , rejoicing that one more week would bring freedom from books for Mattie and the younger parsonage girls . Then said Prudence , seemingly of her own free will , but really directed by an all-controlling Providence , " Is n't it great fun to ride a bicycle ? I love it . Sometime will you let me ride your wheel ? " " Why , certainly . You may ride now if you like . " " No , " said Prudence slowly , " I am afraid it would not do for me to ride now . Some of the members might see me , and -- well , I am very grown up , you know.  - -  Of course , " she added hastily , " it is different with you . You ride for business , but it would be nothing but a frolic with me . I want to get up at six o'clock and go early in the morning when the world is fast asleep . Let me take it to-morrow morning , will you ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . " " Yes , of course you may , " was the hearty answer . " You may stay out as long as you like . I 'm going to sew to-morrow . You make take it in the parsonage now and keep it until morning . I always sleep late on Saturdays . " So Prudence delightedly tripped up the parsonage board walk , wheeling the bicycle by her side . She hid it carefully in the woodshed , for the twins were rash and venturesome . But after she had gone to bed , she confided her plan to Fairy . " I 'm going at six o'clock , and I 'll be back in time to get breakfast . But as you know , Fairy , my plans do not always work out as I intend , so if I am a little late , you 'll get breakfast for papa and the girls , like a dear , wo n't you ? " Fairy promised . And early the next morning , Prudence , in a plain gingham house dress , with the addition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out upon her secret ride . It was a magnificent morning , and Prudence sang for pure delight as she rode swiftly along the country roads . The country was simply irresistible . It was almost intoxicating . And Prudence rode farther than she had intended . East and west , north and south , she went , apparently guided only by her own caprice . She knew it was growing late , " but Fairy 'll get breakfast , " she thought comfortably . Finally she turned in a by-road , leading between two rich hickory groves . Dismounting at the top of a long hill , she gazed anxiously around her . No one was in sight . The nearest house was two miles behind , and the road was long , and smooth , and inviting , and the hill was steep . Prudence yearned for a good , soul-stirring coast , with her feet high up on the framework of the wheel , and the pedals flying around beneath her skirts . This was not the new and modern model of bicycle . The pedals on Mattie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . It seemed safe . The road sloped down gradually at the bottom , with an incline on the other side . What more could one desire . The only living thing in sight besides birds gossiping in the leafy branches and the squirrel scolding to himself , was a sober-eyed serious mule peacefully grazing near the bottom of the hill . Prudence laughed gleefully , like a child . She never laughed again in exactly that way . This was the last appearance of the old irresponsible Prudence . The curtain was just ready to drop . " Here goes ! " she cried , and leaping nimbly into the saddle , she pedaled swiftly a few times , and then lifted her feet to the coveted position . The pedals flew around beneath her , just as she had anticipated , and the wind whistled about her in a most exhilarating way . But as she neared the bottom , a disastrous and totally unexpected thing happened . The placid mule , which had been righteously grazing beside the fence , suddenly stalked into the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , then to the left , and then , with a sickening thud , she landed head first upon some part of the mule 's anatomy . She did not linger there , however . She bounced on down to the ground , with a little cry of pain . The bicycle crashed beside her , and the mule , slightly startled , looked around at her with ears raised in silent questioning . Then he ambled slowly across the road , and deliberately continued his grazing . Prudence tried to raise herself , but she felt sharp pain . She heard some one leaping over the fence near her , and wondered , without moving her head , if it could be a tramp bent on highway robbery . The next instant , a man was leaning over her . " It 's not a tramp , " she thought , before he had time to speak . " Are you hurt ? " he cried . " You poor child ! " Prudence smiled pluckily . " My ankle is hurt a little , but I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , laughed aloud , and Prudence joined him rather faintly . " I 'm afraid I can not walk , " she said . " I believe I 've broken my ankle , maybe my whole leg , for all I know . It -- hurts -- pretty badly ! " " Lie down like this , " he said , helping her to a more comfortable position , " do not move . May I examine your foot ? " She shook her head , but he removed the shoe regardless of her head-shake . " I believe it is sprained . I am sure the bone is not broken . But how in the world will you get home ? How far is it to Mount Mark ? Is that where you live ? " " Yes , " considering , " yes , I live there , and it must be four miles , anyhow . What shall I do ? " In answer , he pulled off his coat , and arranged it carefully by the side of the road on the grass . Then jerking open the bag he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three soft shirts . Hastily rolling them together for a pillow , he added it to the bed pro tem . Then he turned again to Prudence . " I 'll carry you over here , and fix you as comfortably as I can . Then I 'll go to the nearest house and get a wagon to take you home . " Prudence was not shy , and realizing that his plan was the wise one , she made no objections when he came to help her across the road . " I think I can walk if you lift me up . " But the first movement sent such a twinge of pain through the wounded ankle that she clutched him frantically , and burst into tears . " It hurts , " she cried , " do n't touch me . " Without speaking , he lifted her as gently as he could and carried her to the place he had prepared for her . " Will you be warm enough ? " he asked , after he had stood looking awkwardly down upon the sobbing girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " nodded Prudence , gulping down the big soft rising in her throat . " I 'll run . Do you know which way is nearest to a house ? It 's been a long time since I passed one coming this way . " " The way I came is the nearest , but it 's two miles , I think . " " I 'll go as fast as I can , and you will be all right This confounded cross-cut is so out of the way that no one will pass here for hours , I suppose . Now lie as comfortably as you can , and do not worry . I 'm going to run . " Off he started , but Prudence , left alone , was suddenly frightened . " Please , oh , please , " she called after him , and when he came back she buried her face in shame , deep in the linen towel . " I 'm afraid , " she whispered , crying again . " I do not wish to be left alone here . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down beside her . " You 're nervous . I 'll stay with you until you feel better . Some one may come this way , but it is n't likely . A man I passed on the road a ways back told me to cut through the hickory grove and I would save a mile of travel . That 's how I happened to come through the woods , and find you . " He smiled a little , and Prudence , remembering the nature of her accident , flushed . Then , being Prudence , she laughed . " It was my own fault . I had no business to go coasting down like that . But the mule was so stationary . It never occurred to me that he contemplated moving for the next century at least . He was a bitter disappointment . " She looked down the roadside where the mule was contentedly grazing , with never so much as a sympathetic glance toward his victim . " I 'm afraid your bicycle is rather badly done up . " " Oh ,  - -  whatever will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I see now , that it was just foolish pride that made me unwilling to ride during decent hours . What a dunce I was ,  - -  as usual . " He looked at her curiously . This was beyond his comprehension . " The bicycle belongs to Mattie Moore . She lives across the street from the parsonage , and I wanted to ride . She said I could . But I was ashamed to ride in the daytime , for fear some of the members would think it improper for a girl of the parsonage , and so I got up at six o'clock this morning to do it on the sly . Somehow I never can remember that it is just as bad to do things when you are n't seen as when you are . It does n't seem so bad , does it ? But of course it is . But I never think of that when I need to be thinking of it . Maybe I 'll remember after this . " She was silent a while . " Fairy 'll have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . " Silence again . " Maybe papa 'll worry . But then , they know by this time that something always does happen to me , so they 'll be prepared . " She turned gravely to the young man beside her . He was looking down at her , too . And as their eyes met , and clung for an instant , a slow dark color rose in his face . Prudence felt a curious breathlessness ,  - -  caused by her hurting ankle , undoubtedly . " My name is Prudence Starr ,  - -  I am the Methodist minister 's oldest daughter . " " And my name is Jerrold Harmer . " He was looking away into the hickory grove now . " My home is in Des Moines . " " Oh , Des Moines is quite a city , is n't it ? I 've heard quite a lot about it . It is n't so large as Chicago , though , of course . I know a man who lives in Chicago . We used to be great chums , and he told me all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ,  - -  when the Methodists get rich enough to pay their ministers just a little more salary . " Then she added thoughtfully , " Still , I could n't go even if I had the money , because I could n't leave the parsonage . So it 's just as well about the money , after all . But Chicago must be very nice . He told me about the White City , and the big parks , and the elevated railways , and all the pretty restaurants and hotels . I love pretty places to eat . You might tell me about Des Moines . Is it very nice ? Are there lots of rich people there ?  - -  Of course , I do not really care any more about the rich people than the others , but it always makes a city seem grand to have a lot of rich citizens , I think . Do n't you ? " So he told her about Des Moines , and Prudence lay with her eyes half-closed , listening , and wondering why there was more music in his voice than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . She did not mind it at all . In fact , she never gave it a thought . From beneath her lids , she kept her eyes fastened on Jerrold Harmer 's long brown hands , clasped loosely about his knees . And whenever she could , she looked up into his face . And always there was that curious catching in her breath , and she looked away again quickly , feeling that to look too long was dangerous . " I have talked my share now , " he was saying , " tell me all about yourself , and the parsonage , and your family . And who is Fairy ? And do you attend the college at Mount Mark ? You look like a college girl . " " Oh , I am not , " said Prudence , reluctant to make the admission for the first time in her life . " I am too stupid to be a college girl . Our mother is not living , and I left high school five years ago and have been keeping house for my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How old are you ? " " I am twenty-seven , " and he smiled . " Jerrold Harmer , " she said slowly and very musically . " It is such a nice name . Do your friends call you Jerry ? " " The boys at school called me Roldie , and sometimes Hammie . But my mother always called me Jerry . She is n't living now , either . You call me Jerry , will you ? " " Yes , I will , but it wo n't be proper . But that never makes any difference to me ,  - -  except when it might shock the members ! You want me to call you Jerry , do n't you ? " " Yes , I do . And when we are better acquainted , will you let me call you Prudence ? " " Call me that now.  - -  I ca n't be too particular , you see , when I am lying on your coat and pillowed with your belongings . You might get cross , and take them away from me.  - -  Did you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not much of a student . Then I knocked around a while , looking at the world , and two years ago I went home to Des Moines . I have been there ever since except for little runs once in a while . " Prudence sighed . " To Harvard !  - -  I am sorry now that I did not go to college myself . " " Why ? There does n't seem to be anything lacking about you . What do you care about college ? " " Well , you went to college , " she answered argumentatively . " My sister Fairy is going now . She 's very clever ,  - -  oh , very . You 'll like her , I am sure ,  - -  much better than you do me , of course . " Prudence was strangely downcast . " I am sure I wo n't , " said Jerrold Harmer , with unnecessary vehemence . " I do n't care a thing for college girls . I know a lot of them , and -- aw , they make a fellow tired . I like home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep house , and are sweet , and comfortable , and all that . " Jerrold flipped over abruptly , and lay on the grass , his face on his arms turned toward her face . They were quiet for a while , but their glances were clinging . " Your eyes are brown , are n't they ? " Prudence smiled , as though she had made a pleasant discovery . " Yes . Yours are blue . I noticed that , first thing . " " Did you ? Do you like blue eyes ? They are n't as -- well , as strong and expressive as brown eyes . Fairy 's are brown . " " I like blue eyes best . They are so much brighter and deeper . You ca n't see clear to the bottom of blue eyes , you have to keep looking . " And he did keep looking . " Did you play football at college ? You are so tall . Fairy 's tall , too . Fairy 's very grand-looking . I 've tried my best to eat lots , and exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , I played football.  - -  But girls do not need to be so tall as men . Do n't you remember what Orlando said about Rosalind ,  - -  'just as tall as my heart ' ? I imagine you come about to my shoulder . We 'll measure as soon as you are on your feet again . " " Are you going to live in Mount Mark now ? Are you coming to stay ? " Prudence was almost quivering as she asked this . It was of vital importance . " No , I will only be there a few days , but I shall probably be back every week or so . Is your father very strict ? Maybe he would object to your writing to me . " " Oh , he is n't strict at all . And he will be glad for me to write to you , I know . I write to two or three men when they are away . But they are -- oh , I do not know exactly what it is , but I do not really like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's such a bother . " " Yes , it is , that 's so . I think I would quit , if I were you . I was just thinking how silly it is for me to keep on writing to some girls I used to know . Do n't care two cents about ' em . I 'm going to cut it out as soon as I get home . But you will write to me , wo n't you ? " " Yes , of course . " Prudence laughed shyly . " It seems so -- well , nice ,  - -  to think of getting letters from you . " " I 'll bet there are a lot of nice fellows in Mount Mark , are n't there ? " " Why , no . I ca n't think of any real nice ones ! Oh , they are all right . I have lots of friends here , but they are -- I do not know what ! They do not seem very nice . I would n't care if I never saw them again . But they are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " he said with feeling . " Is Des Moines just full of beautiful girls ? " " I should say not . I never saw a real beautiful girl in Des Moines in my life . Or any place else , for that matter ,  - -  until I came -- You know when you come right down to it , there are mighty few girls that look -- just the way you want them to look . " Prudence nodded . " That 's the way with men , too . Of all the men I have seen in my life , I never saw one before that looked just the way I wanted him to . " " Before ? " he questioned eagerly . " Yes , " said Prudence frankly . " You look just as I wish you to . " And in the meanwhile , at the parsonage , Fairy was patiently getting breakfast . " Prudence went out for an early bicycle ride ,  - -  so the members would n't catch her , " she explained to the family . " And she is n't back yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride right by the grocery store where the Ladies have their Saturday sale . That 's Prudence , all over . Oh , father , I did forget your eggs again , I am afraid they are too hard . Here , twins , you carry in the oatmeal , and we will eat . No use to wait for Prudence , it would be like waiting for the next comet . " Indeed , it was nearly noon when a small , one-horse spring wagon drove into the parsonage yard . Mr. Starr was in his study with a book , but he heard a piercing shriek from Connie , and a shrill " Prudence ! " from one of the twins . He was downstairs in three leaps , and rushing wildly out to the little rickety wagon . And there was Prudence ! " Do n't be frightened , father . I 've just sprained my ankle , and it does n't hurt hardly any . But the bicycle is broken ,  - -  we 'll have to pay for it . You can use my own money in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to town , because there was n't any room for him in the wagon with me lying down like this . Will you carry me in ? " Connie 's single bed was hastily brought downstairs , and Prudence deposited upon it . " There 's no use to put me up-stairs , " she assured them . " I wo n't stay there . I want to be down here where I can boss the girls . " The doctor came in , and bandaged the swollen purple ankle . Then they had dinner ,  - -  they tried to remember to call it luncheon , but never succeeded ! After that , the whole parsonage family grouped about the little single bed in the cheery sitting-room . " Whose coat is this , Prudence ? " asked Connie . " And where in the world did you get these towels and silk shirts ? " added Fairy . Prudence blushed most exquisitely . " They are Mr. Harmer 's , " she said , and glanced nervously at her father . " Whose ? " chorused the family . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take mental notes with an eye to future stories . " If you will sit down and keep still , I will tell you all about it . But you must not interrupt me . What time is it , Fairy ? " " Two o'clock . " " Oh , two . Then I have plenty of time . Well , when I got to that little cross-cut through the hickory grove , about four miles out from town , I thought I would coast down the long hill . Do you remember that hill , father ? There was no one in sight , and no animals , except one hoary old mule , grazing at the bottom . It was irresistible , absolutely irresistible . So I coasted . But you know yourself , father , there is no trusting a mule . They are the most undependable animals . " Prudence looked thoughtfully down at the bed for a moment , and added slowly , " Still , I have no hard feelings against the mule . In fact , I kind of like him.  - -  Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the hill , that mule skipped right out in front of me . It looked as though he did it on purpose . I did not have time to get out of his way , and it never occurred to him to get out of mine , and so I went Bang ! right into him . And it broke Mattie Moore 's wheel , and upset me quite a little . But that mule never budged ! Jerry -- er Harmer ,  - -  Mr . Harmer , you know , said he believed an earthquake could coast downhill on to that mule without seriously inconveniencing him . I was hurt a little , and could n't get up . And so he jumped over the fence ,  - -  No , Connie , not the mule , of course ! Mr. Harmer ! He jumped over the fence , and put his coat on the ground , and made a pillow for me with the shirts and towels in his bag , and carried me over . Then he wanted to go for a wagon to bring me home , but I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Mr. Davis came along with his cart , and Jerry -- er -- Harmer , you know , helped put me in , and the cart was so small they both had to walk . " " Where is he now ? " " Is he young ? " " Is he handsome ? " " Did he look rich ? " " Do n't be silly , girls . He went to the hotel , I suppose . Anyhow , he left us as soon as we reached town . He said he was in a hurry , and had something to look after . His coat was underneath me in the wagon , and he would n't take it out for fear of hurting my ankle , so the poor soul is probably wandering around this town in his shirt-sleeves . " Already , in the eyes of the girls , this Jerry -- er -- Harmer , had taken unto himself all the interest of the affair . " He 'll have to come for his coat , " said Lark . " We 're bound to see him . " " Where does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grove ? " inquired Mr. Starr with a strangely sinking heart , for her eyes were alight with new and wonderful radiance . " He lives in Des Moines . He was just walking into town , and took a short cut through the grove . " " Walking ! From Des Moines ? " Prudence flushed uncomfortably . " I did n't think of that , " she said . " But I do not see why he should not walk if he likes . He 's strong and athletic , and fond of exercise . I guess he 's plenty able to walk if he wants to . I 'm sure he 's no tramp , father , if that is what you are thinking . " " I am not thinking anything of the kind , Prudence , " he said with dignity . " But I do think it rather strange that a young man should set out to walk from Des Moines to Mount Mark . And why should he be at it so early in the morning ? Does n't he require sleep , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know ? I guess if he likes to be but in the morning when it is fresh and sweet , it is all right . I like the morning myself . He had as much right out early as I had . His clothes were nice , and he is a Harvard graduate , and his shoes were dusty , but not soiled or worn . Anyhow , he is coming at four o'clock . If you want to ask if he is a tramp , you can do it . " And Prudence burst into tears . Dramatic silence in the cheerful sitting-room ! Then Fairy began bustling about to bathe the face and throat of " poor little Prudence , " and her father said sympathetically : " You 're all nervous and wrought up , with the pain and excitement , Prudence . I 'm glad he is coming so we can thank him for his kindness . It was mighty lucky he happened along , was n't it ? A Harvard graduate ! Yes , they are pretty strong on athletics at Harvard . You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice when he gets here , " said Father Starr , with great diplomacy . And he was rewarded , and startled , by observing that Prudence brightened wonderfully at his words . " Yes , do , " she urged eagerly . " Get some of the roses from the corner bush , and put them on the table there . And when you go up-stairs , Fairy , you 'd better bring down that little lace spread in the bottom drawer of our dresser . It 'll look very nice on this bed.  - -  Work hard , girls , and get everything looking fine . He 'll be here at four , he said . You twins may wear your white dresses , and Connie must put on her blue and wear her blue bows.  - -  Fairy , do you think it would be all right for you to wear your silk dress ? Of course , the silk is rather grand for home , but you do look so beautiful in it . Father , will you put on your black suit , or are you too busy ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace sent you . " He went up-stairs to obey , with despair in his heart . But to the girls , there was nothing strange in this exactness on the part of Prudence . Jerrold Harmer was the hero of the romance , and they must unite to do him honor . He was probably a prince in disguise . Jerrold Harmer was a perfectly thrilling name . It was really a shame that America allows no titles ,  - -  Lord Jerrold did sound so noble , and Lady Prudence was very effective , too . He and Prudence were married , and had a family of four children , named for the various Starrs , before one hour had passed . " I 'll begin my book right away , " Lark was saying . She and Carol were in the dining-room madly polishing their Sunday shoes ,  - -  what time they were not performing the marriage ceremony of their sister and The Hero . " Yes , do ! But for goodness ' sake , do n't run her into a mule ! Seems to me even Prudence could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his automobile break down in the middle of the road , and Prudence can run into it . The carbureter came off , and of course the car would n't run an inch without it . " " Yes , that 's good , " said Carol approvingly . " It must be a sixty cylinder , eight horsepower -- er -- Ford , or something real big and costly . " " Twins ! You wo n't be ready , " warned Prudence , and this dire possibility sent them flying upstairs in a panic . While the girls , bubbling over with excitement , were dressing for the great event , Mr. Starr went down-stairs to sit with Prudence . Carol called to him on his way down , and he paused on the staircase , looking up at her . " Lark and I are going to use some of Fairy 's powder , father , " she said . " We feel that we simply must on an occasion like this . And for goodness ' sake , do n't mention it before Him ! It does n't happen very often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , do n't you say anything about falling in the flour barrel , or turning pale all of a sudden , whatever else you do . We 'd be so mortified , father . " Mr. Starr was concerned with weightier matters , and went on down to Prudence with never so much as a reproving shake of the head for the worldly-minded young twins . " Father , " began Prudence , her eyes on the lace coverlet , " do you think it would be all right for me to wear that silk dressing-gown of mother 's ? I need something over my nightgown , and my old flannel kimono is so ugly . You know , mother said I was to have it , and -- I 'm twenty now . Do you think it would be all right ? But if you do not want me to wear it --  --  " " I do want you to , " was the prompt reply . " Yes , it is quite time you were wearing it . I 'll get it out of the trunk myself , and send Fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the door , he asked carelessly , " Is he very good-looking , Prudence ? " And Prudence , with a crimson face , answered quickly , " Oh , I really did n't notice , father . " He went on up-stairs then , and presently Fairy came down with the dainty silk gown trimmed with fine soft lace . " I brought my lavender ribbon for your hair , Prudence . It will match the gown so nicely . Oh , you do look sweet , dearest . I pity Jerrold Harmer , I can tell you that . Now I must hurry and finish my own dressing . " But with her foot on the bottom stair , she paused . Her sister was calling after her . " Send father down here , quick , Fairy . " Father ran down quickly , and Prudence , catching hold of his hands , whispered wretchedly , " Oh , father , he -- he is good-looking . I -- I did notice it . I did n't really mean to lie to you . " " There , now , Prudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must n't get excited again . I 'm afraid you are too nervous to have callers . You must lie very quietly until he comes . That was no lie , child . You are so upset you do not know what you are saying to-day . Be quiet now , Prudence , it 's nearly time for him to come . " " You are a dear good father , " she cried , kissing his hands passionately , " but it was a lie . I did know what I was saying . I did it on purpose . " And Mr. Starr 's heart was heavy , for he knew that his fears were realized . CHAPTER XII ROUSED FROM HER SLUMBER At twenty minutes to four , the parsonage family clustered excitedly in the sitting-room , which the sunshine flooded cheerily . They were waiting for the hero of Prudence 's romance . " Oh , Larkie , will you run up-stairs and bring my lace handkerchief ? It 's on our dresser , in the burnt-wood box . " And after Lark had departed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center of the table , Fairy ,  - -  a little to the right.  - -  If you would move the curtains the least little bit , those torn places would not show . " Then she sighed . " How nice you all look . Oh , Connie , wo n't you turn the clock a little this way , so I can see it ? That 's better , thank you , precious . Thank you , Lark ,  - -  is n't it a pretty handkerchief ? I 've only carried it three times , and I have never really used it . Would you keep these pearls on , Fairy , or would you take them off ? " " I would keep them on , Prue ,  - -  they catch the color of the gown a little , and are just beautiful . You do look so sweet , but your face is very flushed . I am afraid you are feverish . Maybe we had better not let him see Prue to-day , father . Perhaps he can come back to-morrow . " " Fairy ! " exclaimed Prudence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat . We ca n't expect him to go coatless over Sunday . Listen ,  - -  listen , girls ! Look , Fairy , and see if that is he ! Yes , it is , I know ,  - -  I can tell by his walk . " Warm rich color dyed her face and throat , and she clasped her hands over her heart , wondering if Connie beside her could hear its tumult . " I 'll go to the door , " said Father Starr , and Prudence looked at him beseechingly . " I -- I am sure he is all right , father . I -- you will be nice to him , wo n't you ? " Without answering , Mr. Starr left the room . He could not trust his voice . " Listen , girls , I want to hear , " whispered Prudence . And she smiled as she heard her father 's cordial voice . " You are Mr. Harmer , are n't you ? I am Prudence 's father . Come right in . The whole family is assembled to do you honor . The girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back this way . Prudence is resting very nicely . " When the two men stepped into the sitting-room , Prudence , for once , quite overlooked her father . She lifted her eyes to Jerrold Harmer 's face , and waited , breathless . Nor was he long in finding her among the bevy of girls . He walked at once to the bed , and took her hand . " My little comrade of the road , " he said gaily , but with tenderness , " I am afraid you are not feeling well enough for callers to-day . " " Oh , yes , I am , " protested Prudence with strange shyness . He turned to the other girls , and greeted them easily . He was entirely self-possessed . " Miss Starr told me so much about you that I know you all to begin with . " He smiled at Fairy as he added , " In fact , she predicted that I am to fall in love with you . And so , very likely , I should , if I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and then he walked back and stood by Prudence once more . " Was it a bad sprain ? Does it pain you very badly ? You look tired . I am afraid it was an imposition for me to come this afternoon . " Illustration : " She predicted I 'm to fall in love with you . " " Oh , do n't worry about that , " put in Connie anxiously . " She wanted you to come . She 's been getting us ready for you ever since the doctor left . I think it was kind of silly for me to wear my blue just for one caller . " The twins glared at her , realizing that she was discrediting the parsonage , but Jerrold Harmer laughed , and Prudence joined him . " It is quite true , " she admitted frankly . " The mule and I disgraced the parsonage this morning , and I wanted the rest of you to redeem it this afternoon . " She looked at him inquiringly . " Then you had another coat ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in a window this morning , and could n't resist it . Was the ride very hard on your ankle ? " Mr. Starr was puzzled . Evidently it was not lack of funds which brought this man on foot from Des Moines to Mount Mark ,  - -  half- way across the state ! He did not look like a man fleeing from justice . What , then , was the explanation ? " You must have found it rather a long walk , " he began tentatively , his eyes on the young man 's face . " Yes , I think my feet are a little blistered . I have walked farther than that many times , but I am out of practise now . Sometimes , however , walking is a painful necessity . " " How long did it take you coming from Des Moines to Mount Mark ? " inquired Carol in a subdued and respectful voice ,  - -  and curious , withal . " I did not come directly to Mount Mark . I stopped several places on business . I hardly know how long it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's luck , I suppose . " " Well , " said Lark , " taking it a little at a time it might be done , but for myself , I should never dream of undertaking so much exercise . " " Could you walk from here to Burlington at one stretch ? " asked Connie . He looked rather surprised . " Why , perhaps I could if I was in shape , but -- seven miles was all I cared about this morning . " " Well , I think it was mighty brave of you to walk that far ,  - -  I do n't care why you did it , " announced Connie with emphasis . " Brave ! " he repeated . " I have walked three times seven miles , often , when I was in school . " " Oh , I mean the whole thing -- clear from Des Moines , " explained Connie . " From Des Moines , " he gasped . " Good heavens ! I did not walk from Des Moines ! Did you --  " He turned to Prudence questioningly . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " And added hastily , " But I did not care if you did . It did not make any difference how you came . " For a moment he was puzzled . Then he burst out laughing . " I am afraid we had too much to talk about this morning . I thought I had explained my situation , but evidently I did not . I drove from Des Moines in the car , and --  --  " " The automobile ! " gasped Carol , with a triumphant look at Lark . " Yes , just so . I stopped several places on business as I came through . I drove from Burlington this morning , but I got off the road . The car broke down on me , and I could n't fix it ,  - -  broke an axle . So I had to walk in . That is what I was seeing about to-day ,  - -  sending a man out for the car and arranging about the repairs . " He smiled again . " What in the world did you think I would walk from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquisitive than grammatical . " I did not think anything about it until they asked , and -- I did not know about the car . You did not mention it . " " No . I remember now . We were talking of other things all the time . " He turned frankly to Mr. Starr . " Perhaps you have heard of the Harmer Automobile Company , of Des Moines . My father was Harvey Harmer . Two years ago , when I was running around in Europe , he died . It was his desire that I should personally take charge of the business . So I hurried home , and have had charge of the company since then . We are establishing sales agencies here , and in Burlington , and several other towns . I came out for a little trip , and took advantage of the opportunity to discuss the business with our new men . That 's what brought me to Mount Mark . " To Connie he added laughingly , " So I must sacrifice myself , and do without your praise . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . " For the first time in her life , Prudence distinctly triumphed over her father . She flashed him the glance of a conqueror , and he nodded , understandingly . He liked Jerrold Harmer ,  - -  as much as he could like any man who stepped seriously into the life of Prudence . He was glad that things were well . But -- they would excuse him , he must look after his Sunday 's sermons . A little later the twins and Connie grew restless , and finally Connie blurted out , " Say , Prue , do n't you think we 've upheld the parsonage long enough ? I want to get some fresh air . " The twins would never have been guilty of such social indiscretion as this , but they gladly availed themselves of Connie 's " break , " and followed her out-of-doors . Then Fairy got up , laughing . " I have done my share , too . I think we 'll leave the parsonage in your hands now , Prue . I want to write to Aunt Grace . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if Prudence wants me , you will call , wo n't you , Mr. Harmer ? And wo n't you stay for dinner with us ? I 'm sure to disgrace the parsonage again , for I am no cook , but you can get along for once , surely . We spend more time laughing when the food is bad , and laughter is very healthful . You will stay , wo n't you ? " Jerrold Harmer looked very eager , and yet he looked somewhat doubtfully at Prudence . Her eyes were eloquent with entreaties . Finally he laughed , and said , " I should certainly like to stay , but you see I want to come back to-morrow . Now , will I dare to come back to-morrow if I stay for dinner to-night ? Would n't Connie say that was disgracing the parsonage ? " Fairy laughed delightedly . " That is very good , " she said . " Then you will stay . I 'll try to fix it up with Connie to save the reputation of the house . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have for dinner ? We only say dinner when we have company , Mr. Harmer . What we have is supper . " Prudence contracted her brows in the earnest endeavor to compose a menu suitable for this occasion . " Mashed potatoes , and -- use cream , Fairy . You 'd better let Lark do the mashing , for you always leave lumps . And breaded veal cutlet , " with a significant glance , " and creamed peas , and radishes , and fruit . Will that be enough for you , Mr. Harmer ? " " Oceans , " he said contentedly . " Well , I 'll collect the twins and Connie and we will try to think up a few additions . Where 's the money ? " " In the dungeon , and the key is on the nail above the door . And the silverware is there , too , " with another significant glance . After that , Prudence lay back happily on the pillows and smoothed the lace on her mother 's silk dressing gown . " Talk to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what you do , your work , you know , and how you amuse yourself . I want you to amuse me now , Mr. Harmer . " " You called me Jerry this morning . " " Yes , I know . Do you want me to call you Jerry still ? " " Yes , Prudence , I do . Do you mind if I move my chair a little closer ? " " No , put it right here . Now , I am ready . " " But there 's nothing interesting about me . Let 's talk of --  --  " " It 's interesting to me . Tell me about your business . " " You do n't care anything about business , I am sure . " " I care about your business . " " Do you , Prudence ?  - -  You look so sweet this afternoon . I nearly blurted it out before the whole family . Would n't the twins have laughed ? It would have disgraced the parsonage . I think Mr. Starr is awfully lucky to have five girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange that the prettiest and dearest one of them all should be the oldest daughter ? " " Oh , but I 'm not really --  " Prudence began earnestly . Then she stopped , and added honestly , " But I am glad you think so . " No , they did not quote poetry , they did not discuss the psychological intricacies of spontaneous attraction , they did not say anything deep , or wise , or learned . But they smiled at each other , with pleased investigating eyes . He put his hand on the coverlet , just near enough to touch the lace on the sleeve of her silk dressing gown . And together they found Paradise in the shabby sitting-room of the old Methodist parsonage that afternoon . " Must you prepare meat for breading half an hour before cooking , or when ? " demanded Fairy , from the dining-room door . " What ?  - -  Oh !  - -  Fifteen minutes before . Do n't forget to salt and pepper the crumbs , Fairy . " " Perhaps some time your father will let you and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car . You would enjoy a few days there , I know . I live with my aunt , a dear , motherly little old soul . She will adore you , Prudence , and you will like her , too . Would your father let you spend a week ? We can easily drive back and forth in the car . " " Maybe he will ,  - -  but who will keep the parsonage while I am away ? " " Fairy , to be sure . She must be a good fairy once in a while . We can take the twins with us , Connie , too , if you like , and then Fairy will only have to mother your father . Do you like riding in a car ? " " Oh , I love it . But I have not ridden very much . Willard Morley took me quite often when he was here , but he is in Chicago now . " " When 's he coming back ? " suspiciously . " Prudence , shall we have tea or coffee ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . " " What ?  - -  Oh !  - -  Which do you want , Jerry ? " " Which does your father prefer ? " " He does n't drink either except for breakfast . " " I generally drink coffee , but I do not care much for it , so do not bother --  --  " " Coffee , Lark . " " When 's that Morley chap coming back ? " " I do not know . " And then , " He is never coming back as far as I am concerned . " Jerrold relented promptly . " You are why he went away , I suppose . " " At any rate , he is gone . " " Did you ever have a lover , Prudence ? A real lover , I mean . " " No , I , never did . " " I 'm awfully glad of that . I'll --  --  " " Prudence , do you use half milk and half water for creamed tomato soup , or all milk ? " " What ?  - -  Oh !  - -  All milk , Connie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , or it may curdle . " " What in the world would they ever do without you , Prudence ? You are the soul of the parsonage , are n't you ? " " No , I am just the cook and the chambermaid , " she answered , laughing . " But do n't you see how hard it will be for me to go away ? " " But it is n't fair ! Vacation is coming now , and Fairy ought to take a turn . What will they do when you get married ? " " I have always said I would not get married . " " But do n't you want to get married , some time ? " " Oh , that is n't it . I just ca n't because I must take care of the parsonage , and raise the girls . I ca n't . " " But you will , " he whispered , and his hand touched hers for just a second . Prudence did not answer . She lifted her eyes to his face , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Do you mind if I go upstairs and talk to your father a few minutes ? Maybe I 'd better . " " But do not stay very long , " she urged , and she wondered why the brightness and sunshine vanished from the room when he went out . " First door to the right , " she called after him . Mr. Starr arose to greet him , and welcomed him to his combination study and bedroom with great friendliness . But Jerrold went straight to the point . " Mr. Starr , it 's very kind of you to receive a perfect stranger as you have me . But I understand that with a girl like Prudence , you will want to be careful . I can give you the names of several prominent men in Des Moines , Christians , who know me well , and can tell you all about me . " " It is n't necessary . We are parsonage people , and we are accustomed to receiving men and women as worthy of our trust , until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among our friends . " " Thank you , but -- you see , Mr. Starr , this is a little different . Some day , Prudence and I will want to be married , and you will wish to be sure about me . " " Does Prudence know about that ? " " No , " with a smile , " we have n't got that far yet . But I am sure she feels it . She hasn't -- well , you know what I mean . She has been asleep , but I believe she is waking up now . " " Yes , I think so . Do you mind if I ask you a few questions ? " " No , indeed . Anything you like . " " Well , first , are you a Christian ? " " Not the kind you are , Mr. Starr . My parents were Christians , but I 've never thought much about it myself because I was young and full of fun . I have never been especially directed to religion . I go to church , and I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I seldom read it . But I 'll get busy now , if you like , and really study it and -- try to come around your way . I know Prudence would make me do that . " And he smiled again . " Do you drink ? " " I did a little , but I promised Prudence this morning I would quit it . I never got -- drunk , and I have not formed the habit . But sometimes with the boys , I drink a little . But I do not care for it , and I swore off this morning.  - -  I smoke , too , not cigarettes , of course . Prudence knows it , but she did not make me promise to quit that ? " His voice was raised , inquiringly . " Would you have promised , if she had asked it ? " This was sheer curiosity . " I suppose I would . " He flushed a little . " I know I was pretty hard hit , and it was such a new experience that I would have promised anything she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it is wicked . " " Never mind the smoking . I only asked that question out of curiosity . We 're not as strait-laced as we might be perhaps . The only things I would really object to , are those things that might seriously menace your happiness , yours and hers , if the time does come . But the next question ,  - -  can you pass a strict physical examination ? " " Yes , I can . I 'll go with you to your physician to-night if you like . I 'm all right physically , I know . " " Tell me about your relations with your mother when she was living . " " She has been dead four years . " Jerrold spoke with some emotion . " We were great chums , though her health was always poor . I wrote her three times a week when I was away from home , and she wrote me a note every day . When I was in school , I spent all my vacations at home to be with her . And I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the idea of my going so far from her . " " Jerrold , my boy , I do not want to seem too severe , but -- tell me , has there been anything in your life , about women , that could come out and hurt Prudence later on ? " Jerrold hesitated . " Mr. Starr , I have been young , and headstrong , and impulsive . I have done some things I wish now I had n't . But I believe there is nothing that I could not explain to Prudence so she would understand . If I had thought beforehand of a girl like her , there are things I would not have done . But there is nothing , I think , that would really hurt , after I had a chance to talk it over with her . " " All right . If you are the man , God bless you . I do n't suppose you are worthy of Prudence , for she is a good , pure-hearted , unselfish girl ,  - -  there could be none better . But the real point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  I like your coming up here like this . I think that was very decent and manly of you . And , do you mind if I just suggest that you go a little slow with Prudence ? Remember that she has been sound asleep , until this morning . I do not want her awakened too rudely . " " Neither do I , " said Jerrold quickly . " Shall I go down now ? The girls have invited me to stay for supper , and Prudence says I am to come back to-morrow , too . Is that all right ? Remember , I 'll be going home on Monday ! " " It is all right , certainly . Spend as much time here as you like . You will either get worse , or get cured , and -- whichever it is , you 've got to have a chance . I like you , Jerrold . Prudence judges by instinct , but it does not often fail her . " Prudence heard him running down the stairs boyishly , and when he came in , before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight , Prudence . And do not scold me , for I ca n't help it . " Then he put his hands over hers , and kissed her on the lips . They were both breathless after that . Prudence lifted her lashes slowly , and gazed at him seriously . It was she who spoke first . " I was never really kissed before , " she whispered , " not really . " Then they sat in silence until Fairy announced that supper was ready . " But I wo n't promise it is eatable , " she assured them , laughing . " I wish I could go to the table , too , " said Prudence , looking at her father wistfully , " I could lie on the old lounge out there . " " And have your supper on a tray , of course . Can you carry her , father ? " " I can ! " volunteered Jerrold promptly . " I have done it . " " I think between us we can manage . We 'll try it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of seeing Jerrold at the table with her parsonage family . For to her surprise , she realized that she could not bear that even a few minutes should pass , when she could not see the manly young face with the boyish mouth and the tender eyes ! Prudence , at last , was aroused from her slumber . CHAPTER XIII SHE ORDERS HER LIFE " Prudence , are you going to Aunt Grace 's early in the summer , or late ? " demanded Fairy . " Oh , let 's not talk of that now . There 's plenty of time . " " No , there is n't . School will be out in a week , and Babbie wants to give a house party and have our little bunch at his home for a few days this summer . He wants to set the date , and I ca n't tell him when because I do not know when you are going to auntie 's . " They sat around the breakfast table , Prudence and Fairy and their father , talking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excused themselves , and even now could be heard shouting gaily in the field beyond the old red barn . Prudence looked restlessly from one to the other , when her sister insisted upon an answer . " Why , " she began , " I 've about decided not to go to Aunt Grace 's this summer . " Fairy rapped on the table with the spoon she held in her hand . " Do n't be silly ! You have to go . You 've never had a vacation in your life , and father promised Aunt Grace on his reputation as a minister , did n't you , papa ? " " Yes , I promised all right . " " But , papa ! I do not have to go , do I ? A whole month ,  - -  oh , honestly , I do not want to . " " Why do n't you ? Last fall you were wild about it . Do n't you remember dreaming --  --  " " Oh , but that was last fall , " said Prudence , smiling softly , and unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside her dress . " I did n't know I was going to sprain my ankle , and be so useless . It may be two weeks yet before I can walk on it . " " What has that got to do with it ? " " Do you really prefer to stay at home , Prudence ? " queried her father . " The whole summer ? " Prudence blushed most gloriously . " Oh , well , " she began slowly . Then she took the plunge recklessly . " Why , you see , father , Jerry lives with his aunt in Des Moines ,  - -  he told you that , did n't he ? And they have quite a big house , and -- he wants to take me and the twinnies to Des Moines in the car for a week or ten days . And Fairy will take care of you and Connie . And -- if I can do that -- I do not want any more vacation . I could n't bear to stay at auntie 's a whole month , away from you and the parsonage . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was thinking , " Besides , Jerry is coming every two weeks , and if I were away , we would miss a visit ! " Fairy laughed in an irritating , suggestive way , but Mr. Starr only nodded . " I am sure you will not mind that , will you father ? His aunt must be a perfectly good and nice woman , and -- such a long drive in the auto , and -- to see all over Des Moines . " But Prudence paused guiltily , for she did not add , " With Jerry ! " although the words were singing in her heart . " That will be very nice indeed , and of course I do not object . It will be a forty years ' delight and wonder to the twins ! Yes , I will be glad to have you go . But you can still have your month at Grace 's if you wish . " " But I do not wish , " protested Prudence promptly . " Honestly , father , I 'll write her the sweetest kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Of course , we wo n't make you go , you goose , " said Fairy , " but I think you are very foolish . " " And you can go , Fairy , " cried Prudence hospitably . " Aunt Grace loves you so , and you 've worked so hard all year , and ,  - -  oh , yes , it will be just the thing for you . " Prudence wished she might add , " And that will let me out , " but she hardly dare say it . " Well , when does your Des Moines tour come off ? I must know , so I can tell Babbie about the house party . " " Let Babbie choose his own date . Jerry says we shall go whenever I say -- I mean whenever you say , father ,  - -  and we can decide later on . Give Babbie first choice , by all means . " That was the beginning of Prudence 's golden summer . She was not given to self-analysis . She did what seemed good to her always , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wherefore . She had n't the time . She took things as they came . She could not bear the thought of sharing with the parsonage family even the least ardent and most prosaic of Jerrold 's letters . But she never asked herself the reason . It seemed a positive sacrilege to leave his warm , life-pulsing letters up-stairs in a bureau drawer . It was only natural and right to carry them in her dress , and to sleep with them under her pillow . But Prudence did not wonder why . The days when Jerry came were tremulously happy ones for her , she was all aquiver when she heard him swinging briskly up the ramshackle parsonage walk , and her breath was suffocatingly hot . But she took it as a matter of course . The nights when Jerry slept in the little spare bedroom at the head of the stairs , Prudence lay awake , staring joyously into the darkness , hoping Jerry was sound asleep and comfortable . But she never asked herself why she could not sleep ! She knew that Jerry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that his eyes were the softest and brightest and the most tender . She knew that his hands had a thrilling touch quite different from the touch of ordinary , less dear hands . She knew that his smile lifted her into a delirium of delight , and that even the thought of sorrow coming to him brought stinging tears to her eyes . But why ? Ah , Prudence never thought of that . She just lived in the sweet ecstatic dream of the summer , and was well and richly content . So the vacation passed , and Indian summer came . And the girls went back to their studies once more , reluctantly , yet unaccountably glad even in their reluctance . It is always that way with students ,  - -  real students . They regret the passing of vacation days , but the thought of " going back to school " has its own tingling joys of anticipation . It was Saturday evening . The early supper at the parsonage was over , the twins had washed the dishes , and still the daylight lingered . Prudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front porch , talking in whispers . Fairy had gone for a stroll with the still faithful Babbie . Connie and the twins had evidently vanished . Ah -- not quite that ! Carol and Lark came swiftly around the corner of the parsonage . " Good evening , " said Lark politely , and Prudence sat up abruptly . The twins never wasted politeness ! They wanted something . " Do you mind if we take Jerry around by the woodshed for a few minutes , Prue ? " " I 'll come along , " said Prudence , rising . " Oh , no , " protested Lark , " we do not want you ,  - -  just Jerry , and only for a little while . " Prudence sniffed suspiciously . " What are you going to do to him ? " she demanded . " We wo n't hurt him , " grinned Carol impishly . " We had intended to tie him to a stake and burn him alive . But since you have interceded on his behalf , we 'll let him off with a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Lark , " for there are two of us , and we are mighty men of valor . " " That 's all right , " Prudence answered defensively . " I 'd sooner face a tribe of wild Indians any day than you twins when you are mischief-bent . " " Oh , we just want to use him a few minutes , " said Carol impatiently . " Upon our honor , as Christian gentlemen , we promise not to hurt a hair of his head . " " Oh , come along , and cut out the comedy , " Jerry broke in , laughing . " I 'll be back in two minutes , Prue . They probably want me to shoo a chicken out of their way . Or maybe the cat has been chasing them . " Once safely around the corner , the twins changed their tactics . " We knew you were n't afraid , " said Lark artistically , " we were just teasing Prudence . We know we could n't hurt you . " " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of you , that 's all . It 's something we ca n't do ourselves , but we knew you could do it , all right . " Jerry perceived the drift of this argument . " I see ! I 'm paid in advance for my service . What 's the job ? " Then the twins led him to the woodshed . This woodshed stood about twenty feet from the back door of the parsonage , and was nine feet high in front , the roof sloping down at the back . Close beside the shed grew a tall and luxuriant maple . The lower limbs had been chopped off , and the trunk rose clear to a height of nearly twelve feet before the massive limbs branched out . The twins had discovered that by climbing gingerly on the rotten roof of the woodshed , followed by almost superhuman scrambling and scratching , they could get up into the leafy secrecy of the grand old maple . More than this , up high in the tree they found a delightful arrangement of branches that seemed positively made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in the act of utilizing them that they called upon their sister 's friend for help . " Do you see this board ? " began Lark , exhibiting with some pride a solid board about two feet in length . " My eyesight is quite unimpaired , " answered Jerry , for he knew his twins . " Well , we found this over by the Avery barn . They have a big scrap pile out there . We could n't find anything around here that would suit , so we looked , over there . It 's just a pile of rubbish , and we knew they would n't mind . " " Else you would not have taken it , eh ? Anything like apples , for instance , is quite under the ban . " " Yes , indeed , " smiled Lark . " We 're too old to steal apples . " " Of course , " added Carol . " When we need our neighbor 's apples , we send Connie . And get nicely punished for it , too , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisite board ? " " Well , we 've found a perfectly gorgeous place up in the old tree where we can make a seat . It 's quite a ways out from the trunk , and when the wind blows it swings splendidly . But it is n't very comfortable sitting on a thin limb , and so we want a seat . It 's a fine place , I tell you . We thought you could nail this securely on to the limbs ,  - -  there are two right near each other , evidently put there on purpose for us . See what dandy big nails we have ! " " From the Avery 's woodshed , I suppose , " he suggested , smiling again . " Oh , they are quite rusty . We found them in a sack in an old barrel . It was in the scrap heap . We 're very good friends with the Averys , very good , indeed , " she continued hastily . " They allow us to rummage around at will -- in the barn . " " And see this rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dandy ? " " Ah ! The Avery barn must be inexhaustible in its resources . " " How suspicious you are , Jerry , " mourned Lark . " I wish we were that way , instead of innocent and bland and trustful . Maybe we would get rich , too . This is the first time I ever really understood how you came to be a success in business . " " But you are quite wrong this time , " said Lark seriously . " Old Mr. Avery gave me this rope . " " Yes , he did ! Lark told him she was looking for a rope just exactly like this one , and then he gave it to her . He caught the idea of philanthropy right away . He 's a very nice old gentleman , I tell you . He 's so trusting and unsuspicious . I 'm very fond of people like that . " " We thought when you had the board nicely nailed on , you might rope it securely to the limbs above . They are in very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you suppose you can do that , Jerry ? Do you get seasick when you climb high ? " " Oh , no , high altitudes never make me seasick . I 've a very good head for such purposes . " " Then suppose you get busy before it grows dark . We 're in a great hurry . And we do not want Connie to catch us putting it up . It 'll be such fun to sit up there and swing when the wind blows , and have poor Connie down beneath wondering how we manage to stick on . She ca n't see the seat from the ground . Wo n't it be a good joke on her ? " " Oh , very ,  - -  - yes , indeed.  - -  Well , let 's begin.  - -  Now , observe ! I will just loop this end of the rope lightly about my -- er -- middle . The other end will dangle on the ground to be drawn up at will . Observe also that I bestow the good but rusty nails in this pocket , and the hammer here . Then with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heights of -- Say , twins , did n't I see an old buggy seat out in the barn to-day ? Seems to me --  --  " " Oh , Jerry ! " The twins fairly smothered him . " Oh , you darling . You are the nicest old thing.  - -  Now we can understand why Prudence seems to like you . We never once thought of the old buggy seat ! Oh , Jerry ! " Then they hastily brought the discarded seat from the barn , and with the help of Jerry it was shoved up on the woodshed . From there , he lifted it to the lowest limb of the old maple , and a second later he was up himself . Then it was lifted again , and again he followed ,  - -  up , and up , and up ,  - -  the loose end of the donated rope trailing loose on the ground below . The twins promptly ,  - -  as promptly as possible , that is ,  - -  followed him into the tree . " Oh , yes , we 'll come along . We 're used to climbing and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold things steady while you hammer . " And Jerry smiled as he heard the faithful twins , with much grunting and an occasional groan , following in his wake . It was a delightful location , as they had said . So heavy was the leafy screen that only by lifting a branch here or there , could they see through it . The big seat fitted nicely on the two limbs , and Jerry fastened it with the rusty nails . The twins were jubilant , and loud in their praises of his skill and courage . " Oh , Jerry , " exclaimed Carol , with deep satisfaction , " it 's such a blessing to discover something really nice about you after all these months ! " " Now , we 'll just --  --  " " Hush ! " hissed Lark . " Here comes Connie . Hold your breath , Jerry , and do n't budge . " " Is n't she in on this ? " he whispered . He could hear Connie making weird noises as she came around the house from the front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghastly in the extreme . Connie 's mouth had not been designed for whistling . " Sh ! She 's the band of dark-browed gypsies trying to steal my lovely wife . " " I 'm the lovely wife , " interrupted Carol complacently . " But Connie does not know about it . She is so religious she wo n't be any of the villain parts . When we want her to be anything real low-down , we have to do it on the sly . She would no more consent to a band of dark-browed gypsies than she would --  --  " Connie came around the corner of the parsonage , out the back walk beneath the maple . Then she gave a gleeful scream . Right before her lay a beautiful heavy rope . Connie had been yearning for a good rope to make a swing . Here it lay , at her very feet , plainly a gift of the gods . She did not wait to see where the other end of the rope was . She just grabbed what she saw before her , and started violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Look at my rope ! " Prudence rushed around the parsonage . The twins shrieked wildly , as there was a terrific tug and heave of the limb beside them , and then -- a crashing of branches and leaves . Jerry was gone ! It did look horrible , from above as well as below . But Jerry , when he felt the first light twinge as Connie lifted the rope , foresaw what was coming and was ready for it . As he went down , he grabbed a firm hold on the branch on which he had stood , then he dropped to the next , and held again . On the lowest limb he really clung for fifteen seconds , and took in his bearings . Connie had dropped the rope when the twins screamed , so he had nothing more to fear from her . He saw Prudence , white , with wild eyes , both arms stretched out toward him . " O. K. , Prue , " he called , and then he dropped . He landed on his feet , a little jolted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once to Prudence . " I 'm all right , " he cried , really alarmed by the white horror in her face . " Prudence ! Prudence ! " Then her arms dropped , and with a brave but feeble smile , she swayed a little . Jerry took her in his arms . " Sweetheart ! " he whispered . " Little sweetheart ! Do -- do you love me so much , my dearest ? " Prudence raised her hands to his face , and looked intensely into his eyes , all the sweet loving soul of her shining in her own . And Jerry kissed her . The twins scrambled down from the maple , speechless and cold with terror ,  - -  and saw Prudence and Jerry ! Then they saw Connie , staring at them with interest and amusement . " I think we 'd better go to bed , all three of us , " declared Lark sturdily . And they set off heroically around the house . But at the corner Carol turned . " Take my advice and go into the woodshed , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their windows . " Prudence did not hear , but he drew her swiftly into the woodshed . Now a woodshed is a hideously unromantic sort of place . And there was nothing for Prudence to sit on , that Jerry might kneel at her feet . So they dispensed with formalities , and he held her in his arms for a long time , and kissed her often , and whispered sweet meaningless words that thrilled her as she listened . It may not have been comfortable , but it was evidently endurable , for it is a fact that they did not leave that woodshed for over an hour . Then they betook themselves to the darkest corner of the side porch ,  - -  and history repeated itself once more ! At twelve , Jerry went up-stairs to bed , his lips tingling with the fervent tenderness of her parting kiss . At one o'clock , he stood at his window , looking soberly out into the moonlit parsonage yard . " She is an angel , a pure , sweet , unselfish little angel , " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wet , " and she is going to be my wife ! Oh , God , teach me how to be good to her , and help me make her as happy as she deserves . " At two o'clock he lay on his bed , staring into the darkness , thinking again the soft shy words she had whispered to him . And he flung his arms out toward his closed door , wanting her . At three o'clock he dropped lightly asleep and dreamed of her . With the first pale streaks of daylight stealing into his room , he awoke . It was after four o'clock . A little later ,  - -  just a few minutes later ,  - -  he heard a light tap on his door . It came again , and he bounded out of bed . " Prudence ! Is anything wrong ? " " Hush , Jerry , not so loud ! " And what a strange and weary voice . " Come down-stairs , will you ? I want to tell you something . I 'll wait at the foot of the stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will you be down soon ? " " In two minutes ! " And in two minutes he was flown , agonizingly anxious , knowing that something was wrong . Prudence was waiting for him , and as he reached the bottom step she clutched his hands desperately . " Jerry , " she whispered , " I -- forgive me -- I honestly --  Oh , I did n't think what I was saying last night . You were so dear , and I was so happy , and for a while I really believed we could belong to each other . But I ca n't , you know . I 've promised papa and the girls a dozen times that I would never marry . Do n't you see how it is ? I must take it back . " Jerry smiled a little , it must be admitted . This was so like his conscientious little Prudence ! " Dearest , " he said gently , " you have said that because you were not awake . You did not love . But you are awake now . You love me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . The girls would not hear of it . They want you to be happy . And you ca n't be happy without me , can you ? " Suddenly she crushed close to him . " Oh , Jerry , " she sobbed , " I will never be happy again , I know . But -- it is right for me to stay here , and be the mother in the parsonage . It is wicked of me to want you more than all of them . Do n't you see it is ? They have n't any mother . They have n't any one but me . Of course , they would not allow it , but they will not know anything about it . I must do it myself . And father especially must never know . I want you to go away this morning before breakfast , and -- never come again . " She clung to him as she said this , but her voice did not falter . " And you must not write to me any more . For , oh , Jerry , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it . Will you do this for me ? " " You 've been up all night , have n't you , dearest ? " " Yes ,  - -  I remembered , and then I could n't sleep . " " What have you been doing all night ? It is morning now . " " I walked up and down the floor , and pounded my hands together , " she admitted , with a mournful smile . " You are nervous and excited , " he said tenderly . " Let 's wait until after breakfast . Then we 'll talk it all over with your father , and it shall be as he says . Wo n't that be better ? " " Oh , no . For father will say whatever he thinks will make me happy . He must not know a thing about it . Promise , Jerry , that you will never tell him one word . " " I promise , of course , Prudence . I will let you tell him . " But she shook her head . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bear to think of never seeing you again , and never getting letters from you , and --  It seems to kill me inside , just the thought of it . " " Sit down here in my lap . Put your head on my shoulder , like that . Let me rub your face a little . You 're feverish . You are sick . Go to bed , wo n't you , sweetheart ? We can settle this later on . " " You must go right away , or I can not let you go at all ! " " Do you mean you want me to get my things , and go right now ? " " Yes . " She buried her face in his shoulder . " If -- if you stay in your room until breakfast time , I will lock you in , so you can not leave me again . I know it . I am crazy to-day . " " Do n't you think you owe me something , as well as your father and sisters ? Did n't God bring us together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think He intended us for each other ? Do you wish you had never met me ? " " Jerry ! " " Then , sweetheart , be reasonable . Your father loved your mother , and married her . That is God 's plan for all of us . You have been a wonderfully brave and sweet daughter and sister , I know . But surely Fairy is old enough to take your place now . " " Fairy 's going to be a professor , and -- the girls do not mind her very well . And she is n't as much comfort to father as I am.  - -  It 's just because I am most like mother , you see . But anyhow , I promised . I ca n't leave them . " " Your father expects you to marry , and to marry me . I told him about it myself , long ago . And he was perfectly willing . He did n't say a word against it . " " Of course he would n't . That 's just like father . But still , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should go back on them ? They have trusted me , always . If I fail them , will they ever trust anybody else ? If you love me , Jerry , please go , and stay away . " But her arm tightened about his neck . " I 'll wait here until you get your things , and we can -- say good-by . And do n't forget your promise . " " Oh , very well , Prudence , " he answered , half irritably , " if you insist on ordering me away from the house like this , I can only go . But --  --  " " Let 's not talk any more about it , Jerry . Please . I 'll wait until you come down . " When he came down a little later , with his suitcase , his face was white and strained . She put her arms around his neck . " Jerry , " she whispered , " I want to tell you that I love you so much that -- I could go away with you , and never see any of them any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still feel rich , if I just had you ! You -- everything in me seems to be all yours . I -- love you . " Her tremulous lips were pressed against his . " Oh , sweetheart , this is folly , all folly . But I ca n't make you see it . It is wrong , it is wickedly wrong , but --  --  " " But I am all they have , Jerry , and -- I promised . " " Whenever you want me , Prudence , just send . I 'll never change . I 'll always be just the same . God intended you for me , I know , and -- I 'll be waiting . " " Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry ! " she whispered passionately , sobbing , quivering in his arms . It was he who drew away . " Good-by , sweetheart , " he said quietly , great pity in his heart for the girl who in her desire to do right was doing such horrible wrong . " Good-by , sweetheart . Remember , I will be waiting . Whenever you send , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Prudence stood motionless , her hands clenched , until she could no longer hear his footsteps . Then she dropped on the floor , and lay there , face downward , until she heard Fairy moving in her room up-stairs . Then she went into the kitchen and built the fire for breakfast . CHAPTER XIV SHE COMES TO GRIEF Fairy was one of those buoyant , warm-blooded girls to whom sleep is indeed the great restorer . She slept soundly , sweetly , dreamlessly . And every morning she ran down-stairs so full of animation and life that she seemed all atingle to her finger-tips . Now she stood in the kitchen door , tall , cheeks glowing , eyes sparkling , and smiled at her sister 's solemn back . " You are the little mousey , Prue , " she said , in her full rich voice . " I did n't hear you come to bed last night , and I did n't hear you getting out this morning . I am an abominably solid sleeper , am I not ? Shall I get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows we only use maple sirup when he is here . I 'm constantly expecting Connie to give it away . Why am I always so ravenously hungry in the morning ? Goodness knows I eat enough -- Why , what is the matter ? " For Prudence had turned her face toward her sister , and it was so white and so unnatural that Fairy was shocked . " Prudence ! You are sick ! Go to bed and let me get breakfast . Why did n't you call me ? I 'm real angry at you , Prudence Starr ! Here , get out of this , and I will --  --  " " There 's nothing the matter with me . I had a headache , and did not sleep , but I am all right now . Yes , bring the sirup , Fairy . Are the girls up yet ? " Fairy eyed her suspiciously . " Jerry is out unusually early , too , is n't he ? His door is open . I did n't hear him coming down so he must have quite outdone himself to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry has gone , Fairy . " Prudence 's back was presented to view once more , and Prudence was stirring the oatmeal with vicious energy . " He left early this morning ,  - -  I suppose he is half-way to Des Moines by now . " " Oh ! " Fairy 's voice was non-committal . " Will you get the sirup now ? " " Yes , of course.  - -  When is he coming back ? " " He is n't coming back . Please hurry , Fairy , and then call the others . The oatmeal is ready . " Fairy went soberly down cellar , and brought up the golden sirup . Then , ostensibly to call her sisters , she hurried up the stairs . " Girls , " she began , carefully closing the door of their room behind her . " Jerry has gone , and is n't coming back any more . And for goodness ' sake , do n't keep asking questions about it . Just eat your breakfast as usual , and have a little tact . " " Gone ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested Lark , and her eyes glittered greedily . " Nothing of the sort . And do n't keep staring at Prue , either . And do not keep talking about Jerry all the time . You mind me , or I will tell papa . " " That 's funny , " said Carol thoughtfully . " We left them kissing each other like mad in the back yard last night ,  - -  and this morning he has gone to return no more . They are crazy . " " Kissing ! In the back yard ! What are you talking about ? " Carol explained , and Fairy looked still more thoughtful and perturbed . She opened the door , and called out to them in a loud and breezy voice , " Hurry , girls , for breakfast is ready , and there 's no time to waste in a parsonage on Sunday morning . " Then she added in a whisper , " And do n't you mention Jerry , and do n't ask Prudence what makes her so pale , or you 'll catch it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breakfast is ready , papa , " she called clearly . She turned the knob softly , and peeped in . " May I come in a minute ? " Standing close beside him , she told him all she knew of what had happened . " Prudence is ghastly , father , just ghastly . And she ca n't talk about it yet , so be careful what you say , will you ? " And it was due to Fairy 's kindly admonitions that the parsonage family took the departure of Jerry so calmly . " Fairy says Jerry took the morning train , " said Mr. Starr , as they were passing the cream and sugar for the oatmeal . " That is too bad ! But it is just the worst of being a business man , one never knows when one must be up and away . And of course , one can not neglect business interests.  - -  The oatmeal is unusually good this morning , Prudence . " This was nothing short of heroic on his part , for her eyes upon her father 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat would not stay down . That was the beginning of Prudence 's bitter winter , when the brightest sunshine was cheerless and dreary , and when even the laughter of her sisters smote harshly upon her ears . She tried to be as always , but in her eyes the wounded look lingered , and her face grew so pale and thin that her father and Fairy , anxiously watching , were filled with grave concern . She remained almost constantly in the parsonage , reading very little , sitting most of her leisure time staring out the windows . Fairy had tried to win her confidence , and had failed . " You are a darling , Fairy , but I really do not want to talk about it.  - -  Oh , no , indeed , it is all my own fault . I told him to go , and not come again.  - -  No , you are wrong , Fairy , I do not regret it . I do not want him to come any more . " And Fairy worried . What in the world had happened to separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly in the back yard the evening before ? Mr. Starr , too , had tried . " Prudence , " he said gently , " you know very often men do things that to women seem wrong and wicked . And maybe they are ! But men and women are different by nature , my dear , and we must remember that . I have satisfied myself that Jerry is good , and clean , and manly . I do not think you should let any foolishness of his in the past , come between you now . " " You are mistaken , father . Jerry is all right , and always was , I am sure . It is nothing like that . I told him to go , and not to come again . That is all . " " But if he should come back now --  --  " " It would be just the same . Do n't worry about it , father . It 's all right . " " Prudence , " he said , more tenderly , " we have been the closest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very beginning . Always you have come to me with your troubles and worries . Have I ever failed you ? Why , then , do you go back on me now , when you really need me ? " Prudence patted his shoulder affectionately , but her eyes did not meet his . " I do not really need you now , father . It is all settled , and I am quite satisfied . Things are all right with me just as they are . " Then he took a serious step , without her knowledge . He went to Des Moines , and had a visit with Jerry . He found him thinner , his face sterner , his eyes darker . When the office boy announced " Mr. Starr , " Jerry ran quickly out to greet him . " Is she all right ? " he cried eagerly , almost before he was within hailing distance . Mr. Starr did not mince matters . " Jerry , " he said abruptly , " did you and Prudence have a quarrel ? She declines to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have had , I think I have a right to know what has happened . " " Does she miss me ? Does she seem sorry that I am away ? Does --  --  " His voice was so boyish and so eager there was no mistaking his attitude toward Prudence . " Look here , Jerry , I want to know . Why are you staying away ? " " Wo n't Prudence tell you ? " " No . " " Then I can not . She made me promise not to tell you a word . But it is not my fault , Mr. Starr . I can tell you that . It is nothing I have done or said . She sent me away because she thinks it was right for her to do so , and -- you know Prudence ! It is wrong , I know . I knew it all the time . But I could n't make her see it . And she made me promise not to tell . " In the end Mr. Starr went back to the parsonage no wiser than he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to blame , and that he held himself ready to return to her on a moment 's notice . The Ladies of the Methodist church were puzzled and exasperated . They went to the parsonage , determined to " find out what 's what . " But when they sat with Prudence , and looked at the frail , pathetic little figure , with the mournful eyes ,  - -  - they could only sigh with her and go their ways . The twins continued to play in the great maple , even when the leaves were fallen , " It 's a dandy place , I tell you , Prudence , " cried Carol . " Jerry did n't have time to put up the rope before Connie pulled him down , but we 've fixed it ourselves , and it is simply grand . You can go up and swing any time you like ,  - -  unless your joints are too stiff ! It 's a very serious matter getting up there ,  - -  - for stiff joints , of course , I mean . Lark and I get up easy enough . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she burst out with unusual passion , " Do n't you ever dare climb up in that tree again as long as you live , twins ! Mind what I say ! " Lark looked thoughtfully out of the window , and Carol swallowed hard . It was she who said gently , " Why , of course , Prue ,  - -  just as you say . " For the first time , Prudence had dealt with them harshly and unfairly . They knew it . There was neither sense nor justice in her command . But they did not argue the point . They kept their eyes considerately away from her , and buried themselves in Julius Caesar , it must be remembered the twins are sophomores now . Five minutes later Prudence spoke again , humbly . " I beg you pardon , twins ,  - -  that was a perfectly idiotic thing for me to say . Of course , you may play in the maple whenever you like . But be careful . You could n't save yourselves in falling as -- as men can . " " We wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Carol kindly . " I do want you to play there , " she answered . " It 's a very nice place , and great fun , I know . I might try it myself if -- my joints were n't so stiff ! Now , go on with your Latin . " But Prudence did not pass under the maple for many weeks without clenching her hands , and shuddering . The twins were not satisfied . They marveled , and wondered , and pondered over the subject of Jerry 's disappearance . Finally they felt it was more than human flesh could stand . They would approach Prudence on the subject themselves . But they bided their time . They must wait until Fairy was safely out of the house . Fairy these days had an infuriating way of saying , " That will do , twins . You 'd better go and play now . " It enraged and distracted the twins almost to the point of committing crime . They had made several artistic moves already . Professor Duke , of their freshman biology class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enthusiastic about it . She and Lark talked of " dear old Duck " for two weeks , almost without pausing for sleep . " I 'm sure you would fall in love with him on the spot , " Carol had said to Prudence suggestively . Prudence had only smiled , evidently in sarcasm ! " Jerry was very nice ,  - -  oh , very nice ,  - -  but you ought to see our little Duck ! " Carol rattled rashly . " I 'm sure you would n't regret Jerry any more if you could just get hold of Duckie . Of course , his being in New York is an obstacle , but I could introduce you by mail . " " I do not care for Ducks , " said Prudence . " Of course , they look very nice swimming around on the water , but when it comes to eating ,  - -  I 'll take spring chicken every time . " Carol did not mention " Duck " again for three days . But there came a day when Fairy was out in the country . Connie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . The twins had their plan of campaign memorized , and they sauntered in to Prudence with a nonchalance that was all assumed . " Prudence , " Lark began , " we 're writing a book . " " That 's nice , " said Prudence . Conversation languished . The subject seemed exhausted . Carol came to the rescue . " It 's a very nice book . It 's a love-story , and perfectly thrilling . Larkie does the writing , but I criticize and offer suggestions . " " That 's kind of you . " A pause . " I 'm going to dedicate it to Carol ,  - -  To my beloved sister , to whose kindness and sympathy , I owe all that I am , or something like that , " Lark explained hopefully . " How proud Carol will be ! " A long pause . " We 're in a very critical place just now , though , " Lark seemed to be commencing at the beginning once more . " We have our heroine in a very peculiar situation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How sad . " Another pause . " We thought maybe you could help us out . " " I 'm afraid not , " Prudence smiled a little . " I have n't any imagination . Ask Fairy . She 's strong on love-stories . " " Maybe if we explain the situation to you , you could give us a suggestion . It is like this : The young people have had all kinds of thrilling experiences , but they are not yet betrothed . But they are just on the point of getting there ,  - -  and something crops up all of a sudden ! The hero goes dashing away , and returns no more . The heroine lies upon her silken couch , weeping , weeping . And no one knows what to do about it , because no one knows what has happened . What do you suppose could have sent the lover away like that ? " " Maybe he has n't enough money for the heroine . " " Oh , yes ,  - -  he 's very rich . " " Maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a bachelor . " " Maybe he did n't love her , after all . " Here Carol chimed in helpfully . " Oh , yes , he did , for we left him kissing her all over the back yard , and he would n't have done that if he had n't loved her , you know . " Prudence 's eyes twinkled a little , but her smile was sad . " Now , what would you advise us to do ? " inquired Lark briskly , feeling instinctively that Carol had explained too much . Prudence rose slowly . " I think , " she said very gently , " I think I would burn the book if I were you , and pay a little more attention to my studies . " Then she went up-stairs , and Carol told Lark sympathetically that they did not deserve an authoress in the parsonage when they did n't give her any more encouragement than that ! On the day before Christmas , an insured package was delivered at the parsonage for Prudence . A letter was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearest little sweetheart : I chose this gift for you long before I had the right to do it . I was keeping it until the proper moment . But the moment came , and went again . Still I want you to have the gift . Please wear it , for my sake , for I shall be happy knowing it is where it ought to be , even though I myself am banished . I love you , Prudence . Whenever you send for me , I am ready to come . Entirely and always yours . Jerry . " With trembling fingers she opened the little package . It contained a ring , with a brilliant diamond flashing myriad colors before her eyes . And Prudence kissed it passionately , many times . Two hours later , she went quietly down-stairs to where the rest of the family were decorating a Christmas tree . She showed the ring to them gravely . " Jerry sent it to me , " she said . " Do you think it is all right for me to wear it , father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little group . " Yes , indeed , " declared her father . " How beautiful it is ! Is Jerry coming to spend Christmas with us ? " " Why , no , father ,  - -  he is not coming at all any more . I thought you understood that . " An awkward silence , and Carol came brightly to the rescue . " It certainly is a beauty ! I thought it was very kind of Professor Duckie to send Lark and me a five-pound box of chocolates , but of course this is ever so much nicer . Jerry 's a bird , I say . " " A bird ! " mocked Fairy . " Such language . " Lark came to her twin 's defense . " Yes , a bird ,  - -  that 's just what he is . " Carol smiled . " We saw him use his wings when Connie yanked him out of the big maple , did n't we , Lark ? " Then , " Did you send him anything , Prue ? " Prudence hesitated , and answered without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my picture taken when I was in Burlington , and sent it to him . " " Your picture ! Oh , Prudence ! Where are they ? Are n't you going to give us one ? " " No , Carol . I had only one made ,  - -  for Jerry . There are n't any more . " " Well , " sighed Lark resignedly , " it 's a pretty idea for my book , anyhow . " From that day on , Prudence always wore the sparkling ring ,  - -  and the women of the Methodist church nearly had mental paralysis marveling over a man who gave a diamond ring , and never came a-wooing ! And a girl who accepted and wore his offering , with nothing to say for the man ! And it was the consensus of opinion in Mount Mark that modern lovers were mostly crazy , anyhow ! And springtime came again . Now the twins were always original in their amusements . They never followed blindly after the dictates of custom . When other girls were playing dolls , the twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were jumping the rope , the twins were conducting a circus . And when other girls played " catch " with dainty rubber balls , the twins took unto themselves a big and heavy croquet ball ,  - -  found in the Avery woodshed . To be sure , it stung and bruised their hands . What matter ? At any rate , they continued endangering their lives and beauties by reckless pitching of the ungainly plaything . One Friday evening after school , they were amusing themselves on the parsonage lawn with this huge ball . When their father turned in , they ran up to him with a sporting proposition . " Bet you a nickel , papa , " cried Carol , " that you ca n't throw this ball as far as the schoolhouse woodshed !  - -  By the way , will you lend me a nickel , papa ? " He took the ball , and weighed it lightly in his hand . " I 'm an anti-betting society , " he declared , laughing , " but I very strongly believe it will carry to the schoolhouse woodshed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five cents ' worth of candy to-morrow . And if it does , you shall put an extra nickel in the collection next Sunday . " Then he drew back his arm , and carefully sighted across the lawn . " I 'll send it right between the corner of the house and that little cedar , " he said , and then , bending low , it whizzed from his hand . Lark screamed , and Carol sank fainting to the ground . For an instant , Mr. Starr himself stood swaying . Then he rushed across the lawn . For Prudence had opened the front door , and stepped quickly out on the walk by the corner of the house . The heavy ball struck her on the forehead , and she fell heavily , without a moan . CHAPTER XV FATE TAKES CHARGE Four hours Prudence lay unconscious , with two doctors in close attendance . Fairy , alert but calm , was at hand to give them service . It is a significant thing that in bitter anguish and grief , Christians find comfort and peace in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in times of danger and mental stress . But here is the big difference between the prayers of Christians and the prayers of " others . " " Others " pray , and pray , and pray again , and continue still in the agony and passion of grief and fear . And yet they pray . But Christians pray , and find confidence and serenity . Sorrow may remain , but anguish is stilled . Mount Mark considered this a unique parsonage family . Their liveliness , their gaiety , their love of fun , seemed a little inapropos in the setting of a Methodist parsonage . " They ai n't sanctimonious enough by half , " declared old Harvey Reel , the bus driver , " but , by Jings ! I tell you they are dandies ! " But as a matter of fact , every one of the family , from Connie up , had a characteristic parsonage heart . When they were worried , or frightened , or grieved , they prayed . Fairy passing up the stairs with hot water for the doctors , whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , " Keep on praying , father . I ca n't stop now , because they need me . But I 'm praying every minute between errands ! " And Mr. Starr , kneeling beside his bed , did pray ,  - -  and the stony despair in his eyes died out , and he came from the little room quiet , and confident , and calm . Connie had been unfortunate . In seeking a secluded corner to " pray for Prudence , " she had passed the door of the dungeon , and paused . A fitting place ! So she turned in at once , drawing the door after her , but leaving it a couple of inches ajar . Then in the farthest and darkest corner , she knelt on the hard floor , and prayed , and sobbed herself to sleep . Fairy passing through the hall , observed the door ajar , and gave it a slight push . The lock snapped into place , but Connie did not waken . Lark remained loyally with Carol until consciousness returned to her . As soon as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn , and climbed into the much-loved haymow . There they lay flat on the hay , faces downward , each with an arm across the other 's shoulder , praying fervently . After a time they rose and crept into the house , where they waited patiently until Fairy came down on one of her numerous errands . " Is she better ? " they whispered . And Fairy answered gently , " I think she is a little better . " Then the twins , in no way deceived , went back to the haymow again . Fairy prepared a hasty supper , and arranged it on the kitchen table . She drank a cup of hot coffee , and went in search of her father . " Go and eat , dadsie , " she urged . But he shook his head . " I am not hungry , but send the girls to the table at once . " On their next trip into the house , Fairy stopped the twins . " Get Connie , and eat your supper . It 's just a cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must help yourselves ,  - -  I ca n't come now . " The twins did not speak , and Fairy went hurriedly up the stairs once more . " I do not think I can eat , " said Carol . " I know I ca n't , " was Lark 's reply . " Wo n't Fairy make us ? She 'll tell papa . " " We 'd better take away about half of this food , and hide it . Then she will think we have already eaten . " This novel plan was acted upon with promptitude . " Where 's Connie ? She ought to eat something . We must make her do it . " " She probably cried herself to sleep somewhere . We 'd better let her alone . She 'll feel much better asleep and hungry , than awake and sorry for Prue . " So the twins went back to the haymow . When it grew dark , they slipped into the kitchen , and huddled together on , the woodbox beside the stove . And down to them presently came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better ! " cried Carol , springing to her feet . " Yes , " said Fairy , dropping on her knees and burying her face in Lark 's lap , as she still sat on the woodbox . " She 's better . She is better . " Lark patted the heaving shoulders in a motherly way , and when Fairy lifted her face again it was all serene , though her lashes were wet . " She is conscious , " said Fairy , still on her knees , but with her head thrown back , and smiling . " She regained consciousness a little while ago . There is nothing really serious the matter . It was a hard knock , but it missed the temple . When she became conscious , she looked up at father and smiled . Father looked perfectly awful , twins , so pale , and his lips were trembling . And Prudence said , ' Now , father , on your word of honor , did you knock me down with that ball on purpose ? ' She spoke very low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say a word , he just nodded , and gulped . She has a little fever , and the doctors say we may need to work with her part of the night . Father said to ask if you would go to bed now , so you can get up early in the morning and help us . I am to stay with Prudence to-night , but you may have to take turns in the morning . And you 'll have to get breakfast , too . So father thinks you would better go to bed . Will you do that , twinnies ? " " Will we ! " And Carol added , " Will you kiss Prudence good night for us , and tell her we kept praying all the time ? Prudence is such a great hand for praying , you know . " Fairy promised , and the twins crept up-stairs . It was dark in their room . " We 'll undress in the dark so as not to awake poor little Connie , " whispered Lark . " It 's nice she can sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins went to bed , and fell asleep after a while , never doubting that Connie , in her corner of the room , was already safe and happy in the oblivion of slumber . But poor Connie ! She had not wakened when Fairy closed the dungeon door . It was long afterward when she sat up and began rubbing her eyes . She did not know where she was . Then she remembered ! She wondered if Prudence --  She scrambled to her feet , and trotted over to the dungeon door . It was locked , she could not turn the knob . At first , she thought of screaming and pounding on the door . " But that will arouse Prudence , and frighten her , and maybe kill her , " she thought wretchedly . " I 'll just keep still until some one passes . " But no one passed for a long time , and Connie stretched her aching little body and sobbed , worrying about Prudence , fearful on her own account . She had no idea of the time . She supposed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe Prudence had died ! Connie writhed in agony on the hard floor , and sobbed bitterly . Still she would not risk pounding on the dungeon door . Up-stairs , in the front room , Prudence was at that time wrestling with fever . Higher and higher it rose , until the doctors looked very anxious . They held a brief consultation in the corner of the room . Then they beckoned to Mr. Starr . " Has Prudence been worrying about something this winter ? " " Yes . " " Has she been grieving , and fretting for something ? " " Yes , she has . " " It is that young man , is n't it ? " inquired the family doctor ,  - -  a Methodist " member . " " Yes . " " Can you bring him here ? " " Yes ,  - -  as soon as he can get here from Des Moines . " " You 'd better do it . She has worn herself down nearly to the point of prostration . We think we can break this fever without serious consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She can not relax and rest , until she gets relief . " So he went down-stairs and over the telephone dictated a short message to Jerry . " Please come ,  - -  Prudence . " When he entered the front bedroom again , Prudence was muttering unintelligible words under her breath . He kneeled down beside the bed , and put his arms around her . She clung to him with sudden passion . " Jerry ! Jerry ! " she cried . Her father caressed and petted her , but did not speak . " Oh , I ca n't , " she cried again . " I ca n't , Jerry , I ca n't ! " Again her voice fell to low mumbling . " Yes , go . Go at once . I promised , you know.  - -  They have n't any mother.  - -  I promised . Jerry ! Jerry ! " Her voice rang out so wildly that Connie , down in the dungeon , heard her cries and sobbed anew , relieved that Prudence was living , frightened at the wildness of her voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go !  - -  Oh , yes , go at once . I promised.  - -  Father needs me . " And then a piercing shriek , " He is falling ! Connie , drop that rope ! " She struggled up in the bed , and gazed wildly about her ,  - -  then , panting , she fell back on the pillows . But Mr. Starr smiled gently to himself . So that was the answer ! Oh , foolish little Prudence ! Oh , sweet-hearted little martyr girl ! Hours later the fever broke , and Prudence drifted into a deep sleep . Then the doctors went downstairs with Mr. Starr , talking in quiet ordinary tones . " Oh , she is all right now , no danger at all . She 'll do fine . Let her sleep . Send Fairy to bed , too . Keep Prudence quiet a few days ,  - -  that 's all . She 's all right . " They did not hear the timid knock at the dungeon door . But after they had gone out , Mr. Starr locked the door behind them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors were locked . He distinctly heard a soft tapping , and he smiled . " Mice ! " he thought . Then he heard something else ,  - -  a faintly whispered " Father ! " With a sharp exclamation he unlocked and opened the dungeon door , and Connie fell into his arms , sobbing piteously . And he did the only wise thing to do under such circumstances . He sat down on the hall floor and cuddled the child against his breast . He talked to her soothingly until the sobs quieted , and her voice was under control . " Now , tell father , " he urged , " how did you get in the dungeon ? The twins --  --  " " Oh , no , father , of course not , the twins would n't do such a thing as that . I went into the dungeon to pray that Prudence would get well . And I prayed myself to sleep . When I woke up the door was locked . " " But you precious child , " he whispered , " why did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was afraid it would excite Prue and make her worse , " she answered simply . And her father 's kiss was unwontedly tender as he carried her upstairs to bed . Prudence slept late the next morning , and when she opened her eyes her father was sitting beside her . " All right this morning , father , " she said , smiling . " Are the girls at school ? " " No ,  - -  this is Saturday . " " Oh , of course . Well , bring them up , I want to see them . " Just then the distant whistle of a locomotive sounded through the open window , but she did not notice her father 's sudden start . She nodded up at him again , and repeated , " I want to see my girls . " Her father sent them up to her at once , and they stood at the foot of the bed with sorry faces , and smiled at her . " Say something , " whispered Carol , kicking Lark suggestively on the foot . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . " Oh , Prudence , do you suppose the doctors will let me come in and watch them bandage your head ? I want to begin practising up , so as to be ready for the next war . " Then they laughed , and the girls realized that Prudence was really alive and quite as always . They told her of Connie 's sad experience , and Prudence comforted her sweetly . " It just proves all over again , " she declared , smiling , but with a sigh close following , " that you ca n't get along without me to look after you . Would I ever go to bed without making sure that Connie was safe and sound ? " Down-stairs , meanwhile , Mr. Starr was plotting with Fairy , a willing assistant . " He 'll surely be in on this train , and you must keep him down here until I get through with Prudence . I want to tell her a few things before she sees him . Bring him in quietly , and do n't let him speak loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand for a few minutes . Explain it to the girls , will you ? " After sending the younger girls down-stairs again , he closed the door of Prudence 's room , and sat down beside her . " Prudence , I ca n't tell you how bitterly disappointed I am in you . " " Father ! " " Yes , I thought you loved us ,  - -  the girls and me . It never occurred to me that you considered us a bunch of selfish , heartless , ungrateful animals ! " " Father ! " " Is that your idea of love ? Is that --  --  " " Oh , father ! " " It really did hurt me , Prudence . My dear little girl , how could you send Jerry away , breaking your heart and his , and ours , too ,  - -  just because you thought us such a selfish lot that we would begrudge you any happiness of your own ? Do n't you think our love for you is big enough to make us happy in seeing you happy ? You used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to marry , then . But we knew the time would come when marriage would seem beautiful and desirable to you . We were waiting for that time . We were hoping for it . We were happy when you loved Jerry , because we knew he was good and kind and loving , and that he could give you all the beautiful things of life -- that I can never give my children . But you thought we were too selfish to let you go , and you sent him away . " " But father ! Who would raise the girls ? Who would keep the parsonage ? Who would look after you ? " " Aunt Grace , to be sure . We talked it over two years ago , when her husband died . Before that , she was not free to come to us . But she said then that whenever we were ready for her , she would come . We both felt that since you were getting along so magnificently with the girls , it was better that way for a while . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us gladly . We had it all arranged . You wo n't want to marry for a year or so , yet . You 'll want to have some happy sweetheart days first . And you 'll want to make a lot of those pretty , useless , nonsensical things other girls make when they marry . That 's why I advised you to save your burglar money ,  - -  so you would have it for this . We 'll have Aunt Grace come right away , so you can take a little freedom to be happy , and to make your plans . And you can initiate Aunt Grace into the mysteries of parsonage housekeeping . " A bright strange light had flashed over Prudence 's face . But her eyes clouded a little as she asked , " Do you think they would rather have Aunt Grace than me ? " " Of course not . But what has that to do with it ? We love you so dearly that we can only be happy when you are happy . We love you so dearly that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are happy . But you -- you thought our love was such a hideous , selfish , little make-believe that --  --  " " Oh , father , I did n't ! You know I did n't !  - -  But - -  maybe Jerry wo n't forgive me now ? " " Why did n't you talk it over with me , Prudence ? " " I knew you too well , father . I knew it would be useless . But -- does n't it seem wrong , father , that -- a girl -- that I -- should love Jerry more than -- you and the girls ? That he should come first ? Does n't it seem -- wicked ? " " No , Prudence , it is not wicked . After all , perhaps it is not a stronger and deeper love . You were willing to sacrifice him and yourself , for our sakes ! But it is a different love . It is the love of woman for man ,  - -  that is very different from sister-love and father-love . And it is right . And it is beautiful . " " I am sure Jerry will forgive me . Maybe if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note now ? There 's no use waiting , is there ? Fairy will bring it , I am sure . " But when a few minutes later , she heard a step in the hall outside , she laid her arm across her face . Somehow she felt that the wonderful joy and love shining in her eyes should be kept hidden until Jerry was there to see . She heard the door open , and close again . " Put them on the table , Fairy dearest , and -- leave me for a little while , will you ? Thank you . " And her face was still hidden . Then the table by the bedside was swiftly drawn away , and Jerry kneeled beside her , and drew the arm from her face . " Jerry ! " she whispered , half unbelievingly . Then joyously , " Oh , Jerry ! " She gazed anxiously into his face . " Have you been sick ? How thin you are , and so pale ! Jerry Harmer , you need me to take care of you , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked earnestly and steadily into the joyful eyes for a moment , and then he pressed his face to hers .
