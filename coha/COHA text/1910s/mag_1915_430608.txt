I N the earlier stages of the war an English country gentleman wrote to Lord Kitchener , complaining that through the isorganization of the railroad service beuse of the movement of troops he was longer getting his letters in time to ad them at the breakfast-table . He for'bly expressed his opinion that the War ffice should so arrange military transport not to interfere with the delivery of the morning post . Lord Kitchener 's reply has t been given out . The probabilities are , wever , that , the reply , if one was made , as to the effect that the letter had been ceived and would be given careful attention . On a par with this are the letters which ve not only been written , but have actuly been printed in the leading newspars , complaining of trains being overcrowded with soldiers , to the discomfort Of regular patrons ; protests against the early closing of public houses , the dimming of lights in towns threatened by aircraft , and the challenging of motor-drivers on the highways in the neighborhood of camps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the irregularity of ocean mails , the high prices of food , in fact , complaints of everything unusual in English life that has come about as a result of the war , have been made in perfect good faith , and with the apparent expectation that the authorities would rectify conditions at an early date . These things are incredible to a Frenchman , a German , or a Russian , for in their countries the entire population is given over to war and the thought of war , and no inconvenience is too great to be borne in silence . The Englishman takes seriously any invasion of what he believes to be his personal rights , and those in authority treat all complaints of this nature in the same serious spirit . This is illuminating as to a certain quality in the British character that , while a source of inspiration to the native humorist and a delight to foreigners as adding substantially to the joy of nations , is one of the great factors in the strength of the British spirit in peace or in war . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the last moment ; but when the hand is put to the plow , insures a straight furrow to the end of the task . Slow to awake and slow to act , but once awake and once in action , the race is as irresistible as the movement of a glacier . No other nation could find its way to victory along a path so strewn with obstacles of its own making . No other nation , with the interior troubles that constantly rise to vex the people , could survive in the face of an enemy . It is said that just prior to the war a report went to Germany that , in case of trouble for England from without , Ireland would make trouble from within ; that India , Egypt , and South Africa would rise to the opportunity for nationalization ; that English labor would hamper the Government in its every need . The strangest feature of all this is the absolute truth of the predictions made to Germany , and yet the real unimportance of these things as weakening influences in the fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter that is not grasped by many observers of English affairs who are not of the race . Ireland has made trouble within , unrest in India , Egypt , and South Africa has risen to the surface , and yet the immutability of the dominating English character has failed to show any signs of disintegration . The work of empire has progressed along its predestined path regardless of the strife within . Sedition  | in Ireland has been dealt with in wholly a casual way ; in fact , almost ignored . Ferment in India and Egypt has been ignored in the press , and kept under stern control by those with power at their command . Thousands of Irishmen are in the British army , and thousands more are waiting in their homes , calmly indifferent as to the outcome of the war , and some , in fact , even nursing an active antagonism toward the British Empire . For many months following the outbreak of war Irish newspapers printed sedition without check . An indignant English press demanded some action . A reluctant Government one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon again ignored their existence . A weary world power is Great Britain , blase to the point of indifference except as to the main object in view , and that is the maintenance of her position as the balance of power in the world . The angry shrieks of the Anglophobes in Ireland , India , Germany , America , and elsewhere echo loudly except in the dim corridors of those vast buildings in Whitehall where pass quietly to and fro the men who direct the destinies not only of their own , but of other European powers . It is little wonder that foreigners in England fail to understand the strength of national purpose and the real cohesive power of the nation as they listen to the clamor about them , for these are in evidence only in times of great national stress . It was only a few months before the war that Rudyard Kipling made a political speech so violent in its denunciation of the men now in power in the British Government as actually to harm the cause he advocated . He described them in plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that state prison was the only proper place for them in any righteous scheme of things . Now we find this same speaker working effectively to support the hands of these very men , and with unquestioned sincerity . This does not mean , however , that his position is reversed . Let the war strain upon the empire pass , and all will be as before . It is not right to judge foreign ambassadors to England too harshly and call them fools because after a few months ' or even years ' residence in England they have visions of the British Empire in ruins and its power passing into the hands of others . In any other country they might be right in their conjecture , but in England the apparent weakness of the national structure is an illusion , and a most effective one at that . The narrow-minded , bigoted , selfish middle-class employer of labor is a slave-driver , and at his door must be laid many of the troubles with which industrial England is afflicted . Six months after the war began , strikes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army and navy . Negotiations between employers and employed finally reached a stage where the difference of half a cent an hour in the " wage-scale was all that prevented an agreement , and a deadlock resulted . Neither side would yield . The inevitable happened . The Government took over the works , paid the increased wage demanded , and left all disputes to be settled after the war . The English employer has put it up to the Government , and after the war he will probably revert to his original contention , and will be successful , for with the depression of business and the glut of the labor market which will follow war he will be twice armed against the demands of labor . There is no lack of patriotism among the laboring-men of England , but they refused to let such a plea be used entirely to the advantage of those who were selling vast bills of goods to the Government at big prices . Behind the firing-line , where every man is intent upon one object and will give his life to save his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time-worn problems of empire , home government , industry , and philanthropy , and yet the nation goes on , the results alone telling the story of that unity of purpose which survives , and triumphs over , this welter of home affairs . It was a long time after the war began before the British people entered into a realization of the task that now lies before  | the mother country . It was not until September , at the furthest point of the British retreat , that the full meaning of the predicted call for three million men was understood even by the intelligent , and to this day there exists in many of the farming districts a strange remoteness from the struggle going on so near by . Imagine the feelings of the people of New York , if great battles were being fought as near as Washington . Consider the intense public interest and the suspension of all ordinary activities that would follow a naval battle along the southern Jersey coast or the bombardment of Atlantic City by hostile air-craft . Then picture if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sound of guns in the channel can be distinctly heard , and near which four or five thousand soldiers in training may be in camp , the villagers of which are content to gather their news every day from the rural postman , and wait until Sunday for their weekly paper to confirm and elaborate his statements . The gentlemen of England took the coming of war and the call for their services quite as a matter of course . Their fathers had achieved their rank and possessions by the sword and through service to the king . Tradition and training left no option , and they went first . It was not a matter of reason or particular intelligence on their part , but there was a gentleman 's job to be done , and theirs to do it . Patriotism is a matter of course with them , and they do not discuss the whys and wherefores of international politics . Then came the more intellectual class ? the professional people from the courts , the stage , from the world of literature , and the keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who offered what they had to give , their lives , for the defense of their country . Their country had no call upon them other than they chose to grant . They owed nothing for lands or titles , but they put aside their own affairs , and when officers ' billets were not forthcoming , they took their places in the ranks . Alen over forty swore they were thirty-five , and the wife of one of these , when word came to her that he had been killed , wrote to her best friend this simple line : " Was n't he splendid ? I am so proud . " Then as the army grew , the wasters , the ne'er-do-wells , the won't-works , the criminals , and all others who in times of peace live to vex society , came straggling in along the line of least resistance . Thus was the first million enrolled and a start made on the second million ; then came a lull . Conscription was talked of as an imminent necessity , but the raid on Scarborough and Hartlepool intervened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those communities penetrated ears that had been deaf till then . The nation seemed to say , " Here , this wo n't do ; we must stir about and put an end to it , " and the men came in by thousands . The War Office then sent out a circular to four million householders , asking every one if he had any one in his family who wished to enlist . In response to this one call 218 , - 000 men joined the colors . Then the movement extended into the ranks of farm labor and industrial workers , until the Government had to call a halt upon the depletion of factory forces . By this time there were two million men under arms , and now this volunteer British army is well on its way toward the three-million mark . The conditions that existed as the first million was being enlisted were extremely bad . The cold rain of winter made all outdoors disagreeable . There was a scarcity of guns , ammunition , clothing , food , and housing . Officers with money bought supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the requisitions . The public was called upon to contribute of everything from underclothes to musical instruments , and probably in no country in the world and at no time in history has non-combatant population so stripped itself of surplus impedimenta for the benefit of its soldiery . A call for motor-cars made to one club alone brought offers ' of over 2000 within a few days . With all this , the life of the nation went on much as before . The Govern- ment was criticized , and paid little heed . Taxes went up , and were collected as usual . Debtors squirmed , but creditors insisted . There was a brave show of " business as usual " at first , but now it is slowly , but surely , penetrating the average middle-class English mind that something is wrong with affairs , and the conclusion is being reached that it is the war that has put things so out of joint and that , if it keeps on in this way for long , it will be a serious affair . Certain forms of hysteria have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last line of home defense among the women , and a regiment of females in khaki parades through Hyde Park in anticipation of the day when they may be called upon for service . Whether it was Mr. H. G. Wells who was responsible for this outbreak has not yet been proved , but as he advocated such organization , he will at least have to bear part of the blame , though his entire program , which included arming the children as well , has not yet been carried out . Needless to say this sort of thing is not done with the sanction of the War Office ; but the officials there are too busy with real things to take any notice of such tomfoolery , and they may argue that it serves as a harmless outlet for an activity which might otherwise become pernicious . The Englishman is not a good hater . With many exceptions , of course , he may be prejudiced , indifferent , or even contemptuous where foreigners are concerned ; but he really hates no one , not even his avowed enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans that led to the internment of German citizens ; it was fear of spies , and even then nearly 20,000 were left at large in London alone . It came to light not long ago that the police , under the direction of the Home Office , were visiting the former employers of Germans now interned , inquiring as to whether the men would be taken back into their former positions if released . This brought forth a vigorous protest in the press , and the scheme was not a success . That the Germans will be as numerous and as strong a factor in English life within a short time after the end of the war as they were before it is the belief of virtually every Englishman , and he does not care . The outbursts of hatred that have reached him from Germany do not worry him in the least ; in fact , they have caused amusement rather than anything else , and have been freely parodied in the English press . The only fixed idea in the mind of every English man , woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany must be beaten , and coupled with this is a supreme belief in the justice of their cause , and an unquestioned faith in a successful outcome of the war . It is hoped that the end will come soon , but whether for a year or for five years , the war will be fought to the carrying out of its now welldefined purposes , and to-day , as the British Government and the people now feel , with or without allies , England will go on to the end with the same intention and the same belief . Appreciation of the spirit shown in Australia and Canada is wide-spread . These communities have grown much in English estimation in the last few months , the bonds of empire being stronger and drawn closer than for many a day . This does not prevent English criticism of the colonial allies , remarks as to the lack of discipline and restraint among their troops , and a slight look askance at a patriotism that makes more noise than is usual " at home . " The Canadians arrive and depart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving of flags . The English regiments march to the sound of tramping 4eet only , leave the camps or railway stations without notice to the public , and disappear into that region known vaguely as " the front , " from which little news except long and gruesome casualty-lists comes back . On the bulletin-board of a single club in London , not a strictly . military club , either , is pinned a type-written sheet . It now bears the names of forty members of the club killed in action and sixty wounded , and- yet the waiters go about as usual , the smoking-room is filled with men  | who talk of many things besides war , and an occasional khaki-clad member is the only indication of abnormal times . As the months go by , the strain is telling somewhat upon this instinct for repression . Sentiment is coming nearer to the surface and more easily manifests itself than it ever did before . The Englishman is apparently content with what his carefully censored newspapers tell him of conditions in South Africa , Egypt , India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money to the cause of empire . He heard briefly of the uprising in South Africa , but did not learn of its seriousness and extent until it was all over . He reads of the loyalty of India and the wondrous deeds of the Ghurkas . He was told that the climate of northern France was not favorable for the Indians and that they had to be taken to the south to recuperate . He does not know that it was the German artillery and not the cold which at first demoralized these troops , and that it is only now they have found themselves , and in accordance with their traditions have made good on the firing-line . He wonders a little at the request of the Viceroy of India for additional power to deal with sedition , and those who know best may grasp the difficulties which now confront the administration of the Indian Government , but they have no fear they will get beyond control . He is told the Indians are fighting for England , but is not informed that this is only incidental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own independence , which is safer under the English system of local autonomy than it would be under the German centralized method of colonial administration . The Englishman at home does not know , however , that several very distinguished Indian princes are in effect prisoners in England , in that the British Government prefers to keep them where they can make no trouble , and has urged them most politely to prolong their visit to England 's hospitable shores . Although it is true that the English nation is absolutely united in its determination to defeat Germany , and unanimous in its belief that the end will be achieved sooner or later , the individualism of the Englishman is as pronounced as ever . English commerce is individualism carried to the greatest possible extreme , and throughout English life there is an absolute lack of the unanimity marked in many other nations . No Englishman will surrender the right to his own opinion . The Scotchman is the highest developed exponent of a contentious spirit , but the Englishman follows a close second . No two Britishers agree absolutely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public affairs , or necessary details in the regulation of community or private life . In other words , there is a strong assertive quality in English character that makes impossible the cultivation of a unanimous sentiment of love or hate for a person or a foreign nation . No cult of hatred , such as has found a place in Germany as a result of the war , could find lodgment in the British nation as a whole . It seems almost impossible to drill the English people into the observance of any particular national system . This war is a struggle between Germany on the one hand , with her people trained and willing to act , live , and think under such a complete code of rules as to leave no room for individualism , and England on the other , with a people who refuse to fall under the control of any system which would destroy the right , held to be inalienable , of every man to think and act for himself . The war has already shown that a nation systematized responds quicker to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more effective position to carry out a national purpose without delay , than one where individualism is strong . The war has also shown , however , that a nation of strong individuality united upon a single purpose , such unity having been arrived at by devious routes , and in free will , is the.stronger in its resisting power and man for man the more dangerous foe .  |
