The forest is dark , with gleams of moonlight . Suddenly there is a faint note of music the Nibelung theme . After a silence it is repeated ; then again . Several instruments take it up . It swells louder . Vague forms are seen flitting here and there . Shadows move. p. 11 GERALD ISMAN Starting up suddenly . What 's that ? Silence ; then the note is heard again , very faint . He starts . It is heard again , and he springs to his feet . What 's that ? Again and again . He runs to his violin , picks it up , and stares at it . Still the notes are heard , and he puts down the violin , and runs down stage , listening . Why , what can it mean ? As the music grows louder his perplexity and alarm increase . Suddenly he sees a figure stealing through the shadows , and he springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Another figure passes . Oh ! I must be dreaming ! Several more appear . Nibelungs ! Why , it 's absurd ! Wake up , man ! You 're going crazy ! Music swells louder ; figures appear , carrying gold shields , chains , etc. , with clatter . My God ! He stands with hands clasped to his forehead , while the uproar swells louder and louder , and the forms become more numerous . He rushes down stage , and the Nibelungs surround him , dancing about him in wild career , laughing , screaming , jeering . They begin to pinch his legs behind his back , and he leaps here and there , crying out . Gradually they drive him toward the grotto , which opens before them , revealing a black chasm , emitting clouds of steam . They rush in and are enveloped in the mist . Sounds of falling and crashing are heard . The steam spreads , gradually veiling the front of the stage . Nets rise with the steam , giving the effect of a descent . During this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III in Das Rheingold. p. 12 p. 13 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE II Nibelheim : a vast rocky cavern .

At the left is a large golden vase upon a stand , and near it lie piles of golden utensils , shields , etc . Left centre is a heavy iron door , opening into a vault .

They post themselves about the apartment . Enter another company supporting KING ALBERICH . He is grey-haired and very feeble , but ferocious-looking , and somewhat taller than the others . His robe is lined with ermine , and he carries a gold Nibelung whip  --  a short handle of gold , with leather thongs . He seats himself upon the throne , and all make obeisance . A solemn pause .

Voices are heard in the distance , and at the climax of the music PRINCE HAGEN and his keepers enter . He is small for a man , but larger than any of the Nibelungs ; a grim , sinister figure , with black hair , and a glowering look . His hands are chained in front of him , and eight Nibelungs march as a guard . He has bare arms and limbs , and a rough black bearskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands glaring from one to another . ALBERICH Good evening , Hagen . PRINCE HAGEN After a pause . Well ? ALBERICH Hesitating . Hagen , you are still angry and rebellious ? p. 16 PRINCE HAGEN I am ! ALBERICH Pleading . Hagen , you are my grandson . You are my sole heir the only representative of my line . You are all that I have in the world ! PRINCE HAGEN Well ? ALBERICH You place me in such a trying position ! Have you no shame no conscience ? Why , some day you will be king and one can not keep a king in chains ! PRINCE HAGEN I do not want to be in chains ! ALBERICH But , Hagen , your conduct is such what can I do ? You have robbed you have threatened murder ! And you my grandson and my heir PRINCE HAGEN Have you sent for me to preach at me again ? ALBERICH Hagen , this stranger he has come to visit us from the world above . These earth-men know more than we they have greater powers He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

But I am in chains ! p. 17 ALBERICH There may be a way of your having another chance . Perhaps this stranger will teach you . If you will promise to obey him , he will stay with you he will be your tutor , and show you the ways of the earth-men . PRINCE HAGEN No ! ALBERICH What ? PRINCE HAGEN I will not have it ! ALBERICH Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN I will not have it , I say ! Why did you not consult me ? ALBERICH But what is your objection PRINCE HAGEN I will not obey an earth-man ! I will not obey anyone !

GERALD is brought on ; the orchestra plays a beautiful melody , violins and horns . MIMI moves left to meet him . GERALD ISMAN Enters left with attendants ; hesitating , gazing about in wonder .

It is very interesting ! GERALD ISMAN Yes I have no doubt . Peers at him . And just to help me straighten things out would you mind telling me are you old or young ? MIMI I am young . GERALD ISMAN How young ? MIMI Nine hundred years young . GERALD ISMAN Oh ! And why did you come for me ? MIMI The king commanded it . GERALD ISMAN The king ? And who may this king be ?

GERALD ISMAN Why it 's in Wagner 's operas . He composed it . ALBERICH Humph composed it ! GERALD ISMAN Aghast . You mean he came and copied it ! ALBERICH Of course ! GERALD ISMAN Why why we all thought it was original ! ALBERICH Original ! It is indeed wonderful originality ! To listen in the Rhine-depths to the song of the maidens , to dwell in the forest and steal its murmurs , to catch the crackling of the fire and the flowing of the water , the galloping of the wind and the death march of the thunder and then write it all down for your own ! To take our story and tell it just as it happened to take the very words from our lips , and sign your name to them ! Originality ! GERALD ISMAN But , your majesty , one thing at least .

Listen ! ALBERICH It is very monotonous , when one is digging out the gold . It keeps up such a wheezing , and pounding . Stopped trumpets from orchestra . GERALD ISMAN Ah , do n't speak of such things ! Gazes about ; sees cup . What is this ? ALBERICH That is the coronation cup . GERALD ISMAN The coronation cup ? ALBERICH One of the greatest of our treasures . It is worth over four hundred thousand dollars . It is the work of the elder Mimi , a most wonderful smith . GERALD ISMAN Advancing . May I look at it ? ALBERICH You will observe the design of the Rhine maidens . p. 22 GERALD ISMAN I ca n't see it here . It 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle ? ALL A candle ! ALBERICH My dear sir ! Candles are so expensive ! And why do you want to see it ? We never look at our art treasures . GERALD ISMAN Never look at them ! ALBERICH No . We know what they are worth , and everyone else knows ; and what difference does it make how they look ? GERALD ISMAN Oh , I see ! ALBERICH Perhaps you would like to see our vaults of gold ? Great excitement among the Nibelungs . The music makes a furious uproar . ALBERICH gives a great key to MIMI , who opens the iron doors . Approach , sir . MIMI Hear the echoes . Shouts . GERALD ISMAN It must be a vast place ! ALBERICH This particular cavern runs for seventeen miles under the earth . GERALD ISMAN What ! And you mean it is all full of gold ? ALBERICH From floor to roof with solid masses of it . GERALD ISMAN Incredible ! Is it all of the Nibelung treasure ? p. 23 ALBERICH All ? Mercy , no ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich man . The extent of some of our modern fortunes would simply exceed your belief . We live in an age of enormous productivity . After a pause . Will you see more of the vault ? GERALD ISMAN No , I thank you . They close it . It must be getting late ; and , by the way , your majesty , you know that no one has told me yet why you had me brought here . ALBERICH Ah , yes , sure enough . We have business to talk about . Let us get to it ! To MIMI . Let the hall be cleared . MIMI drives out the Nibelungs and retires . Sit on this rock here beside me . Confidentially . Now we can talk things over . I trust you are willing to listen to me . GERALD ISMAN Most certainly . I am very much interested . ALBERICH Thank you . You know , my dear sir , that I had a son , Hagen , who was the slayer of the great hero , Siegfried ? GERALD ISMAN Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did not know , I presume , that Hagen , too , had a son , by one of the daughters of earth ? GERALD ISMAN No . He is not mentioned in history . p. 24 ALBERICH That son , Prince Hagen , is now living ; and , in the course of events , he will fall heir to the throne I occupy . GERALD ISMAN I see . ALBERICH The boy is seven or eight hundred years old , which , in your measure , would make him about eighteen . Now , I speak frankly . The boy is wild and unruly . He needs guidance and occupation . And I have sent for you because I understand that you earth-people think more and see farther than we do . GERALD ISMAN Yes ? ALBERICH I wish to ask you to help me to use your strength of mind and body to direct this boy . GERALD ISMAN But what can I do ? ALBERICH I wish you to stay here and be Prince Hagen 's tutor . GERALD ISMAN What ? ALBERICH Anxiously . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence a treasure such as the world has never seen before . And it is a noble work a great work , sir . He is the grandson of a king ! Tell me will you help me ? Gazes imploringly . GERALD ISMAN Let me think . A pause . Your majesty , I have things of importance to do , and I have no time to stay here p. 25 ALBERICH But think of the treasures ! GERALD ISMAN My father is a rich man , and I have no need of treasures . And besides , I am a poet . I have work of my own ALBERICH Oh ! do n't refuse me , sir ! GERALD ISMAN Listen ! There is , perhaps , something else we can do . How would it do to take Prince Hagen up to the world ? ALBERICH Starting . Oh ! GERALD ISMAN This world is a small one . There he might have a wide field for his energies . He might be sent to a good school , and taught the ideals of our Christian civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see to it that proper care was given to him ? GERALD ISMAN If I took him with me it would mean that I was interested in his future . ALBERICH It is a startling proposition . What opportunity can you offer him ? GERALD ISMAN I am only a student myself . But my father is a man of importance in the world . ALBERICH What does he do ? GERALD ISMAN He is John Isman . They call him the railroad king . p. 26 ALBERICH You have kings in your world , also ! GERALD ISMAN Smiling . After a fashion yes . ALBERICH I had not thought of this . I hardly know what to reply . He starts . What is that ? An uproar is heard of left . Shouts and cries ; music rises to deafening climax . Nibelungs flee on in terror . PRINCE HAGEN Rushes on , struggling wildly , and dragging several Nibelungs . Let me go , I say ! Take off these chains ! ALBERICH Rising in seat . Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN I will not stand it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! PRINCE HAGEN No ! ALBERICH I have something new to tell you . The earth-man has suggested taking you up with him to the world . PRINCE HAGEN A sudden wild expression flashes across his features . No ! He gazes from one to the other , half beside himself . You ca n't mean it ! ALBERICH It is true , Hagen . PRINCE HAGEN What why p. 27 ALBERICH You would be sent to school and taught the ways of the earth-men . Do you think that you would like to go ? PRINCE HAGEN Wildly . By the gods ! I would ! ALBERICH Nervously . You will promise to obey PRINCE HAGEN I 'll promise anything ! I 'll do anything ! ALBERICH Hagen , this is a very grave decision for me . It is such an unusual step !

We can trust you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no trouble . Take them off ! ALBERICH Off with them ! MIMI Advances and proceeds to work at chains with a file . Yes , your majesty .

GERALD ISMAN It 's too much to try to tell . You will be there soon . PRINCE HAGEN Ah ! Be quick there ! Tears one hand free and waves it . By the gods ! ALBERICH To GERALD . You had best spend the night with us and consult with me PRINCE HAGEN No , no ! No delay ! What 's there to consult about ? ALBERICH We have so much to settle your clothes your money PRINCE HAGEN Give me some gold that will be all . Let us be off ! GERALD ISMAN I will attend to everything . There is no need of delay .

The man is a perfect demon ! GERALD ISMAN Where does he come from ? p. 36 JOHN ISMAN Apparently nobody knows . The papers say he turned up a couple of years ago he wo n't talk about his past . He joined Tammany Hall , and he 's sweeping everything before him . GERALD ISMAN What do you suppose will come of it ? JOHN ISMAN Oh , he 'll get elected what is it he 's to be an alderman ? and then he 'll sell out , like all the rest . I was talking about it this afternoon , with Plimpton and Rutherford . MRS . BAGLEY-WILLIS They 're to be here to-night , I understand . JOHN ISMAN Yes so they mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , centre , with an armful of roses . Ah ! Mrs. Bagley-Willis ! Good evening ! MRS . BAGLEY-WILLIS Good evening , Estelle . ESTELLE ISMAN Good evening , father . Hello , Gerald . GERALD ISMAN My , are n't we gorgeous to-night ! ESTELLE ISMAN Just are n't we ! MRS . BAGLEY-WILLIS The adventure does n't seem to have hurt you . Where is your mother ? GERALD ISMAN She went into the drawing-room . MRS . B.-W. and ISMAN go off , right ; ESTELLE is about to follow . Estelle ! p. 37 ESTELLE ISMAN What is it ? GERALD ISMAN What 's this I hear about your adventure last night ? ESTELLE ISMAN With sudden seriousness . Oh , Gerald ! Comes closer . It was a frightful thing ! I 've hardly dared to think about it ! GERALD ISMAN Tell me . ESTELLE ISMAN Gerald , that man was talking straight at me he meant every bit of it for me ! GERALD ISMAN Tell me the story . ESTELLE ISMAN Why , you know , Lord Alderdyce had heard about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensation this campaign . And he 's interested in our election and wanted to hear O'Hagen speak . He said he had a friend who 'd arrange for us to be introduced to him ; and so we went down there . And there was a most frightful crowd it was an outdoor meeting , you know . We pushed our way into a saloon , where the mob was shouting around this O'Hagen . And then he caught sight of us and Gerald , from the moment he saw me he never took his eyes off me ! Never once ! GERALD ISMAN Smiling . Well , Estelle you 've been looked at before . ESTELLE ISMAN Ah , but never like that ! p. 38 GERALD ISMAN What sort of a man is he ? ESTELLE ISMAN He 's small and dark and ugly he wore a rough reefer and cap but Gerald , he 's no common man ! There 's something strange and terrible about him there 's a fire blazing in him . The detective who was with us introduced us to him and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something or other " I 've been so interested in your speech , Mr. O'Hagen . " And he laughed at me " Yes , I 've no doubt . " And then suddenly it was as if he leaped at me ! He pointed his finger straight into my face , and his eyes fairly shone . " Wait for me ! I 'll be with you ! I 'm coming to the top ! " GERALD ISMAN Good God ! ESTELLE ISMAN Imagine it ! I was simply paralyzed ! " Mark what I tell you , " he went on " it 'll be of interest to you some day to remember it . You may wait for me ! I 'm coming ! You will not escape me ! " GERALD ISMAN Why he 's mad ! ESTELLE ISMAN He was like a wild beast . Everybody in the place was staring at us as he rushed on . " You have joy and power and freedom all the privileges of life all things that are excellent and beautiful . You are born to them you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us as you might at some strange animals in a cage . You chatter and laugh and go your way but remember what I told you I shall be with you ! You can not keep ME down ! I shall be master of you all ! " p. 39 GERALD ISMAN Incredible ! ESTELLE ISMAN And then in a moment it was all over . He made a mocking bow to the party " It has given me the greatest pleasure in the world to meet you ! " And with a wild laugh he went out of the door and the crowd in the street burst into a roar that was like a clap of thunder . A pause . Gerald , what do you think he meant ? GERALD ISMAN My dear , you 've been up against the class-war , it 's rather the fashion now , you know . ESTELLE ISMAN Oh , but it was horrible ! I ca n't get it out of my mind . We heard some of his speech afterwards and it seemed as if every word of it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect fury I think they 'd have set fire to the city if he 'd told them to . What do you suppose he expects to do ? GERALD ISMAN I ca n't imagine , I 'm sure . ESTELLE ISMAN I should like to know more about him . He was never raised in the slums , I feel certain . GERALD ISMAN Steve O'Hagen . The name sounds Irish . ESTELLE ISMAN I do n't think he 's Irish . He 's dark and strange-looking almost uncanny . GERALD ISMAN I shall go down there and hear him the first chance I get . And now , I guess I 'd best get out , if I want to dodge old Plimpton. p. 40 ESTELLE ISMAN Yes and Rutherford , too . Is n't it a bore ! I think they are perfectly odious people . GERALD ISMAN Why do you suppose mother invited them ? ESTELLE ISMAN Oh , it 's a business affair they have forced their way into some deal of father 's , and so we have to cultivate them . GERALD ISMAN Plimpton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I wonder how many hundred millions of dollars we shall have to have before we can choose our guests for something more interesting than their Wall Street connections ! ESTELLE ISMAN I think I hear them . Listens . Yes the voice . Mocking PLIMPTON 'S manner and tone . Good evening , Miss Isman . I guess I 'll skip it ! Exit right . GERALD ISMAN And I , too ! Exit left . RUTHERFORD A stout and rather coarse-looking man , enters , right , with PLIMPTON . It 's certainly an outrageous state of affairs , Plimpton ! PLIMPTON A thin , clerical-looking person , with square-cut beard . Disgraceful ! Disgraceful ! RUTHERFORD The public seems to be quite hysterical ! p. 41 PLIMPTON We have got to a state where simply to be entrusted with great financial responsibility is enough to constitute a man a criminal ; to warrant a newspaper in prying into the intimate details of his life , and in presenting him in hideous caricatures . RUTHERFORD I can sympathize with you , Plimpton these government investigations are certainly a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to lie awake nights trying to remember what my lawyers had told me to forget ! PLIMPTON Ahem ! Ahem ! Yes a rather cynical jest ! I ca n't say exactly MRS . ISMAN In doorway , right . Ah , Mr. Plimpton ! How do you do ? And Mr. Rutherford ? PLIMPTON Good evening , Mrs. Isman . RUTHERFORD Good evening , Mrs. Isman . MRS . ISMAN You managed to tear yourself away from business cares , after all ! PLIMPTON It was not easy , I assure you . MRS . ISMAN Wo n't you come in ? RUTHERFORD With pleasure . Exit , right , with MRS . ISMAN , followed by PLIMPTON. p. 42 GERALD ISMAN Enters , left . That pious old fraud ! Sits in chair . Well , I 'm safe for a while ! Sprawls at ease and reads . HICKS Enters , centre . A gentleman to see you , Mr. Gerald . GERALD ISMAN Hey ? Takes card , looks , then gives violent start . Prince Hagen ! Stands aghast , staring ; whispers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What shall I tell him , sir ? GERALD ISMAN What what does he look like ? HICKS Why he seems to be a gentleman , sir . GERALD ISMAN How is he dressed ? HICKS For dinner , sir . GERALD ISMAN Hesitates , gazes about nervously . Bring him here quickly ! HICKS Yes , sir . GERALD ISMAN And shut the door afterwards . HICKS Yes , sir . Exit . GERALD ISMAN Stands staring . Prince Hagen ! He 's come at last ! Takes the faded telegrams from his pocket ; looks at them ; then goes to door , right , and closes it. p. 43 HICKS Enters , centre . Prince Hagen . PRINCE HAGEN Enters ; serene and smiling , immaculately clad . Ah , Gerald ! GERALD ISMAN Gazing . Prince Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN You are surprised to see me ! GERALD ISMAN I confess that I am . PRINCE HAGEN Did you think I was never coming back ? GERALD ISMAN I had given you up . PRINCE HAGEN Well , here I am to report progress . GERALD ISMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ? PRINCE HAGEN Oh , I 've been seeing life GERALD ISMAN You did n't like the boarding school ? PRINCE HAGEN With sudden vehemence . Did you think I would like it ? Did you think I 'd come to this world to have my head stuffed with Latin conjugations and sawdust ? GERALD ISMAN I had hoped that in a good Christian home PRINCE HAGEN Laughing . No , no , Gerald ! I let you talk that sort of thing to me in the beginning . It sounded fishy even then , but I did n't say anything I wanted to get my bearings . But I had n't been twenty-four hours in that good Christian home before I found out what a kettleful of jealousies and hatreds it was . The head master was an old sap-head ; and the boys ! I was strange and ugly , and they thought they could torment and bully me ; but I fought ' em by the Lord , I fought ' em day and night , I fought ' em all around the place ! And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they cringed and toadied ! They hated the slavery they lived under , but not one of them dared raise his hand against it . p. 44 GERALD ISMAN Well , you 've seen the world in your own way . Now are you ready to go back to Nibelheim ? PRINCE HAGEN Good God , no ! GERALD ISMAN You know it 's my duty to send you back . PRINCE HAGEN Oh , say ! My dear fellow ! GERALD ISMAN You know the solemn promise I made to King Alberich . PRINCE HAGEN Yes but you ca n't carry it out . GERALD ISMAN But I can ! PRINCE HAGEN How ? GERALD ISMAN I could invoke the law , if need be . You know you are a minor PRINCE HAGEN My dear boy , I 'm over seven hundred years old ! GERALD ISMAN Ah , but that is a quibble . You know that in our world that is only equal to about eighteen PRINCE HAGEN I have read up the law , but I have n't found any provision for reducing Nibelung ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny PRINCE HAGEN I would n't need to deny . The story 's absurd on the face of it . You know perfectly well that there are no such things as Nibelungs ! GERALD gasps . And besides , you 're a poet , and everybody knows you 're crazy . Fancy what the newspaper reporters would do with such a yarn ! Cheerfully . Come , old man , forget about it , and let 's be friends . You 'll have a lot more fun watching my career . And besides , what do you want ? I 've come back , and I 'm ready to follow your advice . p. 45 GERALD ISMAN How do you mean ? PRINCE HAGEN You told me to stay in school until I 'd got my bearings in the world . And then I was to have a career . Well , I 've got my education for myself and now I 'm ready for the career . After a pause . Listen , Gerald . I said I 'd be a self-made man . I said I 'd conquer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize how far it is to the top , and I ca n't spare the time . GERALD ISMAN I see . PRINCE HAGEN And then besides that I 've met a woman . GERALD ISMAN Startled . Good heavens ! PRINCE HAGEN Yes . I 'm in love . GERALD ISMAN But surely you do n't expect to marry ! PRINCE HAGEN Why not ? My mother was an earth-woman , and her mother , also . GERALD ISMAN To be sure . I 'd not realized it . A pause . Who is the woman ? PRINCE HAGEN I do n't know . I only know she belongs in this world of yours . And I 've come to seek her out . I shall get her , never fear ! GERALD ISMAN What are your plans ? p. 46 PRINCE HAGEN I 've looked this Christian civilization of yours over and I 'm prepared to play the game . You can take me up and put me into Society as you offered to do before . You 'll find that I 'll do you credit . GERALD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course . Alberich will furnish it , if you tell him it 's needed . You must call Mimi . GERALD ISMAN Mimi is here now . PRINCE HAGEN Starting . What ! GERALD ISMAN He is in the house . PRINCE HAGEN For what ? GERALD ISMAN He came to look for you . PRINCE HAGEN What is the matter ? GERALD ISMAN I do n't know . He wants you to return to Nibelheim . PRINCE HAGEN Find him . Let me see him ! GERALD ISMAN All right . Wait here . Exit left . PRINCE HAGEN What can that mean ? ESTELLE ISMAN Enters , right , sees PRINCE HAGEN , starts wildly and screams . Ah ! She stands transfixed ; a long pause . Steve O'Hagen ! A pause . Steve O'Hagen ! What does it mean ? p. 47 PRINCE HAGEN Who are you ? ESTELLE ISMAN I live here . PRINCE HAGEN Your name ? ESTELLE ISMAN Estelle Isman . PRINCE HAGEN In a transport of amazement . Estelle Isman ! You are Gerald 's sister ! ESTELLE ISMAN Yes . PRINCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my brother ! PRINCE HAGEN Yes . ESTELLE ISMAN You Steve O'Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN Gravely . I am Prince Hagen ESTELLE ISMAN Prince Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN A foreign nobleman . ESTELLE ISMAN What what do you mean ? You were on the Bowery ! PRINCE HAGEN I came to this country to study its institutions . I wished to know them for myself therefore I went into politics . Do n't you see ? ESTELLE ISMAN Dazed . I see ! PRINCE HAGEN Now I am on the point of giving up the game and telling the story of my experiences . p. 48 ESTELLE ISMAN What are you doing here in this house ? PRINCE HAGEN I came for you . ESTELLE ISMAN Stares at him . How dare you ? PRINCE HAGEN I would dare anything for you ! They gaze at each other . Do n't you understand ? ESTELLE ISMAN Vehemently . No ! No ! I am afraid of you ! You have no business to be here ! PRINCE HAGEN Taking a step towards her . Listen ESTELLE ISMAN No ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Stares at him , then abruptly exit , centre . PRINCE HAGEN Laughs . Humph ! Hearing voices . Who is this ? RUTHERFORD Off right . I do n't agree with you . JOHN ISMAN Nor I , either , Plimpton . Enters with PLIMPTON and RUTHERFORD ; sees HAGEN . Oh I beg your pardon . PRINCE HAGEN I am waiting for your son , Sir . JOHN ISMAN I see . Wo n't you be seated ? p. 49 PRINCE HAGEN I thank you . Sits at ease in chair . PLIMPTON My point is , it 's as Lord Alderdyce says we have no hereditary aristocracy in this country , no traditions of authority nothing to hold the mob in check . JOHN ISMAN There is the constitution . PLIMPTON They may over-ride it . JOHN ISMAN There are the courts . PLIMPTON They may defy the courts . RUTHERFORD Oh , Plimpton , that 's absurd ! PLIMPTON Nothing of the kind , Rutherford ! Suppose they were to elect to office some wild and reckless demagog take , for instance , that ruffian you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts , and listensand he were to defy the law and the courts ? He is preaching just that to the mob striving to rouse the elemental wild beast in them ! And some day they will pour out into this avenue RUTHERFORD Vehemently . Very well , Plimpton ! Let them come ! Have we not the militia and the regulars ? We could sweep the avenue with one machine gun PLIMPTON But suppose the troops would not fire ? p. 50 RUTHERFORD But that is impossible ! PLIMPTON Nothing of the kind , Rutherford ! No , no we must go back of all that ! It is in the hearts of the people that we must erect our defenses . It is the spirit of this godless and skeptical age that is undermining order . We must teach the people the truths of religion . We must inculcate lessons of sobriety and thrift , of reverence for constituted authority . We must set our faces against these new preachers of license and infidelity we must go back to the old-time faith to love , and charity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got it there ! JOHN ISMAN Amazed . Why PLIMPTON Sir ? PRINCE HAGEN You 've said it ! Set the parsons after them ! Teach them heaven ! Set them to singing about harps and golden crowns , and milk and honey flowing ! Then you can shut them up in slums and starve them , and they wo n't know the difference . Teach them non-resistance and self-renunciation ! You 've got the phrases all pat handed out from heaven direct ! Take no thought saying what ye shall eat ! Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth ! Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's ! p. 51 JOHN ISMAN Why this is preposterous ! PLIMPTON This is blasphemy ! PRINCE HAGEN You 're Plimpton Plimpton , the coal baron , I take it . I know you by your pictures . You shut up little children by tens of thousands to toil for you in the bowels of the earth . You crush your rivals , and form a trust , and screw up prices to freeze the poor in winter ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take it . You have slaves working twelve hours a day and seven days a week in your mills . And you mangle them in hideous accidents , and then cheat their widows of their rights and then you build churches , and set your parsons to preach to them about love and self-sacrifice ! To teach them charity , while you crucify justice ! To trick them with visions of an imaginary paradise , while you pick their pockets upon earth ! To put arms in their hands , and send them to shoot their brothers , in the name of the Prince of Peace ! RUTHERFORD This is outrageous ! PLIMPTON Clenching his fists . Infamous scoundrel ! RUTHERFORD Advancing Upon HAGEN . How dare you ! PRINCE HAGEN It stings , does it ? Ha ! Ha ! p. 52 PLIMPTON Sputtering . You wretch ! JOHN ISMAN This has gone too far . Stop , Rutherford ! Calm yourself , Plimpton . Let us not forget ourselves ! To PRINCE HAGEN , haughtily . I do not know who you are , sir , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are a friend of my son 's PRINCE HAGEN I claim that honor , sir . JOHN ISMAN The fact that you claim it prevents my ordering you into the street . But I will see my son , sir , and find out by what right you are here to insult my guests . Turning . Come , Plimpton . Come , Rutherford we will bandy no words with him ! They go off , centre . PRINCE HAGEN Alone . By God ! I touched them ! Ha , ha , ha ! Grimly . He will order me into the street ! With concentrated fury . That is it ! They shut you out ! They build a wall about themselves ! Aristocracy ! Clenching his fast . Very well ! So be it ! You sit within your fortress of privilege ! You are haughty and contemptuous , flaunting your power ! But I 'll breach your battlements , I 'll lay them in the dust ! I 'll bring you to your knees before me ! A silence . Suddenly there is heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; HAGEN starts. p. 53 MIMI Enters , left . Prince Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN Mimi ! MIMI At last ! PRINCE HAGEN Approaching . What is it ? MIMI Beckons . Come here . PRINCE HAGEN In excitement . What do you want ? MIMI You must come back ! PRINCE HAGEN What do you mean ? MIMI The people want you . PRINCE HAGEN What for ? MIMI They need you . You must be king . PRINCE HAGEN Wildly . Ha ? MIMI Alberich PRINCE HAGEN Alberich ? MIMI He is dead ! PRINCE HAGEN With wild start . Dead ! MIMI Yes he died last night ! PRINCE HAGEN Turns pale and staggers ; then leaps at Mimi , clutching him by the arm . No ! NO ! p. 54 MIMI It is true . PRINCE HAGEN My God ! A look of wild , drunken rapture crosses his face ; he clenches his hands and raises his arms . Ha , ha , ha ! MIMI Shrinks in horror . Prince Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN He is dead ! He is dead ! Leaps at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PRINCE HAGEN Ha , ha , ha ! It is mine ! It is mine ! Begins pacing the floor wildly . Victory ! Victory ! VICTORY ! Ha , ha , ha ! Ha , ha , ha !

I am King ! King ! KING ! Seizes MIMI and starts centre ; the music rises to climax . To Nibelheim ! To Nibelheim ! Stands stretching out his arms in exultation ; a wild burst of music. @x The conservatory is a study in green and gold , with strange tropical plants having golden flowers .

BAGLEY-WILLIS But he would n't do a single thing I told him . I never had such a protege in my life ! DE WIGGLESTON RIGGS Extraordinary ! MRS . BAGLEY-WILLIS I told him it would be frightfully crude , and it is . And yet , Wiggie , it 's impressive , in its way nobody can miss the feeling . Such barbaric splendor !

It 's quite in a different class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Stupefying ! MRS . BAGLEY-WILLIS And did you ever know the public to take such interest in a social event ?

I suppose that old lady 's taken to herself all the credit for this evening 's success ! LORD ALDERDYCE Well , really , you know , was n't it ah quite a feat to make society swallow this adventurer ? GERALD ISMAN How can anybody stay away ? When a man spends several millions on a single entertainment people have to come out of pure curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway ! GERALD ISMAN Gazing about . Think of buying all the old Vandergrift palaces at one swoop ! LORD ALDERDYCE Oh , really ! GERALD ISMAN This palace was one of the landmarks of the city ; all its decorations had been taken from old palaces in Italy . And he tore everything off and gave it away to a museum , and he made it over in three months ! LORD ALDERDYCE Amazing . Music and applause heard left . MRS .

Percy Pennington told me about it he 's her own first cousin , you know , Lord Alderdyce and he vows he saw the letter in her desk ! LORD ALDERDYCE Oh , tell us ! MRS . ISMAN Well , it was just after Prince Hagen made his appearance , when the papers were printing pages about him . And the news came that he 'd bought these palaces ; and the next day Mrs. Bagley-Willis got a letter marked personal . Percy quoted the words Dear Madam : I wish to enter Society . I have no time to go through with the usual formalities . I am a nobleman , with an extraordinary mind and unlimited money . I intend to entertain New York Society as it has never dreamed of being entertained before . I should be very pleased if you would cooperate with me in making my opening ball a success . If you are prepared to do this , I am prepared to pay you the sum of one million dollars cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , of course , this proposition is entirely confidential ! LORD ALDERDYCE By jove ! MRS . ISMAN Think of it ! GERALD ISMAN But can it be true ? p. 60 MRS . ISMAN What is more likely , my dear ? You know that Mrs. Bagley-Willis has been spending millions every season to entertain at Newport ; and their fortune will never stand that ! Oh , I must give it to Van Tribber he 'll see that the papers have it ! LORD ALDERDYCE But had n't you better make sure that it 's really MRS . ISMAN It does n't make the slightest difference ! Everybody will know that it 's true ! GERALD ISMAN They are ready to believe anything about Prince Hagen . MRS . ISMAN Certainly , after a glimpse of this palace . Did you ever see such frantic money-spending in your life ? LORD ALDERDYCE Never ! MRS . ISMAN Gold ! Gold ! I am positively blinded with the sight of gold . I 'd seen every kind of decoration and furniture , I thought but solid gold is new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance ! Points to coronation cup . And those fountains I believe that even the basins are of gold . MRS . ISMAN Perhaps we could stop the water and see . LORD ALDERDYCE I must go I have a dance . I am sorry not to see your daughter . p. 61 MRS . ISMAN Yes it was too bad she could n't come . Good-bye . LORD ALDERDYCE exit . MRS . ISMAN Pointing to throne . Look at that thing , Gerald ! GERALD ISMAN Yes no wonder the crowd came ! MRS . ISMAN I imagine a good many came because they did n't dare stay away . They certainly ca n't be enjoying themselves after such a day down town . GERALD ISMAN It was too bad the panic should come just on the eve of the ball . MRS . ISMAN My dear Gerald ! That 's his sense of humor ! He wanted to bring them here and set them to dancing and grinning , while in their hearts they are frightened to death . GERALD ISMAN How did he do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have money without limit and he 's been buying and buying everything in sight ! You know how prices have been soaring the past two months . And of course the public went wild , and took to speculating . Then Prince Hagen sold ; and the bottom has simply dropped out of everything . GERALD ISMAN I see . And do you suppose the slump has hit father ? MRS . ISMAN I do n't know . He wo n't talk to me about it . But it 's easy to see how distressed he is . And then , to cap the climax , Estelle refuses to come here ! Prince Hagen is certain to be furious . p. 62 GERALD ISMAN For my part , I admire her courage . MRS . ISMAN But , Gerald we ca n't afford to defy this man . GERALD ISMAN Estelle can afford it , I hope . MRS . ISMAN Here comes your father now . Look at him !

I knew as soon as I laid eyes on the man that he 'd do us harm . p. 64 JOHN ISMAN We must keep out of his power . We must save what we can from the wreck and learn to do with it .

PRINCE HAGEN Goes to table , centre , and sits opposite ISMAN . Well ? JOHN ISMAN Prince Hagen , what do you want with me ? PRINCE HAGEN Surprised . Why the pleasure of your company . JOHN ISMAN I mean in the Street . PRINCE HAGEN Oh ! Have you been hit ? JOHN ISMAN Do n't mock me . You have used your resources deliberately to ruin me . You have followed me you have taken every railroad in which I am interested , and driven it to the wall . And I ask you , man to man , what do you want ? PRINCE HAGEN After some thought . Isman , listen to me . You remember four months ago I offered you a business alliance ? p. 66 JOHN ISMAN I had no idea of your resources then . Had I known , I should not have rejected your offer . Am I being punished for that ? PRINCE HAGEN No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alliance with me it would have been just the same . It was my purpose to get you into my power . JOHN ISMAN Oh ! PRINCE HAGEN To bring you here to make you sit down before me , and ask , What do you want ? And so I will tell you what I want , man to man ! A pause . I want your daughter . JOHN ISMAN Starts . What ! PRINCE HAGEN I want your daughter . JOHN ISMAN Good God ! PRINCE HAGEN Do you understand now ? JOHN ISMAN Whispering . I understand ! PRINCE HAGEN Isman , you are a man of the world , and we can talk together . I love your daughter , and I wish to make her my wife . JOHN ISMAN And so you ruined me ! PRINCE HAGEN Four months ago I was an interloper and an adventurer . In a month or two I shall be the master of your financial and political world . Then I had nothing to offer your daughter . Now I can make her the first lady of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't sell our children not in America . PRINCE HAGEN Do n't talk to me like a fool , Isman . I never have anything to do with your shams . JOHN ISMAN But the girl ! She must consent ! PRINCE HAGEN I 'll attend to that . Meantime , I want you to know what I mean . On the day that your daughter marries me I will put you at the head of my interests , and make you the second richest man in America . You understand ? JOHN ISMAN Weakly . I understand . PRINCE HAGEN Very well . And do n't forget to tell your wife about it . He rises . JOHN ISMAN Is that all ? PRINCE HAGEN No ; one thing more . Your daughter is not here to-night . JOHN ISMAN No . PRINCE HAGEN I wish her to come . JOHN ISMAN But she is indisposed ! PRINCE HAGEN That is a pretext . She did not want to come . JOHN ISMAN Possibly PRINCE HAGEN Tell her to come . p. 68 JOHN ISMAN Startled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAGEN Nonsense . Your home is only a block away . Telephone to her . JOHN ISMAN Dismayed . But she will not be ready . PRINCE HAGEN Tell her to come ! Whatever she is wearing , she will outshine them all . ISMAN hesitates a moment , as if to speak , then goes off , right , half dazed ; the other watches him , laughing silently to himself . That 's all right ! Sees Calkins . Ah , Calkins ! CALKINS Enters with an armful of papers . Here are the morning papers , Prince . PRINCE HAGEN Ah ! Takes them . Still moist ! Did you think I wanted them that badly ? CALKINS Promptness never harms . PRINCE HAGEN Opening papers . That 's true . Ah , they hardly knew which was more important the ball or the panic ! We filled them up pretty full . Did you see if they followed the proofs ? CALKINS There are no material changes . PRINCE HAGEN Ha ! Ha ! Cartoons ! Prince Hagen invites the Four Hundred with one hand and knocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ! What 's this ? Three millions to decorate his palaces half a million for a single ball ? p. 69 CALKINS I suppose they could n't credit the figures . PRINCE HAGEN Humph ! We 'll educate them ! Sweeps papers out of the way . So much for that ! Were all the orders for the London opening gone over ? CALKINS All correct , Prince . PRINCE HAGEN Very good ! That 's all . CAL . exit . They 're all anxious about London I can see it ! Ah , Gerald ! GERALD ISMAN Enters , right . Hello ! PRINCE HAGEN Smiling . You see , they came to my party ! GERALD ISMAN Yes . PRINCE HAGEN They smile and chatter they bow and cringe to me and I have not preached any of your Christian virtues , either ! GERALD ISMAN No . I grant it . It 's a very painful sight . After a pause . That was a pleasant fancy to have a panic on the eve of your ball ! PRINCE HAGEN It was n't nearly as bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's ! GERALD ISMAN What 's the end of it all ? PRINCE HAGEN The end ? Why have an end ? I did n't make this game I play it according to other men 's rules . I buy and sell stocks , and make what money I can . The end may take care of itself . p. 70 GERALD ISMAN It 's rather hard on the helpless people , is n't it ? PRINCE HAGEN Humph ! The people ! After a pause . Gerald , this world of yours has always seemed to me like a barrel full of rats . There 's only room for a certain number on top , and the rest must sweat for it till they die . GERALD ISMAN It 's not a very pleasant image to think of . PRINCE HAGEN I do n't think of it . I simply happen to find myself on top , and I stay there and enjoy the view . Seats himself at table . As a matter of fact , Gerald , one of the things I intend to do with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I will tolerate such stupid waste as we have at present everybody trying to cheat everybody else , and nobody to keep the streets clean . It 's as if a dozen mere should go out into a field to catch a horse , and spend all their time in trying to keep each other from catching it . When I take charge they 'll catch the horse . GERALD ISMAN Drily . And you 'll ride him . PRINCE HAGEN And I 'll ride him . Laughs . GERALD ISMAN After a pause . At first I could n't make out why you bothered with this Society game . Now I begin to understand . You wanted to see them ! p. 71 PRINCE HAGEN I wanted to watch them wriggle ! I wanted to take them , one by one , and strip off their shams ! Take that fellow Rutherford , the steel man ! Or Plimpton , the coal baron , casting his eyes up to heaven , and singing psalms through his nose ! The instant I laid eyes on that whining old hypocrite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest again till I 'd shown him as he is a coward and a knave ! And I tell you , Gerald , before I get through with him Ah , there he is ! PLIMPTON Off . Hello , Isman ! PRINCE HAGEN Come . Draws back with GERALD . JOHN ISMAN Entering , right , with PLIMPTON and RUTHERFORD . Any word yet ? PLIMPTON Nothing yet ! RUTHERFORD Such a night as this has been ! JOHN ISMAN If the thing keeps up today the Exchange will have to close there will be no help for it . PLIMPTON We are in the hands of a madman ! RUTHERFORD We must have a conference with him we must find out what he wants . JOHN ISMAN Did you speak to him , Plimpton ? PLIMPTON I tried to . I might as well have butted my head against a stone wall . " I have money , " he said , " and I wish to buy and sell stocks . Is n't that my right ? " p. 72 RUTHERFORD He 's a fiend ! A fiend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows that if coal stocks go down another ten points I 'll be utterly ruined ! JOHN ISMAN Terrible ! Terrible ! PLIMPTON To RUTHERFORD . Rutherford , have you learned any more about where his money comes from ? RUTHERFORD I meant to tell you I 've had another report . The mystery deepens every hour . It 's always the same thing the man takes a train and goes out into the country ; he gathers all the wagons for miles around , and goes to some place in the woods and there is a pile of gold , fifty tons of it , maybe , covered over with brush . Nobody knows how it got there , nobody has time to ask . He loads it into the wagons , takes it aboard the train , and brings it to the Sub-treasury . JOHN ISMAN The man 's an alchemist ! He 's been manufacturing it and getting ready . RUTHERFORD Perhaps . Who can tell ? All I know is the Sub-treasury has bought over two billion dollars ' worth of gold bullion in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that ? PLIMPTON No wonder that prices went up to the skies ! p. 73 RUTHERFORD I had the White House on the ' phone this afternoon . We can demonetize gold the government can refuse to buy any more . JOHN ISMAN But then what would become of credit ? PLIMPTON Vehemently . No , no that will not help ! Gazes about nervously . There 's only one thing . Whispers . That man must be killed ! RUTHERFORD Horrified . Ah ! JOHN ISMAN No . PLIMPTON Just that ! Nothing else will help ! And instantly or it will be too late . JOHN ISMAN Plimpton ! PLIMPTON He must not be alive when the Exchange opens this morning ! RUTHERFORD But how ? PLIMPTON I do n't know but we must find a way ! We owe it as a public duty the man is a menace to society . Rutherford , you are with me ? RUTHERFORD By God ! I am ! JOHN ISMAN You 're mad ! PLIMPTON You do n't agree with me ? JOHN ISMAN It 's not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 74 PLIMPTON Gazing about . This is no place to discuss it . But I tell you that if there is no support from London RUTHERFORD Starting . Come perhaps there may be word ! They start left . We may beat them yet who can tell ? PLIMPTON , RUTHERFORD and ISMAN go off . PRINCE HAGEN Emerges with GERALD from shadows , shaking with laughter . Hat ha ! ha ! Love and self-sacrifice ! You see , Gerald ! GERALD ISMAN Yes I see ! Looks right then starts violently . My sister ! PRINCE HAGEN Ah ! GERALD ISMAN What does this mean ? PRINCE HAGEN To ESTELLE , who enters , right , evidently agitated . Miss Isman ! ESTELLE ISMAN My father said PRINCE HAGEN Yes . Wo n't you sit down ? ESTELLE ISMAN Hesitatingly . Why I suppose so PRINCE HAGEN To GERALD . Will you excuse us , please , Gerald ? p. 75 GERALD ISMAN Amazed . Why , yes but Estelle ESTELLE ISMAN In a faint voice . Please go , Gerald . GERALD ISMAN Oh ! very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me . PRINCE HAGEN Yes . Sitting opposite . How do you like it all ? ESTELLE ISMAN It is very beautiful . PRINCE HAGEN Do you really think so ? ESTELLE ISMAN Wondering . Do n't you ? PRINCE HAGEN No . ESTELLE ISMAN Truly ? PRINCE HAGEN No . ESTELLE ISMAN Then why did you do it ? PRINCE HAGEN To please you . ESTELLE ISMAN Shrinks . Oh ! PRINCE HAGEN Fixes his gaze on her , and slowly leans across table ; with intensity . Have n't you discovered yet that you are mine ? ESTELLE ISMAN Half rising . Prince Hagen ! p. 76 PRINCE HAGEN How long will it be before you know it ? ESTELLE ISMAN How dare you ? PRINCE HAGEN Listen . I am a man accustomed to command . I have no time to play with conventions I can not dally and plead . But I love you . I can not live without you ! And I will shake the foundations of the world to get you ! ESTELLE ISMAN Staring , fascinated ; whispers . Prince Hagen ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that it would bring you here so that I might have a chance to tell you . Simply for that one purpose . I have broken the business world to my will that also was to make you mine ! ESTELLE ISMAN Wildly . You have ruined my father ! PRINCE HAGEN Your father has played this game , and his path is strewn with the rivals he has ruined . He knows that , and you know it . Now I have played the game ; and I have beaten him . It took me one day to bring him down Laughs . It will take me less time to put him back again . ESTELLE ISMAN But why , why ? PRINCE HAGEN Listen , Estelle . I came to this civilization of yours , and looked at it . It seemed to me that it was built upon knavery and fraud that it was altogether a vile thing rotten to the core of it ! And I said I would smash it , as a child smashes a toy ; I would toss it about as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw you , and in a flash all that was changed . You were beautiful you were interesting . You were something in the world worth winning something I had not known about before . But you stood upon the pinnacle of Privilege you gathered the clouds about your head . How should I climb to you ? p. 77 ESTELLE ISMAN Frightened . I see ! PRINCE HAGEN I came to your home I was turned from the door . So I set to work to break my way to you . ESTELLE ISMAN I see ! PRINCE HAGEN And that is how I love you . You are all there is in the game to me . I bring the world and lay it at your feet . It is all yours . You do not like what I do with it , perhaps . Very well take it and do better . The power is yours for the asking ! Power without end ! He reaches out his arms to her ; a pause . You do not like my way of love-making , perhaps . You find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And where , among the men that you know , will you find one who can feel for you what I feel who would dare for you what I have dared ? Gazes at her with intensity . Take your time . I have no wish to hurry you . But you must know that , wherever you go , my hand is upon you . All that I do , I do for the love of you . ESTELLE ISMAN Weakly . I you frighten me ! PRINCE HAGEN All the world I lay at your feet ! You shall see . PLIMPTON Off left . Prince Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN Starting . Ah ! p. 78 PLIMPTON Enters , running , in great agitation , with a telegram . Prince Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN Well ? PLIMPTON I have a report from London . The market has gone all to pieces ! PRINCE HAGEN Ah ! PLIMPTON Pennsylvania coal is down twenty-five points in the first half hour . I 'm lost everything is lost ! RUTHERFORD Running on . Prince Hagen ! Steel is down to four ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you want with us ? What are you trying to do ? RUTHERFORD Wildly . You 've crushed us ! We 're helpless , utterly helpless ! PLIMPTON Have you no mercy ? Are n't you satisfied when you 've got us down ? RUTHERFORD Are you going to ruin everybody ? Are you a madman ? PLIMPTON What are you trying to do ? What do you want ? PRINCE HAGEN Has been listening in silence . Suddenly he leaps into action , an expression of furious rage coming upon his face . His eyes gleam , and he raises his hand as if to strike the two . Get down on your knees ! p. 79 PLIMPTON Ha ! RUTHERFORD What ? PRINCE HAGEN Louder . Get down on your knees ! PLIMPTON sinks in horror . PRINCE HAGEN turns Upon RUTHERFORD . Down ! RUTHERFORD Sinking . Mercy ! PRINCE HAGEN As they kneel before him , his anger vanishes ; he steps back . There ! Waving his hand . You asked me what I wanted ? I wanted this to see you there upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . Behold ! RUTHERFORD Oh ! Starts to rise . PRINCE HAGEN Savagely . Stay where you are ! To see you on your knees ! To hear you crying for mercy , which you will not get ! You pious plunderers ! Devourers of the people ! Assassins of women and helpless children ! Who made the rules of this game you or I ? Who cast the halo of righteousness about it who sanctified it by the laws of God and man ? Property ! Property was holy ! Property must rule ! You carved it into your constitutions you taught it in your newspapers , you preached it from your pulpits ! You screwed down wages , you screwed up prices it must be right , because it paid ! Money was the test money was the end ! You were business men ! Practical men ! Do n't you know the phrases ? Money talks ! Business is business ! The gold standard ha , ha , ha ! The gold standard ! Now someone has come who has more gold than you . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done to the people I will do to you ! You shall drink the cup that you have poured out for them you shall drink it to the dregs ! p. 80 PLIMPTON Starting to rise . Monster ! PRINCE HAGEN Stay where you are ! Cringe and grovel and whine ! Draws a Nibelung whip from under his coat . I will put the lash upon your backs ! I will strip your shams from you I will see you as you are ! I will take away your wealth , that you have wrung from others ! Before I get through with you you shall sweat with the toilers in the trenches ! For I am the master now ! I have the gold ! I own the property ! The world is mine ! You were lords and barons you ruled in your little principalities ! But I shall rule everywhere every-thing all civilization ! I shall be king ! King ! With exultant gesture. @x The scene shows a spacious room , fitted with luxurious rusticity . To the right of centre are a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , right is a table , with a telephone . In the centre of the room is a large table , with a lamp and books , and a leather arm-chair at each side . To the left of centre is a spacious stone fireplace , having within it a trap door opening downward . At the left a piano with a violin upon it . There are exposed oak beams ; antlers , rifles , snowshoes , etc. , upon the walls . Entrances right and left . At rise : CALKINS , standing by the desk , arranging some papers . CALKINS As ' phone rings . Hello ! Yes , this is the Isman camp . Prince Hagen is staying here . This is his secretary speaking . No , Prince Hagen does not receive telephone calls . No , not under any circumstances whatever . It does n't make any difference . If the President of the United States has anything to say to Prince Hagen , let him communicate with Mr. Isman at his New York office , and the message will reach him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To HICKS , who enters with telegram . Hicks , for the future , Prince Hagen wishes all messages for him to be taken to my office . That applies to letters , telegrams everything . p. 82 HICKS Very good , sir . Exit . CALKINS Opening a telegram . More appeals for mercy . PRINCE HAGEN Enters from veranda , wearing white flannels , cool and alert . Well , Calkins ? CALKINS Nothing important , sir . PRINCE HAGEN The market continues to fall ? CALKINS Copper is off five points , sir . PRINCE HAGEN Ah ! CALKINS The President of the United States tried to get you on the ' phone just now . PRINCE HAGEN Humph ! Anything else ? CALKINS There has been another mob on Fifth Avenue this morning . They seem to be threatening your palace . PRINCE HAGEN I see . You wrote to the mayor , as I told you ? CALKINS Yes , sir . PRINCE HAGEN Well , you 'd best put in another hundred guards . And they 're to be instructed to shoot . CALKINS Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can depend on I do n't want any mistake about it . I do n't care about the building , but I mean to make a test of it . p. 83 CALKINS I 'll see to it , sir . PRINCE HAGEN Anything else ? CALKINS A message from a delegation from the National Unemployment Conference . They are to call tomorrow morning . PRINCE HAGEN Ah , yes . Make a note , please I sympathize with their purpose , and contribute half a million . To GERALD , who enters , left . Hello , Gerald how are you ? Make yourself at home . To CALKINS . I attribute the present desperate situation to the anarchical struggles of rival financial interests . I am assuming control , and straightening out the tangle as rapidly as I can . The worst of the crisis is over the opposition is capitulating , and I expect soon to order a general resumption of industry . Prepare me an address of five hundred words sharp and snappy . Then see the head of the delegation , and have it understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CALKINS Very good , sir . PRINCE HAGEN And stir up our Press Bureau . We must have strong , conservative editorials this week It 's the crucial period . Our institutions are at stake the national honor is imperilled order must be preserved at any hazard all that sort of thing . p. 84 CALKINS Yes , sir I understand . PRINCE HAGEN Very good . That will be all . CALKINS Yes , sir . Exit , right . GERALD ISMAN You 're putting the screws on , are you ? PRINCE HAGEN Humph ! Yes . It 's funny to hear these financial men their one idea in life has been to dominate and now they cry out against tyranny ! GERALD ISMAN I can imagine it . PRINCE HAGEN Here 's Plimpton , making speeches about American democracy ! These fellows have got so used to making pretenses that they actually deceive themselves . GERALD ISMAN I 've noticed that you make a few yourself now . PRINCE HAGEN Yes do n't I do it well ? Thoughtfully . You know , Gerald , pretenses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GERALD ISMAN Indeed ? PRINCE HAGEN We never made any pretenses in Nibelheim ; and when I first met you , your talk about virtue and morality and self-sacrifice was simply incomprehensible to me . It seemed something quite apart from life . But now I 've come to perceive that this is what makes possible the system under which you live . p. 85 GERALD ISMAN Explain yourself . PRINCE HAGEN Here is this civilization simply appalling in its vastness . The countless millions of your people , the wealth you have piled up it seems like a huge bubble that may burst any minute . And the one device by which it is all kept together is pretense ! GERALD ISMAN Why do you think that ? PRINCE HAGEN Life , Gerald , is the survival of the strong . I care not if it be in a jungle or in a city , it is the warfare of each against all . But in the former case it 's brute force , and in the latter it 's power of mind . And do n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slums the docile slave of the man who can outwit him is this Morality this absolutely sublimest invention , this most daring conception that ever flashed across the mind of man ? GERALD ISMAN Oh , I see . PRINCE HAGEN I used to wonder at it down there on the Bowery . The poor are a thousand to your one , and the best that is might be theirs , if they chose to take it ; but there is Morality ! They call it their virtue . And so the rich man may have his vices in peace . By heaven , if that is not a wondrous achievement , I have not seen one ! GERALD ISMAN You believe this morality was invented by the rich . p. 86 PRINCE HAGEN I do n't know . It seems to be a congenital disease . GERALD ISMAN Some people believe it was implanted in man by God . PRINCE HAGEN Shrugging his shoulders . Perhaps . Or by a devil . Men might have lived in holes , like woodchucks , and been fat and happy ; but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other man 's delight . CALKINS Enters , right . Are you at leisure , sir ? PRINCE HAGEN Why ? CALKINS Mr. Isman wants you on the ' phone . PRINCE HAGEN Oh ! All right Goes to ' phone . GERALD ISMAN Rises . Perhaps I PRINCE HAGEN No , that 's all right . Sits at ' phone . Hello ! Is that Isman ? How are you ? To CALKINS . Calkins ! CALKINS Yes , sir . Sits and takes notes . PRINCE HAGEN How about Intercontinental ? Imperiously . But I can ! I said the stock was to go to sixty-four , and I want it to go . I do n't care what it costs , Isman let it go in the morning and do n't ever let this happen again . I have sent word you are to have another hundred million by nine-thirty . Will that do ? Do n't take chances . Oh , Rutherford ! Tell Rutherford my terms are that the directors of the Fidelity Life Insurance Company are to resign , and he is to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally Plimpton ? What do I want with his banks I 've got my own money And , oh , by the way , Isman call up the White House again , and tell the President that the regulars will be needed in New York . No , I understand you I think I 've fixed matters up at this end . I 've got two hundred guards up here , and they 're picked men they 'll shoot if there 's need . I 'm not talking about it , naturally but I 'm taking care of myself . You keep your nerve , Isman . It 'll all be over in a month or two more these fellows are used to having their own way , and they make a fuss . And , by the way , as to the newspapers we 'll turn out that paper trust crowd , and stop selling paper to the ones that are making trouble . That 'll put an end to it , I fancy . You had best get after it yourself , and have it attended to promptly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isman no , you 're all right ; only you have n't got enough imagination . But just get onto this job , and let me hear that it 's done before morning . Good-bye . Hangs up receiver . Humph ! To GERALD . They 've about got your father 's nerve . p. 87 GERALD ISMAN I ca n't say that I blame him very much . In somber thought . Really , you know , Prince Hagen , this ca n't go on . What 's to be the end of it ? PRINCE HAGEN Laughing . Oh , come , come , Gerald do n't bother your head with things like that ! You 're a poet you must keep your imagination free from such dismal matters . See , I 've got a job for you . Pointing to books on table . Do you notice the titles ? GERALD ISMAN Has been handling the books absent-mindedly ; now looks at titles . The Saints ' Everlasting Rest . Pilgrim 's Progress . The Life of St. Ignatius What does that mean ? PRINCE HAGEN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language . GERALD ISMAN I See ! PRINCE HAGEN But I do n't seem to get hold of it very well . I think it 's the job for you . GERALD ISMAN How do you mean ? PRINCE HAGEN I 'm getting ready to introduce Morality into Nibelheim . GERALD ISMAN What ? PRINCE HAGEN Playfully . You remember you talked to me about it a long time ago . And now I 've come to your way of thinking . Suppose I gave you a chance to civilize the place , to teach those wretched creatures to love beauty and virtue ? p. 88 GERALD ISMAN It would depend upon what your motive was in inviting me . PRINCE HAGEN My Motive ? What has that to do with it ? Virtue is virtue , is it not ? No matter what I think about it ? GERALD ISMAN Yes . PRINCE HAGEN And virtue is its own reward ? GERALD ISMAN Perhaps so . PRINCE HAGEN Let us grant that the consequences of educating and elevating the Nibelungs of teaching them to love righteousness would be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to labor at getting more for a wicked capitalist like me . Would it not still be right to teach them ? GERALD ISMAN It might , perhaps . PRINCE HAGEN Then you will try it ? GERALD ISMAN No I 'm afraid not . PRINCE HAGEN Why not ? GERALD ISMAN Gravely . Well for one thing I have weighty reasons for doubting the perfectibility of the Nibelungs . PRINCE HAGEN Gazes at him ; then shakes with laughter . Really , Gerald , that is the one clever thing I 've heard you say ! p. 89 GERALD ISMAN Laughing . Thank you ! PRINCE HAGEN Rises and looks at watch . Your mother was coming down . Ah ! Mrs. Isman ! MRS . ISMAN Enters , left . Good afternoon , Prince Hagen . PRINCE HAGEN And how go things ? MRS . ISMAN I 've just had a telegram from my brother . He says that the Archbishop of Canterbury never goes abroad , and was shocked at the suggestion ; but he thinks two million might fetch him . PRINCE HAGEN Very well offer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth that ? PRINCE HAGEN My dear lady , it is worth anything if it will make you happy and add to the eclat of the wedding . There 's nothing too good for Estelle . MRS . ISMAN Ah , what a wonderful man you are . Eyeing him . I was wondering how rose pink would go with your complexion . PRINCE HAGEN Dear me ! Am I to wear rose pink ? MRS . ISMAN No , but I 'm planning the decoration for the wedding breakfast . And I 'm puzzled about the flowers . I 'm weary of orchids and la France roses Mrs. Bagley-Willis had her ball room swamped with them last week . p. 90 PRINCE HAGEN We must certainly not imitate Mrs. Bagley-Willis . MRS . ISMAN Complacently . I fancy she 's pretty nearly at the end of her rope . My maid tells me she could n't pay her grocer 's bill till she got that million from you ! PRINCE HAGEN Ha , ha , ha ! MRS . ISMAN I wish you 'd come with me for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delighted , I 'm sure . They go off , left . GERALD ISMAN Oh , my God ! ESTELLE ISMAN Enters in a beautiful afternoon gown , and carrying an armful of roses ; she is nervous and preoccupied . Ah ! Gerald ! GERALD ISMAN Estelle . He watches her in silence ; she arranges flowers . ESTELLE ISMAN How goes the poem , Gerald ? GERALD ISMAN The poem ! Who could think of a poem at a time like this ? Advancing toward her . Estelle ! I can bear it no longer ! ESTELLE ISMAN What ? GERALD ISMAN This crime ! I tell you it 's a crime you 're committing ! p. 91 ESTELLE ISMAN Oh , Gerald ! Do n't begin that again . You know it 's too late . And it tears me to pieces ! GERALD ISMAN I ca n't help it . I must say it ! ESTELLE ISMAN Hurrying toward him . Brother ! You must not say another word to me ! I tell you you must not I ca n't bear it ! GERALD ISMAN Estelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given my word ! My honor is pledged , and it 's too late to turn back . I have permitted father to incur obligations before all the world GERALD ISMAN But , Estelle , you do n't know . If you understood all all ESTELLE ISMAN With sudden intensity . Gerald ! I know what you mean ! I have felt it ! You know more about Prince Hagen than you have told me . There is some secret - something strange . She stares at him wildly . I do n't want to know it ! Gerald do n't you understand ? We are in that man 's hands ! We are at his mercy ! Do n't you know that he would never give me up ? He would follow me to the end of the earth ! He would wreck the whole world to get me ! I am in a cage with a wild beast ! They stare at each other. p. 92 GERALD ISMAN In sudden excitement . Estelle ! ESTELLE ISMAN What ? GERALD ISMAN Can it be that you love this man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I tell ? He terrifies me . He fascinates me . I do n't know what to make of him . And I do n't dare to think . Wildly . And what difference does it make ? I have promised to marry him ! MRS . ISMAN enters , left , and listens . ESTELLE ISMAN And I must keep my word ! You must not try to dissuade me MRS . ISMAN Estelle ! ESTELLE ISMAN Mother ! MRS . ISMAN Has Gerald been tormenting you again ? My child , my child I implore you , do n't let that madness take hold of you ! Think of our position . Attempts to embrace her . I know how it is I went through with it myself . We women all have to go through with it . I did not care for your father it nearly broke my heart . I was madly in love at the time truly I was ! But think what will become of us ESTELLE ISMAN Vehemently , pushing her away . Mother ! I forbid you to speak another word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep my bargain . I will do what I have said I will do . But I will not have you talk to me about it Do you understand me ? p. 93 MRS . ISMAN My dear ! ESTELLE ISMAN Please go ! Both of you ! I wish to be alone ! MRS . ISMAN In great agitation . Oh , dear me ! dear me ! Exit , left . GERALD ISMAN Good-bye ! Exit , right ; ESTELLE recovers herself by an effort ; stands by table in thought . Twilight has begun to gather . PRINCE HAGEN Enters by veranda . Ah ! Estelle ! Comes toward her . My beautiful ! Makes to embrace her . Not yet ? ESTELLE ISMAN Faintly . Prince Hagen , I told you PRINCE HAGEN I know , I know ! But how much longer ? I love you ! The sight of you is fire in my veins . Have I not been patient ? The time is very short when will you let me Advances . ESTELLE ISMAN Gasping . Give me give me till tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ! Turns to table . Ah , flowers ! Do you like the new poppies ? p. 94 ESTELLE ISMAN They are exquisite ! PRINCE HAGEN Sits in chair . Well , we 've had a busy day today . ESTELLE ISMAN Yes . You must be tired . PRINCE HAGEN In your house ? No ! ESTELLE ISMAN Rest , even so . Goes to piano . I will play for you . Sits , and takes Rheingold score . One of Gerald 's scores . Plays a little , then sounds the Nibelung theme . PRINCE HAGEN starts . She repeats it . PRINCE HAGEN No no ! ESTELLE ISMAN Why-what 's the matter ? PRINCE HAGEN That music ! What is it ? ESTELLE ISMAN It 's some of the Nibelung music . Gerald had it here . PRINCE HAGEN Do n't play it ! Hesitating . Music jars on me now I 've too much on my mind . ESTELLE ISMAN Rising . Oh very well . It is time for tea , anyway . Have you talked with father today ? PRINCE HAGEN Three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He plays the game well . p. 95 ESTELLE ISMAN He has played it a long time . PRINCE HAGEN Yes . ' Phone rings . Ah ! What is that ? Takes receiver . Hello ! Yes oh , Isman ! I see ' More trouble in Fifth Avenue , hey ? Well , are the regulars there ? Why do n't they fire ? Women and children in front ! Do they expect to accomplish anything by that ? No , do n't call me up about matters like that , Isman . The orders have been given . No not an inch ! Let the orders be carried out . That is all . Good-bye . Hangs up receiver . ESTELLE ISMAN Has been listening in terror . Prince Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN Well ? ESTELLE ISMAN What does that mean ? PRINCE HAGEN It means that the slums are pouring into Fifth Avenue . ESTELLE ISMAN A pause . What do they want ? PRINCE HAGEN Apparently they want to burn my palace . ESTELLE ISMAN And the orders what are the orders ? PRINCE HAGEN The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESTELLE ISMAN Is it for me that you are doing this ? p. 96 PRINCE HAGEN How do you mean ? ESTELLE ISMAN You told me you brought all the world and laid it at my feet . Is this part of the process ? PRINCE HAGEN Yes , this is part . ESTELLE ISMAN Stares at him intently ; whispers . How do you do it ? PRINCE HAGEN What ? ESTELLE ISMAN What is the secret of your power ? They are millions , and you are only one yet you have them bound ! Is it some spell that you have woven ? A pause ; HAGEN stares at her . She goes on , with growing intensity and excitement . They are afraid of your gold ! Afraid of your gold ! All the world is afraid of it ! It is nothing - it is a dream it is a nightmare ! If they would defy you if they would open their eyes it would go as all nightmares go ! But you have made them believe in it ! They cower and cringe before it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and murder their brothers for it ! They sell their minds and their souls for it ! And all because no one dares to defy you ! No one ! No one ! In a sudden transport of passion . I defy you ! PRINCE HAGEN starts ; she gazes at him wildly . I will not marry you ! I will not sell myself to you ! Not for any price that you can offer not for any threat that you can make ! Not in order that my mother may plan wedding breakfasts and triumph over Mrs. Bagley-Willis ! Not in order that my father may rule in Wall Street and command the slaughter of women and children ! Nor yet for the fear of anything that you can do ! p. 97 PRINCE HAGEN In a low voice . Have you any idea what I will do ? ESTELLE ISMAN Desperately . I know what you mean you have me at your mercy ! You have your guards - I am in a trap ! And you mean force I have felt it in all your actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of escape , even from that ; and I will take it ! You can compel me to kill myself ; but you can never compel me to marry you ! Not with all the power you can summon not with all the wealth of the world ! Do you understand me ? They stare at each other . I have heard you talk with my brother , and I know what are your ideas . You came to our civilization , and tried it , and found it a lie . Virtue and honor justice and mercy all these things were pretenses snares for the unwary . There was no one you could not frighten with your gold ! That is your creed , and so far it has served you but no farther ! There is one thing in the world you can not get one thing that is beyond the reach of all your cunning ! And that is a woman 's soul . With a gesture of exultant triumph . You can not buy me ! PRINCE HAGEN Estelle ! ESTELLE ISMAN Go ! PRINCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! p. 98 ESTELLE ISMAN You love me ! The slave driver with his golden whip ! PRINCE HAGEN Even so I love you . ESTELLE ISMAN What do you know of love ? What does the word mean to you ? Before love must come justice and honor , with it come mercy and self-sacrifice all things that you deride and trample on . What have you to do with love ? PRINCE HAGEN With intensity . I love you ! More than anything else in all the world I love you ! ESTELLE ISMAN Stares at him . More than your power ? PRINCE HAGEN Estelle ! Listen to me ! You do not know what my life has been ! But I can say this for myself I have sought the best that I know . I have sought Reality . A pause . I seek your love ! I seek those things which you have , and which I have not . Fiercely . Do you think that I have not felt the difference ? ESTELLE ISMAN In a startled whisper . No ! PRINCE HAGEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has become all the world to me ! I love you I can not live without you . I will follow you wherever you command . Only teach me how to win your love . p. 99 ESTELLE ISMAN I can not make terms with you . I will not hear of love from you while you have force in your hands . PRINCE HAGEN I will leave your home . I will set you free . I will humble myself before you . What else can I do ? ESTELLE ISMAN You can lay down your power . PRINCE HAGEN Estelle ! Those are mere words . ESTELLE ISMAN No ! PRINCE HAGEN Who is to take up the power ? Shall I hand it back to those who had it before ? Are Plimpton and Rutherford better fitted to wield it than I ? ESTELLE ISMAN Vehemently . Give it to the people ! PRINCE HAGEN The people ! Do you believe that in that mass of ignorance and corruption which you call the people there is the power to rule the world ? ESTELLE ISMAN What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that has kept them in ignorance ? What is it but your gold ? It lies upon them like a mountain 's weight ! It crushes every aspiration for freedom every effort after light ! Teach them help them then see if they can not govern themselves ! PRINCE HAGEN I meant to do it p. 100 ESTELLE ISMAN Yes so does every rich man ! When only he has the time to think of it ! When only his power is secure ! I have heard my father say it a score of times . But there are always new rivals to trample new foes to fight new wrongs and horrors to be perpetrated ! The time to do it is now NOW ! PRINCE HAGEN Estelle CALKINS Enters hurriedly . Prince Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN What is it ? CALKINS A message from Isman . There is bad news from Washington . PRINCE HAGEN Well ? CALKINS A. bill has been introduced in Congress it is expected to pass both houses to-night your property is to be confiscated ! PRINCE HAGEN What ! CALKINS The sources of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to become public property . It is to take effect at once ! ESTELLE ISMAN Pointing at him in exultation . Aha ! It has come ! They stare at each other . CALKINS I tried to get more information but I was cut off p. 101 PRINCE HAGEN Cut off ! CALKINS I think the wires are down I ca n't get any response . PRINCE HAGEN I see ! Stands in deep thought ; laughs . Well To ESTELLE . At least Plimpton and Rutherford are buried with me ! To CALKINS . Send to town at once and have the wires seen to . And try to learn what you can . CALKINS Yes , sir at once ! Exit . ESTELLE ISMAN They have done it themselves , you see ! PRINCE HAGEN Yes I see . GERALD ISMAN Enters , centre ; stands looking from one to the other . Well , Prince Hagen it looks as if the game was up . PRINCE HAGEN You 've heard the news ? GERALD ISMAN From Washington ? Yes . And more than that . Your guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISMAN Yes . We 're prisoners of war , it seems . ESTELLE ISMAN Gerald ! PRINCE HAGEN How do you know ? p. 102 GERALD ISMAN They 've sent a delegation to tell us . They 've cut the telephone wires , blocked the roads , and shut us in . PRINCE HAGEN What do they want ? GERALD ISMAN They do n't condescend to tell us that . They simply inform us that the woods are guarded , and that anyone who tries to leave the camp will be shot . ESTELLE ISMAN In fright . Prince Hagen ! HAGEN stands motionless . GERALD ISMAN Solemnly . Hagen , the game is up ! PRINCE HAGEN In deep thought . Yes . The game is up . A pause . Gerald ! GERALD ISMAN Well ? PRINCE HAGEN Points to violin . Play ! GERALD ISMAN Startled . No ! PRINCE HAGEN Play ! GERALD ISMAN You will go ? PRINCE HAGEN Yes . I will go . But I will come back ! Play ! GERALD takes the violin and plays the Nibelung theme . Louder ! GERALD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the orchestra and mounts to a climax , in the midst of which HAGEN pronounces a sort of incantation.Mimi ! Mimi ! Open the gates of wonderland ! Bring back the mood of phantasy , and wake us from our evil dream ! Silence . Then answering echoes of the music are heard , faintly , from the fireplace . There are rappings and murmurings underground , rumbling and patter of feet , and all the sounds of Nibelheim . As the music swells louder , the trap doors slide open , and MIMI appears , amid steam and glare of light . ESTELLE sees him , and recoils in terror . A company of Nibelungs emerge one by one . They peer about timidly , recognize HAGEN , and with much trepidation approach him . MIMI clasps his hand , and they surround him with joyful cries . He moves toward the fireplace , and the steam envelops him . p. 103 ESTELLE ISMAN Starts toward him , stretching out her arms to him . Prince Hagen ! PRINCE HAGEN Farewell ! He gradually retires , and disappears with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triumphant .
