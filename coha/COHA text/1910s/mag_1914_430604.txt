 | IN the spring of 1914 Mr. P. A. B. Widener of Philadelphia purchased , for a price said to have been $250,000 , a matchless piece of armor known as the " Helmet of the Morosinis , " which once belonged to Vincenzo Morosini , one of the most celebrated Venetian patricians of the sixteenth century . In 1909 Henry J. Duveen paid $16,500 for two postage stamps ? one-penny and twopenny philatelic rarities of Mauritius , which were engraved by a Port Louis watchmaker in 1847 and which every stamp collector has dreamed of owning . At the Hoe sale , which took place in New York  | City three and a half years ago , a Gutenberg Bible was knocked down to Henry Huntington for $50,000 . These are record prices , to be sure . But every year , at Sotheby 's and Christie 's in London and at the Hotel des Ventes in Paris , staggering sums are received for antique pictures . jewelry , statuary , books and engravings , from open-handed millionaires who have turned their attention from the collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is it any wonder that many a deft but unscrupulous artist and craftsman should turn criminal and become a forger of the antique ? It is so much safer than highway robbery , so much more lucrative than safe-blowing , so much more respectable than coining false money , so considerately ignored by the district attorney and the police that the forger ' of old art objects has been all 70 but degraded from a kind of specious art in itself to a factory industry . In the Eaubourg Montmartre , Louis Quatorze furniture and tapestries are produced about as regularly as a Detroit automobile plant turns out motor cars ; in Egypt the making of scarabs and statuettes is a household industry ; in Siena , the production of early Italian masters is so well established that " worm-eaten " panels , on which saints are to be painted in the sixteenth-century manner by a twentieth century hand , are shamelessly placed before the dealers ' shops so that the gold backgrounds may dry . There are exposures enough when the manufactured " antique " is unusually crude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms ? partly because the transaction between dealer and purchaser is very much like horse-trading , which means that  | the buyer must be on his guard and must assume all the risk , and partly because a millionaire who would never make a contract without consulting a lawyer , and who would even turn up a box of strawberries to set that he is not misled by a seductive top Ls er , has no burning desire to pose in the newspapers as having bought an artistic gold brick . The game of fooling the millionaire collector is so easily played that the makers of fraudulent antiques trade even upon the names of living artists . Corot , Henner , Inness , Wyant , and Homer Martin were all dishonestly and successfully mimicked in their lifetime . T. Sidney Cooper once examined two hundred and eighty-six works attributed to him , and pronounced two hundred and fifty-five to be spurious . When huge sums are paid for the work of famous masters , the collector usually Wages an expert on whose opinion he relies absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furtwangler , who can tell from the mere curling of the hair on a marble bust whether it is genuine Roman work of the best period or a skilful modern counterfeit ; there are archaeologists whose knowledge of ancient manuscripts is such that they know the exact changes of Greek letters in every century ; there are antiquarians who , from the mere marks of a tool , can determine whether a chair was made in the twentieth or the seventeenth century . But they are not many , these all-wise , all-knowing connoisseurs ; not more , perhaps , than a score or two in the whole world . And even they can be deceived . A whole committee of them were hoodwinked so completely that on their advice the Louvre lost a small fortune . That happened when Schapschelle Hochmann , a  | Russian , appeared in Paris and offered for sale a magnificent ceremonial head-piece of pure beaten gold , bearing an inscription to the effect that it was given to the Scythian king Saitapharnes by the Greek colony of Olbia in 200 B.C. The Louvre paid Hochmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had vouched for the tiara . Hochmann left Paris in twenty-four hours . That the tiara was beautiful no one could deny . Such was its workmanship that it totally eclipsed anything that could be expected of a modern goldsmith ? so it was declared . Benvenuto Cellini might have made such a crown , averred Andre Falize and Maitre Lalique , but no mere nineteenth-century craftsman . One day , some years after its purchase , a letter from Lifschitz , a jeweler , appeared in a Parisian newspaper , a letter in which Lifschitz stated that he had actually seen the tiara of Saitapharnes made in Odessa by a certain Rouchomowski , who had received a paltry 2,000 rubles ( $i , 000 ) for his trouble . Immediately two camps sprang up ? the tiarists and the anti-tiarists . They waged a bitter epistolary war in the columns of the press . Finally an enterprising Parisian editor brought Rouchomowski on from Odessa . The French Senate asked Professor Clermont-Ganneau to make an investigation . Clermont - Ganneau gave Rouchomowski some gold , told him to reproduce parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rouchomowski performed his task with much the same accuracy as an automatic piano reels off a Bach fugue over and over again . Clermont-Ganneau was satisfied ; so was the Louvre ; so was Paris . The tiara was forthwith transferred to the Conservatoire des Arts Decoratifs . Why ? Because it had ceased to be beautiful ? Or was it because it must never be admitted that a stupid Russian is the artistic peer of a Cellini ? Emperor William and the " Flora " Bust Only a few years elapsed after the Louvre 's sad experience , when the art world was again shaken by a blunder , made this time by Dr. Wilhelm Bode , Germany 's foremost authority on Italian art . As the curator of the Emperor Frederick Museum in Berlin , Bode purchased for $40,000 a waxen bust so exquisite in modeling and style that he decided it must be the work of Leonardo da Vinci or one of that school . Other connoisseurs were not so cock-sure and gave expression to their doubts in no uncertain terms . To settle this nice point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inspected the " Flora " bust , as it had become known . The Emperor , as all the world is aware , has a happy gift of settling once and for all matters that puzzle engineers , generals , admirals , artists , and musicians . Has he not himself painted pictures ? Has he not designed battleships ? Has he not composed operas ? Has he not adorned the Siegesallee of Berlin with a phalanx of statues famous for their hideous mediocrity ? Is he not , therefore , the one competent person to decide whether or not the " Flora " bust is a work by Leonardo or not ? One penetrating glance from the imperial eye . and the question was immediately settled . " The bust is genuine , " decreed the Emperor . After that , only some graceless enemy of Germany , some feeble-minded , malicious foreigner , would continue to reflect on " Flora 's " authenticity and Bode 's scholarship . He turned up in the person of an Englishman named Lucas , who maintained that the bust was the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Victorian day , and that as a boy he had watched his parent at work upon it . When an expert has once decided how and when a canvas has been painted or a statue modeled , the testimony of a mere eve-witness is not taken too seriously . Lucas had some difficulty in proving his case . Bits of the waistcoat of Richard Cockle Lucas , old newspapers , and spermaceti forming part of the bust 's composition convinced the art world that Leonardo had not made the " Flora " bust . In justice to the forgotten sculptor Lucas , it must be said that he had never dreamed of making a counterfeit Leonardo . He had molded his bust from a painting in the possession of the Morrison family , and his work eventually found its way into the hands of dealers in art objects . That he should have hit upon the manner df Leonardo and his school was largely accidental . It was otherwise with Bastianini , who was assuredly one of the ablest sculptors of the nineteenth century , and who so dazzled contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as genuine Renaissance productions .  | Long before he attracted attention , Bastianini was employed as the salaried forger of Giovanni Freppa , a Florentine art broker , for whom he turned out early Renaissance fireplaces and a Holy Family in has-relief , so fine that it was sold as a genuine Verocchio . Fame came to Bastianini when he made a statue of the poet Benivieni . Freppa , his employer , paid 350 lire ( $7o ) for this bust , and later foisted it on de Nolivos , who supplied many collectors and museums with antiques . Nolivos in turn sold the bust to Count de Nieuwerkerque , general director of the Louvre , for 14,600 francs ( $2,900 ) . Bastianini 's forgery found a merited place in the Louvre beside the works of Michelangelo and Cellini . From Italy came the rumor that the bust was a fraud . Nieuwerkerque declared himself quite willing to pay 15,000 francs ( $3,000 ) to any sculptor who could duplicate the work , whereupon Bastianini promptly claimed the money in a letter to the Diritto . The usual controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when irrefutable documents were received from Italy : Freppa 's confession of his part in the swindle ; the affidavits of several tobacco factory hands to the effect that their fellow worker , Bonajuti , had posed for Bastianini ; and declarations of reputable artists who had seen the bust in Bastianini 's studio . Thereupon the Louvre turned the bust over to the Muse Sauvageot . Bastianini made dozens of wonderfully artistic reliefs and statues which deceived the foremost experts and artists of Europe . He is the author of the " Florentine Singer , " an exquisitely modeled figure that has become known through engravings . His bust of Savonarola easily passed as a contemporary sculpture . Lord Frederick Leighton kept a photograph of it " like a sacred image " at the head of his bed , and the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia wanted to build a special structure in which it might be worthhoused . Dr. Foresi finally succeeded in unmasking its pretensions . Extraordinary as it may seem , there has even grown up a business of forging forgeries . Albrecht Durer in his lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by whom Italy was flooded with good copies of Durer engravings signed with the great German 's initials . In desperation , Durer went to Venice and through the courts sought to restrain Marc Antonio . The court decided that it could not prevent Marc Antonio from copying , but that it could and would restrain him from using Darer 's name . Marc Antonios are still sold as genuine Durers . What is more , they have acquired a certain value as interesting forgeries , with the result that they are in turn forged . Dozens of " Genuine Portraits " of Shakespeare If a collector acquires a forgery solely for its intrinsic merit , ? a forgery by Bastianini or Marc Antonio , for example , ? he may readily be forgiven . He is not even a dupe . But what fitting epithet can be hurled at a man who buys , on the flimsiest evidence of authenticity , a picture for which all the world has been seeking through two centuries and more , and which must fulfil certain long established requirements ? Over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to possess the only true portraits of William Shakespeare . Every one knows that the only likenesses of Shakespeare that deserve serious consideration are the bust at Stratford-onAvon and the Droeshout engraving in the First Folio edition , and that neither of these was made from life . But M. H. Spielmann , an English art critic who has scoured every corner of this nook in art , finds that there are at least two dozen paintings of Shakespeare and dozens of miniatures that were trustingly bought as genuine by their present owners . Two unscrupulous restorers , Holder and Zincke , are responsible for several of these Shakespeare paintings ; they even supplied verses ingeniously ascribed to Ben Jonson in order to envelop their impositions in an Elizabethan atmosphere . If you find a seventeenth-century picture of a highbrowed , thoughtful man , with soulful eyes , wired ruff , and a goatee , you have only to supply it with a date ( " 1603 , " " 1605 , " or " 1609 " ) and to hint that it may be Shakespeare in order to command a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the history of some alleged Shakespeare portraits , such as the " Ely Palace " portrait , the " Felton " portrait , the " Ashbourne " portrait , and others . It is hard to convince the possessor of a Shakespeare likeness , thus acquired , that it is not to be worshiped on bended knees . With Sheraton furniture it is the same . Of Thomas Sheraton 's actual manufacture , only one piece is known with certainty ?  | a glass-fronted bookcase stamped " T. S. " on the inside of a drawer . Sheraton could never have made the shiploads of chairs , tables , sideboards , and secretaries that bear his name ; for he never possessed anything more than a small shop , and had a grievously hard time making two very inelastic ends meet . The delight of unearthing for oneself an antique relic that seems to be priceless blinds even the professional buyers for museums . For more than two decades Michel Kaufman , a cunning German mason , thus made sport of the leading scholars of his country . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his frauds are what they purport to be . In the presence of Jakob von HefnerAlteneck , director of the Bavarian National Museum and an authority in his day on Roman art , Kaufman permitted his skilful fabrications to be " discovered . " The first find was a Roman oven . It may have been genuine ? at least , von HefnerAlteneck thought so . Year after year more ovens were dug up , until finally Kaufman had one hundred and seventeen to his credit . As he progressed he grew bolder . His later ovens contained finished and half finished pots , prepared clay , and bowls . " These are the finest examples of the Roman potter 's art thus far discovered , " von Hefner-Alteneck asserted . All the discoveries were eagerly bought by the museums of Speier , Luxemburg , Paris , and Munich , as well as by private collectors . The suspicions of the Minister of State were finally aroused . Von HefnerAlteneck was sent to investigate ; he brought back reassurances . Kaufman became bolder . He dug up a relief portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumed charger , clutching the imperial sword of state and adorned with a Louis XIV periwig . That was too much even for an innocent , bespectacled archaeologist . Kaufman was promptly exposed , but he died unpunished . The scientific consequences of such frauds are often far-reaching . An entire new cast may be given to history and the painstaking work of earnest students all but undone . A pertinent instance of the error into which the scientific world may fall because of some knavery is the deception to which Alphonse de Candolle and Count Sternberg were subjected . Both men were botanists of reputation . Both independently determined to investigate the germinating power of seeds ; both determined to experiment with seeds found in Egyptian tombs ; and both applied , curiously enough , to the same scholar to supply their needs ? a Cairo student who in turn obtained what was wanted from a dealer . Elaborate treatises were published by de Candolle and Sternberg on the tenacity of life displayed by wheat and barley seeds thousands of years old ; for both succeeded in raising excellent grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their researches appeared in popularized form in the daily press , in histories , and in school books . Scientific conclusions of importance were based on their work . Finally Edmond Gain and Maspero proved that de Candolle and Sternberg had been tricked . The Cairo dealer had simply bought last year 's seed and sold it , at an advanced price , as a specimen obtained from an old tomb . The Most Cultured Criminal in the World The historical and technical knowledge demanded in the preparation of art counterfeits must equal that of the average university professor or museum curator who may be called in as an expert . If the cultured " gentleman " criminal is to be found anywhere outside of the pages of detective stories , he is certainly to he seen among sellers of pseudo-antiquities . He must combine all the graces of a polished man of the world with a bespectacled academician 's knowledge of the past . He must deal with business men as a business man in transactions that may run into many thousands of dollars , and he must match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . No wonder that the game has its fascination . The technical processes of preparing art objects are as well understood among the manufacturers of decoy antiques as the stratagems of card sharpers among cheating gamblers . A gold necklace or bracelet , shaken up with broken eggs from time to time , will acquire a beautiful old patina in three months . Is an ivory carving to be aged ? The piece is cracked by dipping it in hot water and drying it over a hot fire . Are you looking for a medieval chair or table ? Old wooden joists are ingeniously pieced together with real antique nails . The piece is carved and painted , but the paint is rubbed down with potash , so that only faint traces may be  | seen here and there . Must the chair be worm-eaten ? Maceration in acid or a judicious use of the gimlet will give you all the worm-holes your heart desires . If you are wise you will test the holes with a knitting-needle . Even the worms of old were no more given to biting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a Parisian antique picture factory and you will find that the aging of a canvas is as much an art as is the wielding of a brush . The canvas must be old . Fortunately , the peasants of Austria and southeastern Europe still weave canvas as it was woven three centuries ago . If such canvas can not be obtained , genuine but cheap old paintings are bought ; the paint is dissolved off with lye ; and the old surface is re-prepared to ensnare its future purchaser . The painting must be cracked to convince you that it is old ? The twentiethcentury Renaissance artist bakes it in an oven , like so much bread , until the paint cracks and even peels . The paint is too bright ? That defect can be cured by boiling the canvas in licorice or tobacco juice . Milk , fine ashes , and lampblack rubbed in with the hand will produce that rich golden tone that you admire so fervently . Must you have dirt ? The back of the canvas is sprinkled with powdered rosin and floor sweepings rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A brushing , with limewater and a month in a humid cellar will raise a green crop that will surely satisfy you . Bring on your expert now , and let him dare say that this is not a genuine work of the sixteenth century . But the painting itself , after all , is the thing . How is the style and handling of the Italian Renaissance so admirably mimicked ? It requires a great technician who wields a sure brush . A hand is copied from this master , a smile from that , a drapery from a third , a pose from a fourth , parts of a background from a fifth , sixth , and seventh . The finished product is a mosaic , to be sure , but a mosaic that can be detected only if to few originals have been plagiarized . As . in the battle waged by safe-makers and burglars . by armorplate-makers and gunsmiths. much is learned by both sides , so collectors and tricksters have educated each other . It no longer pays to age paper by fuming it or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watermark of a past century . Hence all Europe has been scoured for old registers , Bibles , legal documents , and deeds . Upon the fly-leaves of old books , upon documents bought or purloined from parish registers , impressions from " old " blocks are taken or drawings made with ink diluted to give it the faded aspect of lapsed generations . In the effort to disarm suspicion a deliberate modern touch may turn the tide in the forger 's favor . Just as a false tooth may be given the appearance of an honest but damaged incisor by providing it with an unnecessary gold filling , so a manufactured archaic painting will plead its age with the aid of " repairs . " It was made yesterday ; but the damage that it has sustained in the course of centuries of abuse has rendered it necessary to restore it in places . The wooden panel on which it has been painted ( planed from an old parquet floor or . wainscot ) has been repaired with a piece of obviously modern wood or cement . Thus is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of an older painting beneath a later surface . You turn the thing over to a renovator , who brings to light the hidden beauty of a masterpiece that had escaped the imbecile dealer who sold the picture . You are proud of your astuteness . So is the dealer of his ? for he had two pictures painted on the same panel . Detecting Forged Paintings by X-Rays The time is near when these snares , cunning as they may be , will fail to attract . Within the last two years scientific men have brought their processes and implements to bear , so that trustworthy tests of authenticity are gradually being developed . Thus , Dr. Alexander Faber of Weimar has worked out an ingenious method of studying paintings with the aid of X-rays , a method which , while it is still so new that it has not as vet been widely applied , will unquestionably prove a valuable aid in determining whether a picture is an original , a restoration , or a falsification . When a questioned canvas is photographed with the X-rays , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a fantastic sketch of the painting . Such a photograph bears only a general resemblance to the original . The relative brightness of the colors is changed ; the contours are not always the same ; and  | ugly spots or stripes mar the artistic effect of the whole . This curious transformation is due to the different densities of the pigments employed . Certain pigments are very transparent to X-rays , for which reason some concealed parts of a painting are more easily penetrated and photographed with the rays than others . Heavy , moderately heavy , and light colors , such as lead and mercury , zinc and iron , and aluminium , affect the photographic plates differently under the action of the X-rays . THIS IS the famous " Flora " bust , a beautiful wax sculpture which completely deceived Dr. Bode , the foremost German authority on antiques and the man upon whom the Berlin . Gallery relies almost entirely for expert advice . Bode contended that this work was by Leonardo da Vinci . It turned out to be the work . of an English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence Dr. Faber has been able to compile a scale of penetrability which , when compared with a color scale obtained by ordinary photography , enables him to determine with accuracy what pigments underlie the surface of a painting . Just as a bone appears distinctly in an X-ray photograph , despite its covering of flesh , so a heavy pigment appears distinctly beneath a light pigment . An ordinary photograph presents only the surface of the painting ; an X-ray photograph all the layers of color ,  | so that it may be regarded . in effect , as a kind of cross-section of the painting . Changes made by the artist himself , as well as subsequent restorations , are at once revealed by the X-rays . The painting out of a white drapery and the substitution of a dark form , the correction of a badly drawn hand , the addition of a new figure to enhance the effect of a composition , are disclosed so unmistakably that one can almost see the artist or his restorers at work . Concealed shapes creep out , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been tampered with by later brushes shows how a great artist constantly seeks to improve his work . A mere copyist 's reproduction would hardly disclose these evidences of conscientiousness ; for a copyist has only to follow the thing before him and not to interpret . Hence it becomes an easy matter to determine whether or not certain famous paintings in European galleries which have been in dispute are really originals or not . An X-ray picture of a genuine old Dutch master and a forgery attributed to that master will expose the real nature of both canvases at a glance ; for the forger can not possibly mimic all the many corrections that the master , in his effort to translate his subject as he saw it , felt it necessary to make . Professor A. P. Laurie of Edinburgh approaches the problem in another and equally effective way . He has devised a scientific method of examining pigments and brush-work which , when it becomes more generally known , will make it easier to detect fraudulent old masters . He found that because illuminated manuscripts can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage to reproduce them from end to end , because they have been rarely restored , because in their chromatic decoration the pigments were laid on pure and with little medium , they were a veritable mine of chemical information . He analyzed the pigments on missals as old as the seventh century and on documents as recent as the beginning of the eighteenth century . After that he framed a chemical table of pigments which shows exactly what colors were available for eleven centuries . Woe betide the counterfeiter who uses Prussian blue to produce a sixteenth-century portrait ! Professor Laurie has only to remove from the canvas a speck of paint no bigger than a pin-head to discover the anachronism . The study of brush-work Professor Laurie carries out photographically . He uses a " micro-camera , " an instrument which is a hybrid camera and microscope , and which makes photographic enlargements of selected portions of a disputed painting . Connoisseurs have used the lens for many years , it must be admitted ; but the lens is an imperfect weapon , because the memory of brush-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of micro-photographs forgets nothing . A practical test of the method came when Professor Laurie was asked to pass on the authenticity of a Teniers in a private collection . His first step was to make enlargements of a genuine Teniers in the National Gallery of Edinburgh and of one in the National Gallery of London . He found that Teniers used short , broad , straight strokes in painting faces , with the addition of very fine lines , slightly curved , for reproducing the hair of a beard . The head in the privately owned picture under examination was modeled up by a totally different method . At once Professor Laurie knew that the picture was not a genuine Teniers , although it bore that master 's name . More scientific work like that of Dr , Faber and Professor Laurie is needed to place the appreciation of art works on a more substantial footing than it now possesses . The art connoisseur , however learned he may be , is subconsciously swayed by emotional interest , prepossession , and unadmitted personal bias . He tries hard to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct , his sense of the fitness of things , ? in a word , his good taste , ? he must of necessity make costly and ridiculous mistakes . At best his judgment is a higher kind of guessing or intuition . A scientist , charged with establishing the period at which a landscape was painted or a chair fashioned , may not know the difference between a Botticelli and a Correggio or an Adam and a Chippendale ? may , indeed , be totally devoid of artistic taste ; but , in a laboratory equipped with all the delicate appliances of modern chemistry and microscopy , he can perform his allotted task by handling the object as if it were a mysterious solution or compound , the true nature of which is to be fathomed . There will always be art forgers , but their number will be few and their difficulties many when the scientist with his X-rays and his chemicals supplants the guessing of the connoisseur .
