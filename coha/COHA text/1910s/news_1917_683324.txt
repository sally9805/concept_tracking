txt Germany 's war credits began at $1,250,000,000 each . Her ninth cred1t , reported on Saturday , is for . $3,000,000,000 . The total of the credits is in the last decade of a round hundred billion marks , $25,000,000,000 . The loans floated on the credits are some billions smaller , but the floating *debt approximates ' the difference al-% , most certainly . That is why the credit is authorized . ' The figures would have been incredible in the pre-war period . It is equally amazing that . these staggering burdens are borne ' without exhausting the disposition to assume them . The last ' credit was Voted " without discussion , " and without opposition except from one of the minor parties . The political declaration upon which the credit was based was passed by a vote of 214 to 116 . So far as the world knows , Germany 's politics and economics are less disturbed than those of opponents who deem themselves the superiors of Germany in morals and economics . What is the source of this strength , so disconcerting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unity itself is one source . Germany 's economic endurance is due to the fact that Germany is so self-contained , alike in her morals and her resources . The Central Powers produce more wheat than the United states , Canada , and the Argentine produced in the year before the war . They possess more cattle than England , France , and Italy combined . The iron capacity of the two sets of allies was not very different before the war , but Germany has enlarged hers at the expense of her enemy 's . Germany 's great foreign trade is a ' wreck , of course , but that is one , source of her strength , for all the en'peace which went to the profits of peace has been capable of diversion ' to the support of war . That no doubt ' creates an evil future day , but explains nevertheless a great source of Germany 's present strength . The moral explanation is no more mysterious than the economic . According to Scriptural authority , the ' wicked flourish like a green bay tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a military gmeaning . Every military advantage gained against the laws of war , and ( which civilized enemies deny themelves lest they , too , should forfeit heir character , strengthens Gering ' . She seized with a sure hand the coal deposits and iron works of Prance and Belgium . She works them with forced labor of civilian ! enemies , not prisoners who might fairly be made to work for their support . Germany methodically pillaged the private industrial resources of the ! countries she ravaged . She ? carried ; machinery and materials to Germany and deported the labor necessary to I'cork them . Germany allows herself ( financial excesses which she denied herself in the previous war against France . When Germany occupied Warts the Bank of France was spared . But formal complaint has been made to our State Department that Prussia levied a forced loan of a billion francs ' upon Belgian banks and taxed threefifths of it upon the National Bank of Belgium , which is a *private institurtion . Private bank officers were imprisoned when their resources were taken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been substituted for ' the local currency . The total of the fines which German Generals and Governors have levied upon subjugated peoples is not known , but many large individual amounts have been reported . In short , the mystery of German ; economic strength is a mixture of good and bad reasons . The German habit of patient industry and submission to leadership is a priceless asset in either peace or war . This is reinforced by piracy on the sea , pillage on the land , and skill in mar ' , libeling the resources of peace for use 4n war . Germany is now investing about sevenfold her normal savings 4n war securities , and spending it all In the acquirement of what she will ' not be allowed to keep . Germany is 1a sort of national Dr. Jekyll and Mr. ! Hyde . It is necessary to admit her ' virtues , and it is more necessary to stop her crimes .
