txt PREJUDICE . Nathan Straus Comments on the Ills It Creates . Easy to create , it is hard to destroy . Sinister of wit , it is weak of wisdom . Its perceptions are false . It sees in darkness ; it is blind in the light . It nurtures lies and rejects truth . Breeding hatred , it blasts sympathy . It rules those who give it life . It is a conjured Frankenstein , dominating millions of men , It sits beside the gates of life and takes toll of all that pass . It is the conservator of all that reason would destroy the destroyer of the works of justice . It is the hand-maiden of error , the nemesis of knowledge . It feeds fear and poisons hope . It lives by the law of the dead : It thrives upon the meat of yesterday . It sickens on the sustenance of today . It is the anarchist of the heart . It smothers faith . It gives love to the torch . It bemeans benevolence and shuns communion . It stills the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It betrays belief and sets suspicion on a throne . It rejoices in tears . Its mirth is in misery . it is the monster of the mind . It pollutes thought , serves despair , and ravishes right . It offends against fact and is a stranger to logic . Its soothing is in sophistry . It divines the unreal and walks in the way of phantoms . It drains the potions brewed by witches of the brain . It is a thing of charms and amulets . It is prejudice !
