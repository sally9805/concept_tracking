txt EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY into the lime-water . An insoluble , white precipitate is immediately formed which is carbonate of lime . The carbonic-acid gas which you blow out , and which is mildly acid with water , combines with the lime , which is a strong alkali , to form this carbonate . Now marble is carbonate of lime , so that with lime-water enough and wind enough , and the needful procedure in fusing afterward , one might produce his gravestone out of his own proper person . It would give an aspirant a chance for " a place in the world in the eyes of men " after he had passed away , an opportunity to be both cremated and preserved . It appears , from researches made in physiological laboratories , that oxygen plays a very important part in what we call the mystery of sleep . Although we continue both asleep and awake to inhale the free oxygen and to exhale oxygen that has ( lone its work of oxidation and is in combination with carbon as carbon dioxide , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such times . While we are awake it seems we exhale more oxygen than we inhale . When we sleep we inhale more than we exhale . We deplete the store awake and increase it while we sleep . Now we can not live without it . It provides by its reactions , by processes of oxidation within us , for bodily heat and for the chemical processes of life . How needful it is we are reminded when we consider how quickly we are drowned . In the history of torture one of the most cruel methods of putting culprits to death was simply to keep them awake until they died . Without sleep they could not make up for the oxygen lost and so they died of oxygen starvation . It is said that there is no record of the ability of executioners to keep any one 6o AIR AND WATER awake over five days . I make this statement from memory only . Plants breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen . In much less measure , some of them do the opposite . Oxygen combines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this form . The fires that we see are chiefly carbon and hydrogen combining with oxygen at such a rate that the combining particles grow white hot and give light . Oxygen dissolves slightly in water , and fish get most of what they need that way . It is in rocks and in sand and in all living things . The reason why our bodies are maintained at blood heat is because of the oxygen that is going into combination within them . We are slowly burning so long as we live . If we inhale air that contains much more than one-fifth part oxygen , it makes us hilarious ? drunk , in fact . The great melodrama in which the dashing speculator leads oxygen into the air-ducts of the stock-exchange and so excites the traders that stocks go up and he makes his fortune has not been written yet , but here is the chance . I claim no copyright on the idea . The oxygen atom has two hooks , and there are two atoms in the molecule , except when a current of electricity short-circuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus produces lightning , and then a little ozone is formed . Ozone is oxygen , but with three atoms in the molecule instead of two , the atoms connected up , as in . the corners of a triangle , with one arm or hook engaged on either side . It is not stable ; the one extra atom soon disengages itself , and then it is ready for business to oxidize things . Getting one or more atoms of oxygen into a combination is called oxidation . Getting atoms of oxygen 6t EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY out of a molecule is called reduction . Ozone , therefore , is an oxidizing agent . On the other hand , small particles of iron , heated , will take up oxygen from many compounds , and that makes it a reducing agent . A smelter , that melts up ores and separates the free metals from their oxides , is a reduction works . If we imagine the earth as without form and void , we might as well imagine that there was much more oxygen in a free and uncombined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals were oxidized ; but that they are now in an approximate state of equilibrium , animals and fires taking it up and plants giving it back to the air again . To produce oxygen for the industries , free from nitrogen , two methods are most frequently used . One is the electrolysis of water , whereby one volume of oxygen collects in a vessel over one pole and two of hydrogen over the other . The other method is by liquefying air and distilling off the nitrogen . The way to determine whether oxygen is present in excess in a container or a stream of escaping gas is to light a splinter of wood or a straw , blow out the flame while leaving a spark , and then hold the end with the spark so that it will serve as a test . If oxygen is present in excess the spark will burst into flame . A jet of burning oxygen and hydrogen , called the oxy-hydrogen flame , or , better still , oxygen and acetylene gas , known as the oxy-acetylene flame , will make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steel through almost any thickness . Oxygen is one of the great disinfectants . If brought into contact with the bacilli of disease it will usually oxidize them and render them harmless . If atmospheric air is pumped into sewage as it comes from city sewers , it will cause all the insoluble organic // matter to precipitate in the form of stable bodies , at once harmless and approximately inoffensive , and of enormous value as fertilizer . This is the line of re-search for the economic and harmless disposal of sewage . The nature of four-fifths of the air we shall have to postpone until we come to nitrogen ; but some of the physical properties of air we may consider at this point . It presses in upon us at about the rate of fifteen pounds to the square inch . We live on the oxygen , which is about one-fifth of it . According to its content of water , carbon dioxide , dust , spores of life , a slight divergence in the ratio of oxygen to the whole , and smoke or fumes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wholesome or unwholesome . The amount of dust that it carries is considerable ; indeed , it is the minute particles of dust that diffuse the light and that may have a marked effect upon rainfall . If a beam of light strikes through a dark room , we get an idea of the amount of dust there is floating around . We can see it then . Air is not a carrier of electricity , but the electricity breaks through at times under pressure , as we see in lightning . Moist air is more of a conductor than dry air ; that is , electricity breaks through moist air more easily than through dry air . Now pure water is not a conductor , but even the water up in the sky is not absolutely pure . Hardly anything in nature is pure ; nature is the most omnivorous mixer there is . Like all other gases , whether chemically pure or mixed , air grows hot as we compress it and cools as it expands . You may remember some pages back how gases contract as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their volume for each degree centigrade . Now suppose we let a gas expand without // heating it . While it is expanding it takes up heat instead of giving it off , and that produces cold . When you build a fire under a boiler , where does the heat go ? A little of it goes out the chimney , and the rest is taken up by the expanding steam . This explains how they make freezing-machines : by letting liquefied gases evaporate that want to evaporate so badly that they do n't need any heat to drive them to it . Then they use up what heat there is . In a similar way , if you compress a gas , not by cooling it , but by force , the molecules will bombard the inclosing walls harder and harder until they grow hot . In time an equilibrium is reached , but during the process it will give off the heat that would have been taken from it had you lowered the temperature . The inventor who planned to maintain a very high temperature by suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then " keep up the temperature by letting that hot gas escape , " forgot to calculate that as much cold would be produced by the expansion of the gas as there would be heat needed for its compression . The reason why it makes your hand cold to blow it is because it causes the moisture to evaporate ? to expand as a gas and to produce cold . Air is n't so light , after all , as we should discover by the way we should puff out and our organs would all be disarranged if we attempted to live in an atmosphere containing all the oxygen we need but with only three pounds ' pressure to the square inch ? i.e. , in an atmosphere within an air-tight room from which all the nitrogen were extracted . Our eyes would pop out and we should burst blood-vessels in no time . A very interesting and highly useful discovery was made by Dr. F. G. Cottrell while professor of physical // chemistry at the University of California . He found that under proper conditions an electric current of very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he studied and worked on it according to his nature , whereby with great eagerness he sought to bring down big game that no other fellow had ever bagged . Then he covered as much of the art as he could with patents . The results astounded Doctor Cottrell . There were the smelter people , especially the copper producers , in the throes of distress , because in treating the sulphurous copper ores they were either sending forth sulphurous fumes that killed all vegetation for miles around or they were wasting vast fortunes in valuable metal dust that left their stacks and settled down upon the earth like the ashes of an active volcano . The Government was after them , and the farmers were making themselves heard with voices of righteous wrath . So they fell upon Doctor Cottrell 's neck , beseeching him to save them . The Cottrell process does not precipitate gases , and so the SO2 goes its way . But by this process the particles of metal and earthen dust are removed from the gases while they are still hot , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was necessary to cool them first . Now the hot gases , emerging from the stack in that condition , continue to expand until they are cooled off , by which time they are too dilute to do much harm and are very likely to be blown away . The sulphur gas , if cool when it comes from the stack , will sink right down , because it is heavy ? and then the trouble begins . Details had to be worked out , but there was the art established of precipitating particles in suspension and thus saving thousands of dollars daily in single // plants , and letting the gases escape hot from the chimneys . The royalties bade fair to make a millionaire of Doctor Cottrell in short order but who wants to be a millionaire ? It is , after all , a good deal of a nuisance to be rich . It does not seem to improve the characters of young people to leave them big pots of money . The art of cooking has not developed or improved since the days of Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping , a little house is as comfortable as a big one . The administration of a fortune takes up a good deal of time and disturbs one 's attention . Of course , we can keep some friends by means of it , but those who need help most are the very men who will need it again ? and perhaps be no better for it . Anyway you can put it , it is an infernal nuisance to be rich . Getting the big thing done is the real fun , the real sport , and so Doctor Cottrell organized a good working laboratory in California to treat with the smelter managers and work out their problems in consideration of fat royalties , and then came to New York and organized the Research Corporation , to engage in scientific research . The stock can pay no dividends , and is held by men of consequence for the Smithsonian Institution . He turned over the royalties from all but three ; Pacific coast States to the Corporation , and used the proceeds coming in to him from the excepted territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order , he turned over the rights to the excepted States , also to the Research Corporation , and took a job in the Bureau of Mines . It was work that he liked , and the salary gave him a fair living . The need of this process of electric precipitation of particles in suspension is already very wide-spread . As only one result of its application , enormous savings // have been made in metallurgy and the nuisance of sulphur fumes greatly decreased . Where the conditions and situation warrant it , the sulphurous gas SO2 may be worked over into sulphuric acid , as you may learn later under sulphur , but this is not feasible where the transportation charges for sulphuric acid are too great . The possibilities of electric precipitation have not been nearly reached yet , and the Research Corporation is working on them . The fumes of iron blast furnaces , for instance , contain , among other things , considerable potash , and by putting high potash feldspar into the charge ? another suggestion from Doctor Cottrell 's fertile mind  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the precipitation of a large quantity of the much-needed potash . It is also possible that fog may be dissipated by it , by operating an electrically propelled kite or toy aeroplane , fastened by long wires to the bow of a ship , and between the two poles on the aeroplane and at the bow , precipitating the fog at sea that is in the path of the steamship . At least , this is a possibility . There are vast potentialities of power in compressed air ; a whole undiscovered realm is in this . And with steady winds , such as we have over so much of this country , it does seem as though we were " not very bright " to use so little of it for power , does n't it ? The wind is there , and so is the power ; and , with all our great inventive genius , we manage to pump up a little water for the cows ! So we had better order some more coal to grind the feed . Hydrogen is the lightest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one , and the atomic weight of the other elements are multiples of the weight of hydrogen . Refinements of research have // resulted in fixing 16 as the atomic weight of oxygen , and hydrogen then shows 1.008 instead of z in its combinations ; but we shall not concern ourselves about this . Hydrogen has been found in a free state in nature , but only in minute quantities . Most of it that is freed soon combines with oxygen to produce water . Hydrogen is very widely used in chemical industry . It is easily prepared by the electrolysis of water , H20 , which gives two volumes of hydrogen for every one of oxygen . Still another way is to pass steam over finely divided iron or over certain in m ores that are short of all the oxygen that they can carry in combination , heated to a white glow . The steam decomposes to oxygen and hydrogen . The oxygen is taken up by the ore , and the hydrogen presses on through the tubes from which it is collected . hormerly the ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with the ports closed on account of the war , it seemed worth while to look around a little . In Vir ginia an ore better than the imported was found . It is also produced by the action of many acids upon metals . Let us consider a reaction we employed once before zinc and sulphuric acid : The hydrogen is set free , and , inasmuch as there is nothing for it to combine with , it floats off into the air . After it gets there we know very well what will happen to it . The ubiquity of water is almost as great as oxygen . In the form of water vapor it is mixed with air . In Samuel S. Sadtler 's interesting book Chemistry of // Familiar Things he gives the number of grains of water that one cubic yard of air will contain as the maximum of humidity at various temperatures by the Fahrenheit scale . Here they are : He adds that one cubic mile of air , saturated with moisture at 95 degrees Fahrenheit , would give up 140,000 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 degrees , or the freezing-point . No wonder it rains ! The rays of the sun , which produce no heat by their passage through space , do produce heat by their passage through the air , and at the surface of the earth , where the greatest density prevails , the greatest heat is produced . So they vaporize the waters of the sea and lakes and rivers until the air becomes more or less saturated , according to its temperature . A breeze of cold air up in the blue , that we may not feel at all , reduces the temperature of that above us and down comes the rain . Water is the great natural solvent and carrier . A man has been described as about twelve pounds of ashes and eight buckets of water . A watermelon is ninety-six to ninety-eight per cent . water . A peculiar and very important trick of water is that just as it freezes it expands about 6 per cent . in volume and decreases in weight or density in proportion . That is why ice floats . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid and ? things would be different in the spring ! Hydrogen peroxide , or H202 , is a rather EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY unstable fluid , usually dispensed in dilute solutions in water , from which the extra oxygen atom soon frees itself under the reaction H202 = II20 + O. It is the well-known oxidizing agent of the household medicine-chest , and it really is an excellent antiseptic for that reason . We put it on a sore finger to oxidize the foulness , to burn it up without appreciable heat . Water has remarkable properties . It behaves very like an element in many respects . It makes innu merable chemical combinations with other bodies . Many bodies will dissolve in water and crystallize out as hydrates which are compounds with water . For instance , washing-soda , which is sodium carbonate , Na2CO3 , is a white , amorphous powder by itself , but it will combine with water and go hot in the l , rocess un til the decahydrate , which means the tenfold hydrate of sodium carbonate , is formed and this is expressed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda . These crystals are known in every kitchen . Copper sulphate by itself is a white substance which crystallizes in colorless needle-like prisms . It will combine with water , five to one , to make the penta hydrate , or fivefold hydrate ( CuSO4.5I f2O ) which crystallizes in big blue crystals of an entirely different shape and popularly known as blue vitriol . Heat will drive the water off . We often speak of hard and soft water , and , while we know the difference in practice , we are not all of us acquainted with the philosophy of it . There are two metals , calcium and magnesium , that are related to each other in the periodic system , and they have certain qualities in common . Calcium oxide , CaO , is lime , and magnesium oxide , MgO , is magnesia , and neither is very soluble in water . Both build salts with carbonic acid . By contact with the rocks // the water with carbon dioxide , CO2 , in solution , takes up some of these metals and carries them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bicarbonates are soluble , while the carbonates are not ; so if you boil the water you shift the bicarbonates over into carbonates ? and down comes boiler scale : your carbonates of lime and magnesium , plus mud held in the water in suspension . This is what is called temporary hardness ? the bicarbonates of these two metals in solution that precipitate or fall down as insoluble carbonates when the water is boiled . But there is what is known as permanent hardness , when the water contains the chlorides and sulphuric acid salts of these metals . Boiling will not bring them down . And yet , in proportion as the water contains salts of calcium or magnesium , it is called hard . The German scale is universally used as to the hardness of water ; one degree of hardness represents one part of lime in zoo , 000 parts of water , two degrees is double that , etc . Water of no more than three degrees of hardness is generally held to be pretty soft . But we do not want any lime or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soluble form or not . In washing , bleaching , scouring , dyeing ? in nearly all textile works ? soap is used . In laundries and households we use it , too . But what is soap ? It is , as a good example , stearate of soda ( stearic acid is a fatty acid ) . It is soluble in water . But if the water contains calcium or magnesium there are immediately produced calcium and magnesium soaps , which are insoluble . The stearic acid shifts over to all the Ca and Mg that is in the water , and we have useless lime or magnesium soap , which makes a gray ring on the bath-tub , streaks the clothes in the laundry , confuses the dyer , and costs all sorts of money in wool- // EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY scouring and in the bleaching industries by sheer waste of soap . West of England woolens have a good reputation primarily because the water there is soft ? about three degrees of hardness being the average . Calcium and magnesium are not wanted in water used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of the nuisance that hard water is in boilers ; the scale ruins the tubes , and it is such a poor conductor of heat that it runs the coal consumption away up . There are all sorts of compounds sold to prevent boiler scale , and they are usually , if they have any merit at all , designed to act chemically on the water and produce a scale that is lighter and more porous and so more easily removed . Such compounds are soda ash , tannin , caustic soda , and also some acids . Others act mechanically on the particles of scale as they form , and surround them with a slippery film to keep the mass from hardening or cementing together . Such compounds are slippery elm , starch , fats , and oils . And many of them are out and out quack medicines . Honey , soap , mercury , tobacco , urine , and cow-dung have been sold as wonderful practical remedies . The lime-soda process was the first scientific method introduced to make hard water soft . I t consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reagents , with a view to bringing down the soluble salts of Ca and Mg as insoluble precipitates . The process requires the attention of a chemist , and it does not completely soften the water . This method will bring water down to four or five degrees German hardness ? four or five parts lime or magnesia in 1oo,000 parts of water , but not lower . Now comes a modern invention called " permutit " that is chemically interesting and is of great useful- // ness . Dr. Robert Gans , of the German Geological Survey , while studying the fertility of soils , found that certain substances known as zeolites have a remarkable quality of swapping bases whenever they find a chance to do it . They take up potash , then exchange it for something else as the plants are ready for the potash , then exchange that something else for more potash , and they keep it up indefinitely , feeding potash to the plants in this manner . Of course , the zeolites of the soil are too weak , too mixed with other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make artificial zcolite by fusing feldspar , kaolin , pearlash , and soda together . It is a double silicate of aluminium and soda with water . Graphically it is said to be represented by the following formula : I pray you not to let it frighten you . You observe those two Na or sodium atoms on what we might call the eastern boundary ? That is where the peculiarity lies . If you bring a solution containing magnesium or calcium into contact with it , it will exchange sodium for Mg or Ca , and then , if you bring another salt around , it will exchange its Mg or Ca for the base contained in the new solution . It has , in other words , // no principles of loyalty , no faithfulness , no morals whatever . We are accustomed to polygamy in chemistry ; it does not shock us , but this " power of exchange " is unique . Now let us apply this quality to our own use . An upright cylinder contains a layer of marble chips over a perforated bottom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then comes a thick layer of permutit , which is a substance very like soapstone in appearance , being very porous . This also rests on a perforated bottom , and under it is a layer of gravel . The water , in passing through this filter , exchanges every particle of its lime and magnesia for sodium , in whatever form these may be . It makes the shift , and at the end of the day ( according to its computed capacity ) you have a lime and magnesium permutit in the filter instead of a sodium permutit , as in the morning . The water that has passed through it is completely soft ; it is of zero hardness . In the place of all its Ca and Mg it contains soluble Na salts . Soap is not wasted in it , boiler scale does not form , and the water problem , in many cases , so far as hardness is concerned , is settled . But the filter is to be used next day , and the permutit , being combined with Ca and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we flush out the filter by forcing water through it backward for a few minutes and then make a io-per-cent. solution of ordinary cooking salt ( chloride of sodium , NaCl ) in water . This we let stand in the filter during the night , and by morning the water in it has become exceedingly hard and the permutit has become sodium permutit and is ready for business again to soften water . The permutit is not soluble in water ; it will only exchange bases with salts in solution . So it is not wasted , it does not get // tired as some catalysts do , and it lasts permanently , day in and day out , making its perpetual exchange . The amount of salt required to regenerate the permutit is about one pound of salt for every one hundred gallons of hard water softened . It is a very pretty operation , and as useful in the household to produce the luxury of soft water as it is in the industries . Iron and manganese are also troublesome factors in water . Both make stains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher oxides of these metals being insoluble . There is a modification of permutit which also removes them . Manganese especially is not desired in city watersupplies . So far as we know , its presence does not seem to affect the health of persons who drink water which contains it , even when we consider mineral waters that are high in manganese content . But it is a nuisance ? worse than iron . Certain microscopic growths found in water-pipes absorb the manganese into their sheaths and form long , fibrous , gelatinous masses which increase the friction of the water , and when they are loosened by heavy currents the water issues from the faucets in an unsightly condition . It is deadly to fish life . The brownish cast of the water shuts out the sunlight and stunts the fish growth , and the oxide of manganese accumulates in and clogs up the fish-gills . Like iron , in laundries it produces brownish streaks that show on ironing , and in bleacheries it produces a muddy-white color and occasionally brownish spots . It will do the same to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It injures the fermentation processes of breweries , and it spoils the color baths of dye-houses . A great contribution to the health of cities and villages has been found in the addition of a slight // amount of chlorine to the water-supply . Since the adoption of the chlorination system by the New York City department of water-supply , not a single case of typhoid fever has been attributed to city water . Another method of destroying bacteria in water is by submitting it to the action of ultra-violet rays . These are rays that are substantially light rays ? or rather would produce light if our eyes were equipped to observe them . They are the burning , actinic rays of the sun ? the freckle rays and sunburn rays . The method is to use a mercury arc-light which produces many ultra-violet rays , but which can not get through glass . They do , however , go right through quartz . So the Peter Cooper Hewitt mercury are light is pro-duced in a quartz tube and then water is run over the tube . VII NITROGEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than oxygen ? in the ratio of 14 to i6 ? and it comprises about four-fifths of the air . There is enough going on in the air to keep it pretty well mixed . We have al-ready spoken of how inert this nitrogen gas is . We breathe in the air , take up the oxygen ( of which nearly all of the other fifth is composed ) , and breathe out the same nitrogen , but not the same oxygen . In the exhalations the nitrogen is mixed with some oxygen and carbon dioxide , or carbonic-acid gas , instead of all of the oxygen that went in . Nothing happens to the nitrogen . Its atoms are clinched together in pairs as molecules , and they will not loosen up under ordi-nary conditions . In a temperature such as is tradi-tionally held by orthodoxy to be reserved for sinners , we should have an entirely different chemistry of every-day life ; for extreme heat , such as is found in the electric spark , will tear the nitrogen molecule apart , and when nitrogen once begins to react @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Nature in its quiet way performs the most difficult laboratory tricks without any noise or explosion . I have said that it is very hard to get nitrogen from the air into combination . I meant in the laboratory or in the works . On the other hand , clover , cowpeas , and other leguminous plants have little nodules on their stems just above the earth , and these nodules swami with harmless bacteria which take the nitrogen from the air , bring it into combination , and feed it to the plant . Plow under your cow-peas or clover and you will have provided your soil with fixed nitrogen . This is the good old standard way to get fixed or combined nitrogen into the soil . The only objections to it are the need to hurry up , the demand for farm produce from increasing urban populations , the desire of the farmer to exchange produce for wealth , and the sleepless mortgage . Aside from taking up nitrogen from the air , nature has a way of giving it back . There are a few chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is quite a laboratory trick to perform them . Nature , on the other hand , seems to give it off in some sort of a cycle , taking it up by means of bacteria , and giving some of it off again when the plants and animals are carbonized ; and there may be ? who knows ? ? some bacteria that consume nitrates and set nitrogen free . There must be a nitrogen cycle , into life and back again . But there we are . We must have nitrogen in combination for fertilizer and so for food , for clothing , for explosives , for mining , and for all sorts of engineering work and for munitions of war , for dyestuffs , and hundreds of other things . Some foods , such as sugar , starch , and fats , contain no nitrogen , but the proteins , the stuff that builds muscle and // brawn , the meat for strong men , all these contain nitrogen . Of course , there is the great waste of city sewage , which contains enormous quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all into inoffensive and useful products . I say we know how , but we have not , all of us , these facts of chemistry alive in our brains , and so we just go on complaining and wondering why somebody does n't do something . Let us now consider a little more of this remarkable element . It can outdo fire and brimstone in its satanic tricks . It will not combine except in its own secret way , and once it gets - into combination it becomes the business end of nearly all explosives , and it is one of the elements which must be present in combination if life is to prevail . In the eggs of all animals it is present in large proportion . I shall not offer to base any conclusions upon this , but merely give it as a fact , that the thin , wiry little man , who is all nerves and action , contains more nitrogen in proportion to his weight than the obese , fat man . It is present in all nerve stuff . Until lately the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrate-of-soda beds of Chile . Ammonia is obtained from the distillation of coal , but not in sufficient quantities . This source of supply is increasing as by-product coke-ovens are built . That comes from the N left over in the plants during the ages . We can get it into the earth by planting leguminous plants and plowing them under , as we have noted , but for manufacturing purposes the Chilean nitrate beds were practically the only source of supply . This is what has made Chile so rich . But that store will not last forever . The best posted persons say that at the present rate of consumption // it should take from a hundred to a hundred and fifty years to exhaust the supply , and for the past twentyfive or thirty years the problem of " fixing nitrogen , " as it is called , has been one of the chemical prizes . As soon as nitrogen is in combination it is fixed , and the chemist feels that he can negotiate with it . An American , Charles S. Bradley , was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory scale by means of an electric arc at Niagara Falls . Iie made considerable progress , developed the art , in fact , but he had the misfortune to be first in the field . American capital has never been favorably disposed toward experiment except in mechanics , and at the point that Bradley had to stop for lack of funds two Norwegian chemists , Birkeland and Hyde , took up the problem . With the greater water-power available in Norway , and with abundant capital from Europe , they have had enormous success . Before the Panama Canal was opened their ships with nitrogen fertilizer sailed from Norway around Cape Horn and past Chile to the west coast of the United States with their product . They make a combination of nitrogen with lime for fertilizer . Then the Germans took hold of it , and we shall see what happened . The results are not due to any special superiority of German chemists over others . The merit of a chemist depends upon the man , not his nationality . We may hold this fact to be self-evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not seem to have grasped it yet . Of course there are more chemists in Germany than there are elsewhere in proportion to the population , and I think it true that the profession has a better social standing there than in other countries . This may sound like tea-parties and dances , but it means directorates and banking connec-8o MORE ABOUT AIR tions . The main feature , however , is that German business men are not afraid of that bugaboo of his American cousin , to-wit , " the theorist . " American capitalists will take up an engineering problem and look over blue-prints and plotted curves which they do not completely understand , but which they will try to grasp , and as soon as they get the idea of what is to be accomplished and a theory of the method , down comes the telephone receiver , and a syndicate is formed . The money is straightway available . If the problem is a chemical one , it has been his habit to close his mind and his eye and to have nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposal with the same lively curiosity and interest that he would display in response to a proposal in engineering . The result is that the American business man has neither experience in , nor knowledge of , chemistry . He can not tell one chemist from another . He does n't even know where to go to find out . Not long ago some Eastern capitalists took under consideration a large investment in a chemical works engaged in the utmost niceties of chemical manufacture . The processes were involved and exceedingly complex . So , in order to get at the bottom facts concerning the industry and the way the problems were met , they sent a civil engineer out to examine it . They might as well have sent a dentist ! Now let us get at the way the Herren Doctoren Haber and le Rossignol solved their part of the problem . There is very little water-power in Germany , but catalysis is an art , and it is available everywhere . They knew , as every chemist has known for years , that if three volumes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vessel and an electric spark is passed through the mixed gases , a little // ammonia will be formed . Ammonia is three hydrogen atoms hooked on to one nitrogen atom . Its symbol is NIL . Not much ammonia will be formed , though , and for this reason : at the temperature of the elec-tric spark , nitrogen and hydrogen will unite to form ammonia , but , at the same time , ammonia is not stable at that temperature . It will decompose into nitrogen and hydrogen . It is reversible reaction , because it works both ways . It is expressed as follows : But they did not want a reversible reaction ; they wanted the straight reaction , one in which the arrow points in one direction only , and not both ways . So they conceived the happy idea of sending one part of nitrogen and three parts of hydrogen through tubes containing various metals with a view to getting the metals to act as catalysts . Osmium and uranium did it . Details of the process are secret , but by 1913 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in full operation at Ludwigshafen . The nitrogen is obtained by making liquid air and distilling it off while the hydrogen is obtainable in many ways . This gave Germany all the combined nitrogen it might care to produce by adding the units already established , in the form , you observe , of ammonia . It never rains but it pours . When one process is developed , another is likely to follow shortly after- // ward . An American chemist , Willson , started to make calcium carbide years ago at Niagara Falls by treating coke and quicklime in an electric current . It takes considerable power to bring this about , but only one-fifth as much as is required to fix atmospheric nitrogen by the Norwegian process . Calcium carbide is a very widely known chemical to-day , and is used to make acetylene gas for lighting houses , for automobile lights , and for enriching city gas . The reaction is very simple ; put water on it , and the product is acetylene gas and slacked lime . Now we shall strike a very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invention is started in one country and developed in another . Here we have calcium carbide , developed in the United States . Then two German chemists , Frank and Caro , discovered that if you heat this carbide and run a current of nitrogen over it , the nitrogen will combine with it and you have calcium cyanamide , which is an excellent nitrogen fertilizer . Let 's put these two reactions down : The extra carbon is burned away in the heat , and the cyanamide fertilizer was made in large quantities in Germany . Now we come to a third reaction that has been known for a long time ? that superheated steam passed // over calcium cyanamide gives as the resultant prod-ucts carbonate of lime , or limestone , and ammonia . Here is the reaction : So here were two methods of making ammonia , and from the way in which the output of calcium cyanamide has increased in Germany , from 50,000 tons annually before the war to 600,000 tons in i916 , it would appear that the cyanamide process is the cheaper one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out a method of turning the base ammonia into nitric acid , also by catalysis . Nitric acid is one nitrogen , one hydrogen , and three oxygen atoms in the molecule , and Professor Ostwald found that by passing ammonia and oxygen through tubes filled with finely divided platinum the following reaction takes place : Nitric acid is the one thing most especially needed to make explosives . By 1915 Germany within her own borders had developed the art of making all things needful for munitions of war except copper and cotton . Without these processes the war could not have lasted over a year , despite the enormous stores of Chilean nitrate that were on hand . Indeed , it was these four processes of Willson , of Haber and le Rossignol , of Frank and Caro , and of Ostwald that have made the // war endure . Courage would have been of no avail without them . Very lately Prof. John E. Bucher , of Providence , Rhode Island , has proposed a new method . His work is based on the fact that nitrogen will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron as a catalyst and produce the cyanide , a combination , for instance , of sodium , carbon , and nitrogen , NaCN . He brings soda ash and powdered coal together with powdered iron or iron ore either will do ? in a furnace , runs air through it at a moderately high temperature , and the result is sodium cyanide , with the iron uncombined . No electric power is needed , no heavy outlay , no costly materials ; the whole process , apparently , may be carried out almost anywhere at a very low cost . Of course everybody knows that cyanide of soda is not a thing to fool with ; that it is a deadly poison . But by treating it with steam the products become sodium bicarbonate and ammonia . Engineering details still need to be worked out , and nothing can be called a success until it succeeds in practice , but it is not more than fair to say that Doctor Bucher is busy at them . If the difficulties are overcome , it bids fair to make us all sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combinations of this absurd element with hydrogen and see what results we get . I do not know why nitrogen behaves so . There is ammonia , NH3 . It has an avidity for water which is almost insatiate . But when you have NH3 dissolved in water ( H20 ) you have n't exactly what you might think you have . As soon as the ammonia reaches water , or as soon as you start a chemical reaction going , the nitrogen in the ammonia molecule brings its two extra hooks or bonds into play , the // molecule of ammonia combines with a molecule of water , and we have ammonium hydroxide , or NH4OH . Let us put it down graphically : Here you get a radical or tail of oxygen and hydro gen just like the OH radical in caustic soda or caustic potash , and it behaves that way ! It acts just like a metal , but like a metal with one bond . I ) rive it out of such a combination , and we shall find that , the nitro gen has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonia behaves like the iiietals , we should expect it to have no special affinity for them . But here we should be wrong again , for it attacks metals with energy , just as an acid does , giving up its hydrogen and forming nitrides of metals . That ide in nitride , you may recall , indicates direct , combi nations of a metal with nitrogen . Nitrogen makes other compounds with hydrogen , foolish compounds which it has no business to make , such as hydrazine , N2H4 , and hydrazoic acid , N3H , all bristling with un satisfied bonds . Hydrazoic acid is unstable , and very explosive as well . With oxygen it forms N20 , or nitrous oxide , which is laughing-gas , and is largely used as an anesthetic . There is nitric oxide , NO , which is unstable , and com bines immediately with more oxygen to form nitro gen dioxide , NO2 , which is a reddish gas and violently poisonous . Then we come to nitric acid anhydrid , N206 , which , with one molecule of water ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( HNO3 ) , one of the most powerful acids known : N205 + H2O = 2HNO3 " Acids , " says the definition , " have one or more hydrogen atoms that can be replaced by metals . " All right ; there 's nitric acid , but there 's ammonia , NH3 , too , which is not an acid . Then there 's the opposite : " Bases , or alkalies , include compounds of the general type of metal having an OH radical . " Very well ; there is ammonium hydroxide , NH4OH . But why does nitrogen work both ways ? From the standpoint of a lazy , old-fashioned chemist , I should say that nitrogen has no chemical conscience whatever . Since nitric acid has so much to do with explosives , we might as well consider a little about them at this point . An explosive is a substance that is capable of liberating large quantities of gas as a result of very rapid chemical action . The gases set free by the ex-plosion of gunpowder occupy about three hundred times the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expands these gases many times more . In gunpowder the carbon and oxygen atoms that unite to form carbonic-acid gas and other bodies are in different molecules , and the explosion , while instanta-neous in appearance , is not so rapid as dynamite . In nitroglycerin all the atoms are in the same mole-cule , which disintegrates as follows : These gases take up twelve thousand times the volume of nitroglycerin in the dynamite , and by the heat produced are expanded nearly eight times farther . So one cubic inch of it expands about nine thousand times in an instant . No wonder it shakes things up . HERE is a family of elements , legitimately con-nected according to the Periodic Law , that be-have just as a family of persons or elements should behave . We are wont to attribute to men and women having auburn hair a certain quickness in response to a stimulus . This is a distinct quality of tile halo-gens . As the persons we have in mind grow older we observe that they usually grow more sedate and circumspect . As the halogens increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their reactions . Young persons adorned with Tit ian locks , if they be maids or young matrons , are likely to wear green gowns . We shall find this taste in color also indicated among the halogens . They are fluorine , chlorine , bromine , and iodine . Their atomic weights are , in the order named , 19 , 3 5 r z 8o , and 127 . In the same order they are gas , a gas twice as heavy , a liquid , and a solid . In color they are , also in the same order , greenish yellow , yel-lowish green , brown , and violet-black . All of them have one hook or affinity . All of them combine with // hydrogen and produce acids , and , in the order of their atomic weights , their liking for hydrogen decreases . Bring fluorine and hydrogen together , even in the dark , and they will combine to HF , or hydrofluoric acid , with explosive violence . The real acid would be hydrogen fluoride , HF , with water , H2O ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen atom becomes ionized , we call HF hydrofluoric acid , HCl hydrochloric acid , etc . Chlorine and hydrogen will unite under the influence of light . Bromine will unite with hydrogen if passed through a heated tube containing platinum gauze . It takes still more heat in the presence of platinum black to do the same with iodine . Then , again , fluorine will drive chlorine out of combination with hydrogen and take its place . Chlorine will do the same to bromine , and bromine to iodine . Compounds of iodine with hydrogen are not very stable , but you can hardly drive fluorine and hydrogen apart ? until HF meets something that fluorine likes better , as , for instance , an alkali , a metal , or a salt with a weak acid . Then the hydrogen is dropped , and the fluorine goes at it . We might say that fluorine is the young devil , and iodine is the they develop three , five , and even seven bonds for combining . This does not appear to be the case with fluorine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we do not know much about that yet . The family relations toward oxygen are the very opposite . Fluorine does not combine with it . Chlorine does , but the compounds are very unstable . Chlorate of potash , for instance , gives off its oxygen with explosive violence in the presence of a reducing agent . O. compounds of bromine are more stable than those // of chlorine , and those of iodine are more stable still . With sulphur they behave in a somewhat similar manner . All the halogens are lively in their reactions , fluorine being the liveliest , and iodine the least so . Fluorine , because it bites its way through glass and destroys tissues with such avidity that it is one of the rankest of poisons , is no laboratory favorite . Of all the elements it has the strongest tendency to form compounds . It is found in nature mostly in rocks , in combination with calcium as fluorspar . Its principal use is for etching glass . The process is interesting . The glass vessel which is to be etched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fluorine or by hydrofluoric acid . The desired figures are drawn in the wax , leaving the glass bare wherever the lines are . Sulphuric acid will drive fluorine out of fluorspar , producing sulphate of calcium , or gypsum , on the one hand , and hydrofluoric acid on the other . The glass is attacked wherever a line is drawn , or wherever the wax is scraped off . An opaque surface is produced . If the hydrofluoric acid is dissolved in water , and the glass , prepared in the same way , is clipped into the solution , the acid will bite out a shiny and transparent groove wherever the glass is exposed . Ammonium fluoride ( NH4F ) is generally employed in the place of fluorspar in the glass industry . Another use for this product is to eat the silicates out of straw and then limber it up so that it may be woven into straw hats . Chlorine is the famous member of the family . It is of very widespread occurrence . In combination with sodium , one atom of each in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is what we know as salt , common salt , table salt , and we must have it . // When it is scarce we prize it , and when it is lacking we will brave almost any danger to get it . I do not know what its function is in the process of digestion , but it is probable that the hydrochloric acid which we have in our stomachs is prepared from salt in one of that series of co-ordinated chemical factories that each of us has in his body . Chlorine is everywhere in varying quantities ? in rocks , in the earth , in the sea , and deposited in the beds , far under the earth , of ex tinct salt lakes . Nature does not perform a cycle with salt ; it washes it into the sea and lets it stay there . The actual process seems to be that the so dium is carried to the sea mostly in the form of the sulphate , and the calcium or lime as a chloride , and a shift in the acids takes place after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcium sul phate or gypsum , and the sodium sulphate becoming sodium chloride . The sea is growing richer and the earth is growing poorer in salt . But we need not worry about it . Salt is the raw material for the great soda industry , which we shall treat of in another chapter . It is also used to drive other bodies out of solution in chemical industry . Like all other members of the family , chlorine com bines with hydrogen as hydrochloric acid or , as it is often called , muriatic acid , one atom of each in the molecule , or HC1 . It is , as we have mentioned before , not really an acid until water is brought to it , so that the proper formula would be But we write it HCl because the water stays water and the one H ion of HC1 does the business . HC1 is // a gas , very soluble in water , and is a very strong acid . It is very widely used to produce metallic chlorides . Many metals are dissolved by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grape sugar works take large quantities to neutralize the lime in the process . Some steel-makers use it for " pickling , " or eating off the oxides , or rust , from manufactured steel , although sulphuric acid is more frequently employed for this purpose . Chlorine combines with oxygen , always to form acids . The natural combination is one atom of oxygen to two of chlorine ( because of the oxygen 's two hooks and the chlorine 's one ) , or chlorine monoxide , C12O . This is a brownish gas , very dangerous and very explosive , breaking up easily into its component parts . Mix it with water and you get a solution of hypochlorous acid , in which a molecule of water will combine with a molecule of the chlorine monoxide to form two molecules of hypochlorous acid . This may explain it : It can not be separated , but its salts are known , and they are great bleaching agents . The reason why is because it gives off oxygen so easily . Thus potassium hypochlorite , KC1O , becomes potassium chloride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 0 to get at its favorite , K , which it likes better than O. There are a number of other combinations of chlorine with oxygen , all of them acids , and there is always the likelihood of the oxygen atoms wandering away to any other mate that they can find . A neat little experiment to show this is to mix some powdered sugar and some chlorate // of potash together , carefully , and then add a drop or two of concentrated sulphuric acid . The whole mass will immediately burst into flame , because the sulphuric acid will drive the chlorine dioxide from the chlorate of potash , and chlorine dioxide will not endure for a minute if there is anything as easy to oxidize as sugar at hand . Sugar is composed of carbon , hydrogen , and a little oxygen . One of the chief uses of all of these halogen compounds with oxygen is as oxidizing agents . Oxygen does not seem to feel comfortable when combined directly with a halogen . The greatest use of chlorine in a free state or loosely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , theoretically , is that one molecule ( or two atoms ) of chlorine gas and one molecule of water unite to form two molecules of hydrochloric acid ( I-IC1 ) and set free one atom of oxygen . But chlorine , as well as hydrochloric acid , eats into and disintegrates fiber , so that laundries which use this easy bleaching agent have become the bane of the man with shirts and the distress of the housewife with her weekly wash . Washing clothes is a chemical problem , by no means made perfect as yet , although progress has been and is being continually made . What bids fair to be an even greater use is in the disinfection of drinkingwater . Very small quantities of it will effectively destroy bacterial life by oxidation , as we have explained , even in the effluent from sewage . Now that the electrolytic method of producing soda has made chlorine plentiful , and since it is easily liquefied ( by cooling and compressing ) and shipped in convenient cylinders , there is no more excuse for the spread of epidemics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large municipal // water-supply will effectively chlorinate every bit that is used . The effluents from sewage-disposal plants , if treated with chlorine , may be safely allowed to flow into rivers without fear of contaminating the water . In his work on Municipal Chemistry , Professor Baskerville brought out , several years ago , the value that minute quantities of chlorine would have if added to the water with which streets are flushed . It was later urged by Albert H. Hooker in his book on Chloride of Lime and Sanitation . Here we have the greatest disinfectant known to man , at once cheap and available . And we have in the dust of our streets the bacilli of tuberculosis , tetanus , and the germs that are said to be active in spreading coughs and colds , besides a lot more of the kind . But so far as I know the sprinkling of streets of a city with chlorinated water has never been thoroughly tried out yet . Bromine is used in medicines , the many bromides having the effect of inducing sleep . Compounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iodine is principally used in medicine and also in laboratories as a reagent in analysis . There is a very large quantity of it contained in seaweed , and the new potash industry of the Pacific coast , whereby potash is extracted from giant seaweed or kelp , will probably be glad to hear of a good process whereby iodine may be extracted economically as a by-product . SULPHUR is related to oxygen under the Periodic Law , although it does not look like it or smell like it or make combinations that resemble those of oxygen in appearance ; it is only when we consider them chemically that we note the cousinship . We shall touch upon these resemblances as we pass them by . Sulphur , like certain other elements that we shall consider later , displays what are rather awkwardly called " allotropic modifications . " We have spoken of the personal quality of matter , especially within the domain of catalysis , and here we have another manifestation that indicates how like persons matter is . Many books besides Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde have been written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now allotropy is this multiple personality in elements . We recall how oxygen is a gas of the air , and that the same oxygen may become ozone . The same holds true of sulphur . It may be crystalline , and as such it crystallizes into // two forms . It occurs in an amorphous state as a powder , and as a liquid it has two forms ? that of a mobile liquid and that of a viscid one . All the time it is sulphur , chemically pure sulphur , and nothing else . We know how to bring these changes in form about , and there is probably some regrouping of the atoms in the molecules which causes the changes . Sulphur , like oxygen , has two hooks or affinities to combine with other atoms ; but , unlike oxygen , if it needs more than two it displays four , and in still other combinations it avails itself of six . I do not know of any relation between the number of hooks an element shows for combining and its allotropic modifications . Sulphur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are called sill Ali des . In Louisiana and Texas there are enormous deposits of this element in a free state deep under the quicksand , and most of the supply for the United States comes from this source . It is obtained by the process devised by the late Herman Frasch , who sank through the sand a six-inch , a three-inch , and a one-inch pipe , one inside of the other , and through the six-inch pipe he forced water , superheated and under pressure of one hundred pounds per square inch . Through the three-inch pipe he drove hot , compressed air , and this , mingling with the sulphur which the superheated water had melted , caused it to flow up through the one-inch pipe . A screen at the bottom of the oneinch pipe keeps the earth out , and very pure sulphur comes up , is cast in tanks , and housed in great blocks . In Europe the chief source of supply is Mount Etna , in Sicily , and it is also found in extinct volcanoes in Japan . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as oxygen does , we can see what a vast number of sulphur compounds are possible . And it can produce more different kinds of evil-smelling combinations than any other element . Just as oxygen and hydrogen combine to produce water , H2O , so sulphur and hydrogen combine to produce hydrogen sulphide , 112S , which is a gas and smells like rotten eggs . Sulphur unites with the halogens somewhat after the manner of oxygen , but with entirely different results . There is , for instance , the chloride , S2C12i which is a liquid with a nasty odor and has the capacity to dissolve sulphur . The bichloride , SC12 , is also known , as well as is the tetrachloride , SC14 , and there are other halogen compounds . With the metals it unites directly to form sulphides , just as oxygen forms oxides . Some of these sulphides of metals are the crystalline iron pyrites , copper pyrites , cinnabar ( mercury sulphide ) , galenite or galena ( lead sulphide ) , zinc-blende ( zinc sulphide ) , which are well known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination with iron , as the amorphous sulphide of iron , it is a powder without any mechanical qualities . Sulphur makes iron brittle when present even in very small quantities . Coal that contains too much sulphur ruins boilers and grate-bars ; in fact , sulphur is a great nuisance in fuel . With carbon it combines to produce carbon bisulphide , CS2 , which will dissolve sulphur and rubber and which in the impure commercial state smells like destruction . One whiff of it is enough to fix it in memory . It is used as an insecticide , and in chemical industry to produce carbon tetrachloride , in the production of artificial silk and for other purposes . r , It is with oxygen , however , that sulphur forms the // compounds which bring it into most frequent com mercial use . There are four of them known : Of these we shall consider only two , the dioxide and the trioxide , and this brings us to the consideration of what we may call the Old Horse of Chemistry , or sulphuric acid . When yob. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your bath , you use a nickel-plated faucet which required sulphuric acid in its manufacture . Your tub , if it be enameled , has met sulphuric acid before it became what it is ; and if it is an old-fashioned one of tin , plated on sheet copper , it needed even more sulphuric acid before it took its place in civilization as a bath-tub . The water in which you bathe has probably been treated with sulphate of copper to clear it of algae . The towel with which you dry your-self has met sulphuric acid before you bought it , and the soap-maker possibly found it necessary to use some in the preparation of your soap . The bristles of your hair-brush have been treated with it , and the back of your brush , as well as your comb , if they be of celluloid , could not be produced without it . Your razor , before it reached its present high estate , may have been pickled in sulphuric acid after it was an nealed . As you put on your underwear you may recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thread before it was knit or woven , or upon the fabric afterward . As you button up your outer garments you may be reminded also that sulphuric acid was // needed in scouring the wool , in making the dye , and in the process of dyeing the cloth . The button-maker needed some before your buttons were complete . The tanner needed some in making the leather for your shoes , and it is also used to produce shoe-polish . The cushion upon which you may rest your pious knees in your devotions has met sulphuric acid in one way or another more than once before it reached its present dignity . At breakfast your cup and saucer may have come into being without the aid of sulphuric acid , but only provided they are plain white . To produce the constituents of aqua regia , which dissolved the gold for gilt ornamentation , sulphuric acid was used . The silver of which your spoon , knife , and fork are made may come from a smelter which has first burned the sulphurous ore and made sulphuric acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were plated in a sulphuric-acid bath . The farmer who raised the wheat of which your rolls are made probably used acid phosphate on his land to encourage the wheat to grow . Acid phosphate is phosphate rock treated with sulphuric acid . The paper-maker needed some sulphonated aniline blue to tint your morning paper , even if he used no sulphite pull ) , and it would be a rare ink that is innocent of the touch of sulphuric acid at some point in its history . If you eat buckwheat-cakes and syrup , the syrup needed it , and as for your artificial light , if you get up early enough to need it , you would be driven back to candles if it were not for this product . It is needed in the refining of kerosene and gasolene , and as for your electric light , brought to you by currents of electricity through copper wires ? where would the electric-light industry be with- // out copper ? And where would the copper industry be without the electrolytic process of refining , which requires enormous quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have heard of the embarrassment of industry by the lack of German dyes , but that is a mere bagatelle compared with the general break-up that would follow a dearth of sulphuric acid . ) We can neither go to war and have smokeless powder nor can we live in peace without it . Wherever you go in civilization you can not get out of its path . You may never see it , you may not know its qualities and its very remarkable chemical personality , and you had better not touch it , but almost invariably it has been around before you . All of this will explain but a fraction of the allpervasive ubiquity of sulphuric acid in the arts of what we call civilization . And its use is growing along with the development of chemical industry and the science of agriculture . It has been known as a commercial product in the United States since 1793 . The first step in the process of making it is to burn sulphur . When you burn sulphur you produce a gas containing one atom of sulphur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choking smell of this gas ; you used to produce it every time you lighted an old-fashioned sulphur match . It is easy enough to produce it on a small scale , but when it comes to doing this very thing on a large scale , and measuring the units by the ton , it will be seen that even here there are engineering problems involved that are far from easy . And we have n't sulphuric acid yet , by long odds . We have with our two atoms of oxygen to one of sulphur the anhydrid of sulphurous acid , the first zoo SULPHURIC ACID step in the process : what we are after is the anhydrid of sulphuric acid ; we must worry another atom of oxygen into that molecule and make SO3 instead of SO2 . If we leave it by itself an indefinite time and allow plenty of air to weaken it , it will change over as we want it to , but we never could make a com mercial product that way . No , we must introduce an oxygen-carrier into the chamber that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will not only give up an atom of oxygen , but find a taker in each molecule of SO2 . Oxides of nitrogen will do this , and then get back the oxygen they have lost from the air , so that they may be used over again and again with very slight loss . That is the way we get our SO3 in the old chamber process which we shall now describe . As the first step , either sulphur is burned or the sulphurous ore is roasted and the fumes of SO2 are passed first through a dust-flue and then through what is called a Glover tower , the purpose of which is to get a thorough mixture of the gases wanted . This is a tower filled with lumps of inert material , and there trickles down through the tower sulphuric acid con taining oxides of nitrogen which are dissolved in it . The sulphurous fumes ascend against this stream , carry along the oxides of nitrogen , and proceed into great leaden chambers . Steam is blown into the chambers at various points . Here a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NO , unites with the oxygen of the air to form nitrogen peroxide , NO2 . Then EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY and then , again and the cycle is complete . So we have sulphuric acid on the floor of the chambers , and the gaseous oxides of nitrogen , which must not be lost , mixed with air . From the last chamber the gases are led into a tall Gay-Lussac tower , filled with coke , and over which , from the top downward , there trickles concentrated ( 78 per cent. ) sulphuric acid . This dissolves the oxides of nitrogen , but not the air , which passes out through the stack . The concentrated acid with the oxides of nitrogen dissolved in it is then pumped over from the bottom of the Gay-Lussac tower to the top of the Glover tower , where it proceeds to give up the oxides that it has in solution , just as described above , and this process goes on over and over again . The sulphuric acid taken from the chambers is of about 65 per cent . strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water in pans made of a very high silicon iron . There is no such trouble in getting water attached to the SO3 molecule as we had in getting that extra atom of oxygen into it . The trouble is to keep the water away . The acid that comes out of the leaden chambers is strong enough for use in some industries ( for instance , to produce acid phosphate for fertilizers ) , but it is not strong enough for general commercial purposes . Not all the water is boiled off in the con centrating - pans ; you can not produce a loo per cent . H2SO4 by this concentrating process , but it is made strong enough for a great many purposes ? for most purposes , in fact . IO2 SULPHURIC ACID Dilute sulphuric acid must not be shipped in iron conta , ners because it will eat right through the iron , whereas strong sulphuric acid may be shipped in tank-cars if the necessary precautions are taken to keep water out . This , according to a plausible theory , is because the salts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iron walls that contain it , are very soluble in water , but insoluble in strong sulphuric acid , and thus make a protective coating to the inside of the walls which cease to be protective as soon as the solvent water is introduced . The contact process is an achievement in catalysis and is a development of the last twelve or fifteen years , so far as practice is concerned . It consists in inducing the sulphurous fumes ( SO2 ) to unite with oxygen of the air and form SO3 in the presence of one or more catalysts . The pyrites are roasted , and the cinder , consisting chiefly of iron oxides , but also some oxides of copper , arsenic , and other metals , are used as the first step in which about one-half of the SO2 ( mixed with air ) is converted to SO3 . This is a black , dirty gas , mixed SO2 , SO3i CO2 , 02 , and N2 . From this point it is cooled and cleaned and scrubbed according to the process employed and the conditions at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mat-ter is obtained . This is especially necessary be-cause the remaining half of the SO2 is still to be con verted to SO3 , and the slightest amount of arsenic or any of a number of foreign substances or dust will " poison " the catalyst so that it will not do its work . So far is this purification carried that among the great est producers the gas will stand the Tyndall test ; that is , that a beam of very concentrated light passed through a dark chamber containing it will not show a particle of dust . When we think of the myriads of // dust particles we see if a beam of ordinary daylight is let into any living-room that is darkened , we can imagine how well this work of purification has been done . The gases are then passed over devices containing platinized asbestos , and by the time this process is completed practically all the SO2 is converted to SO3 . From this point the process is very like the old one ; the SO3 is caught tip by strong sulphuric acid , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . H2SO4 , but zoo per cent . sulphuric acid will also dissolve the anhydrid . Let us get this a little clearer . Si ) : , you recall , is the anhydrid which with water , II20 , produces the acid H2SO4 . If you have an acid that is ( ) o per cent . sulphuric acid and ro per cent . water , then , as SO3 is added to it , the acid will gradually become ' co per cent . sulphuric acid . As soon as this stage is passed and we have what is known as free anhydrid dissolved in the sulphuric acid , it is called oleum . This is likely to have about 20 per cent . free anhydrid . If the anhydrid only is wanted ? i.e. , the fuming , solid SO3 , without any H2SO4 in it ? the SO ; , is usually distilled off from the oleum by gentle heating . Some claim that the contact process will in time supplant the chamber process , and I think it likely , in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ideal conditions and flawless management , it should cost no more to make , say , 97 per cent . sulphuric acid by the contact process than 65 per cent . chamber acid . But it takes years to achieve a very high degree of administrative efficiency , and the process is more delicate , and there are patents covering all sorts of steps in it , and royalties must be paid ? and the chamber process is easy . I think the chamber process will still be in operation when many SULPHURIC ACID of the young fellows of to-day will be referred to as graybeards . Lately the United States Department of Agriculture has proposed still another method that is similar to the old one , except that instead of great leaden chambers for the reaction , it is proposed to use coils of lead pipe . The laboratory tests are promising , but no large-scale tests have been made , and the proportion of surface to volume is so different in laboratory tests from that in practice that a great deal must be done before it is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This heavy , oily fluid , also known as oil of vitriol , that destroys nearly everything with which it comes in contact , is like fire or water or electricity ? a good servant but a bad master . And yet it is about the safest and most biddable chemical we know , considering its strength . And in its strength is its greatest usefulness . We do not employ a Percheron stallion to draw a baby-carriage , and yet the Percheron stallion is just what we do want for a heavy load on a bad road . Now sulphuric acid is one of the great dray-horses of chemistry . But if we carry the equine simile any further we shall get into difficulties , for the main business of sulphuric acid is to bite into things chemically and play hobs generally , under control . All of its get , its progeny , its colts , or , more properly speaking , the sulphates and sulpho-conjugations , are not soluble in water , but so many of them are that it is fair to say that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make things over so that they will dissolve in water . Phosphate rock is thus made more available in practice for the soil . Being an acid , it will neutralize alkali , and a new use for great quantities of acid produced from smelter fumes in the 105 104 EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY West has lately been proposed in the reclamation of alkali deserts . The founders of the Chemical National Bank of New York many years ago started in business making sulphuric acid . In those days it was made according to a " formula " or recipe : burn so much sulphur , and do thus and so according to rule and gather in your product . There were difficulties of transportation and in manufacture because sometimes the chambers would become sick and not perform their allotted tasks , while the demand for the product was irregular and slight . So the proprietors closed out their business , and , having a charter bounded h a a , rc 1l y short of their imagination , they started a bank . Now the career of that bank has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound business methods that we are bound to rejoice that the Chemical Bank was duly started . But those interested in chemical industry can not wholly free themselves from the wish that the same talent for organization and the same high character which qualified those men for banking might have remained to hell , along the chemical industry in this country in the clays of its struggles . We might have been further ahead than we are now . I have intimated that sulphuric acid is the old horse of chemistry . Then soda would l. ) e the old mare . And there is lime . Lime , let us say , is the mule , which carries off great loads of waste . Before we give up the subject we must consider a little trick that sulphur has in working its way into molecules , very like the way of oxygen in oxidation . For instance , a sulphurous acid salt , if left in the air long enough , will go over , by oxidation , into a sulphuric acid salt : too SULPHUR COMPOUNDS Now , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the sulphur will work its way into the molecule in the same way , and we have : There are other ways of doing this , but we shall not discuss them . The point is , we have what the name implies , a sulpho-sulphate , because the prefix thio is taken from the Greek word ? c ov ( theion ) , which means sulphur . Thiosulphuric acid is not known in a free state , but we have its salts . The sodium thiosulphate is called by photographers hyposulphite of soda , or " hypo , " and is used to dissolve the chloride or bromide of silver from those places on the photographic plate where it is not wanted . We shall see how useful it is when we consider photography . It forms a soluble silver sodium thiosulphate as follows : The element selenium is very like sulphur in its reactions . It is also , like sulphur , known in various forms or modifications . It is a brick-red powder , a black , brittle , glassy mass , a red crystalline form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the deposits of Glover towers and chambers of sulphuric acid I07 EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY works , and it has been found in meteoric iron . Its chief claim to fame is that in the metallic form it conducts electricity very much better in the light than it will in the dark . This has led to numerous inventions and some curious apparatus , among others the " electric dog " of J. H. Hammond , Jr. , of Gloucester , Massachusetts . A little four - wheeled wagon is equipped with a chemical battery , and selenium resistance coils are placed back of glass lights which are supposed to represent eyes . If a strong light is thrown upon them , this turns the selenium resistance coils into a conductor , and the " dog " speeds forward and follows the light , being propelled ' by a storage battery which it contains . The light causes the selenium coils to conduct the current from the battery to the motor . The commercial supply of selenium is obtained from the electrolytic copper refineries . The present American production is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely used to give a red color to glass ( for railroad signal-lights , etc. ) , and it is also employed to overcome the green color of glass . Selenite of soda is used to impart a bright red color to enamels . Selenium is also used to a limited extent in medicine and bacteriology . PHOSPHORUS belongs to the same group as nitrogen . It is not found in a free state in nature because of its marked a ( iinity for oxygen . It has , like nitrogen , sometimes three hooks and some-times five , according to its pleasure . When driven out of combination it is a heavy , crystalline solid , yellowish in color , and it melts at 440 and boils at 2900 centigrade . In this form it is a rank poison . But if we heat it in a closed vessel it turns into a reddish brown powder which is stable and inert and has little poisonous action , because of the difficulty of absorption . There is an intermediate scarlet phos phorus , and yet another violet or black modification , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as we observed in sulphur , and showing different phases of the same substance . Phosphorus combines with hydrogen to produce phosphine , PH3 , just as nitrogen produces ammonia , NH3 . Phosphine is a very poisonous gas and has a disagreeable odor , something like spoiled fish . Just // as ammonia , NIl3i dissolved in water , H2O , produces ammonium hydroxide , NH4OH , which is known only by its salts , so we get with phosphine , PH3i in water , H2O , phosphonium , PH4OH , which is also known only in its salts ; that is , no one has ever succeeded in producing by itself either ammonium , NH4OH , or phosphonium , PH40H , although there arc plenty of salts in which an acid radical takes the place of the OH . Phosphonium is not so strongly alkaline as ammonium . Then there is a metaphosphoric acid , 11P03i just like nitric acid , HNO3 , but an entirely different product , and by no means so strong an acid . A more important compound with oxygen is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluminous , snow-like mass , which takes up water to produce orthophosphoric , or , as it is generally called , phosi ) boric acid , H3PO4 . This pentoxide is the most powerful dryer known . It will absorb water , if present in sufficient quantity , down to one milligram of water in forty thousand liters of air . About one-tenth of I per cent . of good soil is phosphate , and plants need it . So do animals . As plants exhaust it from the soil it needs to be replaced , and from this requirement comes the great phosphate fertilizer industry . The effect of phosphates upon plant growth seems to be to increase the prolificacy and to hasten the maturity of the crops . The exact role that it plays is still rather vague , but its effect is seen in increased crops . There are in the United States vast deposits of minerals , chiefly in the form of various phosphates of calcium . They are found in South Carolina , in Florida , in Kentucky , Wyoming , and elsewhere . This country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it to Europe in IIO normal times . To prepare it for fertilizer the rock is ground fine and treated with about an equal weight of sulphuric acid . The product is called " acid phosphate " in the fertilizer industry and is applied to renew the phosphorus taken from the soil by plants . We have had the curious situation in this country of the manufacturers of acid phosphate urging the farmer to buy their product as the thing most needful , the German Kali Syndicate urging potash upon the farmer as that for which his plants do most ravenously hunger , and the Chilean nitrate people pressing upon the bewildered husbandman his need of fixed nitrogen . That situation has improved somewhat , and at the time of the present writing , when there is a potash famine in the land , it is doubtful if very much phosphate or nitrate is offered as a substitute for potash . The mining and sale of phosphate rock is one of the great industries of the United States . The old-fashioned sulphur matches were made by dipping the sticks first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing yellow phosphorus , an oxidizing agent and a gum to protect the phosphorus from the air and to keep the mass together . Enough heat was generated by rubbing the tip against any rough surface to start the reaction between the phosphorus and the oxidizing agent ( manganese dioxide , for instance ) , and that in turn set fire to the sulphur , which ignited the wood . But not only was the fire danger of these matches very great : the yellow phosphorus is a nasty poison ; the men who worked in the industry got " phossy jaw , " and died of it , and now the manufacture of such matches is forbidden by law . The new kind of " strike anywhere " matches have a tip of phosphorus sesquisulphide in place of the yellow phosphorus . From the structure of these III EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY matches , with the ignition surface spreading over the tip of the match instead of enveloping the end , the fire hazard is lessened . Safety matches are made of potassium chlorate , powdered glass , rosin , glue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sides of the box . It is a pleasure to record that the manufacture of matches , involving as it does the use of phosphorus , has changed entirely so far as it has come within the hands of certain great administrators . It is not many years ago that to work in a match-factory was a job that any man might dread . Phosphorus is a nasty poison , and its effects are cumulative and cruel . By the substitution of the sesquisulphide for elemental phosphorus the hazard to health and life is removed , and one large manufacturing company , having useful patents covering the process , presented its patents to the United States Government , so that any manufacturer of matches may use them . The health record of the company 's own works is something to be proud of , and it enjoys the advantage of well-paid , satisfied , and loyal employees . Rocks containing phosphates of calcium and phosphorus in other forms are very wide-spread and are often found where they are not wanted . For instance , when they are found mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfit as a member of society . You can not make steel by the old Bessemer process unless the amount of phosphorus present is very slight , because phosphorus spoils the steel . In the open-hearth process more phosphorus can be allowed , as in this way it is boiled off . But generally speaking , phosphorus is to the metals as whisky is to man . It has its uses , but it can do all sorts of harm . A little phosphorus in iron or steel will make II2 ARSENIC it crystallize , and so it becomes brittle and generally unreliable . On the other hand , it is useful in certain alloys . Phosphor bronze , for instance , is an alloy of phosphorus , copper , and tin . It is very hard and firm , and is used in making axle bearings . But there is much more effort made to get phosphorus out of metals than there is to get it in . There used to be a tradition to the effect that phosphorus was food for the mind , because there is a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that a diet of fish was especially to be recommended because phosphorus is also found in fish , and therefore that the aspirant after intellectual life should address himself to codfish , shad , and even bullheads and suckers . The element is indeed found in fish , but chiefly as calcium phosphate in their bones . Arsenic behaves something like phosphorus in its reactions . Usually it has three hooks , but sometimes it has five , and it shows several allotropic modifications . It may appear as a gray , crystalline substance , and a good conductor of electricity , or it may take the form of yellow crystals , or of a gray , amorphous powder or a black powder . It combines with oxygen to produce oxides , and these with water form acids . With the halogens it combines every way possible , and nearly all of its combinations are poisonous . So is pure arsenic . With hydrogen it forms two combinations , the important one of which is arsine , AsH3 . It is a gas , and smells like garlic , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any length of time , for the very good reason that it is one of the rankest poisons there are , nearly as dangerous as prussic acid . Arsenic is found in nature in a free state , as an oxide II3 EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY or " white arsenic , " and in direct combination with metals as arsenides . From a chemical standpoint it is not very aggressive , and it would seem that its poisonous quality must be due to catalysis . It is found in slight quantity in many ores , but is usually distilled or sublimated off in the process of smelting . Of its two compounds with oxygen , arsenious oxide , As203 , or white arsenic , is the best known . It is used in glass-making to remove the color produced by the lower oxides of iron . It is also used in enameling , in calico-printing , for fireworks , to prevent boiler scale , for fly and rat poisons , and as a preservative for mounted birds and animals . Paris green is arsenite of copper ( CuHAsO3 ) , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular use as a paint , for coloring wall-paper , etc. , but it is such a vicious poison that its use is generally restricted in this respect . Farmers find it useful for killing potato-bugs . Arsenic in one form or another has long been a favorite medium of the poisoners , although the tests to detect it are among the most delicate known , the presence of the most minute quantities being capable of demonstration . So delicate is one test that sonietinies the slight amount contained in the glass has been partially dissolved out during the analysis , and dire confusion has resulted . The careful analyst tests his apparatus for arsenic first . As with many other poisons , one may grow accustomed to taking arsenic in increasing amounts until more than double an ordinary fatal dose is taken with impunity . The inhabitants of Styria cat it ( white arsenic ) to increase their endurance . They are said to be of fresh complexion and long-lived , but to die suddenly . It is occasionally given to horses in small quantities to improve the appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one living at a good distance away is anticipated . In alloys with metals arsenic has a tendency to make them brittle . Antimony belongs to the same group as arsenic , phosphorus , and nitrogen ; it has sometimes three hooks and sometimes five ; it has three allotropic modi fications ? it appears as a crystalline , silvery-white , brittle , metallic substance , and as a yellow , and as a gray powder . The last is known as " explosive anti mony , " and when heated or struck or scratched it changes into the crystalline form , increasing in density and with great heat . It is found in small quantities in a free state in nature , but usually as an oxide or in combination with sulphur , arsenic , and the metals . The most common form is the sulphide , called stibnite , Sb2S3 . It makes , in a general way , combinations similar to those of phosphorus and arsenic . In alloys with metals it has the general feature of making them brittle and hard , but it has the added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a molten to a solid state . In castings , therefore , a very sharp impression is produced , and its value in type-metal can be readily understood . Type-metal is composed ( subject to a considerable number of variations ) of about 50 per cent . lead , 25 per cent . antimony , and 25 per cent . tin . Babbitt metal for bearings is , according to one recipe : Britannia metal is 90 per cent . tin and zo per cent antimony . I15 EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY With copper a brittle metal is produced by alloys of increasing proportions of antimony , ranging in color from copper red to rose red and from crimson over to violet . The violet metal is an alloy of half copper and half antimony . In medicine we find antimony used in tartar emetic . This is a double salt with potash and a radical of antimony and oxygen as the two bases in combina-tion with tartaric acid . The chemical name for tartar emetic is potassium antimonyl tartrate , and the formula is K There are five elements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . By the time we reach bismuth we have a real metal . Its combinations with oxygen are bases , not acids , and it is found chiefly in a native state . It looks very like antimony , but it does not appear to be poisonous . We might say that bismuth is the old man of the family , and that he had outgrown the poisonous quality that begins with phosphorus , is at its peak in arsenic , and decreases in antimony . It is used chiefly in making alloys , and in the folin known as bismuth subnitrate it is used in medicine as an astringent and antiseptic dusting-powder . THE most frequent sign of soda that meets the American eye ? being the inviting legend dis played by apothecaries and confectioners ? does not indicate soda at all . " Ice-cold soda-water " is water charged with carbon dioxide , CO2 . It obtained its name by the old method of dissolving sodium bicar bonate in water and then liberating the gas by a mild acid such as cream of tartar . Such a preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old name holds to the water which has the bubbles but not the soda . About 214 per cent . of the crust of the earth is sodium , which makes it rank seventh in point of quantity among the elements . It has one hook , and is found chiefly as the chloride , which we have already considered under salt in connection with chlorine . It is also found as the nitrate NaNO3 in Chile saltpeter , as the sulphate Na2SO4 in Glauber 's salt , and as I17 EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY the carbonate in the alkali deserts . In cryolite , or the ice stone of Greenland , it is found as a sodium alumin-ium fluoride . It is found in countless silicates , and , as a result of rock decay , it gets into the soil and so into animal organisms . Its end product in natural processes is salt , and its habitat the sea . Sodium is not found in a free state in nature , be-cause the pure element , which is a light , silvery , white-colored , waxy metal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda : To prepare metallic sodium this process is reversed , practically , with the aid of the electric current . We say : In practice it is n't so easy . Caustic soda is heated in a tank through which an electric current passes . The metallic Na formed at the cathode is kept away from the anode by an iron net . At the anode , OH groups are liberated which yield water and oxygen , or 20H=1120+0 . The oxygen escapes , but the water goes back to the other pole , meets the metallic sodium , and produces caustic soda again : As a result , the maximum yield for a given quantity of electricity is only 50 per cent . This lust of sodium for water may be easily shown by cutting with a knife a little piece of metallic sodium from a bar and throwing it into a pail of water . It I18 THE ALKALI METALS will swim around on the surface , generating hydrogen , which escapes , and producing a solution of caustic soda in the water . It is well not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody cares to have a piece of sodium busy with water or moisture , or even a solution of caustic soda , in his eye or on his counte nance . Metallic sodium is used in metallurgy , and is kept under kerosene or in some liquid which contains no oxygen . It is in the form of the carbonate as soda or soda ash , as it is called , Na2CO3 , and as the bicarbonate NaHCO3 , and as lye or caustic soda or sodium hydrox ide , NaOH , that it finds its great use . Note , please , that sodium bicarbonate is really a kind of half-carbonate , in that to one radical of the carbonic acid we have one sodium and one hydrogen atom , whereas in the carbonate or monocarbonate there are two Na atoms . We said , in considering sulphuric acid , that if it were called the old horse of chemistry , we should have to regard soda as the old mare . It is the grand universal alkali , and it is used everywhere , constantly . A few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sadtler , elsewhere referred to , from which we shall copy : And this is only a hint of its many uses . Making soda is one of the leading chemical industries and the process always starts with salt . The old standard method of producing it was that of Nicholas le Blanc , the domestic physician to the Duke of Orleans , who in turn provided capital for the start of the industry . The French Revolution came along and left poor old Doctor le Blanc stranded , while the industry , as in dustries have a way of doing , quietly moved over to England . This is a great trick of industries which are not interested in political economy or human welfare ex cept as it may affect production . At the time of this writing there is a movement of electrochemical in dustries from Niagara Falls , where they started , to Norway , where there is cheaper power and more of it . Whether we shall continue to waste our precious power by permitting the continued waste of the wicked beehive coke-ovens , which burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conserve the power that goes to waste ; whether Niagara Falls will be turned over entirely to industry or not ; whether our conservation laws in the United States will be modified so as to permit the profitable industrial use I20 THE ALKALI METALS of available water-power sites ? are all questions that are in the air , and , while they are in process of settlement , the electrochemical industry will probably settle down somewhere and take a lead for fifty or a hundred years . The Le Blanc process consisted in treating salt with sulphuric acid , thus producing sulphate of sodium , Na2SO4 , or salt cake , as it is called . This was heated with coal and limestone ( calcium carbonate ) until the mass had fluxed , when the reaction took place . This brought the carbonic-acid radical over to the soda , and the sulphuric acid produced sulphate of lime or gypsum . The alkalies changed acids in the process . That is the reason why the soda , being obtained from the flux , obtained its name of soda ash . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was conserved as hydrochloric ( or muriatic ) acid , HC1 , and it was also used to make bleachingpowder , which is obtained by passing chlorine through a series of chambers containing slacked lime . The Le Blanc process is now nearly obsolete . In 1861 Ernest Solvay , of Brussels , patented the Ammonia Process , which is that by which the major portion of the soda used to-day is made , although we shall soon note another process , one that is crowding it whenever there is sufficient power available for electricity . In the Solvay process , common salt , NaCl , is treated with ammonium bicarbonate , or successively with ammonia and with carbonic-acid gas , at a low temperature . Sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride are formed , and the sodium bicarbonate , being nearly insoluble in a solution of ammonium chloride , NH4Cl , it precipitates out . The mother liquor is drawn off , treated with caustic lime , which frees the // ammonia , NH3 , and produces calcium chloride . The NH3 is saved , and the calcium chloride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep dusty roads moistened , because it draws water from the air . It is also used to make anti-freezing mixtures , but if any one will discover a steady use for large quantities of it he will have no trouble in getting invitations to dinner . Instead of using lime , it is possible to employ magnesia . From the magnesium chloride the chlorine may be regained by heating , and the magnesium oxide or magnesia , which is formed as soon as the chlorine leaves it , may be used over and over again . The bicarbonate of soda is changed to the carbonate by heating , and caustic soda , NaOH , is made by treating the carbonate with quicklime . It was Ernest Solvay , who had amassed great wealth from the soda industry in Europe and America , who paid the vast indemnity demanded by the Gelman invaders as their price for not destroying the city of Brussels . A still newer method , originating in America and developed by various American chemists , is the electrolytic process . It is not so simple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led into an electrolytic cell . A current of electricity is passed through which splits the Na from the Cl , each element going to its respective pole . The sodium combines with the water to produce caustic soda , as described in the beginning of this chapter , and the chlorine is saved , compressed , and cooled until a liquid condition is reached , and is then sold to bleacheries and to chemical works for chlorination processes and for the destruction of bacilli in city water . Potassium ( K , for the Latin word kalum ) is the elemental or metallic potassium , while potash is the I22 THE ALKALI METALS common term for the carbonate . The nomenclature , however , is a little loose , and " potash salts " is used to indicate salts of potassium , but chiefly the chloride . It is a very close cousin to sodium . It has also only one bond , and in a metallic state it is soft , waxy , of a silvery-white color , and changes over to the hydroxide or caustic potash , KOH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a piece thrown into water will dance about , liberating hydrogen and casting caustic potash into solution at such a lively rate that enough heat is generated to set the hydrogen afire . Potassium is not found in a free state in nature , for the obvious reason that it will not remain free , but it is very wide-spread . In the form of nitrate , KNO3 , or saltpeter , it was formerly found in deposits in India , but these have long been exhausted . They were by no means so extensive as the Chilean beds of nitrate of sodium . The great source of supply has been in the deposits of Germany , in Hanover , Westphalia , and in Alsace , and at the time of the present writing there is a serious potash famine in the United States . The situation reminds one of the old line about " Water , water everywhere , and not a drop to drink , " because there is any amount of potassium to be found in this country . The greatest supply is in the widespread mineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . K , but , alas ! it is bound up with aluminium as a double silicate , and it is insoluble . That is to say , the potash is there in the feldspar , but it is in the form of glass and pottery . So far , the only way to get it out is by the heat of the electric arc , and that takes great quantities of cheap power . This problem is sure to be solved some day ; there are patents by the hundred on various processes to do it . r23 EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY But no large plant of importance is in operation yet , nor is there , so far as we know , any in process of construction at this time . As we have said before , the American business man does not like to spend money on experiments , and every one of these processes requires factory demonstration to prove itself . And yet , so hopeful are men of the solution of this riddle that a syndicate of miners in Colorado are , at the time of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and washed feldspar against the time when somebody will appear with a successful process . There is some potash in sea-water , and the giant kelp of the Pacific coast absorbs it , so that it contains from =o to 40 per cent . of KC1 . Several large works are in process of construction in Californifi. to secure the needed potash from this giant seaweed , but these will produce only a very small fraction of the potash needed . A very interesting suggestion was lately made by a well-known chemical writer . He was visiting California , and observed the great activity in building plants for the commercial recovery of potash . Here are these big seaweeds , thought he , which take up a great deal of potash from the very small amount held in solution in the ocean . The plants do not take in sodium salt , of which there is a much greater amount in the sea . The separation is accomplished by some kind of semi-permeable membrane which lets through potash salts and iodine , but keeps the soda salts out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " What is the character of the semipermeable diaphragm , or , generally , what is the mechanism of the concentration process ? " Here is another nut to crack in physical chemistry . If the nature of the process by which the giant kelps take up the potash salts and leave the compounds of sodium // behind were known , we could put tanks with walls of such a nature into the sea and enjoy watching them fill themselves with pure solutions of potash . Then we might concentrate the liquor , crystallize out the potassium salt , dry it , sell it , and send for another box of those fifty-cent cigars . It seems likely , though , that even if we knew how to turn the trick , it would only work with dilute solutions . Then the cost of concentration might be too great for us to buy the cigars , after all . Another source of supply is in the saline deposits of dry lakes in southern Utah and California . These are being operated in a small way , but not nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German syndicate about $20 a ton to mine and prepare the muriate of potash for market , and they get about $40 a ton for it . Or , rather , that was the case before August 1 , 1914 . Since then as high as $450 a ton has been paid for it . Trees and plants must have potash . The clearest evidence that trees need it is the amount of it we find in wood ashes , in which it runs as high as 5 or 6 per cent. , despite the fact that some of it goes up in smoke . Indeed , that is where it got its English name ? the ash from under the pot . Then , to be ' scruciating elegant , we have Latinized the word to potassium . The Germans stick to the word that came from the Arabic alchemists , and call it kalium , which is related to the word alkali . Just what role potash plays in the nutrition of plants it is hard to tell . It used to be so simple to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminium ) , so much sand ( silica ) , with so much fixed nitrogen , potash , and phosphates , and nothing else . The idea was that after the chemist had done a // little fuddling with it and made his analysis , the enlightened farmer would know exactly what to do . Things are so easy when we know only a little ! Now the chemist does rightly and properly analyze soils , and the enlightened farmer is greatly helped by his results , but remember , please , that agriculture comes more properly under the head of plant physiology than under chemistry . The soil teems with life . In summer from half a million to a million bacteria are found in a single grain weight of soil . Besides bacteria , it has yeasts , molds , fungi , protozoa , arna he , nematodes , and worms . Then there is humus , which is fermenting organic matter . The nature of soils is one of the most complex of studies . There is , however , a gross chemical aspect of soils which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of fertilizers , and this we shall consider . We have discussed the need of fixed nitrogen , and we know the need of phosphoric-acid salts . What potash seems to do in the economy of plant life is to act as a catalyst in that marvelous synthetic laboratory in the plants which mates up carbon dioxide and water to sugar and starch and then to cellulose . The richer plants are in carbohydrates ( sugars , starch , etc. ) the more potash they seem to contain . It seems to aid in the growth of strong , vigorous roots and stems , and in neutralizing plant acids it appears to affect favorably the flavor of fruits . It is claimed also that plants become more resistant to disease if adequate potash is supplied . The reason why sodium may not be substituted for potassium in plant economy is possibly because the potash salts diffuse more readily through the cells than those of soda , or because of the greater liking that potash salts have for water than soda salts . The fact is , however , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success ? so far . The plants will discriminate . The natural history of potash is like that of sodium . It exists principally in the silicates , in feldspar and mica especially , and upon the decay of these minerals some of it is carried into the soil and thence to plants . They must have considerable of it for lusty growth , and , as we have intimated , many kinds of vegetation seem to need it for flavor . The legend is told by a gentleman with a lively imagination of a farmer who had a wonderful apple-orchard in which everything was done which science could provide for his trees . Finally , on the ground that a tree is , after all , only an osmotic engine , the lord of the orchard bethought himself that he could give the needed fertilizer to one of his trees by bringing the constituent parts of the needed manure or " tree food " into its circulation from a solution contained in a bottle and fed by gravity through a gimlet-hole . The tree took by gravity through the gimlet-hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its carefully balanced rations of salts in solution soon began to show results . In size , taste , and quality they outshone any apples ever grown , but , alas ! when cold weather came the tree had grown so accustomed to being fed by the bottle that its roots had atrophied , and the farmer was unable to wean it . We do not know the fate of that tree ? whether it turned out well or badly , and we never have brought ourselves to believe in it thoroughly . We fear it was cut off in the blossom of its youth . The compounds of potassium are so analogous to those of sodium that we shall not mention them in great detail . The chloride and sulphate are used for fertilizer materials , the bromide is used as a medi- // tine , largely for its sedative effect , and the iodide , like sodium iodide , is used also in medicine . The fluoride has the peculiar quality of forming the double halide FK , FH ; and the cyanide , like the cyanide of sodium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nitrate , KNO3 , is one of the constituents of gunpowder in the proportion 75 saltpeter or KNO3 , lo carbon ( charcoal ) , and 15 sulphur . When it explodes this is about what happens : This is not entirely correct , because the remaining potash is not all in the form of K2S . But the gases are chiefly CO2 and some CO . The tension of the gaseous products is about 6,500 atmospheres ( 96,000 pounds to the square inch ) and the temperature about 2,200 ? centigrade . The silicate of K is very like Na silicate . The sulphides are not very stable and oxidize easily . Lithium , sodium , and potassium constitute the prin principal members of the group known as the alkali metals , and lithium is the first of the series . None is found free in nature , all are widely distributed , but lithium is found only in small quantities . It occurs chiefly as the silicate in lepidolite or li thi a mica , as the phosphate in triphylite , and in company with Al , Na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with in the ashes of certain plants , such as tobacco , showing that it is contained in the soil . Minute traces of it are found in many minerals . Metallic lithium , prepared by electrolysis of the Its THE ALKALI METALS fused chloride , is the lightest of all solid substances except frozen hydrogen . It is but little over half the weight ( less than six-tenths ) of water , and it floats on kerosene . It is silvery white , but tarnishes rapidly on exposure to moist air . With oxygen it produces lithium oxide , Li2O , and this goes over into the hy droxide , LiOH , which dissolves in water , producing a strongly alkaline solution , like caustic soda , NaOH , or caustic potash , KOH . The chloride , LiCl , is very soluble and takes on water from the air . The carbonate , Li2CO3 , is not very soluble in water , in which it differs from the Na and K carbonates . The phosphate , Li3PO4 , shows the same peculiarity . Lithium salts are used in medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal or its com pounds at present . The other two members of the family are rubidium and crosium , which we shall not consider further than to note that they are also soft , silvery-white metals , and we mention them only to show the family rela tion , how they progress up in one respect and down in another , just like some other families of elements : ABOUT 50 per cent . of the solid crust of the globe is oxygen , and about 25 per cent . of it is silicon . But silicon is not found in a free state in nature ; it is too fond of oxygen . It belongs to the same group as carbon , and has , consequently , four hooks to the atom . It can be driven from its combi nations in the laboratory without great difficulty , but it burns back to silicon dioxide , or silica , SiO2 , at a comparatively low temperature . In a pure state it is known in three forms : as a brown amorphous powder , as graphitoidal silicon ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , iron-gray crystals ) . As silica , SiO2 , it is sand , and it constitutes from 20 to 35 per cent . of granite and primitive rock , and along with compounds of aluminium , which consti tute clay , it is the earth . It behaves like carbon in its combinations , except // that it may be said to regard this world as a cold , bleak place , and it does not care for combining much except with oxygen . It can hook up its atoms together in chains , as carbon does , and the number of imaginable silicon compounds is beyond compute ; but when the chemist with infinite pains has negotiated a number of silicon compounds that correspond to those of carbon , such as , for instance , silicon chloroform , SiIIC13 ( chloroform being CIIC13 ) ? and similar bodies , they disintegrate on contact with water or in the air and the silicon atom will yoke itself up with oxygen again to SiO2 . It may be livelier at high temperatures , but that is just where we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of this feature of the nature of silicon by quoting some verses called " The Silicon Man , " which appeared several years ago in The Percolator , issued by the Chemists ' Club of New York . The verses will hardly stand alongside of the rhapsodies of Milton , which are occasionally quoted in popular treatises on chemistry ; indeed , their feet are so shaky that they can hardly stand at all ; but they may throw a little light to the chemical imagination as to what silicon would do if it only had the temperature ? and the audience . THE SILICON MAN I saw a glowing Silicon Man Within my chamber fire , And heard him cry in agony , " More fuel , or I expire ! " So from the wood-pile I brought in Some pine and hickory , And as I fed it to the flames He straightway piped his eye . // " I am , " said he , " John Silicon , And I am so constructed That Silicon 's my substitute ; My carbon 's all deducted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That just as you of carbon arc , I am of silicon . " In other features we 're the same ( More fuel ! The coal flame twinges ! ) The point is that our molecules Are different in their hinges . " You call those things organic which By nature are based on Some carbon atoms ? more or less ? We hold to silicon . " At temperatures such as you know , " Said he , " we freeze . We turn To consciousness again when you Would sizzle up and burn . " Now this peculiar Silicon Man ( The fire was bright as gold ) Seemed suffering , and so I gave Him whisky for his cold . He liked it ; said he never felt So well as when he had A taste of liquor on his tongue ; It was his little fad To make an ethyl silicohol By substituting Si For carbon in the alcohol ; He called it Hades Rye . // The Silicon Man drank more and more , He grew full talkative , And drank the substituted dram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd lived , lo , many a year ? An old , old man was he And yet he had not lived so much , Because , as you can see , At ordinary temp'rature His soul was frozen dead , And only resurrected when The flames were blazing red . " This life , " said he , " is not so bad When once you 're used to it : To freeze whene'cr the fire goes out And waken when it 's lit . " The orthodox concept of hell Is partly right , " said he , " The heresy lies in the claim That heat is misery . " My needs , " said he , " arc very few ; r want no meat nor bread , And if you feed the fire well You 'll never find me dead . " But when at last my bedtime came I heard a painful shout ; It was a cry for silicohol Just as the fire went out . We need not worry much about the organic silicon compounds . There are a number of stable ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the // feathers of birds and the scales of fish carry them . But the great mass of it is in the form of silica , SiO2 , and as such it is found in various forms . It is found in a line state of division consisting of the scales of extinct diatoms , and known as kieselguhr , or diatomaceous earth . This is used for filtering , in the preparation of dynamite , and other purposes . Then we find it as quartz in crystals , and in another crystalline form as tridymite in porphyry and other rocks , and in a quasi-amorphous state with water locked in as in opals . It melts to a colorless glass , is insoluble in water , and is not attacked by acids except hydrofluoric . The amorphous silica is soluble in alkali if in a finely divided state , but , when fused , alkali only attacks it slightly . Silica is the anhydrid of an acid which would naturally be obtained by adding water , except that pure silicic acid as such is not known in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silicates are prepared artificially . Silicates of soda and of potash are soluble in water ; other silicates are not . By bringing sand and salt ( NaCl ) and coke together and heating them in an electric arc , Acheson produced a crystalline body composed substantially of the two elements , or carbide of silicon , CSi . This is well known as carborundum , and is made at Niagara Falls . It is so hard as to scratch rubies and is not acted upon by acids at ordinary temperatures . It is one of the hardest abrasives , and has found wide use as a substitute for emery . There are silicides of many metals , but their relation to iron and steel we shall discuss when we come to the iron and steel industry . The most extended use of silica , SiO2 , in industry is in glass and pottery making . Glass is a solid solution of indefinite composition , // produced by the fusing of sand ( silica ) with the oxides of two or more metals . It has no definite molecular structure like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinite arrangement as is found in a solution . Glass has the property of being transparent and rigid at ordinary temperatures , but plastic when heated . Its properties change according to its composition , and , while we may say , generally , that it is insoluble , this is only approximately true . Acids affect it ( always excepting hydrofluoric acid ) less than alkalies , but even water , especially under high pressure and high temperature , will corrode some glass . Glass was made as far back as 1400 B.C. , and at the dawn of the Christian era it was a thriving industry . It degenerated in medieval days , chiefly because the natron , or natural sodium carbonate which the Romans used , was no more availed of , and impure wood ashes were used in the place of it . The Venetians kept up the quality of their product by using the ash of a sea plant which they called kali for their base . In the palmy days the Venetians would not let a man escape from the country if he knew how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up , and if they found him he was supposed to have a harp by the time they finished with him . If sand , which is nearly pure SiO2 , could be melted with ease , it would be ideal glass ? quartz glass ? but it is too hard to fuse . So the maker adds fluxes . As soon as you add soda to the sand , down comes the melting-point of the mixture , and soda is the most convenient flux . But when the glass is made , the less soda you have in it the better the product is likely to be , for silicate of soda is very soluble . Then , too , the more soda glass contains the more will it expand and // EVERYMAN 'S CHEMISTRY contract in heat and cold ? and so be likely to break ? and the lower is its tensile strength . To overcome the solubility another base is added , and this is usually lime . Not always enough lime , however , because the more lime the glass-maker puts in the more fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economical turn of mind . Then , too , sometimes the buyer wants his window-glass or his bottles a little cheaper than he has a right to ask for . If a more brilliant and denser glass is wanted , lead oxide is added , and the lead becomes a silicate . If potash is used in the place of soda , the differences are marked . For instance , a vessel made of limesoda glass without enough lime in it becomes covered in time with a whitish powder which leaves the glass rough . That is , the soda oozes out and by exposure to the air becomes carbonate of soda , which is a whitish powder . Potash glass without enough lime will also sweat out potash , but the carbonate of potash as formed draws on water from the air and so runs off without injury to the surface of the glass . Potash glass has a bell-like ring which soda glass has not , due to greater elasticity , and this makes it more desirable for tableware . Generally speaking , potash glass is cleaner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there being no potash available in the United States these days , it is made with soda , and it is hardly likely to stay as bright as if it were made as before . On the other hand , by that strategy which constitutes research , a better electric-light bulb has been produced with soda than was formerly made with potash . Laboratory glass is now made in the United States in large quantities , and the problem is similar to that for making glass kitchenware ? for , if we but knew it , // every kitchen is a laboratory . The product must have a low coefficient of expansion and high tensile strength . That is , it must not expand and contract too much with heat and cold , because if , say , hot water is poured into a vessel it will expand where the hot water is , but not above it , and there comes the breaking strain . And its tensile strength should be high , so that if you drop it on the floor it will hold together with sufficient tenseness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by adding boric oxide , and he adds silica and aluminium to increase the tensile strength . Isere are a number of kinds of glass and their special uses : Silica , with soda and lime or soda-lime glass . Used for window-glass , chemical glassware , and bottles . Silica , with soda , lime , and aluminium . Used for beer , wine , and spirit bottles , owing to strength and insolubility . Silica , with potash and lime . Bohemian glass , for tableware . Silica , with potash and lead . Flint glass , tableware , optical goods . Boro-silicon , with soda and lime . Optical goods , thermometer tubes , and laboratory ware . Boro-silicon flint , with potash and lead . Optical goods , enamels , imitation gems , etc . Borate and phosphate glasses , containing no silicon , for certain optical purposes . Quartz , pure . Does not obstruct the passage of ultraviolet rays as does all other glass , and is not broken or cracked by sudden changes of temperature . Glass baking-dishes are coming into use , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , because // baking takes place much more rapidly in these than in metallic pans . The reason is simple when you know it ? metal reflects 83 to 99 per cent . of the radiant heat that strikes it , while glass reflects only 3 to 14 per cent . The soluble silicate of soda is called " water glass , " and is used for making bandages for broken limbs , and for keeping eggs and other purposes . Glass is colored by means of certain metallic oxides . Ferric ( iron ) compounds produce green color ; ferrous compounds color it yellow . Manganese ranges from amethyst to violet color . The full effect is produced only when the manganese is fully oxidized , and this takes place on long exposure to the actinic rays of the light . Manganese is often added to window and other glass to correct the green color from iron impurities , and the violet color of arc-light glass is due to the oxidation of the manganese by long exposure to the light . The same phenomenon may be observed in old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight quantities of cobalt make glass blue . Iron and manganese make it brown , and in excess make it black . Colloidal gold imparts a red color to it . So will copper if larger amounts are used , but it is very difficult to get certain results with copper . In making glass it is always necessary to use some " cullet , " or broken glass , which serves as a flux in the glass pots or tanks . When the glass is made there is always some scum , called " glass gall , " that floats on the top . This is skimmed off , and then the temperature is allowed to cool down until the glass is ready for blowing or casting . The principal product of the American glass industry is building-glass , of which there are three classes ? sheet ( or window ) , plate , and wire - glass . // Four-fifths of the window-glass made here is mechanically blown , while up to the present time plate-glass is always cast . In the near future , however , owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing-machines . The difference between plateglass and sheets is of a mechanical rather than a chemical nature . Wire-glass is applied in structural work , requiring a material of great strength ; it is especially useful in factory construction , owing to its resistance to shock and its fire-retarding qualities . In addition to building-glass there is a great pressed and blown hollow-ware industry . This includes the tableware , kitchenware , and bottle industries . Bottles of all sizes , from vials to carboys , are now blown by machinery . The development of the automatic bottle-machine revolutionized the industry . Not long ago a friend asked me why we imported so much table glassware , the finer sorts being almost entirely of European make . The answer is simple ? we have n't the skilled labor . But the reason why we have not the skilled labor is far from simple . Let us see , however , if we can not make a guess at it . When a man achieves sufficient skill to make glassware of exceptional beauty he must have sufficient taste to know the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ; he must be enough of an artist to sense beauty when he has it before him . If he is only a hand in a factory , with more interest in his hours and his pay than he has in the individual quality of his work , he can turn out good , standard designs , fair enough for anybody to use , but he will not , because he can not , under the circumstances , make exceptional wares . To make these requires an artist , and the artist , with his discriminating taste , finds delight in the thing of beauty and distress in that which 139
