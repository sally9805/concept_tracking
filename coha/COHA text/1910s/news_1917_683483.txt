txt Dr. CitAnt.F:s W. ELIOT , in the Magazine Section of Tip ; St:NDay ' TIMES this morning , again proposes the holding of an unofficial conference to discuss peace terms . It would be , we suprose , - something like the abortive Stockholm Conference , except that it would not be composed of persons who have a strong bond of union and intellectual sympathy , as the Socialists have . That bond . however , did not . avail in the case of the Socialists . The total impossibility of getting together so long as the German Government refuses to renounce its bloody ambition was made manifest even to them . The rock on which an unofficial conference would be sure to split is that the negotiators would not be equal . The people rule in the allied countries . They are ruled by the Government in Germany . The representatives of the Allies would represent the people , that is , the governing body . The representatives of Germany would be merely delegates of autocracy . Though the thing might be in appearance a conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of .. the peoples of one side and the military autocracy of another . That is precisely the kind of conference on which the United States , for one , will not enter . The German Socialist ' delegates to Stockholm were as much a part of the Kaiser 's military machine as HI- : : DENnueu 's army . On that rock the conference split . Dr. ELIOT suproses that German delegates to another conference , delegates who were not Socialists , would not be open to ' that impassable objection , and that the same old rock would not split the new conference . We do not agree with him . ? Dr. ELIOT reveals that he does not want Germany to be defeated , on the curious ground that if overpowered " after desperate resistance , the Ger " mans will remain a source of " anxiety and dread for all Europe . " We imagine that a Germany which is not overpowered , which was a menace to all Europe in 1914 , will remain a menace to all Europe after a war in which it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims . We do not consider itn good argument that we should let Germany retain some of the spoil in order to appease her , for we do not think that would , appease her ; and if an unofficial peace conference is not for the purpose of discussing how much of the spoil Germany shall retain , then it is useless to discuss it at all at this stage of the war . Another unusual argument for the unofficial peace conference , put forward by Dr. ELIOT , is that " each Government would reveal something of its own state of mind . " We know Germany 's state of mind . and We hope to change it ; that is the reason why we are fighting . In one of Amnn.osn BIERCE 'S stories a . Confederate General asks a eaptured.sny if he came to ascertain the numbers and disposition of the General 's forces . " Only their numbers , " the spy replies . " Their disposition I already knew . It is morose . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
