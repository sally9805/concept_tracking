txt Within a few hundred feet of the home of Andrew Carnegie and in the most zealously guarded residence zone In New York , where streets are patrolled day and night by policemen and.private watchmen , there occurred two weeks ago one of the most daring daylight robberies in the history of the city . The home of Mrs. Albert H. Gallatin , at 14 East Sixty-fifth Street , a few doors from Fifth Avenue , was entered and the dressing room of Mrs. Gallatin looted of a number of valuable jewtis and heirlooms . The police said nothing about the robbery , and the first hint of it reached TILE TIMES through the following advertisement which appears to-day in the Lost column : Large reward for jewels taken from 1-1 East Sixty-fifth Street . Apply at - 14 East Sixty-fifth Street . No questions asked . The advertisement was inserted by Albert E. Gallatin , son of Mrs , Gallatin , and grandson of the late banker and Secretary of the Treasury . When a TIMES reporter visited the Gallatin residence last night , Mr. Gallatin was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detail , only declining to make public the exact value of the stolen jewels . " We believe that the burglary was perpetrated two weeks ago last Sunday , " explained Mrs. Gallatin , " and we base this conclusion upon the following facts , I last wore my jewels upon the Saturday prior to the supposed day of the robbery , and ? carefully placed them In my dresser in a compartment which Is used for no other purpose . Family Away Most of the Day . " On Sunday morning the family at't'ended church services , and after dinner we went to an afternoon service , so that we were practically away from home throughout the entire day . I retired early Sunday night and occupied my room the greater part of Monday morning , being busy ' with some social -correspondence. " 1t. was not ' until after luncheon on .. Monday that T had occasion to go to my jewel-easket fora , stnall. brooch which I intended to wear- that afternoon , as I was going out . It was then that I discovered that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry was missing . " My boudoir is on the third floor and is not accessible ny any fire escape or other means of outside entrance . The robbery could not have been perpetrated at night , for the reason that 1 am a very light sleeper and the-slightest noise is sufficient to awaken me at all times . Therefore 1 can not conceive that any midnight intruder entered my room either Saturday or Sunday nights . All of our servants have been with us for a long time and there is not one of them whom I would for a moment suspect of pilfering , not to say anything of perpetrating such a wholesale robbery . " There are never less than three or four servants in the house , and such was the case all day Sunday , both in the morning and afternoon . Our men and maid servants and the housekeeper alike agree that there were no suspicious persons seen loitering about the neighborhood , nor did any ' person visit the house in the guise of a caller , canvasser , or . peddler . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor was the lock on the servants ' door molested so far as can be ascertained . The rear door opens upon a back yard. , and the only way in which a thief could get to it would be by climbing over back fences from yards which are only accessible through other residences . Servants Not Suspected . " It is strange that my room was the only one from which ally valuables were taken , and it is also a matter of mystery how any thief could enter the house and reach the third floor undetected . However , I can not too strongly reiterate my first declaration of absolute faith in our servants . My son shares with me absolute confidence in their integrity . It is our theory that some professional thief obtained entrance to the house by means of a skeleton key from the vestibule . either ill the morning or afternoon , went upstairs , and after looting the dresser in my boudoir was either frightened away or decided that the danger of detection was too great to be risked , and quietly effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jewelry taken ? " asked the reporter . " That 1 do not . ca re to replied Mrs. Gallatin . " There were three rings , two breastpins. a valuable string of pearls , and a nilmher of small trinkets , such as pins , br000hes , and other articles . There was also at ) old enameled chain , for the loss of which .1 especially grieve not ' - so much because of its intrinsic worth as because of sentimental associations . Some of the articles were heirlooms , and for that reason could not possibly be replaced . " At the East Sixty-seventh Street Police Station the police refused to make public any details of the burglary beyond admitting that it had been reported and was under investigation . The Lieutenant on the desk refused to make public any details of the robbery bepublic the value of the jewelry missing zo- to divulge the official list of stolen articles , It was learned . however , that Public the amount of the burglary or - to divulge the official list of stolen art ! - cies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
