I have followed with some interest the discussion of " Literary Criticism in American Periodicals " begun by Professor Bliss Perry in the " Yale Review " and continued in a leading article on " Grocer-shop Criticism " in a recent issue of THE DIAL . Professor Perry brings a heavy indictment against periodical criticism in America ; but after reading his censure and your comment , I find it easier than before to explain why criticism has with us risen to no higher levels . For while in a country which is , in the realm of ideas , one of the most conservative in the world , it is neither new nor surprising to find even so authoritative an organ of opinion as your own thrown into a panic when brought face to face with a new idea , still it is surprising if not new to find THE - DIAL accept from the pen of a distinguished scholar in our oldest university the theory that the processes of  | literary criticism are the same as those which th grocer employs in weighing his commodities . Possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hopeless ; but surely it must hav occurred to you that the grocer 's scales measur weight while the literary critic is concerned with quality , ? a thing not so easy to compute , even fo grocers . Surely it must have occurred to you tha while the weights and measures of a grocer are possible of minute ascertainment and universa acceptance , measures of criticism can never be stated with the same precision , or even if so stated can never be certain of universal intelligence , no to mention universal acceptance . Pounds and bushels may be readily converted into kilogram all the world over , and may serve to weigh or measure Irish potatoes , Spanish olives , Arabian dates , and Chinese ginger ; but I challenge THE DIAL to state its literary standards with such pre cision as will make them applicable alike to the literary output of Ireland , Spain , Arabia , and China . Surely it must have occurred to you that while the grocer should aim at an external and mechanical standard wholly outside of the things which he measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should seek to avoid . Surely it must have occurred to you that while a grocer can weigh turnips just as well even if he hates and despises them , and need never have tasted one in his life , the critic , on the other hand , must be called to his profession by a love of books , and can never judge rightly without rea sympathy . Surely it must have occurred to you ? but I stand appalled at the thought of all the things that should have occurred to you before you committed yourself to Professor Perry 's puerile metaphor of the grocer critic . The fact is ( and it is so important that it must be stated clearly and frankly ) that both you and he have a wholly vague and confused idea as to what criticism really means . I might pass lightly over the illustration from the grocer-shop , but one of the passages which you quote with approval from Professor Perry 's article is unmistakable . The real difficulty , he says , is that Americans are interested in " stock-market criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , social , and economic criticism , " even in " musical or dramatic criticism , " but not in the " criticism of books . " Now , the first essential to any understanding of what criticism is , is to understand that the word when used in connection with " baseball criticism " or " pm litical criticism " has no more to do with the word " criticism " when applied to literature or other art , than a clothes-horse has to do with a real horse , or a geometrical circle with a literary circle , or a progressive , euchre party with the Progressive Party , or a firing line with a line of verse . I am afraid that the confusion is hopelessly entrenched in our thought , but it is the duty of journals like THE DIAL and of scholars like Professor Perry to clarify such confusion and not to make it denser . I remember that a friend of mine , hearing of my intention to write a History of Literary Criticism , once suggested that I include in it a history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than merely a history of the criticism of books . The suggestion had an impressive sound , but it was no more valuable than a suggestion to include in a book on horses all the horsey things in the world , including race-track touts , horseradish , clothes-horses , and hippopotamuses . An Italian scholar once attempted a task of this kind , and in the jumble of science , jurisprudence , economics , and " critical " philosophy , literary criticism is reduced to a sorry state . The criticism of literature is , first of all , a distinct and separate art , and involves the re-living in the critic 's mind of the work which he is criticizing ; it involves , that is to say , a re-creation of the artist 's work , before it rises above the work to become an act of judgment . It is only as a metaphor that this art may be said to have any connection whatever with the purely intellectual processes of " political , social , or economic criticism . " It is this confusion which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry tamely receives it ; and it is unnecessary to charge you with the same confusion , since you confess it yourself : " that THE DIAL has upheld this view for upwards of thirty years is well known to our ( your ) readers . " This charge , you will understand , involves neither the probity nor the value of your practice . That THE DIAL has never yielded to the shameless puffery and dishonesty characteristic of so much periodical writing about books is incontestable . It has always stated its honest opinions about them . But honesty of opinion is not criticism any more than honesty of character is statesmanship . It is true that in our political life corruption has been so blatant and pervasive that our present concern seems to be rather with honesty than with statesmanship ; and it may be true that in our literary life our first concern now is with honest opinions rather than with creative criticism . If this is so , our periodicals are in the same stage of development as our politics ; but surely the day must come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken for granted , and a search be made , not for honest writers or honest men , but for true critics and true statesmen . We shall prepare the way for that day when we clarify the concept of " criticism " and make it plain what criticism really is . There is one other confusion of thought which you share with Professor Perry , and which I should like to use this opportunity of making clear . I do not intend to defend what you are pleased to call my " foolish vaporings , " but I think it only fair that you should permit me to clarify at least one point in my own doctrine which you apparently completely misapprehend . Your editorial , as I understand it , includes among other things a defence of critical judgment as an essential element in the act of criticism , and you imply that in my lecture on " The New Criticism " I have thrown the idea of critical judgment to the winds , and invite the critic to enjoy without judging . Nothing could be clearer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , and that I have insisted always that a critic must judge books as well as enjoy them . In my lecture I distinctly pointed out that the failure of modern impressionistic criticism consists in the very fact that it disre- gards this element of critical judgment . I said then and I say now , that enjoyment and judgment always fall " short of their highest powers unless mystically mated , ? judgment erecting its edicts into arbitrary standards and conventions , enjoyment lost in the mazes of its sensuous indecision . " There is no.conflict , then , between you and Professor Perry on the one side and myself on the other , so far as the idea of judgment in criticism is concerned . We differ , however , in this , ? that you are willing to accept what I have called " arbitrary standards and conventions " whenever they have come to us from the past , and I have made it the study of my life to find out exactly what these conventions are , and to point out in exactly what respect they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I believe to have been outworn in this way are the old empirical " rules " according to which classical criticism in a former age judged every work of art . A Latin poet like Horace , brought face to face with a new play , would have said , " This is a bad play because it disobeys the old rule that not more than three speakers shall be on the stage at any one time . " A French classicist like Boileau , brought into contact with a new play , would have said , " This is a bad play because it disregards the old rule that the theme of every play shall not extend beyond twenty-four hours . " An English reviewer like Lord Jeffrey , brought into contact with a new poem , would have said , " This is bad poetry because it disregards the old rule that an heroic couplet should come to a distinct close at the end of every two lines . " And a Victorian American like Professor Perry , brought into contact with a new work of art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad work of art because it disregards the rules which happened to be popular at the time when I received my academic education . " If modern criticism has learned anything whatever as the result of its self-searching during the last one hundred years , it has learned this : that arbitrary standards and rules have never determined the merit of any work of art and never can determine its merit . So that looking about for a new and more vital method by which to test beautiful things , criticism has found it only in this ? the attempt , first , to discover what the artist himself has tried to do , and then to judge his achievement , ? not by any standards which the artist himself did not choose , but only by the goal which he himself set out to arrive at . We can no longer say to an artist , whether he be poet or painter : " Your work is not good because it disregards standards set for you by other people . " We can say to him , and we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have attempted to do this or that , and what you yourself have tried to do you have apparently achieved , or failed in . " Among the arbitrary standards and conventions which I believe to have dominated criticism too long , and which modern thought must eradicate from the whole field of critical thought and activity , I indicated in my lecture on " The New Criticism " some of the more popular and authoritative , such as the application of a purely moral standard in the judgment of literature ; the division of literature into different species or genres , such as lyric , comedy , tragedy , epic , pastoral , and similar vague abstractions ; the theory of style , conceiving style as something separate from the work of art itself ; the conception of the drama as a mechanical rather than a creative art , involving a knowledge of the rules of the theatre rather than the movements of the human heart ; the idea of technique as distinct from the essence of art itself ; the theory of the influence of race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters ; and , finally , the theory of the " evolution " of literature . It may be that I have been mistaken in conceiving some of these theories to be arbitrary standards of taste , but that is not the main question involved . The main problem is merely this ? whether criticism should attempt to be creative in the sense of re-creating the artist 's work in its own mind , and then , and only then , evolving its judgment ; or whether it should unthinkingly hold to the old standards and conventions that have come down to us from the past , and mechanically accept a work of art only in so far as it agrees or disagrees with these traditional standards . The question at issue between us , then , is not whether the critic should judge literature , but how he should judge it ; not whether he should forego all judgment , but whether he should judge rightly or wrongly , ? in a word , whether the critic 's touchstone should be external and mechanical or internal and vital . Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in summing up my position by quoting a few phrases of mine torn from their context ; and thus distorted , it may seem an easy thing to controvert my position even with the vague and graceful arguments of Victorian tradition . Many a Bohemian gathering , he says ( I have not his article at hand and can merely paraphrase from memory ) , repeals the Ten Commandments in the fervor of midnight , only to find in the disillusion of the next morning that the Ten Commandments " will not budge . " I do not intend to confuse the issue by being drawn into an argument that involves not only Biblical exegesis but the philosophy of history and the relativity of morals ; but I must protest at having the ethical standards of a primitive folk imposed not only on universal history but on the criticism of all literature . It would be too obvious a retort to say that the Decalogue did budge between " Exodus " and " Deuteronomy , " and budged stilt more before " Romans " was reached , where the Ten Commandments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to point out that there is not a single commandment out of the ten which has not been disregarded from Old Testament days to our own , and the disregarding of which has not been justified by the moral conscience of men , ? whether it be the edict against murder , disregarded for centuries in the code of the duello and to-day in the cede of war ; whether it be the edict against stealing , which has been disregarded and is still disregarded by every nation on earth ? in our own time by England in the Transvaal , by Italy in Tripoli , by the Balkan States in Macedonia , and by the United States in Puerto Rico ; ? or whether  | it be any of the other of the Ten , which have never had the same consideration by men . But this , after all , is only a side issue ; the important fact is that any comparison between the judgment of an act in practical life and the judgment of a work of art must inevitably be false . If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought from the days of Plato to our own , it is that there is a fundamental distinction between the useful or mechanical arts on the one hand and the liberal arts on the other . Any comparison of the method of criticism with the method used in the practical conduct of life or in the mechanical operation of any of the useful arts and sciences must in itself be fundamentally false . There is then no connection whatever between the Decalogue and the standards of criticism , and Professor Perry might have said with an equal appearance of truth , but an equal fundamental falsity , that many a Bohemian gathering repeals the Ten Cornmandments in the fervor of midnight , only to find in the disillusion of the next morning that cabbages do not grow on grapevines . If I were to attempt to sum up the whole matter , I should say this ? that art is simply the endeavor of the human mind to express itself , to give shape in words or in marble or on canvas to its fancy and its imagination ; and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a true and vital expression . We can not ask it to compete with practical life , or with utilitarian arts . We can simply say that since beauty is its own excuse for being , the imagination achieves its end when it expresses itself . No edict ever enunciated by the masters of criticism can hold water a single moment after a great work of art imposes its new beauty upon us . All we can ask of it is whether it has obeyed the laws which it itself has evolved in the moment of its creation ? not whether it has been true to others , but whether it has been true to itself .  |
