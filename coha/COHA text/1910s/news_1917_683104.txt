txt It does not make much difference to the people which one of the plans for a compromise organization of the House is adopted ; they will be satisfied with any of them . They will not be satisfied , they will be outraged , if no compromise is reached and if a House summoned to meet fn the gravest emergency the country has faced in half a century begins its session with a deadlock over the Speakership and a squabble over the House patronage . While the whole nation is thinking only of the way to meet the crisis . for a branch of its Government to embark immediately on a partisan row will be disheartening and dangerous . Furthermore . there must be an end at once of the talk about five unknowns holding " the- balance of Power , " in the House . Such a thing tindignified and weak in ordinary times . but it is bearable then . lt is not to be endured in such a time as this . Neither does it have to he endured . If the five unknowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election of a Speaker , they will continue to hold it on every item of general legislation that conies up during the life of the Sixty-fifth Congress . That is a reason of the first importance why they should not he permitted to hold it in that election . The legislation of the country at the beginning of a great war must not be permitted to depend on the deals that 211 Republicans or 214 Democrats can make over each successive measure with one Socialist . one Prohibitionist , one Progressive : Protectionist . one T'rogressive , and one Independent . No such situation can arise if the Itouse patriotically resolves to meet . not as a House of Republicans and Democrats , but as a 1-louse of Americans assembled to defend their country . Such a , House . being- confronted by an equal division of party strength , will come to ? an agreement at once by which a long-drawn fight over the Speakership will be avoided . The agreement will place the leadership Of the House in men . whether Republicans or Democrats ' or a. coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders not of parties but of the House as a whole . The legislation these leaders propose or approve will therefore call for the support of majority of the House , not a majority of the Republican or the Democratic Party , and such support will be given : the agreement will assure that . This will dispose of the power of the five perhaps estimable but unknown individuals known as " independents " to control in accordance with their unascertained prejudices the self-defending labors of a great nation in the presence of an efficient foe . Our own belief is that the necessary co-operation between the leaders and the parties would be best secured by a division between the two parties of the Speakership and the importan committees . But any agreemen whereby the House can act as a whop will suit the country . The one thin which it will not endure is an exhibition of governmental inefficiency on the threshold of war , inefficiency caused by a political , squabble over r , f flees and patronage .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
