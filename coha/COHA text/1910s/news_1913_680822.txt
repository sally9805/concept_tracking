txt The Republic of Mexico held its Presidential election to-day , but judging from the indicati6ns at the close of the polls In the capital , not enough votes were cast to make legal the choke of any candidate for President in succession to Gen. Huerta . There were 80,000 registered voters In the Federal district , and according to one estimate fewer than 10,000 votes were cast . A less optimistic estimate put the number of votes cast at about 3,000 . No official figures are available . The constitutional requirement , is that at ' least one-third of the about a000,000 voters shall go to the polls in order to constitute a valid election . The day passed off more quietly than any Sunday here for many months . The streets were deserted , and many of the polling places were not used by voters .

Blanquet. who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Huerta ticket , remained at his home here all day . Federico Gamboa , who headed the Catholics ' ticket , was the only candidate to east a ballot in-the capital . The others apparently were indifferent . So far as can be learned Huerta and Bianquet polled no ballots in this district , although Meagre reports indicate a considerable movement in their favor in the outlying districts . Cavalry Patrolled the Streets . Strong cavalry patrols were on the streets throughout the day from early morning , and they were strengthened toward dark . No groups were perar gather in the streets , which were kept clear by the police without any disorder . Politicians to-night say that the results of to-day 's elections show the indifference of the Mexican people , but consider that the calm conditions in the capital were Jae to the fact that strong patrols had been on the streets for the last two days and nights , resulting in an intimidation of many voters , who would not go to the polls . The national palace was carefully ' guarded throughout the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received orders that no one be allowed to enter the palace unless he had a pass from the Minister of War or was a military man . As the balloting for Senators , Congressmen , and Deputies was conducted at the same time as that for President , the indications are that this will not represent the will of the people , although a member will probably be officially reported ? Oected from each district . It is believed that the Catholics carried their Congressional ticket in the Pederal district , although it is uncertain what the official report on this will be . Several persons were discovered to be candidates for Congress to-day who said they expected to be elected , but they did Itot know 0n what district . David de la , Fuente , the candidate of the Independent Liberals , accompanied by friends , personally made a round of inspection of the booths of the capital , and was apparently greatly disappointed at the lack of enthusiasm . Expect Election to be Void . While it is impossible to predict the outcome of the election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be declared void and that Gen. Huerta will remain in power pending the calling of another election . This has been the belief among political leaders for some time past . Therefore the statement of Gen. Huerta to the diplomats has not been considered as indicating any intention on his part to allow the election of any candidate . It is believed , however , that the . new Congress will declare itself elected , despite the small number of votes cast . Many Mexican families were absent from their regular Sunday social functions , such as dances at country clubs , theatres , matinees , and other diversions .

It is said that army officials believe that if revolutionists gain much more ground , this will inevitably cause anarchy , making American intervention inevitable . Many Mexicans are now calling for intervention preferably by concerted action . Of the Powers . This movement has grown to marked degree Since the dissolution of Cong+ess. many believing that this is certain sooner or later and better come before the country is absolutely ruined . Officials here have been commenting on the statement made . by Senator Bacon yesterday at Philadelphia .
