txt Friends of Park Commissioner Charles B. Stover , who departed from this city on Oct. 15 without giving any notice of his plans , believe that he decided suddenly to take a vacation for the first time in the four years/ that he had held office and that he will be surprised on his return to find that his ' absence had caused anxiety and alarm . It was learned yesterday that within recent years Mr. Stover had on two occasions disappeared in similar fashion for several weeks . Robbins Gilman of the University Settlement at 184 Eldridge Street , where Mr. Stover lives , said last night that shortly before he took office four years ago , Mr. Stover , without telling any of his friends that he meant to take a vacation , dropped out of sight for six weeks . When he came back he appeared to be amazed to learn that his disappearance had caused any concern . Mr. ' Stover explained that he had become very deeply interested in Italian landscape gardening and that , when he got ready to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject and gone off into the country to study them . Mr. Stover did not on that occasion say where he had spent his vacation and his manner discouraged questions . J. K. Paulding , who has been associated for more than twenty years with Mr. Stover in the work of the University Settlement , said last night that seven or eight years ago Mr. Stover took another unannounced vacation and his friends were perplexed greatly by his failure to communicate with them . At this time Mr. Stover , Mr. Paulding , and many others were in the midst of a campaign to have Delancey Street parked . Mr. Stover was the leader of the movement , and a numoer of meetings at which he was to speak had been planned when he unexpectedly absented himself . On his return , after several weeks , he made no explanation of his disappearance , but took up his work on the parking of Delancey Street with renewed zeal . Louis F. La Roche , Secretary of the Park Board , and Ira H. Patchin , private secretary to Mr. Stover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were convinced that Mr. Stover was only taking a vacation . Their theory is that , to take his mind entirely off the subject of his work , he has made it a rule during his absence to avoid reading the newspapers , and for that reason he had tailed to assure his friends of his safety . The Board of Aldermen took official notice of the absence of Commissioner Stover yesterday , when Alderman Dowling introduced an amendment giving the Mayor the power to make the senior officer of any department , when there is no other rule in effect , the acting head of that department , if the I President is absent for ten days . This assignment , according to the ordinance , shall last for thirty days . Alderman Dowling said , in asking for the immediate passage of the ordinance. that it had been recommended by Mayor Kline and that it was an absolute necessity . He said that the business of the Park Department was at a standstill for the want of an executive officer . Aldermen Curran and Dowling I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passed by a vote of 48 to 7 . It was said at the City Hall that unless Commissioner Stover returned to his duties by the early part of next week , Mayor Kline would appoint a successor . As President of the Park Board , Commissioner Stover had to sign all contracts , and his absence has delayed the routine business of the department . On Oct. 20 Mr. La Roche received a telegram sent by . Mr. Stover from Philadelphia , saying that he had decided to extend his vacation . The telegram did not give his address . On last Tuesday Mr. La Roche received a letter from Mr. Stover . The envelope was postmarked Philadelphia , but the letter gave no address . Mr. La Roche said that Mr. Stover spoke of matters regarding the Park Department in his letter and that he said nothing at all by way of explaining his absence . " The letter did not say when he would be back , " said Mr. La Roche . " and I have no way of guessing when he will return . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Stover is accustomed to doing things without consulting others . He has not had a vacation in four years . I imagine that he decided it was about time to take one , and that he started off without delay . He is a great student . He was in the habit of reading till 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning . When he became interested in a new tree , for instance , he would get all the literature he could obtain on the subject and read it through . He was deeply interested in scientific and historical subjects , and read a great deal or . architecture . " When he returns I think it will be found that he took a sudden fancy to some scientific matter and buried himself in books on the subject . Mr. Stover never went on hunting or fishing expeditions . He told me once that he had not caught a fish since he was a little boy . It could not have been on account of his health that he went away . He had been very well for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took office was a touch of rheumatism nearly four years ago . " Mr. Paulding also thought that Mr. Stover had gone into retirement to study up some subject that interested him . As an instance of how Mr. Stover would take infinite pains over trifles , if they happened to strike his fancy , Mr. Paulding told how Mr. Stover had stint himself up in his library with a vast pile of historical lore when he wished to dig out appropriate names for three lion cubs that were born at the Central Park menagerie . After about two days of research he named one Akbar after the Mogul Emperor , another Jumna after a river in India , and a third Sheba after the land of the Biblical Queen . Mr. Stover 's friends all agree that he never indulged in intimate conversations , and that , while he had many friends , no one was especially in his confidence . H. B. Semple . Jr. , a cousin of Mr. Stever and proprietor of a drug store at Easton , Penn .. said over the long distance telephone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The lust time that I saw him , - said Mr. Semple , " was last June when he came to Easton on a short visit during Old Home Week . It is certain that he has not visited Easton since he disappeared in October . The last two vacations that I know of his taking were at Ocean Grove , N. J. , and at Milford , Del . " Mr. Ctover was born at Riegelsville , Penn. , which is six miles from Easton . his parents died in his youth , leaving hint considerqble property . He came to ii , ls city abeut twenty-eight years ago e  --  a. foe a while was a student at the Union Theological Seminary . Instead of reinainine ' to graduate , however , he became interested in settlement work and joined the University Settlement when it was organized twenty-seven Years ago .
