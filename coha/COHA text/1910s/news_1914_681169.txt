txt Several difficult and Hard Lines delicate questions are for the raised by the action Model Boy . which has been taken in the case of Eawm WHITE , the boy who some weeks ago so cruelly disappointed the confident ex- ' peetations of Commissioner Davis by breaking his parole and running away from the Industrial Home in Orange County . WHITE had been sentenced to the pent , tentiary on Hart 's Island for three years , but in six months his irreproachable conduct there had made for him a reputation so high that he was considered particularly promising material on which to try the new ideas as to the practicability of reforming young offenders  --  and a good many old ? ones , too , for that matter ? by " appealing ' to their better nature , " intrustlng them with certain responsibilities , and , in general , putting them on their honor . It was therefore not a little discouraging when this " model boy " eloped after he had been only sixteen days cn the farm to which he had gone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the evasion was not a return to vicious ways . WHITE had made straight for a recruiting station and enlisted for service in Mexico . Through a letter sent to relatives he was found among the other recruits undergoing military training at Fort Slocum , and giving every indication of becoming in time a good soldier . Opinions will differ as to what should have been done then . What was done was to arrest WHITE as an escaped prisoner and send him back to serve out his full sentence in the penitentiary . That was , of course , commendable as a carrying out of the law in such cases made and provided , but a venturesome commentator might go so far as not to condemn the doing of their sworn duty by the law 's representatives , but to hint that they had followed the killing letter of the law rather than its life-giving spirit . WHITE had certainly found for himself a place where he would get a better training in citizenship than any penitentiary will or could provide ; he was earning his own living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown that adventurous self-dependence which is about the best quality a boy can have . To defend or excuse the breaking of his parole would be impossible , but ? well , considering all the circumstances , it seems almost a pity that Dr. Davis and her subordinates could not have found it compatible with their consciences to be , for once , a little blind and a little forgetful . I t grieves u s ? Journalism though our sorrow is Queerly not quite . **25;868;TOOLONG ? to notice that The New York Medical Journal severely criticises a recent article in this paper announcing the discovery of a long-sought germ  --  that of typhus fever . From the comments of The Journal one might almost suspect it of condemning what it had not read , for the description of our article is hardly recognizable . That , however , is probably only seeming , and a result of the not uncommon inability of the class journalist to understand ' the alms and methods of his brother whose appeal is to everybody in ' general . We are told , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " in no sense a smart piece of journalism , " that its subject matter was of no interest to lay readers , while members of the medical profession would suspend judgment until the news of this discovery was presented " in unmistakably orthodox form . " To the first of these statements the answer is that in newspaper circles it is considered , for reasons vindicated by experience to be judicious , and therefore " smart , " if that word must be used , to be the first in presenting important information . As for what interests our readers , perhaps we know about that more than does our estimable and much respected medical contemporary , and we happen to know , also , that several doctors , though they may have suspended judgment while they waited for an " orthodox " announcement in regard to the typhus germ , gave to ours their serious attention as something which it behooved them to look up at once . It is with an emotion a little different from grief that we find in The Journal 's comment the assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " eked out with silly details concerning the discoverer 's career , his youth , and other inapposite matter . " From the strictly scientific standpoint , of course , these details were inapposite. " but we do not pretend to view things from that - position . We do not scorn " human interest , " and we are convinced that it is not " silly " at all to couple biography with achievement when opportunity offers . But , there ! We are not really angry With The Medical Journal . It is a mine whence we have dug many a nugget of valuable news and wise observation in the past , and doubtless it will supply us with many more in the future . ' With our sincere appreciation , however , goes a wish that it would not make itself ridiculous by complaint that its ways are not our ways . ? Its object , , the public service , is ours , anyhow , . so why should either of us be harsh with the other ? ? To the innumerable Boston Will epigrams descriptive Doubtless or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M E L N added another , and not the least accurate , when he called that ever interesting city " the home of the antis . " He went rather , far , ? indeed , when he added , " If you can name anything proposed for the good ' of humanity that Boston has not opposed , I Would like to hear of it . " . He is likely to hear of se.veral . for Boston is the home of " pros /* as well as of antis , " and as it has ? both Preached and practiced about all the principles and theories there are . besides inventing not a few , of course a part of its inhabitants have had . to be right most . of the time . Mere contrariness ? of which Boston has at least a sufficiency  --  will pot , as Mr. Mt:Lux tried ito make us believe , fully explain Boston 's antagonism to the recent management of the New Haven , road . Whether . " the good of humanity " as a whole was the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question to which Mr. MELLEN himself has lent a lot of uncertainty , to put the situation with all possible mildness . In spite of all he said against it , Boston is a charming place , with about the finest set of " associations " to be found anywhere in the country , and its past glories are an enviable , though somewhat unsubstantial , possession .
