SCENE  --  A forward section of the main deck of the British tramp Steamer Glencairn , at anchor off an island in the West Indies . The full moon , half-way up the sky , throws a clear light on the deck . The sea is calm and the ship motionless . On the left two of the derrick booms of the foremast just out at an angle of forty-five degrees , black against the sky . In the rear the dark outline of the port bulwark is sharply defined against a distant strip of coral beach , white in the moonlight , fringed with coco palms whose tops rise clear of the horizon . On the right is the forecastle with an open doorway in the center leading to the seamen 's and firemen 's compartments . On either side of the doorway are two closed doors opening on the quarters of the Bo'sun , the ship 's carpenter , the messroom steward , and the donkeyman  --  what might be called the petty officers of the ship . Near each bulwark there is also a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the forecastle head ( the top of the forecastle )  --  the edge of which can be seen on the right . In the center of the deck , and occupying most of the space , is the large , raised square of the number one hatch , covered with canvas , battened down for the night . A melancholy negro chant , faint and far-off , drifts , crooning , over the water . Most of the seamen and firemen are reclining or sitting on the hatch . Paul is leaning against the port bulwark , the upper part of his stocky figure outlined against the sky . Smitty and Cocky are sitting on the edge of the forecastle head with their legs dangling over . Nearly all are smoking pipes or cigarettes . The majority are dressed in patched suits of dungaree . Quite a few are in their bare feet and some of them , especially the firemen , have nothing on but a pair of pants and an undershirt . A good many wear caps . There is the low murmur of different conversations going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is followed by a sudden silence in which the singing from the land can be plainly heard . DRISCOLL  --  ( a powerfully built Irishman who is sitting on the edge of the hatch , front  --  irritably ) Will ye listen to them naygurs ? I wonder now , do they call that keenin ' a song ? p. 3 SMITTY  --  ( a young Englishman with a blond mustache . He is sitting on the forecastle head looking out over the water with his chin supported on his hands . ) It does n't make a chap feel very cheerful , does it ? ( He sighs . ) COCKY  --  ( a wizened runt of a man with a straggling gray , mustache  --  slapping Smitty on the back ) Cheero , ole dear ! Dow n't be ser dawhn in the marf , Duke . She loves yer . SMITTY  --  ( gloomily ) Shut up , Cocky ! ( He turns away from Cocky and falls to dreaming again , staring toward the spot on shore where the singing seems to come from . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of the hatch  --  waving a hand toward the land ) They bury somebody  --  py chiminy Christmas , I tink so from way it sound . YANK  --  ( a rather good-looking rough who is sitting beside Driscoll ) What d'yuh mean , bury ? They do n't plant ' em down here , Dutchy . They eat ' em to save fun'ral expenses . I guess this guy went down the wrong way an ' they got indigestion . COCKY  --  Indigestion ! Ho yus , not ' arf ! Dow n't yer known as the blokes ' as two stomacks like a bleedin ' camel ? p. 4 DAVIS  --  ( a short , dark man seated on the right of hatch ) An ' you seen the two , I s'pect , ai n't you ? COCKY  --  ( scornfully ) Dow n't be showin ' yer igerance be tryin ' to make a mock o ' me what has seen more o ' the world than yeself ever will . MAX  --  ( a Swedish fireman  --  from the rear of hatch ) Spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's troof , what I tole yer . I ' eard it from a bloke what was captured pris'ner by ' em in the Solomon Islands . Shipped wiv ' im one voyage . ' T was a rare treat to ' ear ' im tell what ' appened to ' im among ' em . ( musingly ) ' E was a funny bird , ' e was  --  ' ailed from Mile End , ' e did . DRISCOLL  --  ( with a snort ) Another lyin ' Cockney , the loike av yourself ! LAMPS  --  ( a fat Swede who is sitting on a camp stool in front of his door talking with Chips ) Where you meet up with him , Cocky ? CHIPS  --  ( a lanky Scotchman  --  derisively ) In New Guinea , I 'll lay my oath ! COCKY  --  ( defiantly ) Yus ! It was in New Guinea , time I was shipwrecked there . ( There is a perfect storm of groans and laughter at this speech. ) p. 5 YANK  --  ( getting up ) Yuh know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lyin ' New Guinea dope on us again , do n't yuh ? Close that trap if yuh do n't want a duckin ' over the side . COCKY  --  Ow , I was on'y tryin ' to edicate yer a bit . ( He sinks into dignified silence . ) YANK  --  ( nodding toward the shore ) Do n't yuh know this is the West Indies , yuh crazy mut ? There ai n't no cannibals here . They 're only common niggers . DRISCOLL  --  ( irritably ) Whativir they are , the divil take their cryin ' . It 's enough to give a man the jigs listenin ' to ' em . YANK  --  ( with a grin ) What 's the matter , Drisc ? Yuh 're as sore as a boil about somethin ' . DRISCOLL  --  I 'm dyin ' wid impatience to have a dhrink ; an ' that blarsted bumboat naygur woman took her oath she 'd bring back rum enough for the lot av us whin she came back on board to-night . BIG FRANK  --  ( overhearing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumboat voman vill bring booze ? DRISCOLL  --  ( sarcastically ) That 's right  --  tell the Old Man about ut , an ' the Mate , too . ( All of the crew have edged nearer to Driscoll and are listening to the conversation with an air of suppressed excitement . Driscoll lowers his voice impressively and addresses them all . ) She said she cud snake ut on board in the bottoms av thim baskets av fruit they 're goin ' to bring wid ' em to sell to us for'ard. p. 6 OLD TOM  --  ( an old gray-headed man with a kindly , wrinkled face . He is sitting on a camp stool in front of his door , right front . ) She 'll be bringin ' some black women with her this time  --  or times has changed since I put in here last . DRISCOLL  --  She said she wud  --  two or three  --  more , maybe , I du n no . ( This announcement is received with great enthusiasm by all hands . ) COCKY  --  Wot a bloody lark ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time ! DRISCOLL  --  ( warningly ) Remimber ye must be quiet about ut , ye scuts  --  wid the dhrink , I mane  --  ivin if the bo'sun is ashore . The Old Man ordered her to bring no booze on board or he wud n't buy a thing off av her for the ship . PADDY  --  ( a squat , ugly Liverpool Irishman ) To the divil wid him ! BIG FRANK  --  ( turning on him ) Shud up , you tamn fool , Paddy ! You vant make trouble ? ( to Driscoll ) You und me , ve keep dem quiet , Drisc . DRISCOLL  --  Right ye are , Dutchy . I 'll split the skull av the first wan av ye starts to foight . ( Three bells are heard striking. ) p. 7 DAVIS  --  Three bells . When 's she comin ' , Drisc ? DRISCOLL  --  She 'll be here any minute now , surely . ( to Paul , who has returned to his position by the bulwark after hearing Driscoll 's news ) D' you see ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see anyting like bumboat . ( They all set themselves to wait , lighting pipes , cigarettes , and making themselves comfortable . There is a silence broken only by the mournful singing of the negroes on shore . ) SMITTY  --  ( slowly  --  with a trace of melancholy ) I wish they 'd stop that song . It makes you think of  --  well  --  things you ought to forget . Rummy go , what ? COCKY  --  ( slapping him on the back ) Cheero , ole love ! We 'll be ' avin our rum in arf a mo ' , Duke . ( He comes down to the deck , leaving Smitty alone on the forecastle head . ) BIG FRANK  --  Sing someting , Drisc . Den ve do n't hear dot yelling . DAVIS  --  Give us a chanty , Drisc . PADDY  --  Wan all av us knows . MAX  --  We all sing in on chorus p. 8 OLSON  --  " Rio Grande , " Drisc . BIG FRANK  --  No , ve do n't know dot . Sing " Viskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " COCKY  --  Now ! Guv us " Maid o ' Amsterdam . " LAMPS  --  " Santa Anna " iss good one . DRISCOLL  --  Shut your mouths , all av you . ( scornfully ) A chanty is ut ye want ? I 'll bet me whole pay day there 's not wan in the crowd ' ceptin ' Yank here , an ' Ollie , an ' meself , an ' Lamps an ' Cocky , maybe , wud be sailors enough to know the main from the mizzen on a windjammer . Ye 've heard the names av chanties but divil a note av the tune or a loine av the words do ye know . There 's hardly a rale deep-water sailor lift on the seas , more 's the pity . YANK  --  Gives us " Blow The Man Down . " We all know some of that . ( A chorus of assenting voices : Yes !  --  Righto !  --  Let ' er drive ! Start ' er , Drisc ! etc . ) DRISCOLL  --  Come in then , all av ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Paradise Street  --  ALL  --  Wa-a-ay , blow the man down !

CHORUS Blow the man down , boys , oh , blow the man down ! Wa-a-ay , blow the man down ! A pretty young maiden I chanced for to meet.Give us some time to blow the man down ! PAUL  --  ( just as Driscoll is clearing his throat preparatory to starting the next verse ) Hay , Drisc ! Here she come , I tink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all rush to the side and look toward the land . ) YANK  --  There 's five or six of them in it  --  and they paddle like skirts . DRISCOLL  --  ( wildly elated ) Hurroo , ye scuts ! ' T is thim right enough . ( He does a few jig steps on the deck. ) p. 10 OLSON  --  ( after a pause during which all are watching the approaching boat ) Py yingo , I see six in boat , yes , sir . DAVIS  --  I kin make out the baskets . See ' em there amidships ? BIG FRANK  --  Vot kind booze dey bring  --  viskey ? DRISCOLL  --  Rum , foine West Indy rum wid a kick in ut loike a mule 's hoind leg . LAMPS  --  Maybe she do n't bring any ; maybe skipper scare her .

Listen to ' em gigglin ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women 's voices can be heard talking and laughing . ) DRISCOLL  --  ( calling ) Is ut you , Mrs. Old Black Joe ? A WOMAN 'S VOICE  --  Ullo , Mike ! ( There is loud feminine laughter at this report . ) DRISCOLL  --  Shake a leg an ' come abord thin . THE WOMAN 'S VOICE  --  We 're a-comin ' . p. 11 DRISCOLL  --  Come on , Yank . You an ' me 'd best be goin ' to give ' em a hand wid their truck . ' Twill put ' em in good spirits . COCKY  --  ( as they start off left ) Ho , you ai n't ' arf a fox , Drisc . Dow n't drink it all afore we sees it . DRISCOLL  --  ( over his shoulder ) You 'll be havin ' yours , me sonny bye , do n't fret . ( He and Yank go off left . ) COCKY  --  ( licking his lips ) Gawd blimey , I can do wiv a wet . DAVIS  --  Me , too ! CHIPS  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let any go to waste . BIG FRANK  --  I could trink a whole barrel mineself , py chimminy Christmas ! COCKY  --  I ' opes all the gels ai n't as bloomin ' ugly as ' er .

COCKY  --  ( angrily ) Ho , yus ? You ai n't no bleedin ' beauty prize yeself , me man . A ' airy ape , I calls yer . p. 12 PADDY  --  ( walking toward him  --  truculently ) Whot 's thot ? Say ut again if ye dare . COCKY  --  ( his hand on his sheath knife  --  snarling ) ' Airy ape ! That 's wot I says !

Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( grumblingly ) I do n't take no back talk from that deck-scrubbin ' shrimp . COCKY  --  Blarsted coal-puncher ! ( Driscoll appears wearing a broad grin of satisfaction . The fight is immediately forgotten by the crowd who gather around him with exclamations of eager curiosity . How is it , Drisc ? Any luck ? Vot she bring , Drisc ? Where 's the gels ? etc . ) DRISCOLL  --  ( with an apprehensive glance back at the bridge ) Not so loud , for the love av hivin ! ( The clamor dies down . ) Yis , she has ut wid her . She 'll be here in a minute wid a pint bottle or two for each wan av ye  --  three shillin 's a bottle . So do n't be impashunt. p. 13 COCKY  --  ( indignantly ) Three bob ! The bloody cow ! SMITTY  --  ( with an ironic smile ) Grand larceny , by God !

THE CROWD  --  ( growling ) Dirty thief ! Dot 's right ! Give her nothin ' ! Not a bloomin ' ' apenny ! etc . DRISCOLL  --  ( grinning ) Ye can take ut or lave ut , me sonny byes . ( He casts a glance in the direction of the bridge and them reaches inside his shirt and pulls out a pint bottle . ) ' T is foine rum , the rale stuff . ( He drinks . ) I slipped this wan out av wan av the baskets whin they was n't lookin ' . ( He hands the bottle to Olson who is nearest him . ) Here ye are , Ollie . Take a small sup an ' pass ut to the nixt . ' Tis n't much but ' twill serve to take the black taste out av your mouths if ye go aisy wid ut . An ' there 's buckets more av ut comin ' . ( The bottle passes from hand to hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a deep " Aaah " of satisfaction. ) p. 14 DAVIS  --  Where 's she now , Drisc ?

COCKY  --  ( still indignant ) I ai n't no bloomin ' captain , I ai n't . I ai n't got no missus  --  reg'lar married , I means . I ai n't  --  p. 15 BIG FRANK  --  ( putting a huge paw over Cocky 's mouth ) You ai n't going talk so much , you hear ?

DRISCOLL  --  An ' do n't forgit what I said about bein ' quiet wid the dhrink , or the Mate 'll be down on our necks an ' spile the fun . ( a chorus of assent ) DAVIS  --  ( looking aft ) Ai n't this them comin ' ? ( They all look in that direction . The silly laughter of a woman is heard . ) DRISCOLL  --  Look at Yank , wud ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thim . That lad 's not wastin ' any toime . ( The four women enter from the left , giggling and whispering to each other . The first three carry baskets on their heads . The youngest and best-looking comes last . Yank has his arm about her waist and is carrying her basket in his other hand . All four are distinct negro types . They wear light-colored , loose-fitting clothes and have bright bandana handkerchiefs on their heads . They put down their baskets on the hatch and sit down beside them . The men crowd around , grinning. ) p. 16 BELLA  --  ( she is the oldest , stoutest , and homeliest of the four  --  grinning back at them ) Ullo , boys . THE OTHER GIRLS  --  ' Ullo , boys . THE MEN  --  Hello , yourself  --  Evenin '  --  Hello  --  How are you ? etc . BELLA  --  ( genially ) Hope you had a nice voyage . My name 's Bella , this here 's Susie , yander 's Violet , and her there ( pointing to the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . PADDY  --  ( roughly ) Never mind the girls . Where 's the dhrink ? BELLA  --  ( tartly ) You 're a hawg , ai n't you ? Do n't talk so loud or you do n't git any  --  you nor no man . Think I wants the ole captain to put me off the ship , do you ? YANK  --  Yes , nix on hollerin ' , you ! D'yuh wanta queer all of us ? BELLA  --  ( casting a quick glance over her shoulder ) Here ! Some of you big strapping boys sit back of us on the hatch there so 's them officers ca n't see what we 're doin ' . ( Driscoll and several of the others sit and stand in back of the girls on the hatch . Bella turns to Driscoll . ) Did you tell ' em they gotter sign for what they gits  --  and how to sign ? p. 17 DRISCOLL  --  I did  --  what 's your name again  --  oh , this  --  Bella , darlin ' . BELLA  --  Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go inside the fo'castle when you gits your bottle . No drinkin ' out here on deck . I ai n't takin ' no chances . ( An impatient murmur of assent goes up from the crowd . ) Ai n't that right , Mike ? DRISCOLL  --  Right as rain , darlin . ' ( Big Frank leans over and says something to him in a low voice . Driscoll laughs and slaps his thigh . ) Listen , Bella , I 've somethin ' to ask ye for my little friend here who 's bashful . Ut has to do wid the ladies so I 'd best be whisperin ' ut to ye meself to kape them from blushin ' . ( He leans over and asks her a question . ) BELLA  --  ( firmly ) Four shillin 's . DRISCOLL  --  ( laughing ) D' you hear that , all av ye ? Four shillin 's ut is . PADDY  --  ( angrily ) To hell wid this talkin ' . I want a dhrink . BELLA  --  Is everything all right , Mike ? DRISCOLL  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let her droive ! p. 18 BELLA  --  All right , girls . ( The girls reach down in their baskets in under the fruit which is on top and each pulls out a pint bottle . Four of the men crowd up and take the bottles . ) Fetch a light , Lamps , that 's a good boy . ( Lamps goes to his room and returns with a candle . This is passed from one girl to another as the men sign the sheets of paper for their bottles . ) Do n't you boys forget to mark down cigarettes or tobacco or fruit , remember ! Three shillin 's is the price . Take it into the fo'castle . For Gawd 's sake , do n't stand out here drinkin ' in the moonlight . ( The four go into the forecastle . Four more take their places . Paddy plants himself in front of Pearl who is sitting by Yank with his arm still around her . ) PADDY  --  ( gruffly ) Gim me thot ! ( She holds out a bottle which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . YANK  --  ( sharply ) Here , you ! Where d'yuh get that stuff ? You ai n't signed for that yet . PADDY  --  ( sullenly ) I ca n't write me name . YANK  --  Then I 'll write it for yuh . ( He takes the paper from Pearl and writes . ) There ai n't goin ' to be no welchin ' on little Bright Eyes here  --  not when I 'm around , see ? Ai n't I right , kiddo ? p. 19 PEARL  --  ( with a grin ) Yes , suh . BELLA  --  ( seeing all four are served ) Take it into the fo'castle , boys . ( Paddy defiantly raises his bottle and gulps down a drink in the full moonlight . Bella sees him . ) Look at ' im ! Look at the dirty swine ! ( Paddy slouches into the forecastle . ) Wants to git me in trouble . That settles it ! We all got to git inside , boys , where we wo n't git caught . Come on , girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yank and Pearl are the last to reach the doorway . She lingers behind him , her eyes fixed on Smitty , who is still sitting on the forecastle head , his chin on his hands , staring off into vacancy . ) PEARL  --  ( waving a hand to attract his attention ) Come ahn in , pretty boy . Ah likes you . SMITTY  --  ( coldly ) Yes ; I want to buy a bottle , please . ( He goes down the steps and follows her into the forecastle . No one remains on deck but the Donkeyman , who sits smoking his pipe in front of his door . There is the subdued babble of voices from the crowd inside but the mournful cadence of the song from the shore can again be faintly heard . Smitty reappears and closes the door to the forecastle after him . He shudders and shakes his shoulders as if flinging off something which disgusted him . Then he lifts the bottle which is in his hand to his lips and gulps down a long drink . The Donkeyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing him . Now that the closed door has shut off nearly all the noise the singing from shore comes clearly over the moonlit water. ) p. 20 SMITTY  --  ( listening to it for a moment ) Damn that song of theirs . ( He takes another big drink . ) What do you say , Donk ? OLD TOM  --  ( quietly ) Seems nice an ' sleepy-like . SMITTY  --  ( with a hard laugh ) Sleepy ! If I listened to it long  --  sober  --  I 'd never go to sleep . OLD TOM  --  ' Tai n't sich bad music , is it ? Sounds kinder pretty to me  --  low an ' mournful  --  same as listenin ' to the organ outside o ' church of a Sunday . SMITTY  --  ( with a touch of impatience ) I did n't mean it was bad music . It is n't . It 's the beastly memories the damn thing brings up  --  for some reason . ( He takes another pull at the bottle . ) OLD TOM  --  Ever hear it before ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a something about the rotten thing which makes me think of  --  well  --  oh , the devil ! ( He forces a laugh . ) OLD TOM  --  ( spitting placidly ) Queer things , mem'ries . I ai n't ever been bothered much by ' em . p. 21 SMITTY  --  ( Looking at him fixedly for a moment  --  with quiet scorn ) No , you would n't be . OLD TOM  --  Not that I ai n't had my share o ' things goin ' wrong ; but I puts ' em out o ' me mind , like , an ' fergets ' em . SMITTY  --  But suppose you could n't put them out of your mind ? Suppose they haunted you when you were awake and when you were asleep  --  what then ? OLD TOM  --  ( quietly ) I 'd git drunk , same 's you 're doin ' . SMITTY  --  ( with a harsh laugh ) Good advice . ( He takes another drink . He is beginning to show the effects of the liquor . His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're poor little lambs who have lost our way , eh , Donk ? Damned from here to eternity , what ? God have mercy on such as we ! True , is n't it , Donk ? OLD TOM  --  Maybe ; I dunno. ( after a slight pause ) Whatever set you goin ' to sea ? You ai n't made for it . SMITTY  --  ( laughing wildly ) My old friend in the bottle here , Donk . OLD TOM  --  I done my share o ' drinkin ' in my time . ( regretfully ) Them was good times , those days . Ca n't hold up under drink no more . Doctor told me I 'd got to stop or die . ( He spits contentedly . ) So I stops . p. 22 SMITTY  --  ( with a foolish smile ) Then I 'll drink one for you . Here 's your health , old top ! ( He drinks . ) OLD TOM  --  ( after a pause ) S'pose there 's a gel mixed up in it someplace , ai n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? OLD TOM  --  Always is when a man lets music bother ' im. ( after a few puffs at his pipe ) An ' she said she threw you over ' cause you was drunk ; an ' you said you was drunk ' cause she threw you over . ( He spits leisurely . ) Queer thing , love , ai n't it ? SMITTY  --  ( rising to his feet with drunken dignity ) I 'll trouble you not to pry into my affairs , Donkeyman . OLD TOM  --  ( unmoved ) That 's everybody 's affair , what I said . I been through it many 's the time . ( genially ) I always hit ' em a whack on the ear an ' went out and got drunker'n ever . When I come home again they always had somethin ' special nice cooked fur me to eat . ( puffing at his pipe ) That 's the on'y way to fix ' em when they gits on their high horse . I do n't s'pose you ever tried that ? p. 23 SMITTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLD TOM  --  ( placidly ) No ; that 's why they has mem'ries when they hears music . ( Smitty does not design to reply to this but sinks into a scornful silence . Davis and the girl Violet come out of the forecastle and close the door behind them . He is staggering a bit and she is laughing shrilly . ) DAVIS  --  ( turning to the left ) This way , Rose , or Pansy , or Jessamine , or black Tulip , or Violet , or whatever the hell flower you name is . No one 'll see us back here . ( They go off left . ) OLD TOM  --  There 's love at first sight for you  --  an ' plenty more o ' the same in the fo'c's'tle . No mem'ries jined with that . SMITTY  --  ( really repelled ) Shut up , Donk . You 're disgusting . ( He takes a long drink . ) OLD TOM  --  ( philosophically ) All depends on how you was brung up , I s'pose . ( Pearl comes out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She shuts the door behind her , sees Smitty on the hatch , and comes over and sits beside him and puts her arm over his shoulder. ) p. 24 OLD TOM  --  ( chuckling ) There 's love for you , Duke . PEARL  --  ( patting Smitty 's face with her hand ) ' Ullo , pretty boy . ( Smitty pushes her hand away coldly . ) What you doin ' out here all alone by yourself ? SMITTY  --  ( with a twisted grin ) Thinking and ,  --  ( he indicates the bottle in his hand )  --  drinking to stop thinking . ( He drinks and laughs maudlinly . The bottle is three-quarters empty . ) PEARL  --  You ought n't drink so much , pretty boy . Don ' you know dat ? You have big , big headache come mawnin ' SMITTY  --  ( dryly ) Indeed ? PEARL  --  Tha 's true . Ah knows what Ah say . ( cooingly ) Why you run ' way from me , pretty boy ? Ah likes you . Ah don ' like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't rough . You 're a genelman . Ah knows . Ah can tell a genelman fahs Ah can see ' im . SMITTY  --  Thank you for the compliment ; but you 're wrong , you see . I 'm merely  --  a ranker . ( He adds bitterly ) And a rotter. p. 25 PEARL  --  ( patting his arm ) No , you ai n't . Ah knows better . You 're a genelman. ( insinuatingly ) Ah would n't have nothin ' to do with them other men , but ( she smiles at him enticingly ) you is diff'rent . ( He pushes her away from him disgustedly . She pouts ) Don ' you like me , pretty boy ? SMITTY  --  ( a bit ashamed ) I beg your pardon . I did n't mean to be rude , you know , really . ( His politeness is drunkenly exaggerated . ) I 'm a bit off color . PEARL  --  ( brightening up ) Den you do like me  --  little ways ? SMITTY  --  ( carelessly ) Yes , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and puts his arm around her waist and presses her to him . ) Why not ? ( He pulls his arm back quickly with a shudder of disgust , and takes a drink . Pearl looks at him curiously , puzzled by his strange actions . The door from the forecastle is kicked open and Yank comes out . The uproar of shouting , laughing and singing voices has increased in violence . Yank staggers over toward Smitty and Pearl . ) YANK  --  ( blinking at them ) What the hell  --  oh , it 's you , Smitty the Duke . I was goin ' to turn one loose on the jaw of any guy 'd cop my dame , but seein ' it 's you  --  ( sentimentally ) Pals is pals and any pal of mine c'n have anythin ' I got , see ? ( holding out his hand ) Shake , Duke . ( Smitty takes his hand and he pumps it up and down . ) You'n me 's frens . Ai n't I right ? p. 26 SMITTY  --  Right it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is n't with me . She was just going back to the fo'c's'tle to you . ( Pearl looks at him with hatred gathering in her eyes . ) YANK  --  Tha ' right ? SMITTY  --  On my word ! YANK  --  ( grabbing her arm ) Come on then , you , Pearl ! Le 's have a drink with the bunch . ( He Pulls her to the entrance where she shakes off his hand long enough to turn on Smitty furiously . ) PEARL  --  You swine ! You can go to hell ! ( She goes in the forecastle , slamming the door . ) OLD TOM  --  ( spitting calmly ) There 's love for you . They 're all the same  --  white , brown , yeller ' n ' black . A whack on the ear 's the only thing 'll learn ' em . ( Smitty makes no reply but laughs harshly and takes another drink ; then sits staring before him , the almost empty bottle tightly clutched in one hand . There is an increase in volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door is thrown open and the whole mob , led by Driscoll , pours out on deck . All of them are very drunk and several of them carry bottles in their hands . Bella is the only one of the women who is absolutely sober . She tries in vain to keep the men quiet . Pearl drinks from Yank 's bottle every moment or so , laughing shrilly , and learning against Yank , whose arm is about her waist . Paul comes out last carrying an accordion . He staggers over and stands on top of the hatch , his instrument under his arm. ) p. 27 DRISCOLL  --  Play us a dance , ye square-head swab !  --  a rale , Godforsaken son av a turkey trot wid guts to ut . YANK  --  Straight from the old Barbary Coast in Frisco ! PAUL  --  I do n't know . I try . ( He commences tuning up . ) YANK  --  Ataboy ! Let ' er rip ! ( Davis and Violet come back and join the crowd . The Donkeyman looks on them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and does not seem to know there is any one on deck but himself . ) BIG FRANK  --  Dance ? I do n't dance . I trink ! ( He suits the action to the word and roars with meaningless laughter . ) DRISCOLL  --  Git out av the way thin , ye big hulk , an ' give us some room . ( Big Frank sits down on the hatch , right . All of the others who are not going to dance either follow his example or lean against the port bulwark . ) BELLA  --  ( on the verge of tears at her inability to keep them in the forecastle or make them be quiet now they are out ) For Gawd 's sake , boys , do n't shout so loud ! Want to git me in trouble ? DRISCOLL  --  ( grabbing her ) Dance wid me , me cannibal quane . ( Some one drops a bottle on deck and it smashes. ) p. 28 BELLA  --  ( hysterically ) There they goes ! There they goes ! Captain 'll hear that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! Here 's the music ! Off ye go ! ( Paul starts playing " You Great Big Beautiful Doll " with a note left out every now and then . The four couples commence dancing  --  a jerk-shouldered version of the old Turkey Trot as it was done in the sailor-town dives , made more grotesque by the fact that all the couples are drunk and keep lurching into each other every moment . Two of the men start dancing together , intentionally bumping into the others . Yank and Pearl come around in front of Smitty and , as they pass him , Pearl slaps him across the side of the face with all her might , and laughs viciously . He jumps to his feet with his fists clenched but sees who hit him and sits down again smiling bitterly . Yank laughs boisterously . ) YANK  --  Wow ! Some wallop ! One on you , Duke . DRISCOLL  --  ( hurling his cap at Paul ) Faster , ye toad ! ( Paul makes frantic efforts to speed up and the music suffers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . I 'm wore out with you steppin ' on my toes , you clumsy Mick . ( She struggles but Driscoll holds her tight. ) p. 29 DRISCOLL  --  God blarst you for havin ' such big feet , thin . Aisy , aisy , Mrs. Old Black Joe ! ' T is dancin 'll take the blubber off ye . ( He whirls her around the deck by main force . Cocky , with Susie , is dancing near the hatch , right , when Paddy , who is sitting on the edge with Big Frank , sticks his foot out and the wavering couple stumble over it and fall flat on the deck . A roar of laughter goes up . Cocky rises to his feet , his face livid with rage , and springs at Paddy , who promptly knocks him down . Driscoll hits Paddy and Big Frank hits Driscoll . In a flash a wholesale fight has broken out and the deck is a surging crowd of drink-maddened men hitting out at each other indiscriminately , although the general idea seems to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take refuge on top of the hatch , where they huddle in a frightened group . Finally there is the flash of a knife held high in the moonlight and a loud yell of pain . ) DAVIS  --  ( somewhere in the crowd ) Here 's the Mate comin ' ! Let 's git out o ' this ! ( There is a general rush for the forecastle . In a moment there is no one left on deck but the little group of women on the hatch ; Smitty , still dazedly rubbing his cheek ; the Donkeyman quietly smoking on his stool ; and Yank and Driscoll , their faces battered up considerably , their undershirts in shreds , bending over the still form of Paddy , which lies stretched out on the deck between them . In the silence the mournful chant from the shore creeps slowly out to the ship. ) p. 30 DRISCOLL  --  ( quickly  --  in a low voice ) Who knoifed him ? YANK  --  ( stupidly ) I did n't see it . How do I know ? Cocky , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . He is a tall , strongly-built man dressed in a plain blue uniform . ) THE FIRST MATE  --  ( angrily ) What 's all this noise about ? ( He sees the man lying on the deck . ) Hello ! What 's this ? ( He bends down on one knee beside Paddy . ) DRISCOLL  --  ( stammering ) All av us  --  was in a bit av a harmless foight , sir ,  --  an '  --  I du n no  --  ( The Mate rolls Paddy over and sees a knife wound on his shoulder . ) THE FIRST MATE  --  Knifed , by God . ( He takes an electric flash from his pocket and examines the cut . ) Lucky it 's only a flesh wound . He must have hit his head on deck when he fell . That 's what knocked him out . This is only a scratch . Take him aft and I 'll bandage him up . DRISCOLL  --  Yis , sor . ( They take Paddy by the shoulders and feet and carry him off left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hatch for the first time. ) p. 31 THE FIRST MATE  --  ( surprised ) Hello ! ( He walks over to them . ) Go to the cabin and get your money and clear off . If I had my way , you 'd never  --  ( His foot hits a bottle . He stoops down and picks it up and smells of it . ) Rum , by God ! So that 's the trouble ! I thought their breaths smelled damn queer . ( to the women , harshly ) You need n't go to the skipper for any money . You wo n't get any . That 'll teach you to smuggle rum on a ship and start a riot . BELLA  --  But , Mister  --  THE FIRST MATE  --  ( sternly ) You know the agreement  --  rum  --  no money . BELLA  --  ( indignantly ) Honest to Gawd , Mister , I never brung no  --  THE FIRST MATE  --  ( fiercely ) You 're a liar ! And none of your lip or I 'll make a complaint ashore to-morrow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , Mister  --  THE FIRST MATE  --  Clear out of this , now ! Not another word out of you ! Tumble over the side damn quick ! The two others are waiting for you . Hop , now ! ( They walk quickly  --  almost run  --  off to the left . The Mate follows them , nodding to the Donkeyman , and ignoring the oblivious Smitty . ( There is absolute silence on the ship for a few moments . The melancholy song of the negroes drifts crooning over the water . Smitty listens to it intently for a time ; then sighs heavily , a sigh that is half a sob . p. 32 SMITTY  --  God ! ( He drinks the last drop in the bottle and throws it behind him on the hatch . ) OLD TOM  --  ( spitting tranquilly ) More mem'ries ? ( Smitty does not answer him . The ship 's bell tolls four bells . The Donkeyman knocks out his pipe . ) I think I 'll turn in . ( He opens the door to his cabin , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear it in the fo'c's'tle  --  the music , I mean  --  an ' there 'll likely be more drink in there , too . Good night . ( He goes in and shuts the door . ) SMITTY  --  Good night , Donk . ( He gets wearily to his feet and walks with bowed shoulders , staggering a bit , to the forecastle entrance and goes in . There is silence for a second or so , broken only by the haunted , saddened voice of that brooding music , faint and far-off , like the mood of the moonlight made audible . ) ( The Curtain Falls )
