December 3r , 1919 THE NEW third places we thought he did . However , he lived the fourth place . But it was n't quite accurate to say his sister married the law partner of the man Who enforces the dry law . She married the cousin of the Superintendent of City Streets . But this man had , at any rate , been a politician high in the councils of Tammany . Unfortunately , however , it was in the days when Richard Croker was a young man . And on the present occasion he was in bed With tonsilitis . But the travelling salesman did n't let that news discourage us . We tried a second politician close to the seat of power . We tried other politicians . Before our search ended we had also tried two hotels , an Assyrian restaurant , a converted stable , a deputy coroner 's office , and a roadhouse in whose c ? tIrtyard the travelling salesman assured us he had Played as a boy of seven . We had twice left our Coach , and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots , to arrive , once , at a deserted warehouse ? the second time on the threshold of a Salvation Army mission . And , we had come , finally , 1 ? The Red Grasshopper . It was a spot the travel ? mIg salesman had forgotten about entirely . We should never have had any of this bother , he said , if only he 'd thought about it in the first place . Here , in the Red Grasshopper , our long trail ended . It was time it ended . We had exhausted al , 1 but a little of the three hours at our disposal . The debt to our driver had reached proportions of which we had no knowledge . The driver himself . W45 in bad temper . The thin man with the parcels , rebellious . But even as we entered , The Red Grass- a ? PPer promised hospitality . People were laughing a , : , 11:1 dancing . There was a fire on the open hearth . Two young girls were playing a piano . We chose a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesman looked at him , winked prodigiously , and said ? said very clearly ? " Cold soup p , The waiter disappeared . He returned . He set co ? ' llered dishes before us . Ah , well ; life has its t ? other compensations . You have guessed what he 11ght. us ? More than likely you have . It was precisely what we ordered . C. M. News from the Sick Room BEWILDERED observers of current natural phenomena in a disordered and confused world had begun to think that the peak of topsy ? turviness had been reached when the so long despised Mexican dollar came to be worth in the open market $1.05 in United States gold currency , and at the same time the British gold sovereign , so long the world 's standard of coin values , de ? clined to $3.70 . Before the puzzled analysts had been able to readjust themselves to this spectacle , they were snatched to a new high level of bewild ? derment by the public appearance of the Honor ? able Albert Bacon Fall , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the White House , certifying to President Wilson 's mental competency . Nothing queerer ever happened in Washington . And the queerest part of it all is that it was taken quite as a matter of course . Nothing has so vividly shown the state of mind into which Washington has fallen . Mr. Fall 's disclosure was treated as a matter of large public import . After his pro ? nouncement for the benefit of the press , at the White House , he was swiftly translated to the Re ? publican cloak room in the Senate wing of the Capitol and there subjected to a critical cross ex ? amination by the lawyers and doctors of the.Senate . They took turns at him . It was an amazing per ? formance . " How long were you in his bedroom ? Was anybody else there ? Did she say anything ? In what position did you find the President ; lying down or sitting up or propped up ? Where did you sit ? Did he shake hands with you ? Which hand did he use ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use it ? Did you see him move his body or his legs ? How did he look ? How long did he talk and how long did you talk ? Was his voice clear and his utterance unimpeded ? How do you mean , husky ; do you mean his voice was hoarse , or that it was thick ? " ( much detail on this point ) and so on and so on and so on , until all the bones had been picked clean . In point of fact , not the least illuminating aspect of Mr. Fall 's revelations was his disclosure of how vaguely he had seen what he had seen . It took him some time to remember whether the President had offered his left hand or his right hand to be shaken . There were minor discrepan ? cies between Mr. Hitchcock 's report and Mr. Fall 's report . The whole amazing , incredible episode has a value and an interest as disclosing the state of mind of our governors and the atmosphere in which their decision are taken for our guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
