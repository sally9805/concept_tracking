 | THREE incidents in European financial history since 1911 illustrate how definitely the Powers have been preparing for war . As we look back at them we wonder why the world has been overwhelmed with surprise and terrorized by the sudden oncoming of the conflict . In 1905 Germany was all but mobilized against France . The money lords in London , Paris , and Vienna stepped between the rival nations and the Algeciras conference patched up their differences . Again in 1911 Morocco was the sore point between Germany and France , and the Kaiser upset Europe by his " sword-rattling " speech . The affair of the Panther caused the British lion to growl . Germany was then much overextended in all of the international money markets . It has been estimated that she was conducting 90 per cent . of her commercial affairs on borrowed money . This figure is probably much exaggerated . But certainly she owed several hundred millions to Paris and nearly as much to London . New York was then , too , a large creditor and so was Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her balances in Berlin . London and New York followed . German bankers were startled and made protest but their loans were called from all directions . Then they tried to borrow in those countries politically hostile to them and offered high rates of interest to attract the American market . But the lenders were in concert on this one point that no funds would be advanced without the personal guarantee of the Kaiser that they would be used for " legitimate purposes " ; that is , not against the lenders . A little later when the German bankers were asked by Emperor William if they were in a condition to meet the chances of war they were obliged to respond in the negative . Then came the famous command : " Gentlemen , when I next call on you I shall expect you to be t eady . " This is the first suggestion that war was brewing . Two years later rumors of war loans in Germany began to filter through the money markets of the Continent and Prussian bonds began to decline . In the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with government securities in every part of the world lower than during this generation a huge Prussian loan was precipitated and it failed . The proceeds of this loan were , in large part , to meet the cost of the new military program that had recently been promulgated . Subsequent to this fiasco there was proposed a tax on capital and incomes for the expenses of the army so onerous that only an impending war could have justified it . This laid an impost on all incomes of both sexes as low as $250 per annum and on all fortunes from $2500 upwards . Kings and princes were taxed in the same ratio as clerks and small storekeepers . The Kaiser on his personal fortune of $35 , - 000,000 had to pay a tax of $500,000 , and on his income of $3,500,000 , an 8 per cent . tax of $440,000 . So his contribution to the war chest was nearly $1,000,000 . The Krupps are said to have been assessed $3,000,000 . Economists agree that a tax on capital is a dangerous financial expedient and only warranted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all tried it in revolutionary times . That Germany should have come to it as recently as last January , when the law went into effect , was ' the second incident plainly showing that one portion of Europe , at least , was maneuvering for war . The third suggestion of war came from Paris . The new military service laws in France were favorably reported in July , 1913 , about a week after similar enactments had been made in Germany . The French Cabinet was at its wit 's end how to finance the tremendous new military budget , as investment markets were sluggish and the portfolios of Paris bankers were filled with the I. O. U. 's of the Balkan states and with rapidly depreciating securities of Mexico , Brazil ,  | and Argentina . The utter inability of Paris to float a government loan of $200,000,000 to $250,000,000 was obvious . Economic conditions ruling then were sufficient without the Socialists ' opposition to defeat such a flotation . Pending at that time in Europe were loans aggregating $1,500,000,000 . Of those assigned to Paris alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ravages of war in the Balkans or to augment armaments on the Continent . It was only when in her desperation Paris , by government order , closed her doors to all foreign loans , thus throwing away her proud title of " bankers of the nations " held since the Boer war , that she was able to meet her pressing domestic needs . The Viviani Ministry practically duplicated the plan of its predecessor in proposing an issue of $360,000,000 3 ' /2 per cent . bonds , redeemable in twentyfive years in distinction to the perpetual 3 per cent . rentes , and subject to a 4 per cent . income tax . I was in Paris when preparations for this loan were going on and found there none of the enthusiasm for it that I had witnessed before the " wickets " of the great credit banks of France when other government loans were being offered . It has since been announced that the loan was many times oversubscribed ; but it appears likely that the government gave strong underwriting support . The French public was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATIONS While Germany and France have been preparing against the day when ambassadors should be peremptorily dismissed , other members of European alliances have not failed to see the trend of events and be forehanded . In June , a year ago , we read what seemed then to be blustering words from the Belgian Premier , but which were instead prophetic . In announcing the government 's intention to raise $62,800,000 for military expenses he said : " We do not intend meekly to supply again a battleground for Europe . In the event of the breaking out of war Antwerp will be found an impregnable fortress . " Only a fortnight before the Archduke of Austria-Hungary was assassinated , the Russian Minister of Finance had informed the Budget Committee of the Duma that his country in the next five years must spend $3,700,000,000 for the army and navy . This year 's budget for military and naval defense was $500,000,000 . In the period since 1908 approximately $2,600,000,000 has been expended for similar purposes . This does not include the cost of those strategic railroads to the German frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the capacity of the Germans who have three times as many railway lines available for mobilization purposes as has the Czar . Austria has a mobilization capacity at the Russian frontier twice as great as that of her adversary . As we know , Great Britain has been building dreadnoughts and maintaining her balance of naval power , out of the pockets of the British tax-payers who have been squeezed a little harder each year and have cursed a little louder at the unfairness of imposts on income . Not so palpable a war measure as the loans described has been the bolstering up of the gold reserves of the great European banks in the last three years . There was some cause for this apart from financial strategy working with militarism . When it was explained as an economic necessity to meet the new competition for gold by India , China and South America the world at large let it go at that . There were times even then when it was difficult to understand why Paris was paying such a price for American gold when she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's history , or why the yellow bars took such circuitous routes as they did in going from New York to Berlin . In consonance , therefore , with loans for war has been the addition to the gold reserves of Continental Europe . These are now $500,000,000 greater than in 1911 when the Kaiser commanded his bankers to prepare . A large percentage of this gain has taken place in the past eighteen months . So far as is known Germany is the only one of the nations at war that has a specific war fund . The famous fortress at Spandau is said to contain $30,000,000 in gold to be employed solely for war 's needs . This would not finance the routine requirements of an army such as the German Empire can put in the field for more than a fortnight ; but its instant availability in case of unexpected attack would make it of double value . EMERGENCY MEASURES Governments , like corporations and individuals , have a way of anticipating loans and of creating floating debts against them so the proceeds are absorbed in paying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Undoubtedly a large portion of the capital secured by Europe in recent years for naval and military purposes has by this time been translated into the . fixed  | forms of battleships , fortresses , cannon , guns , aeroplanes and a multitude of minor agencies through which troops are mobilized and cared for when in active service . Even before England declared war on Germany the House of Commons had voted her $525 , - 000,000 for " emergency purposes , " and two days later $500,000,000 more was granted by the British Parliament . These two items increased the national debt by about 28 per cent . The first of seventy-seven emergency bills authorized by the Reichstag , ? immediately after war on Russia , France and England was declared , ? was for a loan of $1 , - 325,000,000 , an amount which , in itself exceeded by 10 per cent . the existing debt of Germany and added 30 per cent . to the outstanding debt of the German Empire . France would like to borrow $200,000,000 in this country , but the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage this desire . A credit of $540,000,000 as a war fund has been authorized by the French State Council . WHO WILL BEAR THE BURDENS ? Obviously the costs of war must be borne by the man with property or a going business and by the wage-earner . The latter can adjust his month-to-month expenses so that the tax on him will be relatively small , as war chests in war time are usually lined by receipts from taxes on spirits , beer , tobacco , tea , coffee , and other non-essentials , as well as on documents and contracts with which the man with small income has little to do . Germany is already proposing a severe tax on all property in excess of $7,500,000 . Another unique German scheme which can hardly be credited is to commandeer the savings-bank deposits of the Empire , estimated to be worth $4,000,000,000 , and use them as a war fund , giving depositors government interest-bearing script in payment . This would obviate the necessity of a loan , but it might be found difficult for the banks to produce that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they would have to liquidate their securities . This is impossible in these times of " moratoria " and closed stock exchanges . The savings-bank and postal deposits of the fighting nations are about $9,000,000,000 . To fight the Boers , England issued $1 , - 000,000,000 in consols . She has recently been buying back at 70 some of the bonds which she placed at a premium . Even this huge sum was not sufficient and extra taxes had to be imposed . In the Russo-Japanese war Japan , between March and November , 1905 , issued $425,000,000 in war loans , of which London took $157,500,000 ; New York , $141,500,000 ; Berlin $66,000,000 , and Paris $60,000,000 . It is an interesting fact that Japan was able to float a loan at a lower interest rate at the end of the war which had enormously increased her national debt and placed a mortgage on her remunerative government tobacco monopoly , than when she first started to fight Russia . In the same war Russian attempts at loans were failures as they always seemed unhappily to coincide with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balkan Allies and Turkey have so far failed to pay the indebtedness they incurred in the bloody wars of 1912-13 . Before Austria gave her ultimatum to Servia both countries were prostrated industrially and financially . War always brings out the fact that the resources of individuals are far greater than suspected and that wonderful vitality underlies what may seem impoverished surfaces . Witness Mexico in the past two years , ridden by revolution , 60 per cent . of her transportation system out of commission , all but one of her eastern ports and gateways for commerce closed , and agriculture and mining abandoned in the northern states , and . still supporting a great army with every money market of the world opposed to her . Bismarck never believed that France could pay the $1,000,000,000 indemnity in 1870 ; but from every stocking in the empire came a tithe and the debt was liquidated in a few months . If the figures presented by the American Society for Thrift are approximately correct , the people of this country spend each year for intoxicants , soft drinks , tobacco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures and other extravagances the sum of $4,000,000,000 . This is about what different economists have reckoned to be the total cost of the present European war . Europeans are not so careless of their money as Americans , but they are not 50 per cent , more thrifty than we . The population of the nations engaged in war is four times that of the United States . So , if we estimate that 25 per cent . of all males may be drawn into the struggle and the earning capacity of another 25 per cent . be affected by it we can see where enforced economy would supply the reserves for many war bills . The cost of war does not stop with the countries waging it . There is now before the Congress at Washington a series of taxation measures to relieve the United States from embarrassment due to the sudden stop to customs revenues . Of our import trade of $1,850,000,000 as much as $500,000,000 is with nations directly or closely involved in the war . A large part of this commerce is in the highest tariff-yielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be imposed on American tax-payers to the amount of $100,000,000 as a minimum to help defray the cost of the war abroad . The wealth of these same countries , to be drawn on to meet the cost of war , according to latest figures . The nations of the Triple Entente have an aggregate wealth of $194,000,000,000 to which may be added the moral support of Italy and Portugal with a combined wealth of $22,500,000,000 . The members of the Triple Alliance , or Dual Alliance as it turns out to be , have a national reserve wealth behind them of $85,500,000,000 . But , as money power has , in this instance , failed to prevent war , so it may be ineffective in bringing war 's successes .
