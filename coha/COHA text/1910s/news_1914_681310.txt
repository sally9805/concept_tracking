txt A careful . because Suppression deeply interested , Is by reader of the foreign Censors. war news printed in the Thr , TIMES , writes to us complaining that while he finds in our columns every day long dispatches from London and Paris , and frequently some from St. Petersburg , there is hardly anything there from Berlin . And from these unquestionable facts as a premise , he makes an enormous leap beyond logic and lands on the conclusion that THs Plugs is unfair and prejudiced  --  that it is suppressing German news and giving out only information supplied by Germany 's enemies ! What makes this complaint the more pathetic in its utter wrongness is that it comes from a German  --  from a man , that is , who ought to know something about the severity and the efficiency of the censorship which the German military authorities are exercising over every journalist , including the ' foreign correspondents , whom they can control . If our critic , or anybody of like mind with himself , knows how to overcome the journalistic difficulties thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good part of their lives to learning how to do just that , and light from him on the solution of the particular problem as to getting news from German sources at this juncture would be received with thanks and more material expressions of gratitude . It is strange how persistent is the idea I that the papers treat news as a means rather than as an end , and that what they do n't like they either suppress or change ? " color " is the word commonly used  --  to suit their tastes or to serve ulterior ends . Something of that probably does survive , but not in newspapers worthy of the name , and most readers of THE Times must be sure that it is reporting the events of this war as fully and as fairly as is possible in. the circumstances . Rif correspondents , how- ever , are amenable to the civil laws and military regulations of the countries in which they are serving . What they send should and can be interpreted with that fact in mind , and it can be confidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the forces now engaged that one pr another of them will not " get through " with reasonable Promptness . Whoever cares to News Always give a little study to Comes the ivar news as it is from Victors . printed day by day will observe that though every source of it is now guarded by army officers specially detailed for that purpose , at some points the supply is abundant , while at others it is small in amount and poor in quality , and at still others it has dried up altogether . Yet the censors are all men of about the same quality , and all are prompt , when doubtful as to the wisdom , on military grounds , of making public any particular piece of information , in deciding to suppress it . But they are also all alike in desiring the widest publicity for news of successes achieved by their own forces . Now , fortunately for those of us who are in the business of getting news , and fortunately for those whose interest it is for us to get the whole truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another , and what one censor sternly suppresses a second passes with a contented smile . This is hard on the correspondent who happens to be attached to ? a losing or repulsed army or to be stationed in a capital the policies and plans of whose rulers are not working out well , but the suppression is effectual only when it happens that communication with the opposing side is cut off. , And that is rarely the case . As an almost invariable rule , news comes from victors , not from the vanquished or the embarrassed . The news thus supplied may contain elements of exaggeration , but hardly ever is it wholly false , and allowance for the exaggeration is easily made by the judicious and the discriminating . These are great days Magicians for prophets , amateur Have and professional . What Inning . is happening now has an been " in the air " for years , and anybody who chose ? as great numbers did  --  could predict a general European war and hazard guesses both as to when it would occur and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has been a favorite occupation for all the astrologers and clairvoyants with patrons socially , if not intellectually , above he ancillary class , as well as for mystics of various sorts , and big and little statesmen everywhere . The result is now upon us . Of the innumerable forecasts , which among them covered practically the whole stretch of the possibilities , a few are proving to have been more or less nearly right . Some hit the date of the eruption ; others missed that by a year or two or ten , but approximated the course of current events . We are hearing nothing of all the millions and millions of misses  --  the grotesque blunders made with fully as much of solemnity and assurance on the authority of stars or spirits as any of the rest  --  but the few successes are all coming to light . And we are expected to exclaim over them , to admit that they are " wonderful , " " amazing " ; that they show the " something in it " of one or another form of divination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
