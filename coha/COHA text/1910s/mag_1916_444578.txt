The narrative which follows is made up of letters written by an officer of the British merchant marine to an American friend in close sympathy with the creed they formulate . These letters rover a correspondence of many years , the earlier dating from the South African War , where the writer distinguished himself by his courage in action , and some of the later from the Dardanelles campaign , which found him serving as et ; ittf . fit e ( tr of of his Britannic Maj-sty. -6 nsports . The order in which the letters are printed has been designed by the person who received and arranged them to throw into relief the writer 's Progressive views toward Socialism ; but no liberties have been taken with the text . To an individualist , it is interesting to note that the degree of tense social control now exerted by the state in Great Britain may drive a Socialistinto the kind of revolt usuallyassociated with individualistic doctrine . We may add that the writer has been known to the editor of the Atlantic for many years through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genuineness of the letters . THE EDITORS . BATTLE LIVERPOOL , July 12 , 1915 . You will be wondering where I am and what I have been doing all this time . Your letter was here when I arrived home from the Dardanelles . I have been out there since the beginning , in February , as chief officer of a troop transport . We were under all kinds of shell-fire and rifle-fire , as well as being attacked by several aeroplanes daily , but we did n't get a scratch . I am sick to death . I saw more men blown up in one hour out there than I saw killed all through the Boer War . I am cured of ever wishing to be a soldier again . You will appreciate why when I have finished my story . After we landed our troops on April 25 , we were turned into a distributing hospital ship . Over twenty thousand wounded passed through our vessel . It fell to my lot to sew up and bury the dead . To see the flower of the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey , too , for that matter , ? mangled and maimed beyond recognition : not a man over thirty-five years and not one under nineteen years ... To see lines of men charging , with shrapnel blowing big gaps in their lines , makes one wonder if there is a living God who looks down and allows such things to go on . I have a great liking for the individual Turk , and when I saw our Lancashire Fusiliers take a redoubt and pitch the Turks into the sea with the bayonet , I felt a great pity for the poor , honest Turkish peasant . Notwithstanding all that appears in the press about the cruelty of the Turks and their inhuman treatment of wounded , in all the twenty- thousand - odd wounded who passed through our ship I met no single instance of cruelty or of wounds not honestly got . April 25 will stand out as the day of horrors in my life . I suppose the landing against such odds was one of the finest things in history . Some poor chaps never got ashore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stretched from the shore under water for thirty feet and not a man in them was left alive . They floated away later , filled to the gunwales with their dead . On shore the sight was worse . So congested were the Turks in their trenches on such small land space that every 12-inch or 6-inch shell simply sent heads , legs , arms , and trunks of bodies flying in all directions . I think there must have been at least fifty heavy men - of - war , ? British and French , ? as well as torpedo-boat destroyers as thick as gnats , banging away all clay and all night without a stop . From the giant Queen Elizabeth down , every ship was searching the Turkish trenches with guns of all calibres . Above , aeroplanes were spotting and bomb-dropping . Every living person in a circle of twenty miles was bent on taking life or mangling some other person . This carnage was between men who had never exchanged a cross word ; who had never even seen one another . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must say that , after taking aboard a couple of thousand wounded of our own men , I felt hot all over and cursed the Turks all I knew how ; but when it came to taking wounded Turks aboard ? well , I could n't but help them all I could , especially when I saw some of our own slightly wounded men carrying badly wounded Turks up the gangway . What treatment they had been led to expect I do n't know . The poor wretches had fear and agony of wounds written all over their faces . . . . What I saw in the Boer War led me to believe that the British Tommy is a gentleman at heart . What I saw on this ship only strengthened that belief and assured me that the heart of the British workingman is sound and clean . Our fellows had nothing more bitter to say against the Turks than that they were doing their jobs . There was little rest for anybody either by day or night . If one was n't actually at work tending the wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vibration of the ship made ' sleep , or even rest , impossible . What I saw and went through has knocked the bottom out of me . I believe that I just escaped the madhouse be a hair 's breadth . And when I was told to go back again I refused pointblank . There is no danger to the ships now except from submarines . I refused solely because I could not stand the sight of so much battered humanity . I would shoulder a rifle if they would take me : you know that I have offered myself four times and have been turned down each time . I simply can not stand any more seeing men between twenty and thirty years old with legs blown off , arms blown off , and great gaping wounds from shrapnel all over he body ? youngsters struck deaf and dumb from shell-shock though not actually hit ; and men stone-blind from the same cause . A big Australian , six feet three , about twenty-seven , had a shell explocie almost in his face . It threw him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he struggled to his feet , another shell , bursting behind him , threw him on his face and strained his stomach muscles . He was struck blind , deaf , and dumb . His mouth opened and shut continually , as fast as though he were eating . Two men had to be told off to keep his forearms quiet ? they kept coming up to his shoulders as though he were at physical drill . His body shook all over . We had him aboard one week . By that time his mouth had resumed its normal movement and he had got back the sight of one eye . Then he passed through us to another ship . How would any one of your American jingoes like to be twenty-seven years old with both eyes shot out and both wrists shattered by shrapnel ? The man I mean was a young Scot . I helped him up the gangway . He stood six feet three a beautiful specimen of physical manhood . After a day aboard he suffered terrible torture from the heat of the weather and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the smell of blood . He could not lie on a cot , so we had to fence off a corner in the ' tween decks , carpet it with pillows and mattresses , and let him grope round in his agony . On the spots where the blood had soaked through his eye-and wrist-bandages the flies clustered in black clots . He moaned night and day and was scarcely conscious . He was totally blind , and even the sense of touch was denied him , because his wrists were so shattered that they would have to be amputated . Another man ? a Lancashire Fusilier ? was shot in the intestines . His torture was frightful . He raved like an animal and died in agony . The majority of the wounded men were unconscious , and died so . One evening I buried twenty-seven of the best my country ever produced , all Scots Fusiliers . The words , ' We therefore commit his body to the deep ' are graven on my very soul . It is at this part of the service that the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first burial , the thought of these countrymen of mine being sewn up in blankets and dumped overboard like so many bundles of rubbish ? I had a terrible craving to get at the throats of the capitalists and jingoes who are responsible for it all . Submarine commanders can not be blamed for sinking Lusitanias . They are simply doing their jobs and obeying orders . Those who issue such orders can not be got at ; at least , not yet . Day after day these burials went on . Later I refused to attend them . The finish came when one body stuck to the stretcher by reason of the blood having oozed through the wrappings and congealed . The body had to be pried adrift before it would slide of its own weight into the sea . I can not tell you any more just yet . I sicken as I write . ? The stupidity of it all ! ? the wrong men doing the fighting and bearing all the suffering . Kindly-hearted fathers killing other kindly-hearted fathers at the behest of ? whom ? One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they should go through nine months of labor and then rear children , ? for this . I should like to have had a few thousands of American mothers on the quay at Alexandria every time we discharged our freight of mangled humanity . Or , better still , those in your country who are clamoring for war : let them volunteer to come over as stretcher-bearers only . It is horrible , horrible , too horrible . I have refused to go back . Come what may , I will have no more of it . My nerves are all in . Physically , I am not a coward . If my refusal to go back is moral cowardice I am content to let it go at that . There are no penalties attached to my not going back except the loss of my position with the company . My affair comes up in a clay or two , and a few capitalists will sit in judgment on me , and perhaps without the least compunction they will damn my sea career of twenty-two years in twenty-two seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care nothing for the judgment of men who have never seen suffering or sorrow . I will take their dismissal if it comes to that . It will mean starting at the bottom again if I go to sea , but I will never do that . If I am dismissed from the company , then the sea and I have shaken hands for the last time .. . . I have turned the situation over in every possible way to see if I am lack ing in patriotism . I find that up to the present I have done my job and served my country as few have done since the war started . Therefore I have made my stand , let fall what may . And now let me speak of the United States . From what I have pieced together since arriving home , I gather that public feeling in your country runs high over the Lusitania affair . Many seem to be clamoring for war . Who are these people and what do they know of war ? Who eggs them on , and for what reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as stretcher-bearers only . Or perhaps your jingoes are of the same breed as ours : do all their fighting in frock coats while the youth of the country do their dirty work for them . I think the Lusitania dead would be the last , if they could , to cry out for vengeance , and to sacrifice scores of thousands of America 's best youth for their sakes . There must be another way out . There must be thousands of other ways if only the nation would keep cool and think . An American who urges his country to enter the fight is a bad American . It is frightful to think of thousands of such fellows as I have met over on your side being torn to pieces with high explosives . Within twenty-four hours at the Dardanelles we had twelve thousand men killed and wounded . Our losses out there far exceed those published . From cottage and mansion they came , from university and poor school . They represented the best we had . Your ranks would have to be filled with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sweeping the streets . I 'm extremely nervous , not on account of what the company may do to me , but from what I have been through lately . I do n't sleep too well . I see mangled bodies and faces all the time . I 'm up against it every way I turn : I can not get into the firing line ; I ca n't stand the job I 've been on lately ; and I stand practically condemned by the company . In the firing line one would n't see a tithe of what I saw at the Dardanelles , because there we had aboard the mangled of all fronts , whereas , in the trenches , one would only see the wounded of his own immediate front . ? What a maze of contradictions I am in ! I seem to be fighting my way through to something ? what , I do n't know . I am intensely interested in what the company may decide , because if the decision goes against me there will be a new life open ing out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out my salvation that way . Of all the questions I have fought out with the company ? and they are many ? this is the most interesting and perhaps the most vital . If I am dismissed , I suppose many will say that I funked it . Others , who know me , will not say so much : they 'll probably say , ' What a damned fool he was , and next in turn for command , too ! ' Meanwhile , I am resting and playing with my kidlets , awaiting the judgment of the heaven-born . The situation is ludicrous . Here I am , a man who fought through the Boer War ; a man recommended for the Distinguished Service Medal ; a man promoted from the ranks to troop-sergeant at one leap ; a man who , plugging along with one kidney and minus two ribs , was mentioned in dispatches at the Dardanelles in April ; a man who has been shot at with rifles , field-guns , howitzers , aeroplane bombs , and naval guns , and threatened by submarines ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never had a duck-rifle their hands , to see if I funked going back to the Dardanelles . If they want a plain answer to a plain question I 'll tell them straight that I did funk going back to see so many thousand of my best countrymen man- gled by devilish instruments of war . I know I have a wife and two children depending on me , but I am not afraid for them . I have been up against it before , and have won through , and I 'll win through here somehow if I get sacked . I will admit defeat when I am in the grave , not before . Excuse this letter . It is a disjointed affair . I am scarcely myself . You will hear again as soon as I have been judged by the heaven-born . Till then , do all you can to keep your country out of this mess . LIVERPOOL , July 13 , 1915 . The inevitable has happened at last . What I told you of in yesterday 's letter came off to-day . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been asked to resign . I went up without the slightest intention of walking back a peg . They seemed astounded at my refusal even at the price of dismissal . So now I am out of a job , with a wife and two youngsters depending on me for the means to live . It has been the greatest fight of my life , and according to my way of thinking I have won out at the cost of my job . The opportunity was mine to walk a liner 's bridge with a captain 's tin hat on ; but only at the price of keeping my mouth shut and my pen quiet . Your friend may be a fool , but he is honest enough to stand aside and take the blows when it comes to that , rather than to sail the seas hounded by capitalists and forced to do things which daily menace the lives of thousands of innocent travelers . I knew that I had to make my choice before the company would give me command . That was told me many moons ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself since my dismissal is : Is it worth it all ? The only answer I can get from my inner self is : Yes , yes , yes . My dismissal took place at 3 P.M. prompt . It is scarcely 5 P.M. now , so I 've lost no time in letting you know . What an intense sensation of relief I have ! The cloud of years has cleared at last and left me once more in the sunshine ? and with more fight than ever . The sea and I have parted at a time when command was in my hand . What I am going to do I do n't know yet . I do n't ask much of life if I can help my fellow man . Certain it is I wo n't go under . I am content to sweep streets or anything . I have confidence in myself now that I have been put through what was , for me , the supreme test ; and I have confidence in the future even if , at the moment , I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from letters of a much earlier period will explain certain allusions in the foregoing . You ask what started me on my course of radical thinking . Two incidents , both from the Boer War . The thin end of the wedge entered my mind from seeing an old Boer farmer bayoneted . I myself had killed a man before that . But this day , as I was riding along , I saw a sergeant order an infantryman ? a West Kent man ? to capture an old Boer who was making for a horse , ? his own , I fancy . The man dropped out of the ranks and took after the Boer , who was an Eighty-Oner , ' white-bearded , with black crape on his hat ; they never surrendered . Halt ! ' yelled the Kent man . The Boer kept on after the horse . Halt ! you old beggar ! ' yelled the Tommy again . The Boer paid no heed . I 'll give you one more chance ; up with your hands ! ' The Boer kept on . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a purely mechanical motion . The old man reached round and gripped the blade tightly with both hands . The Tommy gave it a twist . All the Boer 's fingers dropped off . The Tommy drew his blade out of the two bleeding stumps and stabbed the old man to the heart . The Boer fell dead . Then the Kent man unfixed his bayonet , wiped the blood off on his sleeve , fixed it again , and fell back into his place in the column . You beast ! ' thought I , and waited for him to pass me , expecting him to have the face of a fiend . As he came near , he turned his head my way and I got a good look at him . It was a worse shock than the sight of him killing the Boer . In his face was everything that manhood holds best . He was a fine-looking fellow ? a man of character . Two days before , I had killed a man myself . It was in a skirmish . My regimental chum sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so instinctively , and this fellow lunged past me , and fell with the force of his missed blow . I brought down the butt of my rifle on his skull and crushed it , as one breaks an egg . All the rest of the day I vomited at intervals . Once I cried . I could not eat . Two days earlier had come a letter from my mother asking me not to take life if I could help it . . . . It was n't the letter . It was the physical shock of seeing a man 's brains beaten in like jelly . I made up my mind then and there that I had had enough of patriotism . Toward the end of the war I was detailed with forty-nine other troopers to act as escort to the present King and Queen . They were then Duke and Duchess of York . The honor was supposed to be ours . Riding along the streets under the hot sun , between crowds of cheering people , and eyeing this undersized man , full to comparing him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows . I can not begin to tell you the shock it gave me . That , for me , was the beginning of the end . The contrast between this Duke and the men of his body-guard did the business for me . Later it dawned on me that I had been fighting an honest , hard-working Boer peasantry for the sake of a gang of London financiers . If ever I take up a gun again it will not be in cold blood . But I 'll fight for the poor against this rotten commercialism , even if I and my wife and children have to go clown into the gutter for it . April , 1914 . I have five men to work the lifeboats . According to the company 's books I have fifty ? the captain and five officers , the four quartermasters ( who steer the ship ) , the boatswain and boatswain 's mate , and his servant ( a boy of ten ) , the carpenter , the carpenter 's assistant , the joiner ? and so on . Actually , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work the boats . The rest have to be on station . The result is that we have to clean ship all night and work boats all day ; we ca n't turn the hose on the decks when the passengers are about . And the boats are in terrible shape , and getting worse all the time . I need fifty-five men instead of fifty men . Last trip I reported a raft with air-tank punctured , impairing its buoyancy . Nothing done about it . Capacity : thirty persons . She 'd drown thirty persons . And yet I am expected to bring the ship in clean with her boats in working order . It simply can not be done . And the money saved on extra men whom the company wo n't hire , the company is dragging out of our hides by overwork . I have a conscience . I wo n't let things go . So I work myself like a dog to keep things up . In Liverpool , after the last trip , I lay down on my couch for a nap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighbor put me to bed . Until I was told , I never knew how I got there . We officers know what it is to be thirty hours on our feet . I have been forty hours without sleep or rest , living on my pipe . After a siege like that , we go to sleep while we are walking the bridge . Our bodies keep awake , but nothing under heavens can keep our minds awake . I have been waked by bumping against the binnacle as I walked , or by banging my head against a stanchion ; or we even bump into each other . Heads soggy . Think quickly we could n't , not if we had to . November , 1913 . On that trip to New York our Hungarian crew deserted . The Balkan War had broken out and they were afraid that on the return they would be seized and sent to the front . We had to go to sea with a crew of Italian peanut-venders from West Street , who did n't know the meaning of a nautical term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first morning at sea I had to go down into the forecastle with a cudgel and drive them out . It was foggy and blowing a bit , and under such conditions the wind usually howls . No sooner were they on deck than she took the spray of a wave over her bow and drenched them ; drenched me , too . With that they all fell flat on the deck , rais- 160 RADICAL 'S ing their hands and screeching ' Madonna Christi ! ' To get one of them into the crow 's nest on lookout , I had to rig a tackle , pass a loop line under his armpits , and hoist him up . They could n't even swing out a boat on its davits . We had to wait until dark before swinging out the two emergency boats which we always keep ready , and then we had to get the officers out to do it . Dared not do it when the passengers were about . With such a crew we were navigating a ship with two thousand souls a.boaid of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager about this . What would you advise ? ' he asked . I 'd advise , if you could n't get a crew in New York , to get one in Boston , and if not in Boston , then along the New England coast where they grow real sailors , even if it cost you ? 100 to the man . That would be better than carrying two thousand people at the risk of their lives , with a crew that can do nothing , not even understand what is said to them . ' ' You are not a business man , ' says he . ' No , ' I said , ' I am a sailor . ' It came out all right ; it was good business , ' was his remark . But some of us have consciences , and such a reply as that does n't satisfy the conscience of an officer who is entrusted with the responsibility for those two thousand lives . September , 1912 . For the past month we have been idle in London , owing to the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we took digs right in the slums of the dock . We wanted to see how the very poorest live . The striking dock laborers in London have been quiet and orderly . It was in Liverpool that the rioting took place PROGRESS ? the Irish element . My wife and I went among them where they were gathered by the thousands , and not an ugly word were we offered . I have gone down aboard ship at one and two o'clock when they would all be out in the streets , ? they had nothing else to do , ? and no one offered to mo- lest me . They told me it was hardest on the kiddies . Whole families were starving . I was amazed at the pluck of these men . It takes pluck to tighten your belt another hole each day and say nothing . These fellows and their families were sober and clean : a very good type . They expected the strike to last much longer than it did , and were prepared to suffer accordingly . Even when they began to starve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you have nothing to back you . . Do n't think our new Association a seamen 's union is going to confine its operations to the betterment of sailors ' conditions only . The traveling public is to be taken into consideration also . If ever I reach the giddy height of command of a company passenger steamer , I feel , now , that I shall get sacked inside of a year . I 'll be up against my conscience and the old or . der of things . I have now been elected a member of the Executive Committee in London . This may , very soon , bring my name into print ; and it remains to be seen whether the company will have the intelligence to see in my actions a desire to remedy crying evils , or if it will look on me as a damned agitator and get rid of me as such . April , 1913 . My career as a committeeman of the union was brief and stormy . During the strike a meeting was called in London to indict the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best pressmen . The accusations were being read by a member of the committee . I interrupted : ' Those charges are not true . ' ' Are you with us or against us ? ' demanded the chairman . ' I am not with you , ' I told him , when you make charges which are not true . ' ' How do you know they are not true ? ' said he . I can go aboard my ship and within an hour bring back copies of the company 's regulations to prove it , ' I replied , ' and I warn these gentlemen of the press that if they go to print with these charges , knowing that they have been challenged , I will go over their heads to their editors . ' The meeting adjourned in confusion . ' Could n't you let this pass ? ' the committeeman said . ' Is n't it better for our cause to allow it to go unchallenged ? ' Nothing is good for your cause which is a knowing falsehood , ' I told them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle conducted on such lines . ' July , 1905 . On that voyage we touched at Odessa during one of the pogroms . The ship lay directly in the line of fire from a height where the Cossacks were stationed . Sometimes the bullets would ping ! against the vessel 's side . We had to keep under cover . Close to the docks where we lay was a heap of the dead , ? Jews , of course . To go ashore in the daytime was almost certainly to be shot . But at night we would crawl out , sneak ashore , and pull the half-dead living out from this heap of corpses and carry them aboard . Among others , we got out a woman and two of her children . I gave up my room to her . Two more of her children and her husband lay dead in the heap . She wept most of the time . . . . VOL , 117- NO.2 Two years afterward , whilst I was second-extra ' on the run between Liverpool and New York , on deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when some one without any warning whatever threw an arm around my neck and kissed me . I flung away and saw to my disgust that it was an untidy Jewish woman . She seized both my hands and kept repeating , ? Odess ' I Odess ' ! ' Then it all came over me . She was the same woman we had dragged out of that heap , and was coming out to New York with her brother . LAND OF PROMISE September I , 1915 . You may be rather surprised to hear of my new venture . The fact is , I had it out with myself after finishing with the company , and have taken to the land , farming . Your friend is now a farmer . In my last letter I merely said that the money-bags had decided to dispense with my services . The chairman , in a very nice manner , told me that after long deliberation and thought the board of directors had decided that I was not a proper person to command one of their ships , as my line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led them to suppose that company interests would suffer unless I altered my views to suit company traditions . I merely told them that I did more than an honest day 's work for a day 's pay , and beyond that , I considered that my thoughts and actions belonged to myself and I would take care that they were not influenced in any way by company dictates . That ended everything . Their decision was made final , and from that moment your friend ceased to be a sailor . Certain of the officials were taken aback at my attitude and expressed surprise . Gentlemen , ' I said , ' your decision leaves me undismayed , and the cloud that has been hanging over me for years has parted and left me once more in the light . ' Several offered me their services outside the company , but I declined them . They asked me to remember my wife and two children . I replied that they were my care , not theirs . They seemed staggered , and concluded that I must be possessed of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . All that now seems a long time ago . Since leaving I have had a happy time . I have walked a hundred miles on this island looking for a suitable place , and at last I have found one . Let me describe it to you . Compared to my house in Liverpool , the farmhouse is a hovel . It is perched up on the mountain side with a glorious view and glorious air ; also , one can catch a decent glimpse of the sea . There are eighty-seven acres of land to the place , a good lot of it heather-clad . It is situated close to the highest mountain . The post comes three times a week , and to post a letter means a four-mile walk . Grub is awfully difficult to get until I have a horse and cart . I 've had to make a six-mile walk for it to town , and six miles back , using the baby-cart as motive power . Water for the house means a walk up the mountain side about a thousand yards . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hive of bees , a fifty-thousand colony . In time I 'll get about thirty hives if the bees do well up here during the winter . What worries us most at present are the fleas . The place is swarming with them . The people who had the place before must have been dirty . Is it true that country people generally are so ? When I get the house in order , I am going to buy stock and implements and start pioughing up a few fields . I have built a small wall already . The place now looks like a jail . In fact , I 've called it ' 13 Jail . ' But there are great possibilities in it . When I get really settled and known , I am going in for politics . Of course you will probably know that the island has Home Rule . In time , I think , I shall be able to devote quite a lot of time to having a spar with the feudal system which is so strong , here . As an instance , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property : it all goes to the husband when she passes into the married state . There are quite a lot of such things that require modernizing . I wo n't be idle in the Cause . It is going to be hard work for a year or so , and I have no illusions on the matter . So long as I have won my battle over myself and have had my scrap with capitalism , I am happy . The loss of social position does n't cost me a wink of sleep . . . . Expecting this to happen some day , I have saved all I knew how , and I feel sure that I shall win over the critical period long before my savings are exhausted . We are out of writing paper and it means a twelve-mile walk to the nearest store , so I am using up sonny 's scribbling pad . October 3 , 1915 . The pigs are fed , the goat milked , and I have just robbed the hens of an egg or two . So now I can sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was painting the gate when the postman brought your letter this morning , just smartening the place up a bit before ploughing starts . Really , I am taking to work very kindly , though my hands are in a shocking state and my back gives me gip nearly all the time . But it is glorious to feel that every clod of earth I break is not done for a man who thunders along at forty knots an hour in a:motor car bought by the sweat of me and my like . Since I have been out in the wilds I have scarcely had the slightest headache . Before , I was all headaches , caused from threshing out the problems that meant either suicide or liberty . My position was untenable ; more so than you can ever know . I had either to abandon my convictions and ideals , gathered in a life 's journey , or get out . I was asked to accept company dictums , thereby strengthening my position and clearing all obstacles out of the way of future promotion . Fate ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and position , and according to many officers in the company , I have thrown away the substance to obtain the shadow . But you and I know which is the substance and which the shadow . As I have told you , I knew long ago that I had to make my choice before tine corn pany would give me command . It may have been intention or it may have been accidental ? the timing of it ? after the Dardanelles , when I had reached the pinnacle of Chief Officer-ship . Whether I would have been man enough to defy them if I had not been through the Dardanelles business I do not know ; but I do know that no power on earth could have forced me to lend a helping band at such wholesale slaughter again after what I saw and felt . Whether my country is right or wrong in the cause of the war , I say that it is absolutely wrong to see countless thousands of its best youth slaughtered in such cruel ways . There must be other ways of settling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go a long way- . Labor on our side is causing a lot of trouble . All unions are dead set against war profits , and friend Lloyd George more than anybody . It is practically impossible now for any concern to make more than an ordinary peace-day profit . And Labor is right . Why , in the first months of the war , when war spirit was at fever heat , the men lost sight of the fact that whilst they were sweating and cheering , some firms were making 60% profit ; others , over 100% , and others again nearly 200% . The Welsh miners were , I think , the first to resume their senses and ask what the employers were doing . The country got quite a shock . Why , the company was making more than three times the profit of ordinary years ; and this in a year of war , when food and necessities are nearly 30% higher than in normal times . Ships were run with four instead of seven officers . The extra work came out of our hides without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lunatic asylum than , I hope , I shall ever be again . One can not work seventy hours at a stretch in a broiling sun with guns roaring night and day , airships dropping bombs , and men being mangled into lumps of unrecognizable flesh and bone , without its wearing one out . It was not so much the overwork as the thought that stabbed me night and day , that no small part of the class that caused this slaughter are lounging in places where their skins are as safe as in peace times . I used to see red and want to get at their throats . I feel now that I can never destroy life again . The beasts I have so far will never lose their blood by my hands . I have a she-goat that follows me around like a dog . I could never hurt her . Many a good dinner I could have killed here ? partridge , hare , or grouse ? but I find it impossible to do so . Why , when I went to the well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog . I simply took it twenty yards away and let it go , knowing full well that it would hop back in again as soon as I cleared out . This may seem to you an extraordinary state of mind for a farmer to be in , but the fact is , I have promised myself not to take life in any shape or form again if I can possibly avoid it . The Dardanelles and my bees have cured me of all inclination to be cruel to man or beast . When the weather is dry and I have a minute to spare , I sit by my hive and watch the bees work . I have them all over my face and hands , and I seldom get a sting , and then only from a tired bee returning with its hind bags heavy with nectar from the heather . The adverse judgment of your friends on my conduct is interesting . It would be impossible , I suppose , for them to see the case as I saw it . And again , the majority of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even perhaps the props and builders . Give them a dose of bloodshed such as Europe is having and give them the same causes of it ; then , perhaps , they would find it impossible , as I did , to carry on . Let some of them be tried , and see how they ring . It is so hard for men who have been nursed all their lives to comprehend what human suffering is and what causes it . One must get out and see it . To do this some men can not pluck up enough courage ; others do not dare for fear of social ostracism . Self , always . For a man to shoulder others ' burdens and realize that he actually is his brother 's keeper requires self-effacement , and I suppose no man can do good work until that self-effacement takes place . At first it struck me as selfish and cowardly to bury myself out here . But what else could I have done ? Even if I had the stomach for it now , the firing line would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalism again , and that means , of course , that I shall never again go to sea . As you see , I have simply been forced out of society . .. . I 'm scarcely myself even yet . In fact , I shall never be my old self again . The Dardanelles knocked that old self out of me , and has made me the bitter enemy of the titled and capitalist classes . I have always been opposed to them , but without hatred . To-day I hate them with a hate that will die only with me . Those thousands of maimed men and thousands of others being blown into the air by shrapnel have seared me to my very soul . I only ask now to be shown the way to fight the causes responsible for such wholesale butchery . No , comrade . I can never again be as you have known me . I have suffered too much from what I have seen .                    @
