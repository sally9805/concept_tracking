txt The plan to knife the Fusion ticketi by repudiating at the Independence League City Convention last night the nominations of Prendergast and for Controller and President of the Board of Aldermen was carried out . The convention was marked by dissension and bitterness . The fight to put ; and Prendergast upon the league ticket was led by John J. Hopper and Sylvester Malone . After a long wrangle , which several times threatened to break up in a general fight , Joseph J. Holwell , a menu , lecturer of sounding . ' boards at 00 Oakland Street , Brooklyn , was nominal-A.1 for Controller , and Dennis , a contractor . of 210 Canal Street , Manhattan . was named by the convention for President of the Board of Aldermen . Other political developments of the day included the nomination of District Attorney Whitman for his present office by the Tammany County Convention . Dr. Thomas Darlington , formerly President of the Board of Health , was nominated for Borough President by Tammany . There were other surprises , among them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for County Clerk . Mayor Gaynor is expected to return to the city this morning and announce that he will be a candidate for Mayor . His supporters have been urging on him the adoption of the Fusion county and borough tickets . The Mayor , it is reported , has been averse to the idea , but his followers hope to win him over . The action of the Independence Leaguers was rather expected by  --  the Fusion forces , who were greatly heartened yesterday when made it clear that he would stay on the ticket . The Fusion forces , moreover . took heart when the Republicans , at designation meetings held in the afternoon , indorsed the borough , County , and the judicial ticket The great point for Fusion was that the Republicans had decided to stand by all along the line . That and the fact that had decided to ignore the Hearst assault gave the Fusion forces new courage . Mr. , the Fusionists learned , decided to stay on the Fusion ticket , no matter what occurred . Mr. Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Fusion ticket . The heads of the Fusion movement , Messrs . Hapgood and Price , afte rthey had looked over the situation , expressed themselves as pleased at the outlook . Most of the Fusionists said they did not see how Mr. Whitman could accept the nomination from Tammany Hall . Fight in League Convention . The first test of strength in last night 's convention of the Independence ) League came when James A. Allen , an attorney and one of W. R. Hearst 's political spokesmen , introduced a resolu-1 tion condemning and Prendergast for their alleged disloyalty to their platform subway pledges of four years ago , and a second resolution ordering that a letter be sent to John Purroy Mitchel. already designated by the Independence League as its candidate for the Mayoralty , in reply to his letter of yesterday declining to accept the Hearst indorsement unless his two running mates upon the Fusion ticket were named also . The two resolutions , which were carried by a rising vote , were as follows : Whereas . Borough President and Controller Prendergast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected , and have acted in shameful disregard of the public welfare . Resolved . That this committee hereby place on record the sentiment of the Independence League Party that Mr. and Mr. Prendergast are unworthy of its support . The second resolution read : Resolved . That the chair appoint a committee of ' five to prepare ' a reply to the letter of Mr. Mitchel and report at the conclusion of the nominations made tonight . The committee appointed to draft the letter to Mr. Mitchel was filled only after Registrar O'Loughlin of Kings County and John J. Hopper had both resolutely refused to serve upon it Chairman William .7 . Taylor then appointed a committee as follows : James A. Allen , Chairman : Arthur J. Largy , John .. I. O'Connor , Joseph J. Holwell , and Joseph Wilkinson . The letter , which was later adopted , read as follows : League 's Reply to Mitchel . New York , Aug. 26 , 1913 . Sir : I am ! n receipt of your favor of the 2Mh inst. , in which you state you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denies the nominations to your two associates upon the Fusion city ticket , and which further states that : ' - To reject Mr. and Mr. Prendergast upon their record in advocating the subway , contracts would be to punish them for the one act in which your judgment and my judgment were opposed to theirs . " Your communication has been laid by me before the City Committee of the Independence League Party , which after due consideration of the same directed me by resolution to advise you as follows : The Independence League is not opposed to Mr. and to Mr. Prendergast because its judgment as to the desirability of the subway contract differed from theirs . It opposes Mr. and Mr. Prendergast because they have been false to the platform pledges upon the faith - of which they were elected . Four years ago the platforms contained specific and clear Pledges with respect to the subway issue . Mr. and Mr. Prendergast deliberately stood upon these platforms . It was solely on the faith of their promises to fulfill these platform pledges-that they were elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were promptly repudiated after election . The Independence League therefore bas no confidence that if elected this year they would perform the promises that they now make , for their record indicates that any promises they make are solely for the purpose of securing election and are not regarded as binding after election . The Independence League Party considers It time to drive home the lesson that platform promises and solemn pledges made to seCure election can not be cast aside and disregarded with impunity after election . and therefore considers it its duty to defeat Mr. and Mr. Prendergast . The Independence League further disagrees with your suggestion that it would be dishonorable in you to accept its nomination unless Mr. IleAheny and Mr. Prendergast were likewise nominated . Four years ago we nominated you , as well as Mr. and Mr. Prendergast , although we did not nominate . Mr. Hannan , the Fusion candidate for Mayor . None of you then suggested that it was dishonorable to accept such nomination unless Mr. Bannard were likewise nominated . On the contrary . you welcomed the nomination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform with Mr. Hearst , who was opposing Mr. Bannard . At that time you saw nothing dishonorable in taking advantage of the nomination , and there is no difference in principle between the situation four years ago and the situation now . Moreover , if the failure of the Independence League Party to indorse Mr. and Mr. Prendergast means , as you indicate , the success of the Democratic candidates for President of the Board of Aldermen and Controller , we suggest that by the same token your refusal to accept the nomination of the Independence League Party means the success of the Tammany candidate for Mayor . The Independence League Party owes no allegiance to the Fusion city slate . It was I not consulted with respect to the Fusion ' city ticket ; It has no representatives upon the Fusion Committee of 101 , and it has yet to learn that any appointed committee can properly assume to exercise for a political party the functions for which its duly organized committees were elected at the last primaries . The Independence League desires to further the old-time principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best qualified irrespective of political affiliation ; acting upon this principle it is glad to support you as its candidate for Mayor , but declines to support Mr. and Mr. Prendergast . JAMES A. ALLEN , Chairman . To John Purroy Mitchel . Opening of the Convention . The proceedings of the convention opened in orderly fashion , but soon after the reading of the rollcall trouble began . James A. Allen . as secretary , read to the convention a telegram from Hearst denouncing both and Prendergast as traitors , and insisting that they could not be nominated consistently upon an Independence League ticket . This war fclic ; wed by the reading of Candidate John Purroy Mitchel 's letter in behalf Of his coneagues on the Fusion ticket . Mitchel 's letter was greeted with mingled boos and cheers . James A. Allen denounced both Prendergast and for having " betrayed the principle of municipal construction and operation of subways , upon which they had been nominated in 1909 . He said that both men had been consistent advocates of city-built subways , without the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star " chamber conferences held at the home of J. P. Morgan , Theodore P. Shonts , and Chairman Willcox of the Public Service Commission . " This convention will determine by its action to-night whether or not the existence of the Independence League as a separate political party is justified or not . We are going to settle the score to-night so far as Prendergast and arc concerned . It may be too late , as Mr. Mitchel has pointed out , to retrieve the wrong which has been done to the people of this city by the infamous subway contracts , but it is not too late for us to prove to the people and to the Committee of One Hundred and Seven that we refuse to condone the treachery of these two men . " Hopper Leads Opposition . As Mr. Allen concluded , John J. Hopper jumped to his feet and demanded recognition . Amid mingled applause and hisses he said . " I am a firm believer in municipal ownership , and I believe that the city could and should nave constructed its own subways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this point now . It is not the issue in this campaign . The issue is Tammany Hall and Tammany Hall alone . Four years ago the Fusion Committee of that day twice offered me the nomination for President of the Board of Aldermen . I refused the nomination because of the platform upon which it was offered . It is unjust to accus@ Mr. Prendergast or Mr of betraying their platform pledges . The platform of the ' Fusion forces in 1909 said that they favored the construction of subways by the city unless the city needed private capital . The Controller and the President of the Board of Alderman have not lived up to the platform of this party upon which they also accepted a nomination . but they have certainly not strayed far from the platform upon which they were originally nominated . " It is absurd for us to attack the right of the Committee of 107 to make nominations because we were not represented upon it . Mr. Snearn was invited to become a member of the committee and so was Mr. Palliser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to deny recognition to the action of the committee . " We tacitly recognized the authority of the committee when members of this organization appeared before it and presented our views and urged a certain lines of action . I labored day and night to obtain for Mr. Allen here the nomination for the r .... upreme Court which he desired . I think I was instrumental in preventing the nomination of Mr. for Mayor . I told the committee that if lie was nominated we would put a third ticket in the field . What rlgut have we now to refuse to ratify the action of the Fusion Committee ? " I disagree with Mr. upon many subjects , but with the exception of his subways policy in the Board of Estimate he has given to this borough a clean and conscientious administration . " He is 1,000 times better than the preceding Tammany incumbent . He believes in many things which this league has advocated : a short ballot , and other reforms . Do n't rush into the arms of Tammany Hall by refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN LINE . Drop Idea of Bolt and . indorse ' Fusion Candidates . While the Fusion situation , so far as keeping John Purroy Mitchel at the head of the ticket is concerned , cleared perceptibly yesterday , the Fusionists are still alarmed over the prominence of Mayor Gaynor as a possible rival , heading a ticket that will indorse all tile other Fusion candidates , as well as Over the attitude of William R. Hearst , who has refused to ' support George and William A. Prendergast , Mr. Mitchel 's attitude in refusing the Independence League nomination for Mayor unless that organization also nominates Mr. and Mr. Prendergast and the decision of Mr. to remain on the Fusion ticket ; no matter what occurs , . - did much to give the Fusion leaders new courage . District Attorney Charles S. Whitman also arrived in town , and assured the Fusionists that there was no cause for alarm , as the Republican organization intended to support the entire Fusion ticket . The Republican organization went on record as favoring the , Fusion slate , its Judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates for those offices . According to Norman Hapgood and Joseph M. Price , the head of the Fusion Committee . there is to be no change in the Fusion ticket . Everything , they said , was in very good condition , end they prophesied that the entire ticket would be elected . Mr. is going to answer Hearst in his own way and at his own time . He said yesterday that he did not intend to let the Independence League leader 's accusation of cowardice and of being a political traitor go unchallenged . The Fusion leaders held several conferences during the day with Mr. , Mr. ' Mitchel , and other candidates , anti impressed upoir:thetre:the necessity of keeping their skirts clear of the Gaynor ticket . Mr. Prendergast is in Europe , and the Fusionists have received no word from him . It was pointed out by the Fusionists that Mr. and Mr. Whitman could not very well afford to accept a nomination on a Gaynor ticket because the police and the subway issues would be prominent in the campaign . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor , some of the Fusionists argued , would make it appear that he ' was in favor of the Gaynor police policy , while with Mr. running with him , the subway argument would lose much of its force as it would appear that the Borough President was in accord with the early Gaynor subway policies . while it is well known that they were opposed to each other . Mr. , however , refused to commit himself regarding what he would do if he were nominated by the Gaynorites . " I will decide what to do when I have received the nomination , " he said . " As for the Hearst attack I have nothing to say at this time . except at no time did I contemplate resigning from the Fusion ticket . " It was the opinion of the Fusionists that the Hearst situation would settle itself . They expected it to die within a few days and be forgotten . Republicans Stand by I talon . Before the various Republican designating committees got together at the Murray Hill Lyceum , on Thirty-fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at which the district leaders agreed to indorse the Fusion slate and stand by County Chairman Samuel S. Koenig . It was said that Mr. Koenig had received word from District Attorney Whitman , v ; .. no did not arrive in the city until 6 o'clock in the afternoon , advising the Republicans not to bolt . It was a bitter dose for the Republicans to swallow , and they did not cPsguise their true feelings . It was one of the most remarkable gatherings of a political party ever held in the city . for the men who presented the names did . so Plainly against their will . The borough ticket was disposed of first . Former Senator Martin Saxe nominated Marcus M. Marks for Borough President . " I know there is considerable feeling among us about the ticket recommended by the Fusion Committee , " said Mr. Saxe , " but we have promised to accept it , and we will do so . When the time comes for real non-partisanship we will have real fusion , and not before . " Abraham Gruber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marks for fifteen years , and had found him one of the finest citizens of the city . The members of the committee very promptly indorsed the nomination of Mr. Marks by the Fusionists . The four Coroners were next designated . Alderman Marks presented the name of Israel L. Feinberg , Leader Ellison of the Seventeenth District named Herman Hellenstein , Thomas Rock named Timothy Healy , the Progressive , and Lloyd Stryker did the same for P. D. Riordan . Joseph Nejedly , leader of the Eighteenth District , threatened to start trouble by naming Dr. John J. Hoebel for Coroner , but Chairman Koenig did not let him get very far . Candidates for the Supreme Court were named next . Chairman Abraham Grubb ? of the Judiciary Committee took the platform and made a speech in which he praised both of the Fusion nominees , Eugene A. Philbin and Benjamin N. Cardozo . After telling- what a good record Mr. Philbin made in the District Attorney 's office Mr. Gruber said : " The selection of Mr. Cardozo , from the standpoint of law and fine legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope every Republican will do his utmost to elect him . I have been asked ' frequently of late why the Republicans refused to nominate Mr. Whitman for Mayor . I told them we wanted to , but that a committee of Fusionists , at the whim of a gentleman named Price , named their own ticket and that we promised to support it . if the Republicans had their way , every one would have named Charles Whitman as his candidate . " Charles S. Coleman of the Fifteenth District named Mr. Philbin saying that as they had to select a Democrat he was glad that it was a good Democrat . Mr. Philbin and Mr. Cardozo were promptly designated . The county slate was taken up next and John R. Davies of the 21st named William H. Wadhams for the Court of General Sessions , Morris Koenig of the Sixth District then named Carl C. Nott , for General Sessions . Both were designated . J. -W . Spencer , Jr .. named William L. Ransom . the Progressive , for Judge of the City Court ; George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Clerk : Max S. Grifenhagen was named for Sheriff by Gustav Hartman of the Sixth District . John J. Hopper , the Independence League leader , was named for Register by J. H. Davenport of the Twentythird District . All the designations were made . Frederick C. Tanner , leader of Mr. Whitman 's district , the Twenty-third , presented his name for the designation as District Attorney . " Whitman can afford to wait and the public will be there at the proper time , " said Mr. Tanner when the delegates quieted clown after cheering the District Attorney 's name . " No thief can afford to have him for District Attorney , " said Mr. Tanner , " and no honest man can afford not to have him . No political party or faction can afford to do without his services . His renunciation was an act of patriotism that will not be forgotten . " The delegates designated Mr. Whitman by acclamation , all standing up and cheering . As the delegates left the hall many openly said that they would not vote for Mr. - Mitchel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kings County caused excitement when he repeated a conversation which he said had taken place over the telephone between himself and Allen . He accused Allen of being disgruntled because he had not received a judicial nomination from the Fusion Committee , and said Allen had invited him , as the leader of Kings County , to join in a fight upon Mitchel and the entire ticket in the City Convention . " I ant going to give you the inside facts , " said O'Loughlin . " On Aug. 13 , 1913 , I had a telephone conversation with James A. Allen at Schuyler 5274. in which I was asked by Allen what I was going to do with the Hapgood bunch ' at the City Convention . " O'Loughlin then read question and answer as the conversation had taken place over the telephone . He quoted Allen as having alluded to Mitchel as " the worst trimmer in the Hapgood bunch . " " I thought that I was nominate- , for Judge , " O'Loughlin quoted Allen as saying . " And Mitchel told me that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nanded it to Ransom . Ransom was substituted after I had concluded my last conference with the committee . " O'Loughlin continued reading from a typewritten report of the conversation which he said he had dictated to a stenographer immediately after leaving the telephone . According to his report , Allen invited him to " get his crowd together and turn down the Fusion ticket at the Independence League Convention . " According- to O'Loughlin , he protested against such action . He quoted Allen as having . replied : " Do n't place any confidence in Mitchel . He 's the worst trimmer in the ' bunch . He is the slickest , oiliest customer I ever saw in my life . " O'Loughlin explained to the convention that he made these revelations because he had been called a " liar " in a city , committee meeting on Saturday night 1 when he accused Allen of having tried to knife Mitchel . Allen replied to O'Loughlin 's attack by saying that the telephone converseItion had been exaggerated . Says It is Hearst or Mitchel . The debate was halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Controller . Sylvester L. Malone nominated William A. Prendergast and begged the convention not to betray Fusion in the interests of Tammany Hall In presenting the name of Joseph J. Holwell , James A. Allen said : " We have come to the parting of the ways . You must choose between the leadersiSp Of John Purroy Mitchel and that of William R. Hearst . It ' you think that Mr. Mitchel has a right to tell you whom you shall nominate then go ahead . " Frank Torrey presented the name of James A. Bedell of Brooklyn/ . The rollcall showed : Holwell , 52 ; Prendergast , 25 , and Bedell , 21 . John J. Hopper named George for President of the Board of Aldermen , and James A.
