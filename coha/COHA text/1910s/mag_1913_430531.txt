Shortly before the middle of August there died at Zurich the most eminent of contemporary German socialists , the sole survivor of the remarkable group of leaders by whom were laid the foundations of the German Social Democracy a generation and more ago , ? August Ferdinand Bebel . It is a cause for gratulation among students of social and political movements that before his death Herr Bebel ? the " Red Pope , " his adversaries denominated him ? committed to writing his recollections of the men and measures of the early days of the German socialist propaganda . There is cause for regret , however , that the Autobiography in which these recollections are recorded was completed ( the portion of it , at least , which has reached print ) only to the year 1878 ; although if we are not to have the entire work as projected , the portion which has been printed , dealing as it does with the remoter and more formative period in the Social Democracy 's growth , may be assumed to be of the largest interest and value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiring triumph over adversity . The conditions surrounding his boyhood were hard and narrow . His father , a non-commissioned officer in the Prussian army , died in 1844 , when the boy was but four years old ; his mother died nine years later . The rudiments of an education were acquired in a poor-law school at Wetzlar , but at the age of thirteen the youth was thrown entirely upon his own resources and prospect of further schooling had to be abandoned . In 1853 he was apprenticed to a master-turner , and five years later he began tramping about the country as a journeyman . In 1860 he appeared at Leipzig , where steady employment was found and where , in February , 1861 , he attended his first public meeting of workingmen and joined his first workingmen 's society . In both politics and industry the times were unsettled , and the opportunity afforded a restless spirit such as Bebel to agitate , to argue , and to organize was unlimited . In May , 1863 , Lassalle 's " Manifesto , " commonly regarded as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shortly afterwards there was formed the General German Labor Union , whose purpose was to make of labor , in accordance with Lassalle 's ideas , an organized power in politics . Bebel , who from 1863 to 1872 served continuously as vice-president of the Leipzig Society for the Promotion of Knowledge among the Working Classes , at first opposed the propaganda for manhood suffrage , on the ground that " the workers were not yet ripe for it , " and long held out against the general programme of the Las ? - salleans . In truth he was not a socialist until , having occasion to read the writings of the Lassalleans in order to combat them , he fell under conviction and was won over . Gradually , however , he became a socialist of the socialists , a universal suffragist , and an outspoken enemy of the entire social order based on capitalism . " I was a Saul , " he says , " and became a Paul ; and a Paul I have remained even unto the evening of my life , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I shall remain to the end , as long as my strength is left me . " In 1867 Bebel was elected a Labor member of the North German Diet . In 1871 he was chosen to a seat in the newly constituted Reichstag , and , except during one prolonged interval of imprisonment , and during the years 1881-1883 , he was at all times thereafter until his death a member of Parliament . From the first he participated actively in debate . He refused to vote the subsidies asked at the beginning of the war with France , and he opposed the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine . By his independence of speech and action he , of course , incurred the displeasure of the authorities . In December , 1870 , he was imprisoned on a charge of attempted high treason ; and in 1872 he was tried and condemned to two years of confinement in a fortress . Released in 1875 , he was imprisoned again for six months in 1877 , on a charge of libelling Bismarck . These periods of enforced inactivity , however , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have arrived at the conclusion that to add the element of martyrdom to the sources of power which the man already possessed would be a mistaken policy . At any rate , there was no further interference with his personal freedom . The present volume brings us only to the eve of the attempts on the life of the Emperor in 1878 , and the anti-socialistic legislation by which those unfortunate episodes were followed . This was also the year in which there took place the final amalgamation of the several organizations which have entered into the composition of the Social Democratic party , so that it affords a convenient division point in the history of the great movement with which Bebel 's name will ever be linked . The writer , in summing up the situation at this point , says : " The play was ready to begin . It was intended to be a tragedy , in the course of which the Social Democratic party was to be sacrificed upon the altar of the monarchical and capitalistic interests . But , as before , it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a comedy , and the Hercules who carne forth to strike us down with his bludgeon was himself laid low after an inglorious ten years ' war against the hated enemy , and cumbered the field of battle with his corpse . Whereas in the old days of the Empire the battle-cry of the advancing armies was ' To me , Guelph ! To me , Ghibbelline ! ' it was now ' To me , Bismarck ! To me , Social Democrats ! ' " In style , the narrative is simple and straightforward ; in substance , it is interesting and often illuminating . It reveals a forceful , intense , yet kindly personality ; and it tells a story that no interpreter of modern European affairs can afford to ignore . Especially instructive are the comments which are made upon Bismarck 's effort to exploit the interests of labor in the earlier years of his ministry , the intimate characterizations of Liebknecht , Schweitzer , and other socialist leaders , and the more or less incidental portrayal of the habits , ideas , and aspirations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is nothing in the book that is superfluous , little that is even unimportant .
