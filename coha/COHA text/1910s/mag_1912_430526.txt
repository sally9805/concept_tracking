 | LET us analyze the discipline obtained by our method , which is based on liberty . The accumulated experience we have had since the publication of the Italian version of " Pedagogia Scientifica " has repeatedly proved to us that in our classes of little children , numbering forty and even fifty , the discipline is much better than in ordinary schools . Whoever visits a well-kept school ( such as , for instance , the one in Rome directed by my pupil Anna Maccherani ) is struck by the discipline of the children . There are forty little beings , from three to seven years old , each one intent on his own work ; one is going through an exercise for the senses , one an arithmetical exercise ; one is handling the letters , one is drawing , one is lacing together the pieces of cloth upon one of the little frames , one is dusting . Some are seated at a table , some on a rug on the floor . There are muffled sounds of objects lightly moved about , of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy only partly repressed : " Teacher ! Teacher ! " an eager call : " Look ! see what I 've done . " But , as a rule , there is entire absorption in their work . The teacher moves about slowly and silently , goes to any child who calls her , supervising operations in such a way that any one who needs her finds her at his elbow , and whoever does not need her is not reminded of her existence . Sometimes hours go by without a word . They seem " little men , " as they were called by some visitors to the Casa dei Bambini , or , as others suggested , " judges in deliberation . " Absolute Obedience in the Houses of Childhood In the midst of such intense interest in work it never happens that quarrels arise over the possession of an object . If any one accomplishes something especially fine , his achievement is a source of admiration and joy to others : no heart suffers from another 's wealth , but the triumph of one is a delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all seem happy and satisfied to do what they can , without feeling jealous of the deeds of others . The little fellow of three works peaceably beside the boy of seven , just as he is satisfied with his own height and does not envy the older boy 's stature . Everything is growing in the most profound peace . If the teacher wishes the whole assembly to do something , for instance leave the work which interests them so much , all she need do is to speak a word in a low tone , or make a gesture , and they are all attention ; they look at her with eagerness , anxious to know how to obey . Often a visitor wishes to hear how a child , now painting , can sing . The child leaves his painting to be obliging ; but the instant his courteous action is completed , he returns to his interrupted work . Sometimes the smaller children finish their work before they obey . A very surprising result of their discipline came to our notice during the examinations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These examinations were practical , and accordingly groups of children were put at the disposition of the teachers being examined , who , according to the subject drawn by lot , took the children through a given exercise . While the children were waiting their turn they were allowed to do just as they pleased . They worked incessantly , and returned to their undertakings as soon as the interruption caused by the examination was over . Every once in a  | while one of them came to show us a drawing made during the wait . Miss George of Chicago , who was present many times when this happened , and Madame Pujol , who founded the first House of Childhood in Paris , were astonished at the patience , the perseverance , and the inexhaustible amiability of the children . Faultless Table Manners of the Children Any one who has watched them setting the table must have passed from one surprise to another . Little four-year-old waiters take the knives and forks and spoons and distribute them to the different places ; they carry trays holding five water-glasses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying big tureens full of hot soup . Not a mistake is made , not a glass is broken , not a drop of soup is spilled . During the whole meal unobtrusive little waiters watch the table assiduously : not a child empties his soup-plate without being offered more , or , if he is ready for the next course , without having a waiter briskly carry off his soup-plate . Not a child needs to ask for more soup or to announce that he has finished . Remembering the usual condition of fouryear-old children , who cry , who break whatever they touch , who need to be waited on , every one is deeply moved by the sight I have just described , which evidently is caused by occult energies latent in the depths of the human soul . I have often seen the spectators of this banquet of little ones moved to tears . Discipline of Children Can Never be Obtained by Commands But such discipline could never be obtained by commands , by sermonizings ? in short , by any of the disciplinary devices universally known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an orderly condition , but their life was deepened and enlarged . In fact , such discipline is on the same plane with school exercises extraordinary for the age of the children ; and it certainly does not depend on the teacher , but on a sort of miracle occurring in the inner life of each child . If we try to think of parallels in the life of adults , we are reminded of the phenomenon of conversion , of superhuman heightening of strength of martyrs and apostles , of the constancy of missionaries , of the obedience of monks . Nothing else in the world , except such things , is on a spiritual height equal to the discipline of the Casa dei Bambini . To obtain such discipline it is quite useless to count on reprimands or spoken exhortations . Such means might perhaps at the beginning have an appearance of efficacy ; but very soon , the instant that real discipline appears , all of this falls miserably to the earth , an illusion confronted with reality : " Night gives way to day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a given moment it happens that a child becomes keenly interested in a piece of work , showing it by the expression of his face , by his intense attention , by his perseverance in the same exercise . That child has set foot in the road leading to discipline . Whatever be his undertaking , an exercise for the senses , an exercise in buttoning up or lacing together , or in washing dishes , it is all one and the same . Children Must be Disciplined by Giving Them Worn . They Want to Do On our side , we can have some influence on the permanence of this phenomenon by means of repeated " lessons of silence . " The perfect immobility , the attention alert to catch the sound of the names whispered from a distance , then the carefully coordinated movements executed so as not to knock against chair or table ; so as barely to touch the floor with the feet ? all this is a most efficacious preparation for the task of setting in order the whole personalit the motor forces and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we mu , : supervise it with scrupulous accuracy , graduating the exercises as experience has taught us . Our effort as teachers to establish discipline is to apply the principles of the method rigorously . It is not to be obtained by words : no man learns self-discipline " through hearing another man speak . " The phenomenon of discipline needs as preparation a series of complete actions . such as are presupposed in the complete application of a really educative method . Discipline is reached always by indirect means . The end is obtained , not by attacking the mistake and fighting it , but by developing activity in spontaneous work . This work can not be arbitrarily offered , and exactly here comes in the method : it must be work which the human being instinctively desires to do , work toward which the latent tendencies of life naturally turn or toward which the individual , step by step , ascends . Why Babies Are So Undisciplined Such is the work that sets the personality in order and opens wide before it infinite possibilities of growth . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little baby : it is fun-  | damentally a lack of muscular discipline . The child is in perpetual disorderly movement : he throws himself down , he makes queer gestures , he cries . What underlies all this is a latent tendency to seek that coordination of movement which will be established later . The baby is a man not yet sure of the movements of his bodily muscles or of his tongue ; he will become so , but for the present he is abandoned to experimentation full of mistakes and of fatiguing efforts toward a desirable end . latent in his instinct , but not clear in his consciousness . To say to the baby , " Stand still , as I do , " brings no light into his darkness ; commands can not aid in the process of bringing order into the complex psycho-muscular system of an individual in process of evolution . We are confused at this point by the example of the adult who , through a wicked impulse , prefers disorder , and who may ( granted that he can ) obey a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward that order which he recognizes and which is within his capacity to achieve . In the case of the little child it is a question of aiding the natural evolution of voluntary action . Hence it is necessary to teach all the coordinated movements , analyzing them as much as possible and developing them bit by bit . Children Do Not Know How to " Be Quiet " Until They Are Taught Thus , for instance , it is necessary to teach the child the various degrees of immobility leading to silence ; the movements connected with rising from a chair and sitting down , with walking , with tiptoeing , with following a line drawn on the floor , keeping an upright equilibrium ; the child is taught to move objects about , to set them down more or less carefully , and , finally , the complex movements connected with dressing and undressing himself ( analyzed on the lacing and buttoning frames at school ) ? and even for each of these exercises the different parts of the movement must be analyzed . Perfect immobility and the successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customary command , " Be quiet ! Be still ! " When we consider the lack of muscular discipline natural to his age , it is not astonishing , but very natural , that the child by means of such exercises should learn self-discipline . In short , he responds to nature because he is in action ; but these actions , being directed toward an end , have no longer the appearance of disorder , but of work . This is discipline which represents an end to be attained by means of a number of conquests . The child disciplined in this way is no longer the child he was at first , who knows how to be good passively ; he is an individual who has made himself better , who has overcome the usual limits of his age , who has made a great step forward , who has conquered his future in his present . The Confusing Orders that Grown People Give to Children He has , therefore , enlarged his dominion . He will not need to have some one always at hand to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet ! Be good ! " The goodness he has conquered can not be summed up by inertia : his goodness now is all made up of action . As a matter of fact , good people are those who advance toward the good ? that good which is made up of their own self-development and of external acts of order and usefulness . In our efforts with the child , external acts are the means to stimulate internal development , and they appear as its manifestation , the two elements being inextricably intertwined . Work develops the child spiritually ; but the child who is better developed spiritually works better , and his improved work fascinates him ; hence he continues to develop spiritually . Discipline is , therefore , not a fact , but a path ? a path in following which the child grasps the abstract conception of goodness with an exactitude that is fairly scientific . But beyond everything else he savors the supreme delights of that spiritual order which is attained indirectly through conquests directed toward their own ends . In that long preparation the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner treasure-house , in which he is steadily piling up that sweetness and strength which will be the source of righteousness . In short , the child has not only learned to move about and to perform useful acts : he has learned a special grace of action which makes his gestures more correct and attractive , and which beautifies his hands and all his body ( because it is sure of itself ) ; which refines the expression of his face and of his serenely brilliant eyes ; and which shows that spiritual life has begun in another human being . Orderly Action Increases the Child 's Nervous Energy I t is obviously true that coordinated actions , developed spontaneously little by little ( that is , chosen and directed in the exercises by the child himself ) , must call for less effort than the disorderly actions performed by the child who is left to his own devices . True rest for muscles ,  | intended by nature for action , is in orderly action ; just as true rest for the lungs is the normal rhythm of respiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is to force them away from their natural motor impulse , and hence , besides tiring them , means forcing them into a state of degeneration ; just as the lungs , forced into immobility , would die instantly . and the whole organism with them . It is , therefore , necessary to keep clearly in mind the fact that rest , for whatever naturally acts , is in some specified form of action corresponding to its nature . To act in obedience to the hidden precepts of nature ? that is rest ; and in this special case , since man is meant to be an intelligent creature , the more intelligent his acts are , the more he finds repose in them . When a child acts only in a disorderly , disconnected manner , his nervous force is under a great strain ; while , on the other hand , his nervous energy is positively increased and multiplied by intelligent actions . The Baby of the Pincian Gardens By analogy , it can be said of the intellectual development of the child that the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means searching for its end , " which goes through exhausting experiments , left as it is to its own resources and too often really persecuted . Once , in our public park in Rome , the Pincian Gardens , I saw a baby of about a year and a half , a beautiful , smiling child , who was toiling to fill a little pail by shoveling gravel into it . Beside him was a smartly dressed nurse , evidently very fond of him , the sort of nurse who would consider that she gave the child the most affectionate and intelligent care . It was time to go home , and the nurse was exhorting the baby patiently to leave his work and let her put him into the baby-carriage . Seeing that her exhortations made no impression on the little fellow 's firmness , she herself filled the pail with gravel , and set pail and baby into the baby-carriage , with the fixed conviction that she had given him what he wanted . I was struck by the loud cries of the child , and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his little face . What an accumulation of wrongs weighed down that nascent intelligence ! The little boy did not wish to have the pail full of gravel : he wished to go through the motions necessary to fill it , thus satisfying a need of his vigorous organism . The child 's unconscious aim was his own self-development , not the external fact of a pail full of little stones . The vivid attractions of the external world were only empty apparitions : the need of his life was a reality . As a matter of fact , if he had filled his pail he would probably have emptied it out again , in order to keep on filling it up until his inner self was satisfled . It was the feeling of working toward this satisfaction that , a few moments before , had made his face so rosy and smiling ; spiritual joy , exercise , and sunshine were the three rays of light ministering to his splendid life . Self-Development Is Almost the Only Pleasure of Children That commonplace episode in the life of that child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the best and most cherished . They are not understood , because the adult judges then by his own measure : he thinks that the child 's wish is to obtain some tangible object , and lovingly helps him to do this ; whereas the child , as a rule , has for his unconscious desire his own self-development . Hence he despises even -- thing already attained , and yearns for that which is still to be sought for . For instance , he prefers the action of dressing himself to the state of being dressed , even finely dressed ; he prefers the act of washing himself to the satisfaction of being clean ; he prefers to make a little house for himself rather than merely to own it . His own self-development is his true and almost his only pleasure . The self-development of the little baby , up to the end of his first year , consists to a large degree in taking in nutrition ; but afterward it consists in aiding the orderly establishment of the psycho-physiological functions of his organism . That beautiful baby in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coordinate his voluntary actions ? to exercise his muscles by lifting , to train his eye to estimate distances , to exercise his intelligence in the reasoning connected with his undertaking , to stimulate his will power by deciding his own actions : while she who loved him , believing that his aim was to possess some little stones , made him wretched . To have learned something is , for the child only a point of departure . When he has learned something , then he begins to enjoy repeating the exercise , and he does repeat it a great number of times , with the most apparent sansfaction . He enjoys executing that act because by means of it he is developing his psychic activities . There results from the observation of this fact a criticism of what is done to-day in many schools ? when , for instance , the pupils are questioned , and the teacher says to some one  | who is eager to answer , " No , not you , because you know it , " and puts her question specially to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who do not know are made to speak , those who do know to be silent . This happens because of considering the act of knowing something as final . Why Children Like to Repeat an Act Over and Over And yet , how many times it happens to us in ordinary life to repeat the very thing we know best , the thing we care most for , the thing to which some living force in us responds . We love to sing musical phrases that are very familiar , which we enjoy because they form a part of the fabric of our lives . We love to repeat stories of things which please us , which we know very well , even though we are quite aware that we are saying nothing new . No matter how many times we repeat the Lord 's Prayer , it is always new . No two persons could be more convinced of mutual love than sweethearts , and yet they are the very ones who repeat endlessly that they love each other . But , in order to repeat in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated ; there must be a mental grasp of this idea , which is indispensable to the beginning of repetition . In the repetition , not in the mere grasping of the idea , consists the exercise which develops life . When a child has attained this condition of repeating an exercise , he is on the way to self-development , and the external sign of this condition is his self-discipline . This phenomenon does not always occur . The same exercises are not repeated by children ef all ages . In fact , repetition corresponds to a need . Here steps in the experimental method of education . It is necessary to offer those exercises which correspond to the need of development felt by organisms ; and if the child 's e has carried him past a certain need , it is Ulmer possible to obtain in its fullness a developsent which missed its proper moment . Hence children grow up often fatally and irrevocably imperfectly developed . The Patience of Children and the Impatience of Grown-up People Another very interesting observation is that which relates to the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are undertaking something for the first time are extremely slow . Their life is governed in this respect by laws especially different from ours . Little children accomplish , slowly and perseveringly , complicated operations agreeable to them , such as dressing , undressing , cleaning their rooms , washing themselves , setting the table , eating , etc . In all this they are extremely patient , overcoming all the difficulties presented by an organism still in process of formation . We , on the other hand , noticing that they are " tiring themselves out " or " wasting time " in accomplishing something which we would do in a moment and without the least effort , put ourselves in the child 's place and do it ourselves . Always with the same erroneous idea that the end to be attained is the completion of the action , we wash and dress the child , we snatch out of his hands objects which he loves to handle , we pour the soup into his bowl , we feed him , we set the table for him . And after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who , even with benevolent intentions , overbear others , we consider him to be incapable and inept . We often speak of him as " impatient " simply because we are not patient enough to allow his actions to follow laws of time differing from our own ; we call him " tyrannical " exactly because we employ tyranny toward him . This stain , this false imputation , this calumny on childhood , has become an integral part of the theories concerning childhood , in reality so patient and gentle . The Naughtiness of Children Only Their Defense of the Right to Live The child , like every strong creature fighting for the right to live , rebels against whatever offends that occult impulse within him which is the voice of nature and which he ought to obey ; and he shows with violent actions , with screaming and weeping , that he has been overborne and forced away from his mission in life . He shows himself to be a rebel , a revolutionist , an iconoclast against those who do not understand him , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing him backward in the highway of life . Thus even the adult who loves him rivets about his neck another calumny , confusing his defense of his molested life with a form of innate naughtiness characteristic of little children . What would become of us if we fell into the midst of a population of jugglers , or of quick-change impersonators of the variety hall ? ? if , as we continued to act in our usual way , we saw ourselves assailed by these sleight-ofhand performers , hustled into our clothes , fed so rapidly that we could scarcely swallow , if everything we tried to do was snatched from our hands and completed in a twinkling and we ourselves reduced to impotence and to a  | humiliating inertia ? Not knowing how else to express ourselves , we would defend ourselves from these madmen with blows and yells ; and they , having only the best will in the world to serve us , would call us naughty , rebellious , and incapable of doing anything . Something of this sort occurs between children and adults . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exercises that the education of the senses consists ; their aim is not that the child shall know colors , forms , and the different qualities of objects , but that he shall refine his senses in an exercise of attention , of comparison , of judgment . These exercises are true intellectual gymnastics . Such gymnastics , reasonably directed by means of various devices , aid in the formation of the intellect , just as physical exercises fortify the general health and quicken the growth of the body . The child who trains his various senses separately , by means of external stimuli , concentrates his attention and develops piece by piece his mental activities , just as with separately prepared movements he trains his muscular activities . These mental gymnastics are not merely psycho-sensual , but they prepare the way for spontaneous association of ideas , for ratiocination developing out of definite knowledge , for a harmoniously balanced intellect . They are the powder-trains which bring about those mental explosions which delight the child so intensely when he makes discoveries in the world about him , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glories in the new things which are revealed to him in the outside world , and in the exquisite emotions of his own growing consciousness ; and , finally , when there spring up in him , almost by a process of spontaneous ripening , like the internal phenomena of growth , the external products of learning ? writing and reading . The Natural Instinct of a Child to Touch and Handle Things I happened once to see a two-year-old child , the son of a medical colleague of mine , who , fairly fleeing from his mother who had brought him to me , threw himself on the litter of things covering his father 's desk , the rectangular writing-pad , the round cover of the inkwell . I was touched to see the intelligent little creature trying his best to go through the exercises which our children repeat with such endless pleasure till they have fully committed them to memory . The father and the mother pulled the child away , reproving him , and explaining that there was no use trying to keep that child from handling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and naughty . " How often we see children reproved because , though they are told not to , they " will take hold of everything . " Now , it is precisely by means of guiding and developing this natural instinct " to take hold of everything , " and to recognize the relations of geometrical figures , that we prepare our little four-year-old men for the joy and excitement they experience later over the phenomenon of spontaneous writing . The child who throws himself on the writingpad , the cover to the ink-well , and such objects , always struggling in vain to attain his , desire , always hindered and thwarted by people stronger than he , always excited and weeping over the failure of his desperate efforts , is wasting nervous force . His parents are mistaken if they think that such a child ever gets any real rest , just as they are mistaken when they call " naughty " the little man longing for the foundations of his intellectual edifice . The children in our schools are really at rest , ardently and blessedly free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or grooves the geometric figures offered to their instinct for higher self-development ; and they , rejoicing in the most complete spiritual calm , have no notion that their eyes and hands are initiating them into the mysteries of a new language . Obedience Not a Simple Act of Will The majority of our children become calm as they go through such exercises , because their nervous system is at rest . Then we say that such children are quiet and good : external discipline , so eagerly sought after in ordinary schools , is more than achieved . However , as a calm man and a self-disciplined man are not one and the same , so here the fact which manifests itself externally by the calm of the children is a phenomenon really merely physical and partial compared to the real selfdiscipline which is being developed in them . Often ( and this is another misconception ) we think all we need to do , to obtain a voluntary action from a child , is to order him to do it . We pretend that this phenomenon exists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We find little children specially disobedient ; or , rather , their resistance , by the time they are four or five years old , has become so great that we are in despair and almost tempted to give up trying to make them obey . We force ourselves to praise " the virtue of obedience " to little  | children ( which , according to us , should belong specially to infancy , should be the " infantile virtue " ) exactly because we can make children practise it only with the greatest difficulty . We need only reflect that this " obedience , " which we treat so lightly , occurs later as a natural tendency in older children , and then as an instinct in the adult , to realize that it springs spontaneously into being , and that it is one of the strongest instincts of humanity . We find that society rests on a foundation of marvelous obedience , and that civilization goes forward on a road made by obedience . Human organizations are often founded on an abuse of obedience ; associations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social problems center about the necessity of rousing man from a state of " obedience " which has led him to be exploited and brutalized ! Obedience , naturally , is sacrifice . We are so accustomed to an infinity of obedience in the world , to a condition of self-sacrifice , to a readiness for renunciation , that we call matrimony the blessed condition , although it is made up of obedience and self-sacrifice . The soldier , whose lot in life is to obey if it kills him , is envied by the common people , while we consider any one who tries to escape from obedience as a malefactor or a madman . Besides , how many people have had the deeply spiritual experience of an ardent desire to obey something or some person that leads them along the path of life ? ? more than this , a desire to sacrifice something for the sake of this obedience ? It is , therefore , entirely natural that , loving the child , we should point out to him that obedience is the law of life ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one who is confronted with the characteristic disobedience of little children . Children Can Not Obey Until They Have Been Taught How But obedience can be reached only through a complex formation of the psychic personality . To obey , it is necessary not only to wish to obey , but also to know how to . Since , when a command to do a given thing is given , we presuppose a corresponding active or inhibitive power in the child , it is plain that obedience must follow the formation of the will and of the mind . To prepare in detail this formation with detached exercises is , therefore , indirectly to urge the child toward obedience . When the child completes coordinated actions directed toward a given end , when he achieves something he set out to do , when he repeats patiently his DNTESSORI 101 exercises , he is training his positive will power . Similarly , in a very complicated series of exercises He is setting in activity his powers of inhibition : for instance , in the " lesson of silence , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child is waiting to be called ; later for a rigorous self-control , when he is called and would like to answer joyously and run to his teacher , and instead is perfectly silent , moves very carefully , taking the greatest pains not to knock against chair or table or to make a noise . Training Children 's Will Power Other inhibitive exercises are the arithmetical ones , when the child , having drawn a number by lot , must take from the great mass of objects before him , apparently entirely at his disposition , only the number corresponding to the number in his hand , whereas ( as experience has proved ) he would like to take the greatest number possible . Furthermore , if he chances to draw the zero he stands patiently with empty hands . Still another training for the inhibitive will power is in " the lesson of zero , " when the child , called upon to come up zero times and give zero kisses , stands quiet , conquering with a visible effort the instinct which would lead him to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school dinners , who carries the big tureen full of hot soup , isolates himself from every external stimulant which might disturb him , resists his childish impulse to run and jump , does not yield to the temptation to brush away the fly on his face , and is entirely concentrated on the great responsibility of not dropping or tipping the tureen . A little boy of four and a half , every time he set the tureen down on a table so that the little guests might help themselves , gave a hop and a skip , but then . took up the tureen again to carry it to another table , repressing himself to a sober walk . He never left his task before he had passed the soup to the twenty tables , and he never forgot the vigilance necessary to control his actions . Will power , like all other activities , is invigorated and developed through methodical exercises ; and all our exercises for will power are also mental and practical . The child seems to be learning exactitude and grace of action , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read and write ; but much more profoundly he is learning how to become his own master , how to be a man of prompt and resolute will . Besides the exercises for developing will power , the other factor in obedience is the capacity to perform the act necessary to obey .  | One of the most interesting observations made by my pupil Anna Maccherani ( at first in the school in Milan and afterward in that on the Via Guisti in Rome ) relates to the connection between obedience in a child and his " knowing how . " Children Often Unable to Perform the Same Act Twice Obedience appears in the child as a latent instinct as soon as his personality begins to take form . For instance , a child begins to try a certain exercise , and suddenly one time he goes through it perfectly . He is delighted , stares at it , and wishes to do it over again , but for some time the exercise is not a success . Then comes a time when he can do it nearly every time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to do it . The external command does not , as yet , produce the voluntary act . When , however , the exercise always succeeds with absolute certainty , then an order from some one else brings about , on the child 's part , orderly , adequate action ; that is , the child is able each time to execute the command received. - That these facts ( with variations in individual cases ) are laws of psychical development is apparent from every one 's experience with children , in school or at home . One often hears a child say : " I did do such and such a thing , but now I ca n't ! " or a teacher , disappointed by the incompetence of a pupil , will say : " Yet that child was doing it all right ? and now he ca n't ! " Finally there is the period of complete development , in which the capacity to perform some operation is permanently acquired . There are , therefore , three periods : a first , subconscious one , when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself by a mysterious inner impulse in the midst of disorder , producing as external result a completed act , which , however , being outside the field of consciousness , can not be reproduced at will ; a second , conscious period , when there is some action on the part of the will which is present during the process of the development and establishing of the acts ; and a third period when the will can direct and cause the acts , thus answering the command from some one else . Now , obedience follows a similar sequence . In the first period of spiritual disorder , the child fails to obey , exactly as if he were physically deaf , and out of hearing of commands . In the second period , he would like to obey ; he looks as though he understood the command and would like to respond to it , but can not ? or at least , does not always succeed in doing it is not " quick to mind , " and shows no pleasure when he does . In the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as he becomes more and more perfect in the exercises , he is proud because he knows how to obey . This is the period in which he runs joyously to obey , and leaves at the most gentle request whatever is interesting him , so that he may quit the solitude of his own life , and enter with the act of obedience into the spiritual existence of another . To this order , established in a consciousness formerly chaotic , are due all the phenomena of discipline and of mental development , which open out like a new creation . From minds thus set in order , when " night is separated from day , " come sudden emotions and mental feats which recall the Biblical story of the creation . The child has in his mind not only what he has laboriously acquired , but the free gifts which flow from spiritual life , the first flowers of affection , of gentleness , of spontaneous love for righteousness , which perfume the souls of such children and give promise of the " fruits of the Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit is love , joy , peace , long-suffering , gentleness . goodness , faith , meekness . " They are virtuous because they exercise patience in repeating their exercises , long-suffering in yielding to the commands and desireof others , good in rejoicing in the well-being of others without jealousy or rivalry ; they live , doing good in joyousness of heart and in peace , and they are eminently , marvelously industrious . But they are not proud of such righteousness . because they were not conscious of acquiring it as a moral superiority . They have set their feet in the path leading to righteousness , simply because it was the onk way to attain true self-development and learning ; and they enjoy with simple hearts tin fruits of peace which hang along that path . These are the first outlines of an experiment which shows a form of indirect discipline in which there is substituted for the critical and sermonizing teacher a rational organization o-i work and of liberty for the child . It involves conception of life more usual in religious fieldthan in those of academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energies mankind ; but it is founded on work and or liberty , which are the two paths to all civic progress .
