( The living room in the home of a small farmer in East Prussia . It is simple but not squalid . In the corner on a long low couch is a thing  --  entirely covered with a white sheet . At either side of what must be the head is a lighted candle . On the wall there hangs a great crucifix . The day is just breaking and with the growing light there is visible the figure of a woman seated by the couch , her hands folded in her lap , her head stiffly erect . At length the head begins to droop and droop , and the figure relaxes . A door opens , there is a heavy tread , and in an instant the woman is on her feet . A man , tall , broad-shouldered , with the face and hands of a worker , has entered the room . He is dressed , though , for the church rather than for the fields . WILLIAM ( In an attempted whisper )  --  " Margaret ! Well ? " ( Margaret points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He sinks at the foot of the couch ) MARGARET ( Touching him gently )  --  " William ! " WILLIAM ( Roused ; rising and crossing himself )  --  " You are right ! " ( With an effort ) " When  --  when did  --  it happen ? " MARGARET " Just after midnight . " p. 3 WILLIAM " And you did n't call me ! " MARGARET " I thought it would be time this morning . It was the first sleep you 'd had since they brought him home . " WILLIAM ( Eagerly )  --  " Did he speak  --  did he ask for me ? " MARGARET " He " ( Stops ) " No , not a word . It was as though he were falling asleep . " WILLIAM " Little Paul ! He was 19 last month . Why , I could lift him with one hand . And a scholar , too . How he loved his books ! God ! " ( Clenches his fist ) MARGARET " It is better so . If he had lived " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived it would have been horrible . Far better to die a hero . And I  --  his brother  --  I should be rejoicing in in his glorious death . But I have lost my manhood by his bedside . I am as weak as a woman . " MARGARET ( Involuntarily )  --  " Poor Marie ! " WILLIAM " No ! Happy Marie ! Happy to have been beloved by a hero . " ( Changing his tone ) " I must fetch the priest . " MARGARET " He was here . He left only an hour ago . He was called to Ludwig Bergman 's bed . " p. 4 WILLIAM " Yes  --  there 's scarcely a home " ( Stops abruptly ) MARGARET ( Alarmed )  --  " William ! " WILLIAM ( Somewhat gruffly )  --  " Well ! " MARGARET " You 're wearing your Sunday clothes . " WILLIAM " And what if I am ? " MARGARET " You were going to take in the hay this morning . There 's been no work done in the fields since Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And all our helpers gone  --  what 's to become of the cattle ? " WILLIAM " The hay must wait . " MARGARET " Wait ? Wait for what ? William , tell me . " WILLIAM ( Abruptly )  --  " Margaret , my class has been ordered to the front . " MARGARET " And you  --  you  --  " WILLIAM " I go , too , of course . " MARGARET " But so suddenly , without warning " WILLIAM " The order came last night  --  I  --  I put off telling you " MARGARET ( Mechanically )  --  " The order came last night . " p. 5 WILLIAM " That 's why I left Paul . I needed sleep for my long journey today . " MARGARET " Today ! You are going today ? " WILLIAM " I must be in Strassburg tonight . They 've given me a commission . I 'm to be a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery . Perhaps I shall return a captain . " MARGARET " You 're going out there  --  to kill  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come any day . " MARGARET " I thought the war would be ended . I thought they would excuse you " WILLIAM " I do n't want to be excused . Do you think I 'm a coward ? But the war must be over soon . It ca n't last much longer . Why , they say it costs thousands of marks every day . I 'll be back before you 've begun to miss me . " MARGARET " Yes , it 's scarcely two months since HE left . ( Pointing to couch ) WILLIAM " And if it should come to that  --  I shall not die dishonorably . I shall try to be worthy of my dead brother . " MARGARET ( With her first touch of fire )  --  Are n't there enough unmarried men to fight their cruel wars ? " p. 6 WILLIAM " Margaret ! It 's for our homes we 're fighting . I have no son to offer to my country  --  " MARGARET ( Sadly )  --  " No . " WILLIAM " If only God had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a time one feels it more than ever . " MARGARET " To send to the war you mean ? " WILLIAM " To fight for his country ! But we must n't question the ways of God . But since we are childless , I have a double duty ! I must be both son and husband to you . God , my country and you  --  that 's what I 'm fighting for ! " MARGARET " I must n't stand here idling . I must get your breakfast . When do you leave ? " WILLIAM " At 7 . " MARGARET " Then there 's no time to be wasted . " ( Goes toward door . Karl enters . He is about William 's age , but looks older . He is thin , stooped and limps slightly . He has small , delicate hands , deep set , piercing eyes , a sharp chin and a broad forehead . ) MARGARET " Good morning , Karl . " ( Karl looks from one to the other , then at the couch . Involuntarily he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to William and grasps his hand ) p. 7 WILLIAM " You loved him , Karl . " KARL " When he was a little fellow he used to watch me work by the hour  --  filing the wheels , coiling the spring , painting the figures on the dial . I made the watch he wore when he joined his regiment and I 'll wager he was never late to roll call . When he first learned to tell time , I 'd read him out of the Almanac every night the hour at which the sun would rise next morning , and he 'd slyly set back the clock  --  to fool the sun . But he soon learned he could n't cheat the sun  --  or the grave . " WILLIAM " And his books  --  always at them , was n't he ? " KARL " He was a cunning one . And how he 'd tease me ! Father Time , he used to call me , and he 'd say that every time I made a clock I thought I was making the world go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is affected )  --  " Are you ready for our journey , Karl ? " MARGARET " What ! Karl going too ! " KARL ( Glad of the diversion )  --  " And why not , madam ? Why ca n't I go as well as your big hulk of a husband ? To be sure I 'm only a humble private while Mr. William is to be a lieutenant , but I 'm a better target than he is because I ca n't run so fast . " p. 8 MARGARET " But your weak back and your limp ! You must n't go ! " KARL " Nonsense , Margaret . In war a good head is almost as valuable as a good pair of feet . There are n't better eyes than mine in the German army . I 've been made a sharpshooter  --  sniper , I think they call it . They 'll put me up in a tree to pot at poor devils who ca n't see me . " MARGARET ( Compassionately )  --  " My poor Karl . " KARL " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours more and I would have finished my masterpiece  --  the finest clock of its size in Europe . But if Europe wants wars instead of clocks , that 's her loss , not mine . " ( A horse stops outside . There is a knock and a man in riding dress enters ) KARL " Good morning , friend postman . What bad news do you bring today ? " POSTMAN " Ah , that 's always it these days  --  ' What bad news do you bring ? ' Six months ago there was no better loved man in the province than I. Not for my ugly face to be sure , but because I brought good tidings  --  news from a cousin or an old mother in the next province or a letter from America perhaps . The children flocked around me and every housewife greeted me with a bit of fresh bread or some such trifle . But now  --  Lord God , what a difference ! The children crouch in the corner and there 's nothing in the housewife 's hands but a wet handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiresome phrase , ' What bad news do you bring ? ' " p. 9 KARL " Well , there 's little bad news you can bring here . " POSTMAN ( Fishing for a letter )  --  " I 've a gray envelope  --  from the Imperial government  --  that 's usually bad news these times . Ah , here it is . ' Private Paul Dreier '  --  Paul  --  that little chap  --  off fighting . Well , well ! " WILLIAM " For Paul ? " POSTMAN " I 'll have to deliver it to you , I guess . I 've always cared about official letters . The government 's very particular . You 'll see that he gets it all right , eh ? " KARL " He 's gone where the post wo n't reach him . " POSTMAN " The devil he has ! Somewhere in Russia , I 'll bet . Those Russians " KARL " Easy , good friend . " ( Calls his attention to the bier ) POSTMAN ( Awestruck )  --  " Paul ! " ( Karl nods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly ) " That 's hard , you know  --  a little fellow like that . How old was he ? " WILLIAM " 19 . " POSTMAN " 19 , was he ? My Fritz is just the same age . He 's a fine big fellow , too , but his mind " ( Shakes his head sorrowfully ) " It 's like a baby 's . He 's always up to some mischief . It 's cost me a pretty penny to keep peace with my neighbors . I used to grumble a little against God  --  God forgive me " ( He crosses himself ) " But when the war broke out and all the other young chaps went away , I thanked God for making my Fritz a little wrong in the head . After all , one 's son is one 's son . " ( Hesitates a moment ) " But you 've forgotten the letter . " p. 10 WILLIAM ( Looking at the letter )  --  " I 'm a bad hand at this printed writing " POSTMAN " That there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " WILLIAM " Here , Karl , you 're a scholar . Read it out for us . " KARL ( Reads )  --  " Private Paul Dreier : The Imperial Government has been pleased to raise you to the rank of corporal and to bestow upon you the Iron Cross for conspicuous bravery  --  " POSTMAN ( Gasping )  --  " Iron Cross  --  what the devil ! " WILLIAM ( Joyously )  --  " Margaret ! Do you hear ? They 've given him the Iron Cross . " MARGARET " Yes , I heard . Your breakfast will soon be ready now . " WILLIAM " Little brother , I 'm proud of you . " ( Draws himself up proudly and salutes the bier ) POSTMAN ( Nudging Karl )  --  " I say , let me have a look at him , wo n't you ? " KARL " Have you never seen a lump of clay ? " POSTMAN " Just a little glimpse , you know . So I 'll be able to say I 've seen him . The Iron Cross ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Leading him gently to the door )  --  " Go along , good friend . One has n't time to indulge one 's curiosity these days . " POSTMAN ( Going )  --  " Very well , then . After all I have seen him . There was only a little sheet between . This will make a tale ! The Iron Cross , eh ! That little chap . Well , well ! " ( Goes out ) WILLIAM " Margaret  --  Karl  --  this is a happy day for us . " ( Margaret crosses herself silently ) WILLIAM " I never dreamed that this honor would come to us . " ( He kneels at the foot of the bier and kisses the sheet ) " Paul , my hero , they 've given you the Iron Cross ! " KARL " Yes , they 've given him the Iron Cross ! Why did n't I think of that when they brought him home bleeding and half-dead ? They 'll give us all the Iron Cross  --  men , women and children . We 'll all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose ? In the name of Christ " ( He laughs ) " Well , nothing could be more reasonable than that . Come along , William , we must pack our kits . " ( He goes out laughing ) WILLIAM ( Following him )  --  " What 's the matter with him ? Has he lost his senses ? " ( He goes out ) ( Margaret continues busying herself about the room . At the door a girl appears . She is about 18 , with a supple , well-developed figure and a face of wild beauty . A shawl is about her head . Her manner is half frightened , half fierce ) p. 12 MARGARET " Ah ! Marie ! " ( She blocks the couch ) MARIE ( Looking at Margaret 's face )  --  " What has happened ? Tell me ! " MARGARET ( Fondling her )  --  " Marie , dear " MARIE " Paul ! Where is Paul ? " ( Pushes Margaret aside and sees the bier . She shrieks aloud and throws herself at the foot of the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's will , dear . If he had lived  --  it would have been terrible . His last words were of you . Only of you . I could n't bear to tell William . God forgive me . " ( She crosses herself ) MARIE " Paul ! Paul ! Do n't leave me . Do n't leave me ! " MARGARET ( Starts , looks at Marie and bends over her )  --  " Marie ! " ( She whispers something . Marie shrinks away from her and crouches on the floor like a hunted animal . William runs in followed by Karl ) WILLIAM " Who is screaming ? What 's wrong ? " ( He sees Marie  --  sternly ) " It would be more becoming if you held your head high and offered thanks to God . Have you no pride ? No honor ? " p. 13 MARIE ( Springing to her feet )  --  " You robbed me of him ! You urged him to go ! He was mine and you took him from me ! " WILLIAM ( Firmly )  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . I thank God that he did not live to be married to you . The children you would have borne him would have been dishonorable cowards  --  unfit to bear his name . " MARGARET " William , you do n't know what you 're saying ! " ( Marie is shrinking away from William ) WILLIAM " Leave this house and do not enter it again . You have dishonored my dead brother . " ( Marie , as though in a trance , edges toward the door ) MARGARET " Marie ! " WILLIAM " Margaret , I forbid you to speak to her . " ( Margaret is silent . Marie goes out . The three remain in rapt silence ) KARL ( Suddenly )  --  " Merciful Christ ! Suppose  --  suppose  --  William , what if the girl was n't thinking only of herself ? " WILLIAM " What are you talking about , Karl ? " KARL " Suppose  --  there 's someone else ? " p. 14 WILLIAM " Someone else ? " ( Suddenly understanding ) " God in heaven ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low voice )  --  " Yes . " WILLIAM " Why did n't you tell me of this ? MARGARET " And what then ? " ( William puts his hand to his head , goes toward the door , checks himself , and remains in troubled thought . Karl and Margaret are silent . Captain Halbe enters ) HALBE ( Saluting William )  --  " Good morning , Lieutenant . Good morning , Schiller . Good morning , Mrs. Dreier . " ( They return his greetings . ) " I have come to see Corporal Paul Dreier . " KARL " There he lies . " HALBE ( Sees the couch and crosses himself )  --  " He died a soldier 's death . No doubt you have been notified of the honor that has been conferred upon him ? " WILLIAM " The Iron Cross ? " HALBE " Yes . No greater honor can come to a man . How old was he ? " WILLIAM " 19 . " HALBE " 19 ! Dreier  --  I congratulate you ! Not many youths come to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented the capture of two of our machine guns ! " p. 15 KARL ( Half aloud )  --  " Two machine guns ! Think of that now ! " HALBE ( After looking at Karl suspiciously )  --  " I have come to pin the Cross upon his breast . I regret that he did not live long enough to know of this honor . It would have gladdened his dying moments . " ( He goes towards the bier . Margaret steals to his side , lays her hand on his arm ) MARGARET " Please  --  do n't uncover it . " HALBE ( staring at her )  --  " Very well . " ( He places the cross on top of the sheet ) " Let it be buried with him . " WILLIAM " Yes , Margaret . See that that is done . I wo n't be here when he 's buried . " HALBE " When do you leave for the front ? " WILLIAM " This morning . " HALBE " Good ! We need men like you , Dreier . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in time . We were becoming a race of women . But the war will change all that . It will rejuvenate the nation  --  make us strong and virile again , as our ancestors were . " ( A little boy runs in ) LITTLE HEINRICH ( Breathlessly )  --  " Captain ! Captain ! They want you right away ! There 's a girl has drowned herself . " p. 16 HALBE " The devil  --  another one ! " ( Goes out with boy . Margaret exchanges a look with Karl and slips out quietly . William bows his head ) KARL ( Softly , to the couch )  --  " Well , Paul , my dear , when you meet your Marie in the next world you can tell her what your lives were worth down here  --  a machine gun apiece . " ( He goes to William ) " Friend William , here 's our breakfast getting cold . " WILLIAM " I want no breakfast . " KARL " That wo n't do . You 'll have to take care of your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it was your own property , you could feed it or not as you liked  --  that was your concern . But I fancy the Emperor wo n't like it , if you begin mistreating HIS property . " WILLIAM " You are right , Karl . I thank you for reminding me of my duty . " ( They draw up to the table and for a while eat in silence . They continue at breakfast throughout the following scene ) KARL ( Suddenly )  --  " William , why are you and I going out there to fight ? " WILLIAM " Is this the time for jesting , Karl ? " KARL " Eh , but I 'm not jesting , old friend . I 'm thinking . And when one is going to risk one 's skin , it 's time to begin thinking . " p. 17 WILLIAM " We are going to fight  --  to risk our skins , as you say  --  because our country needs us . " KARL " When it comes to being needed , it seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripening  --  and my clock to be finished . " WILLIAM " That 's what we 're fighting for  --  the right to live in our homes in peace and in freedom . " KARL " And who 's to hinder us ? " WILLIAM " You talk like a simpleton ! The Russians are scarcely a hundred miles away  --  every day brings them nearer . Everything we hold dear is endangered . Do you want to lick the boots of a Cossack ? " KARL " But  --  " ( Thinks a moment ) " But listen to me ! We 're not going to fight the Cossacks at all . We 're going off to France to pot at Frenchmen . What do you say to that ? " WILLIAM " It 's all one  --  they 're all in league against us . " KARL " Are they now ? I wonder how many of them ever saw a German ? I 'll wager now that you never saw a Frenchman  --  or a Russian either , did you ? " WILLIAM " No  --  but " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a Frenchman once in Munich . My uncle took me there when I was a little shaver . The Frenchman was cook in an eating-house . He wore a big white apron and had tiny feet . He kept turning a huge spit and his face was all shiny with grease and sweat . He looked as harmless as a nightingale . I suppose if I saw him tomorrow I 'd have to blow his head off . " ( Laughs ) " Eh , that 's funny . Here am I  --  turned 40  --  who never harmed so much as an insect , let alone a human being  --  going off to kill some poor devils I never laid eyes on before  --  because  --  because , well , damned if I know ! " p. 18 WILLIAM " Because you know that it is your duty to crush the barbarians who have invaded your country . " KARL " But we 're invading their country , too , and I should n't be surprised if they 're calling US barbarians . " WILLIAM " Captain Halbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best proof of it . Why are n't you content with doing your duty and leave arguing and questioning and rights and wrongs for your betters ? That 's their business . Doing our duty is ours . " KARL " My betters ! That 's always rubbed under my nose . Why was n't my father a notary or a soldier instead of a carpenter ? Then I 'd be somewhere I tell you . William , what asses we were not to go to America  --  five  --  ten  --  twenty years ago . America ! That 's the land ! I read all about it the other day in one of Paul 's books . They have a law there that 's called the something or other of independence . It makes all the men in the land equal . Think of that William ! No poverty and wretchedness ! No rich and no poor ! But everybody with the same chance ! Everybody getting just what he earns and nobody to thank for it . Your children and mine  --  if we had any  --  on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " WILLIAM " One 's own country is best . " KARL ( Lost in thought )  --  " William , suppose now  --  suppose that you and I should refuse to fight ? " p. 19 WILLIAM ( Staring at him )  --  " Refuse to fight ! " KARL " Yes . Break our guns over our knees and say calmly , ' We wo n't fight . ' " WILLIAM " Are you mad , Karl ? " KARL " What would happen then , do you think ? " WILLIAM " We would be dastardly cowards and besides , we 'd be shot as traitors . " KARL ( Carried away with his idea )  --  " Yes , there were just we two . But suppose  --  suppose  --  that every man in this village , and every man in the next village , and every man in the province were to say the same thing ? " ( Excitedly ) " Yes , and every man in Germany and Russia and France and Spain , or wherever it is that they 're fighting . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea ! By heaven , that 's an idea ! " WILLIAM " Stop ! I command you . You are talking treason ! " KARL ( Continuing )  --  " Then the kings and the ministers and the gun-makers would have to fight it out among them . And would n't I like to see them at it ! " WILLIAM ( Sternly )  --  " Karl , I am your superior officer " ( A woman has appeared in the doorway . She is young and rather pretty , but is pale and woefully bedraggled . In her arms she carries a boy of five or so . A girl of perhaps seven is clinging to her skirt ) p. 20 THE WOMAN ( Calling )  --  " William ! " WILLIAM ( Turning , bewildered )  --  " Frieda ! " ( Frieda totters . Karl rushes forward and places her in a chair , seating the boy on the floor . Margaret enters ) MARGARET ( Sizing up the situation )  --  " Quick , give her some brandy ! " ( Karl produces his pocket flask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  " I saw them on the road . Something has happened to Bertha ! " KARL ( To Frieda )  --  " How 's that ? Better , eh ? " FRIEDA ( Revived by the brandy )  --  " I could n't have held out another mile . For two days and two nights we 've been walking , walking , walking " WILLIAM " You walked here from Braunwald ? " MARGARET ( Caressing the children )  --  " Poor little ones ! " ( They cling to her instinctively ) FRIEDA " I thought I should never reach here . I thought I should die by the roadside , of horror and fright . I wanted to kill myself . But who was to care for these orphans " ( Sobbing ) " Oh Bertha , Bertha ! My sainted sister ! " p. 21 MARGARET " Mericful God  --  she is dead ? " ( She crosses herself ) WILLIAM " What has happened ? For God 's sake , Frieda , tell us . " FRIEDA " The Cossacks " ( At the mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Cossacks ! Frieda ! Oh my God in Heaven , to die like that ! " WILLIAM " The Cossacks ? I do n't understand " KARL ( Horror-stricken )  --  " Do n't you hear , man ? They 've reached Braunwald  --  and the woman  --  Bertha ! Oh , it 's horrible ! " WILLIAM " You mean they 've they 've " MARGARET " Outraged  --  violated  --  defiled her  --  my sweet sister Bertha ! She was the eldest ! " WILLIAM " The foul beasts ! " FRIEDA ( Suddenly falling on her knees and raising her clasped hands to heaven )  --  " Oh , all-powerful God , visit Your anger upon them . Let them die in a far country , unfriended , unabsolved , suffering the tortures of the damned , the vultures screaming over them . Let their bodies rot in the rain " p. 22 MARGARET " Frieda  --  little sister " FRIEDA ( Unheeding )  --  " and their souls burn in everlasting hell-fire . Make their wives barren and  --  and  --  ( Her voice grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Raising her )  --  " William , help me ! " ( Together they lift Frieda and carry her into the next room , the little girl clinging to Margaret . The boy follows but the door closes and he can not open it ) LITTLE HEINRICH ( Beating the door and crying )  --  " Auntie Frieda ! Auntie Frieda ! " KARL " Sh ! Sh ! Little Heinrich  --  come here to me ! " LITTLE HEINRICH ( Paying no attention to him )  --  " Auntie Frieda ! " KARL " Auntie Frieda 's asleep  --  come and talk to Karl . " ( Picks him up ) LITTLE HEINRICH ( Still crying )  --  " I do n't know you . I 'm afraid of you . " KARL " What  --  afraid of Karl ? Karl who would n't harm a hair of your head ! " LITTLE HEINRICH ( As before )  --  " I want to go to Auntie Frieda . I 'm afraid of strange men . Strange men are bad . " p. 23 KARL " Karl is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to let you listen to his clocks ? " LITTLE HEINRICH ( As before )  --  " No . " KARL " Like this , you know " ( Holds watch to the boy 's ear ) HEINRICH ( As before )  --  " Let me go ! " KARL ( Pocketing watch , to himself )  --  " The little beggar 's outgrown that . What the devil can I give him ? " ( Looks about perplexed . Sees bier , hesitates , then )  --  " Here , I 've something pretty for you , if you 'll stop crying . ( Puts Heinrich down and goes towards the bier . Little Heinrich , his curiosity aroused , follows him with his eyes , though still crying . Karl takes up the Iron Cross ) " Paul , my dear , I 'm going to borrow this . You can spare it for ten minutes , eh ? " ( He holds it up before Heinrich ) " How 's that now ? " LITTLE HEINRICH ( Stretching out his hand )  --  " I want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to him )  --  " Aha ! Pretty , is n't it ? Do n't prick yourself . That 's a brave fellow . " ( The child sits on the floor , contentedly playing . Karl busies himself preparing for the journey . Margaret and William enter ) " How is little Frieda ? " p. 24 MARGARET " She 's resting now . She was weak from lack of sleep and from the horror " ( Shudders ) KARL ( Patting her shoulder )  --  " It 's a heavy day , Margaret , my dear . " ( He turns away ) WILLIAM ( Grimly )  --  " Our swords shall wipe out the memory of it ! " ( Drawing his sword and holding it on high , dramatically ) " God in heaven , witness Thou , that I give my sword and my life to the Fatherland to the defense of my home and to the avenging of our sister Bertha 's honor , so help me Lord Jesus Christ . " ( Karl and Margaret listen to him without enthusiasm . Half-consciously their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an uneasy moment of silence ) KARL ( Breaking the strain )  --  " I must be off . There are two or three people in the village who may have commissions for me to perform in Heaven . Margaret , I 'll leave my clock in your care . If I dodge the bullets I 'll come back to finish it . 48 hours work , that 's all ! Why could n't they have waited ? You 'll see that no dust touches it , nor no dampness , either ? " MARGARET " I 'll take good care of it . " KARL ( Gives her clock , carefully wrapped )  --  " That 's a dear woman . It 's my only child , you know , and now , goodbye , my dear . We 'll meet again somewhere  --  perhaps . " ( He kisses her ) " I 'll be at the station , William . " ( He dashes out to conceal his emotion ) p. 25 MARGARET ( Affected )  --  " Goodbye , my brave Karl ; God spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must say goodbye , too ! " MARGARET " So soon ? " WILLIAM " Yes , there 's not much time left . " MARGARET ( Suddenly crying )  --  " Oh , William " WILLIAM " Margaret , remember that you are a soldier 's wife ! It is for the Fatherland ! " MARGARET " We 've been so happy together . " WILLIAM " Yes , but one 's country comes first . " MARGARET " Before life  --  before happiness ? " WILLIAM ( Slowly )  --  " Yes , even before life ; even before happiness . " MARGARET ( Passionately )  --  " It 's not right  --  it 's cruel ! " WILLIAM ( Sternly )  --  " It is right  --  whether it is cruel or not , and whoever flinches and compains is a coward and a weakling . Are you afraid to face your duty ? " MARGARET ( Controlling herself )  --  " No , I 'm not afraid . I was wrong to complain . Forgive me. " p. 26 WILLIAM ( Softening a little )  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . But it 's for God and my country . " MARGARET " Then may God protect you and your country reward you ! " WILLIAM " I entrust everything to you  --  the house , the cattle , the fields . It is not given to women to fight in defense of their homes ; but they have their tasks , too , and in their own way , they too can be of service to their country . The crops will be ready for the harvesting soon , Margaret . The cattle must be fed and cared for . Then there are these little ones of Bertha 's to be clothed and watched over until their father returns from the war . And soon there will be more sick and wounded to nurse and provide for . In time of war , all these things are woman 's work and in your hands I leave them . " MARGARET " I shall try to do my duty .

" ( For a moment they cling to each other silently ) p. 27 WILLIAM ( Gravely )  --  " And now there is one other thing " MARGARET " Yes ? " WILLIAM " The Cossacks are still more than a hundred miles away . I pray God that our troops will drive them back long before they can reach here , but if they should not  --  then " MARGARET " Yes . " WILLIAM " There is only one fate in store for the women  --  Bertha 's fate . " ( Margaret shudders . William takes a revolver from his pocket ) " Here is a loaded pistol .

When he learns how you suffered  --  that you thought more of your mother 's happiness and of his happiness than of yourself , you 'll be dearer than ever to him . " ROSA ( Happily )  --  " Do you think so ? I hope it 's true ! But how shall I ever be able to tell him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else  --  I could n't bear that , Mrs. Dreier . But how can I tell him  --  " MARGARET " You 'll find a way , Rosa . " ROSA " That 's what mother says . Mother wo n't live much longer , Mrs. Dreier . The doctor told me . " MARGARET " What will you do then ? " ROSA " Why , I 'll be with Fritz , of course . I hope God spares mother until Fritz comes back . She 's so anxious to see us safely married . " ( Heinrich enters . He wears a faded uniform and is carrying a large bundle done up in a sheet ) HEINRICH ( To Margaret )  --  " It seems to me you might be helping me get ready instead of standing here gossiping . " ROSA " I 'll go , Mrs. Dreier  --  goodbye . " MARGARET " Goodbye , Rosa . I 'll be down to see your mother later . " ( Rosa goes out ) p. 55 HEINRICH ( Putting bundle on the table )  --  " Talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for . You 're all alike , everyone of you . " MARGARET " Not so loud , Heinrich , you 'll wake the child . " HEINRICH " Well , what of it ? You make as much fuss of that brat as though he were your husband 's child . You 'd actually think he was something to be proud of . " ( Margaret goes out . She re-enters in a few moments with some clothing over her arm ) MARGARET " Heinrich , here are the clothes Frieda wore . I 've been saving them as a remembrance ; you 'd better take them with you " HEINRICH " Frieda 's clothes ? Well , I do n't want them . I can remember her without them . " MARGARET " Take them with you and keep them . In a few years Emma will be big enough to wear them . " HEINRICH ( Taking the clothes , grumbling ) " The devil ! This bundle is heavy enough already . " MARGARET " The children must have warm clothing for the winter . Firewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that . I made only necessary things . I wish I 'd had time to make more . " HEINRICH " Yes , it 's easy enough for you to talk . You do n't have to carry the bundle . You 'd think I was an army mule . " p. 56 MARGARET " I 'll have another small bundle for you . " HEINRICH ( Indignantly )  --  " Another ? No , I wo n't take it . What do you take me for anyhow ? " MARGARET " It 's just some food for you and the children to eat on the way . " HEINRICH ( Smiling )  --  " Ah , some of that fine pot-cheese , too ? " MARGARET " Yes . " HEINRICH ( Admiringly )  --  " You 're a good housewife , Margaret . Better than my poor Bertha was . God rest her soul . " ( He crosses himself . Margaret is about to go . He calls ) HEINRICH " Margaret . " MARGARET " Well ? " HEINRICH " Do you think , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ? I may not find mine when I get home . And as you say , there 'll be need for warm clothing this winter . " MARGARET " William will need his coat . " HEINRICH " You still think he 's coming back , do you ? " MARGARET " I know he 'll come back . He must come back . I 've prayed to the good God a dozen times every day . " p. 57 HEINRICH " That 's all very well . But I would n't be so sure about it if I were you . There are lots of prayers just like yours that the good God has n't chosen to answer . It 's a month now since the peace was signed and all you 've heard is that they think he 's a prisoner . Almost everyone else from this village has been accounted for  --  " ( Margaret goes out hurriedly ) HEINRICH ( Starting after her )  --  " Hey ! What the devil are you running off like that for ? ( Grumbling ) " It 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women would grow out of all handling . They need somebody to clout them , that 's what they need . " ( Karl enters from outside . He wears working clothes and carries a spade over his shoulder . He feels his way with a stick ) KARL ( Putting down spade )  --  " Are you growling again ? " HEINRICH " Who 's growling ? It 's easy enough for you to talk . You do n't have to carry this bundle . You 'd growl too if you did . Look at that bundle . " ( Grumblingly ) " What 's the good of telling you to look at anything ? " KARL ( Seating himself )  --  " When are you going ? " HEINRICH " As soon as things are ready . These women are are so slow . " p. 58 KARL " I hurried through my work so that I could say goodbye to the little ones . That job of mine is no easy one , you may believe me . Another funeral tonight . Young Peter Kaufmann . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Turkey . And his father went crazy from the noise of the guns . " HEINRICH " Well , what are you telling me for ? Have n't I got troubles enough of my own . Going back alone with two little kids  --  my wife dead  --  Frieda dead  --  my cattle gone , too , most likely . Who 's going to look after my house ? House ? How do I know I 'll find a house there ? Those damned Cossacks ! " KARL " Everybody 's hurt somewhere . You 're luckier than some . You have your children . " HEINRICH " Yes , they have to be fed and cared for . And with appetites like a corporal 's . Luckier than some . It 's easy enough for you to talk . You did n't lose a wife . My poor Bertha . " ( He wipes his eyes ) " Who 's going to take care of me ? " KARL " You 'll marry again , I guess . There 's no scarcity of women . " HEINRICH " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones wo n't want me with my two children . And the old ones will have three or four children of their own . No thank you . " ( He pauses reflectively ) " I say , Karl , do you think Margaret would have me ? " p. 59 KARL " Margaret ? Are you crazy , man ? " HEINRICH " Why not ? I guess I 'm good enough for her . " KARL " She might not like your burying William alive for one thing . " HEINRICH " There you go ! William ! He wo n't come back any more . The war 's over a month . " KARL " He may come back and he may not . But I guess Margaret is n't thinking of marrying again . " HEINRICH " She might do worse . " KARL " You empty headed ass ! Even if William does n't come back , do you think she 'd take you  --  after him ? " HEINRICH " I do n't know about that . I guess I 'm as good as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one anyhow . She ought to be glad to get somebody to look after her . " ( Karl laughs ) HEINRICH " It 's easy enough for you to laugh . You have n't got two kids to work for . You 've got your nice fat pension to live on and nobody to think of but yourself . " ( Karl grunts ) HEINRICH " I fought for my country just the same as you did . I was wounded just as you were . Worse , I 'll bet . And I have n't a scratch or a bruise to show for it . They 'd laugh at me if I asked for a pension . My damned luck ! " p. 60 KARL " It 's thanks to Margaret that you 're alive . " HEINRICH " Well , well , all right . You 've told me that a thousand times . " KARL " You ca n't seem to get it through your thick skull . For more than a year she 's been taking care of you and the children . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Frieda went ? Do you think the Cossacks would have nursed you back to health ? " HEINRICH " Well , that 's a woman 's business , is n't it ? If we go to war to protect them , the least they can do is to take care of us when we 're shot . They get us into enough trouble . I 'd have been promoted if it were n't for a scrape with a damned French woman . " KARL " Oh , so you 've been up to those tricks , too ! " HEINRICH " It 's easy enough for you to say that . What do you expect anyhow ? They make a man fight until his blood gets boiling hot and then they complain if he loses his head a bit . I was sorry enough afterwards . But when a man 's away from his wife for six months  --  my poor Bertha ! And how the devil did I know that the woman would go blabbing to the Colonel ? It was n't bad enough that I lost my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bargain . That damned old woman of a Colonel ! " KARL " Was she a married woman , too ? " p. 61 HEINRICH " How the devil do I know ? She looked something like Bertha . " ( Wiping his eyes ) " Poor Bertha ! Curse those Russians ! Sometimes I think though that the good God sent those Cossacks to punish me for that Frenchwoman . That 's why I do n't complain . One must n't murmur against the good God . " ( He crosses himself ) ( Margaret enters with a small package ) MARGARET " Here , Heinrich . " ( Heinrich takes it with a grunt ) MARGARET " Back so early , Karl . " KARL " I wanted a word with the children . I 've another funeral at six o'clock  --  young Kaufmann 's . " MARGARET " The children are getting ready . They 're in my room . " KARL " I 'll go in to them . " ( He goes out ) HEINRICH " Why did n't you make them hurry ? First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARGARET " You 've nearly an hour yet . I was saying goodbye to them . It 's hard to give them up . It 's almost two years since Frieda brought them here . I love them as much as if they were my own  --  more  --  God forgive me . " ( She breaks off ) HEINRICH ( Struck with an idea )  --  " You do n't like to lose them , eh ? " p. 62 MARGARET " No , I 've grown so used to them . HEINRICH " Well , you do n't have to lose them if you do n't want to . " MARGARET " What do you mean ? " HEINRICH " Why  --  come along with us . " MARGARET " Nonsense , Heinrich , how can I do that ? " HEINRICH " Easy enough . I do n't mind your bringing the brat along . It 's another mouth to feed , but I do n't care . As to Karl , let him take care of himself . What do you want that old fool around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with me . " MARGARET " Better off with you ? " HEINRICH ( Getting angry )  --  " Yes ! Yes ! Do n't stand there gaping at me . Where are your brains ? I mean that you should marry me . " MARGARET " You must be out of your senses , Heinrich . " HEINRICH " That 's the thanks I get for offering to marry you . Well , you 'd better think it over . You are n't so young , you know , and there are n't as many men as there were two years ago . Well , what do you say , Margaret ? You 're a good house-wife and the children need looking after , and God knows , I ca n't afford a servant . You can sell this place , or better still , I 'll sell my place and we can live here . " ( Looking about critically ) " Yes , I think that will be better  --  " p. 63 MARGARET ( Indignantly )  --  " Why , you talk as though William  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! William ! What 's the good of fooling yourself ? Do n't you think he would have come back long ago if he were alive ? " MARGARET " He is alive ! I know he is ! I feel it ! " HEINRICH " There 's no use arguing with a woman when she sets her will against you . Suppose you hear that he is n't coming back ? " MARGARET " If God wills it so , then I shall never marry again . " HEINRICH " What nonsense ! A fine woman like you . Come , Margaret , be sensible . I 'll wait a month  --  two months , eh ? " MARGARET " I 've given you my answer , Heinrich . " HEINRICH " Oh , you 've given me your answer , have you ? You 're mighty particular , are n't you ? That 's the thanks I get . How many men do you think would marry you  --  with your damned Russian brat ? " MARGARET " Heinrich ! " ( Karl enters with the children ) HEINRICH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you 're ready . We have n't got all day . " ( Pointing to the small package ) " Take that bundle , Emma . Come along now . " ( He shoulders the large package and stalks out without a word ) p. 64 KARL " What 's the matter with him , now ? " MARGARET ( Taking the children in her arms )  --  " Goodbye , my little ones ! " ( She kisses them ) EMMA ( Crying )  --  " Must we go already ? " LITTLE HEINRICH " I do n't want to go ! " MARGARET " Yes , you must ; it 's time . " EMMA " I 'll write to you every day . " LITTLE HEINRICH ( Not to be outdone )  --  " And I 'll come to see you every day . " MARGARET ( Laughing and crying )  --  " Yes , yes , yes . Go along , now , my dears . You must n't keep your father waiting . Run after him , now . " LITTLE HEINRICH ( Kissing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Karl . " ( He runs out ; Emma follows him , sobbing ) KARL ( Waving his stick )  --  " Goodbye ! Goodbye ! " LITTLE HEINRICH ( Shouting , off stage )  --  " Papa ! Papa ! Do n't walk so fast ! Wait for us ! " MARGARET " Little motherless ones . It tears my heart , Karl , to see the children suffer . When I see men and women in sorrow and pain , I say to myself , ' It is God 's punishment for their sins . ' But the children ! The innocent pure-hearted children  --  surely they have n't sinned ! " ( Raising her hands to Heaven ) " Oh , gentle Lord Jesus , have mercy on the children ! " p. 65 KARL " The sins of their fathers , Margaret , that 's what it is ! That 's what your Bible says , is n't it ? I used to read it , once upon a time ! There are some clever things in it , if you look for them . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers shall be visited upon the children even unto the third and fourth generation . ' Third and fourth generation ! That 's it ! Those old scribblers were no fools , I tell you . Who 's paying for this little picnic we 've just been through ! The fellows we 're shoving under ground as fast as we can dig holes for them ? I guess not ! They 're only what those factory chaps call raw material . Their children and their grandchildren and their great grand-children will pay for the finished product  --  unless they wo n't . " MARGARET ( As always paying no heed to Karl 's ramblings )  --  " It will be as God wills . " KARL ( Chuckling )  --  " That 's a funny one ! Think of paying for your great grandfather 's amusements ! I never thought of that before ! I knew some fellows in the trenches who would have enjoyed that little joke . " MARGARET ( Suddenly )  --  " Yes , Karl , you are right ! " ( Pointing to the child ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its father . So long as it lives it will be hated and taunted and avoided . " p. 66 KARL " Yes . The innocent suffer for the guilty . The child  --  and you . " MARGARET " No , Karl , I am not innocent . " KARL " What ? " MARGARET " I used to pray to God every night to bless me with a child . I used to dream that I was caring for it and watching it grow strong and beautiful . And when Little Heinrich and Emma came , I grew to love them as though I had borne and suckled them . Then I 'd think that when they left me , I 'd be alone again , with no little ones to love and watch over . And instead of bowing humbly before God 's will , I wept and pitied myself . And God has punished me . He has granted my prayer and given me a child . But it is different , Karl  --  different , different . I try to love it . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , such pity  --  but not love . God forgive me . " KARL " God cherish and reward you , you mean . When I think of all you 've suffered , all you 've undergone , by Heaven , it makes me want to fall at your feet . They talk about heroes ! A fellow goes out there to that mad-house , that was closed up a month ago , and for six months or a year he 's right in the thick of it , shooting and being shot at , seeing his comrades drop at his sides , taking orders like a dog . He 's no longer the Hans or the Fritz or the Johann that one used to see driving his oxen up the road . He 's a wild animal trying to kill some other animal not because he hates him  --  but because he does n't want the other fellow to kill him . Then one day  --  bang ! and something snaps inside his head . He 's smelt the blood and the powder  --  and listened to the noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ca n't stand any more of it . He 's no longer an animal , he 's a lunatic . Then without knowing what he 's doing or why , he captures a trench or a gun or burns a bridge  --  and they say he 's died for his country ! He 's a hero ! I like your kind of heroism better . To stay here at home where all the misery 's of the dull kind and none of it of your own making  --  to do the same dull , thankless tasks day after day , without complaining and without hope of reward  --  that 's heroism . You do n't die for your country  --  you live for it . " p. 67 MARGARET " I 've only done my duty . " KARL " You 'll get small thanks for it . " MARGARET " Thanks , Karl ? Does one do things to be thanked ? When someone is in need of help is n't it one 's duty to be helpful ? Is n't Heinrich the husband of my sainted sister ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To lose his dear wife  --  and such a death ! And the children ! How can one 's heart help going out to them ? And they love me , too , God bless them ! That 's thanks enough . " KARL " And all the people in the village  --  all you 've done for them ! Nursing and feeding and comforting them . What would they have done without you ? " MARGARET " Did n't the sweet Savior command us to love one 's neighbor as oneself ? I would be a traitor to God if I failed in my duty . Yes , and a traitor to the Fatherland , too . When our husbands and brothers are sacrificing their lives , we , too , must make our sacrifices . " ( Karl shakes his head dubiously . Margaret puts her hand on his shoulder ) MARGARET " Karl , I know you . Your heart is kinder than your tongue . Do you think of reward ? Who is to reward you for working at your hard , dismal task  --  blind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pension to pay our taxes ? " p. 68 KARL " You 're breaking your word ! You promised me not to speak of it again . " MARGARET " Forgive me ! But when I think of your kindness  --  " ( She cries softly ) KARL " Let 's talk of something else  --  " MARGARET " Karl , do you think William will come back ? " KARL " There 's every reason to hope so . He 's on the list of prisoners . I spoke to Halbe this morning . " MARGARET " What did he say ? " KARL " He did n't say much . It 's not easy to talk to Halbe since they 've made him a major . It seems , though , that all the prisoners have n't been released yet . Things are still a good bit upset . " MARGARET " Karl , what will William do when he comes back and finds  --  " ( She points to the cradle ) "  --  the child ! " KARL " Do ! Why , what can he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven for giving him a wife who suffered what you have suffered so that he might have a home to come back to . " MARGARET " You think he 'll forgive me ? " KARL " Forgive you ? For what ? " MARGARET ( Half to herself )  --  " Yes , I 'm sure he will . " p. 69 KARL " Our William is n't as keen witted as some I 've met , but I hope he is n't altogether a fool . " MARGARET " I should be on my way to see Rosa 's mother instead of talking about my own affairs . " ( She goes to the door and opens it . Staggering back ) " Karl ! He 's coming ! William 's coming ! " KARL ( Joyously )  --  " I told you it would turn out all right . " ( Margaret falls to her knees and prays silently . William enters . He wears a tattered uniform , resplendent with decorations and medals . His empty right sleeve hangs by his side ) MARGARET ( Rising ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They embrace silently ) KARL ( Coming forward )  --  " Well , here you are ! " WILLIAM ( Seeing him for the first time )  --  " Karl ! You poor fellow ! I did n't know  --  " KARL " It 's all right , William . Four senses like those I have left are worth five of another man 's . " WILLIAM ( Seizing him about the shoulder and hugging him )  --  " Still the same old Karl ! " p. 70 KARL ( Groping for William 's hand and finding the empty sleeve ) " What ! Arm gone ! The devil ! " WILLIAM ( Laughing )  --  " No , only a French surgeon ! " KARL " By Heaven , Margaret , the war has made a wit of our William . " ( They laugh ) KARL " He 'll be writing a book soon  --  ' The Memoirs of Lieutenant William Dreier , ' eh ? " WILLIAM ( Proudly )  --  " CAPTAIN William Dreier . " KARL ( Drawing himself up in a mock salute ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back so quietly that one would never have suspected it . " WILLIAM ( Resentfully )  --  " Yes , they 're a fine lot , your villagers . Not so much as an escort at the station . There was enough cheering , when we went away . Half the people I passed did n't even bother to raise their heads or salute ! The others only stared at me as though I just come out of prison . " KARL " Well , you have , have n't you ? " WILLIAM " I do n't like your jokes , Karl . " KARL " Ah , William ! When the world grows to like my jokes , there wo n't be any more wars . " p. 71 WILLIAM ( Puzzled )  --  " What do you mean ? " KARL " It does n't matter . " ( He feels for William 's breast ; whistles ) " Phew ! You 've got a whole tinker 's outfit there . " WILLIAM ( Rather displeased )  --  " There are some would give all they own for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  " Iron Cross , too ! " WILLIAM ( To Margaret )  --  " That was for the affair at Verdun . You may have heard about it . The Crown Prince fastened it on with his own hands . I never thought I 'd have any dealings with princes ! " KARL " I met lots of chaps out there who 'd like to have . " WILLIAM " I guess you did . " ( He fingers the medals lovingly ) " Every one of these has a history . I wo n't tell them to you now . I 'll save them for long evenings . " KARL " Which one paid for the arm ? " WILLIAM ( Rather confused )  --  " None ! " MARGARET " How could anything pay for that , Karl ? " KARL ( To William )  --  " What ! They did n't even give you a decoration for it ? " p. 72 WILLIAM ( As before )  --  " It happened after the war ended . " KARL &amp; MARGARET ( Together )  --  " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through the war without a scratch . Not so much as a flesh-wound . They said I had a charmed life . About ten days before the truce began , I was taken prisoner and sent to Paris  --  " MARGARET " Did you suffer in prison ? " WILLIAM " You 'd hardly call it a prison . I had a fine room in a big hotel . All I had to do was give my word that I would n't try to escape . " KARL " He 's an officer , you see . " MARGARET " And you did n't write ? " WILLIAM " They would n't let us because they were afraid of information getting through . Afterwards I could n't . Well , when peace was declared , there were big celebrations in Paris  --  " KARL " In Berlin , too , they say . " WILLIAM " Of course . They had parades and speech making and all that . I was on my way to the railroad station when I passed a street-meeting . When the crowd saw my uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me get up on a kind of a platform where there were a lot of other officers  --  French , Austrian and German . They were showing us off . Just as I mounted the platform , it toppled over  --  " p. 73 MARGARET " Oh ! " WILLIAM " I put out my arm to save myself . Three or four of the others fell on top of me and crushed the arm so badly that it could n't be saved . There you have the whole story . " MARGARET " And it all could have been avoided , if they had only been a little careful . " WILLIAM ( Rather resentfully )  --  " Yes . " ( Karl bursts out laughing ) WILLIAM " What are you laughing at , Karl ? " KARL " Nothing ! Nothing ! Well , I 'm due at the funeral . " WILLIAM " What funeral ? " KARL " Young Peter Kaufmann 's . You remember him ? " WILLIAM " Yes , but what have you to do with it ? " KARL " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand as ever , Karl . " MARGARET " Karl is assistant sexton , now . " WILLIAM " Sexton ! Karl ? " KARL " And why not ? From clock maker to sexton is n't such a long step . You remember when Paul was a little fellow , he used to call me Father Time ? Well , it 's part of Father Time 's job to help people into their graves , is n't it ? " ( He shoulders the spade ) " I 'll be back at supper-time . " ( He goes out ) p. 74 WILLIAM " What 's the matter with Karl ? Has something in his head snapped ? " MARGARET " William , we can never thank Karl enough . Do you know what he 's done ? He 's given up his pension towards our taxes . " WILLIAM " Are things as bad as that ? " MARGARET " Everything is so high . And the taxes are almost doubled . " WILLIAM " Well , I 'll get back to work  --  as well as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy his pension . He 's a good friend , old Karl . " MARGARET " And then , you know , I had all those other mouths to feed  --  Heinrich and the children  --  and  --  " WILLIAM " Oh , yes , I saw them down at the station . He looked as sour as ever . The children have been here ever since I left , I suppose . " MARGARET " Yes . And a few months later , they brought Heinrich here . He was dangerously wounded . The doctors did n't think he would live . He had to be nursed for months . " WILLIAM " You had your hands full , too , did n't you ? And no one to help you , either . Karl was n't much use , I guess . " MARGARET " He was very helpful considering his condition . " WILLIAM " Well , it 's all over now . I 'm back and you 're safe . " ( He seats himself and draws Margaret onto his lap ) p. 75 MARGARET ( Happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night you brought me here  --  the night of our marriage . Do you remember ?

" WILLIAM " Frieda ! Yes , I 'd forgotten about Frieda . She 's dead , you say ? That 's sad news . What was it  --  cholera  --  typhus ? " MARGARET " She took her life ! " WILLIAM " God in Heaven ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks off ) WILLIAM " What is it , Margaret ? What 's come over you ? " p. 76 MARGARET ( Steeling herself )  --  " Frieda took her life rather than  --  oh , how can I tell you . " WILLIAM " Tell me what , Margaret ? " MARGARET ( Drawing him silently over to the cradle )  --  " Look there ! " WILLIAM ( In amazement )  --  " Frieda 's ? " MARGARET " Mine ! " WILLIAM " What do you say ? " MARGARET " The child is mine ! The Cossacks were here . " ( Going to him ) " Oh , William ! " WILLIAM ( Repulsing her )  --  " Do you know what you 're saying ? Do you know what you 're telling me ? " MARGARET " Yes , I know  --  I know . " WILLIAM " You 're telling me that a Cossack  --  you  --  do you know how horrible that is ? " MARGARET " They say that wherever there 's war , the women  --  " WILLIAM " You vile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You submitted to this ! You lived through it ! " p. 77 MARGARET " Yes , I lived through it . " WILLIAM " I warned you ! I gave you a pistol ! You swore to me you 'd use it  --  if  --  if  --  and you did n't use it ? You allowed yourself to  --  You thought more of your miserable life than you did of your honor or of me ! " MARGARET " I was thinking of you , William . " WILLIAM " No ! You were thinking of yourself  --  of your own skin . " MARGARET " No ! I thought of you coming back from the war , tired and wounded with no home to welcome you and no wife to care for you . " WILLIAM " I would rather see this house a heap of ashes and you buried beneath them , than find you as you are  --  a dishonored woman . A coward and a traitor . " MARGARET " I prayed God to guide me . " WILLIAM " God ! What has God got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left you the pistol  --  you gave me your promise ! There was no need to pray . You knew your duty . Your cowardly heart guided you . " MARGARET " I tried to do what was best ! " WILLIAM " You 've dishonored me  --  defiled my home ! You 're not worthy to be a soldier 's wife . " p. 78 MARGARET " Listen to me , William . Perhaps then you 'll forgive me . All those poor folks in the village were so badly off . I used to cook and sew for them . And Karl was here  --  weak and blind . And the children . And Heinrich , between life and death . They all needed me , William . When Frieda killed herself , there was no one but me to look out for them . I could n't leave them . I thought I could do more good alive than dead . " WILLIAM " All that you are saying amounts to nothing . There is nothing more sacred than honor . Honor comes first  --  not last ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those helpless ones , William  --  just to protect myself ? " WILLIAM " Yourself ! What of me ? Do you owe nothing to me ? For two years I 've been out there fighting  --  risking my life  --  suffering hardships , and for what , do you think ? For myself ? " MARGARET " For the Fatherland ! " WILLIAM " For you ! For my home ! One 's home is the Fatherland ! That 's why we give up everything to go and kill and burn and make waste . Do you think we like to do it ? It 's for you , at home , we do it . To protect you  --  to shield you from danger . " MARGARET " And what I 've done has been for the home , too ! You say that when you kill and burn and destroy the homes of people like ourselves it 's for the Fatherland  --  for us you do it ! Perhaps it is . We women do n't understand such things . We only know that the work here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick and wounded and the feeble must be fed and clothed and cared for , that the fields must be tilled and the harvests taken , that the children must be made strong and skillful to take the place of those who never come back . That 's for the home  --  for the Fatherland , too ! " p. 79 WILLIAM ( Bitterly )  --  " Home ! What home have I ? " MARGARET " William ! Do n't say that ! " WILLIAM " This is what I 've come back to  --  after two years . Every night I prayed for your sake that I 'd come back alive . And all that time I went unscratched . My charmed life ! Now I know it was only God mocking at me . I wish a bullet had found me . " MARGARET " William , do n't ! Day and night , I prayed God to spare you . " WILLIAM " Do you think God heeds the prayers of such as you ? This is what I 've come back to  --  to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( With sudden passion ) " My God , why do n't I kill the brat ? " MARGARET ( Interposing herself between William and the cradle )  --  " No ! " WILLIAM " You love it  --  that child of hate ! " MARGARET " For nine months I carried it under my heart ! I brought it into the world in pain and sorrow . Do you think that is nothing to a woman  --  even when  --  do you think that the child whose lips have tugged at my breasts means nothing to me ? If I can not give it love , I can protect and care for it  --  make up to it for the sin of which it is innocent , but for which it must suffer all its life . They say the war is over . For me  --  for us  --  it will never be over . " p. 80 WILLIAM " Yes , you are right . I will leave you with your cub , so that every day  --  every hour , you will be reminded of your shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? You 're not going away ! " WILLIAM " Do you think I 'll share this roof with your bastard ? " MARGARET " William , you must n't go away . You must n't ! I know how hard  --  how terrible it is for you . I 'd do anything  --  anything to spare you this suffering . But it 's too late now . What has happened ca n't be altered . If I 've done wrong , forgive me . I prayed to God for strength and guidance and I tried to do what was best for you  --  for everyone . Let 's try to be as happy as we can . Just think  --  it 's two years since we 've seen each other , and now , when you 're scarcely home  --  oh , why do they make these cruel wars ? We were so happy before . William , you 're not yourself . The shock has been too much for you . Be patient . Rest yourself before you decide . " WILLIAM " Do you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll never see me again . " MARGARET " You 've made up your mind that we must separate . " WILLIAM " Yes . " MARGARET " Then let me go . I 'm the guilty one  --  this is your home  --  " p. 81 WILLIAM " No ! The house is no longer mine . You have defiled it . " MARGARET " But where will you go ? What will you do ? You 're crippled and  --  " WILLIAM " I will offer myself to my country . I 've given up everything for the Fatherland . The Fatherland will provide for me . " ( He goes toward the door ) MARGARET " William . " ( He does not turn ) MARGARET " Goodbye , William ! " ( He goes out without answering . Margaret stands motionless staring vacantly ahead of her . After a while Karl enters with his spade ) KARL " Hello ! No voices ! Are you there , Margaret ? " MARGARET " Yes . " KARL " William go out ? " MARGARET " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show his medals , eh ? He 's just like a schoolboy , that big fellow . " ( He seats himself and begins unlacing his boots ) " It 's like old times to have him back again . " ( Pulls off boot ) " Whew ! That 's better . I 'll be glad when supper 's ready , Margaret . Digging people 's graves gives one an appetite . " ( He hums gaily and pulls off the other boot as @x The same room . It is night . The lamp is lit and outside is quite dark . Karl is sitting at the window . Margaret is sitting opposite him near the lamp knitting and rocking the cradle . For a while there is silence , broken only by the clicking of the needles ) KARL " There 's a chill in the air tonight . " MARGARET " Yes . We 'll be needing a fire in here soon . " KARL " The ground is getting harder , too . It takes much longer to dig a grave . Luckily , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago . One can afford to take one 's time about it now . " MARGARET " Soon it will be very cold on the roads and in the fields at night . " KARL " Yes . Those that have a sound roof over their heads and a little firewood to burn are lucky , I tell you . There 'll be plenty who have n't this winter  --  poor devils . " MARGARET " I wonder where William is . " ( Karl gives an exclamation of impatience ) MARGARET " He 'll be cold  --  terribly cold . His clothes are thin and badly torn and he has n't much money , I 'm sure . " KARL " His skin is thick enough . " p. 83 MARGARET " What can he be doing ? What can he do  --  with one arm  --  a man who 's lived by the use of his hands ? " KARL " Eh , you 're right there . He 'd be better off without his head . Damn him ! " MARGARET " It 's three months since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps he 's starving  --  or sick , who can tell ? He must be alive , though  --  or else  --  they would have brought him home . " KARL " Oh , he 's alive all right . Chaps like that do n't die so easily . " MARGARET " Do you think the government is looking out for him ? " KARL ( Laughing )  --  " The government ? That 's a good one ! " MARGARET " When he went away , he said that the Fatherland would provide for him  --  because he had given up everything for it . " KARL " That 's another one of his foolish ideas . What do you suppose the Fatherland cares about him ? " MARGARET " He fought for the Fatherland  --  he lost his arm in the war . " KARL " That 's all very good , but war is one thing and peace is another . In war-time your William was a bit of a hero  --  the saviour of his country and all that sort of thing , but now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graft . " p. 84 MARGARET " Then what can he be doing ? " KARL " What does it matter what he 's doing ? Let him go to the devil in his own way ! " MARGARET " Karl ! " KARL " Why are you always thinking about him ? " MARGARET " How can I help thinking of him  --  wandering about alone ! Without money  --  without friends ! " KARL " And what about you ? Sacrificing yourself for your fine William and then having him treat you like this ! " MARGARET " It is as the good God wills . " KARL " There you go again . The good God ! Everything that happens you blame on God ! A bloody war breaks out , kills millions of people , makes millions of others suffer and you say it 's the work of God . A brute of a Cossack comes along and ravishes you , makes you the mother of a child that will be a source of sorrow all its life , and you comfort yourself by saying its God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever commit I 'd like to know ! Then your damned pig-headed fool of a husband runs off and leaves you and you say it 's GOD 'S will , and on top of it all , you call him the GOOD GOD ! I do n't understand it . " MARGARET " Karl , do n't talk like that . For the sake of your soul . " p. 85 KARL " Well , I do n't like your God . I like a God with whom I can have a friendly argument if I want to . If things are n't going the way I think they should go , I want to tell Him so and have it out with Him . And , I do n't want to blame Him for all the wickedness and stupidity of men and women . " MARGARET " Karl , Karl , please stop ! You make me tremble . To speak of God like that . May He have mercy on your soul ! " KARL " Phew ! I 'm getting a frightful temper lately . First thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a little warmer , though . " ( Rosa enters from the kitchen ) ROSA " Is there anything else to be done , Mrs. Dreier ? " MARGARET " No , Rosa . He 's asleep . Rest yourself . " ( Rises ) " You 've been working hard all day . " ( Looks into the cradle ) ROSA " Are you going out ? " MARGARET " Yes , I 'm going down the road to old Ludwig Wolff 's . I 've just finished knitting these heavy stockings for him . Poor old man . His son was paralyzed in the war , you know  --  and poor Ludwig has to go to work very early every morning . His blood 's thin and he feels the cold . " ROSA " Let me go , Mrs. Dreier . You must be terribly tired . Please let me go . " p. 86 MARGARET " No , thank you , Rosa . I 'm not tired . Besides , I want to say a few words to the old man . He 's so down-hearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , Margaret ? " MARGARET " Then he wo n't have the stockings for the morning  --  and it may be frosty . It 's not far ; I 'll be back soon . " ( She goes out with a lantern ) KARL " That 's a great woman , Rosa . " ROSA ( Simply )  --  " She 's an angel , Mr. Karl . " KARL " Well , I do n't know about that . I 've never seen an angel . But from the pictures of them I 've seen , they do n't look as though they spent much time knitting stockings for broken-down old carpenters . " ROSA " You should n't joke about such things , Mr. Karl . " KARL " No ; you 're right , Rosa . Well , whether Margaret 's an angel or not  --  there are n't many like her . " ROSA " There is no one like her . Who else would have taken me in , when my mother died ? Do you know , Mr. Karl , I hardly miss my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " KARL " She 's good to everyone  --  she always was . And when that idiot William ran off , that did n't change her a bit . Do you think anybody else would n't have turned sour ? I guess not . " p. 87 ROSA " Why did he go away like that , Mr. Karl ? I do n't understand it . " KARL " Well , I 'm twice as old as you are and I do n't understand it , either . " ROSA " I think she misses him . She never talks about him , but I think she does just the same . " KARL " She 's a fool if she does . " ROSA " Oh , Mr. Karl ! " KARL " I guess I did n't mean that . What an old tinderbox I 'm getting to be ! " ( Thoughtfully ) " Tinderbox , eh ? I never thought of that before ! That 's a good name for some of those fellows I met out there . Just get the right kind of a spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Karl ? " KARL " It was bad enough . " ROSA " Poor Fritz ! He must have suffered , too . " KARL " Yes . Poor Fritz . " ROSA " Do you think he 'll come back soon , Mr. Karl ? " KARL " It 's four months now , Rosa , since the war ended " ROSA " Yes , that 's why ! He ca n't stay away much longer . I look for him every day . " p. 88 KARL " Yes . " ROSA " You do n't think he 'll come back . I can tell that by your voice and your face . " KARL " Rosa " ROSA " Oh , it does n't matter . I do n't expect anyone to believe it . But , I know he 'll come back . I know that God will answer my prayers . " KARL " I hope so . " ROSA " Everyone said that Mr. Dreier was n't going to come back . But he did . " KARL " It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fritz will do the same thing . He 'll fool you all some day , by walking in quietly " KARL " Well , if he fools us that way , we sha n't find fault with him . " ROSA " Oh , I 've pictured it to myself a hundred times . Often , at night , when I ca n't sleep , I slip down here and sit by the window and dream that I see him coming home . " KARL " And does that make you happy ? " ROSA " Oh , indeed it does ! I keep my eyes fixed on the bend in the road , waiting patiently . Suddenly , I see him coming around the turn , in a bright uniform , with his sword by his side . I do n't move , but watch him come nearer and nearer until  --  " ( She gives a sudden piercing scream ) p. 89 KARL " What 's the matter ? What 's happened ? " ROSA ( Crossing herself repeatedly )  --  " Heavenly Father . There 's a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Fritz ! Fritz ! " ( She starts to run out but Karl seizes her ) KARL " Control yourself , Rosa . There 's nobody there . You 've talked yourself into this . " ROSA " No , no ! I tell you he 's coming this way ! He 's walking very slowly ! Oh , if you could only see ! Thank God ! Thank God ! My Fritz has come back to me ! " KARL " Be calm , Rosa . Look again . Do you see anyone now ? " ROSA " Yes ! Yes ! He 's coming up the path to the house . Soon , he 'll be where the light will fall on him ! Then I 'll see his face ! Oh , he 's walking so slowly  --  so slowly ! Now ! He 's coming nearer and nearer ! A few steps more  --  now ! " ( She gives a long despairing cry and hurries into the kitchen sobbing bitterly ) KARL " Rosa ! Rosa ! Come back ! I told you there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She 'll go out of her mind some day , Rosa ! Come here ! I want to talk to you ! " ( He searches about for his stick . The door opens slowly and William enters . He is pale and haggard . His uniform is even dirtier than before and more ragged . Rags are wrapped about his feet in place of shoes . He walks slowly and painfully ) p. 90 KARL " Good God , what 's that ? Did someone come in ? Who 's there ? " WILLIAM ( Sinking wearily into a chair )  --  " It 's I ! " KARL ( Recovering himself )  --  " Oh , it 's you , is it ? So you 've come back ? " WILLIAM ( Gruffly )  --  " Well , what of it ? " KARL " With as little ceremony as you went away . " WILLIAM " That 's no concern of yours . This is my house and I come and go as I please . " KARL " You 're right about that . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion " WILLIAM " I 'm not asking your opinion . " KARL " I 'll give it to you , anyhow . " WILLIAM " No , you wo n't . You mind your own damned business . I wo n't have you interferring with me . Do you hear me ? " KARL " Oho ! So , the mighty Captain Dreier is going to tell people what they shall say and what they sha n't . " WILLIAM " Yes , and I 'll smash your head in if you do n't shut up . " KARL " Do n't try to bully me , you tin soldier . " p. 91 WILLIAM ( In a frenzy )  --  " I 'll break your neck , damn you ! " ( He lurches at Karl but falls back exhausted ) KARL " Well , why do n't you hit me ? " WILLIAM ( Weakly )  --  " For God 's sake , man , give me something to eat . I have n't had any food for three days . " KARL " What ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " KARL " Well , why the devil did n't you say so in the first place ? Wait a minute ! " ( He hobbles off to the kitchen and returns in a few moments with some bread and milk , which William takes and devours ravenously ) KARL " That 's better , eh ? " WILLIAM " I could n't have lasted much longer . " KARL " You 've had bad luck , it seems . " WILLIAM " Bad luck ! Injustice , that 's what you mean . " KARL " It 's not quite the same thing . " WILLIAM " There 's no such thing as justice in this world . " KARL " Hello ! Have YOU discovered that ? Well , that 's encouraging . " p. 92 WILLIAM " Yes , I 've discovered it . " KARL " How  --  when  --  where ? " WILLIAM " Need you ask that ! I 've come back in rags , penniless  --  starving " KARL " Well , whose fault is that ? " WILLIAM " Whose fault ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risked my life a thousand times , gave up " KARL " Oh , I see  --  the Fatherland . Yes , of course , you thought they would take care of you . " ( William laughs bitterly ) KARL " They did n't do it , eh ? What did they say ? " WILLIAM " They said I was n't entitled to a pension , because I was wounded after peace was declared . One day too late ! As though that made it any easier for me " KARL " Whom did you see ? " WILLIAM " I saw everybody . I 've been all the way to Berlin . " KARL " Phew ! Walked all the way ? " WILLIAM " And back . I tramped around from one government office to another . I 've been ordered about by porters and sneered at by little , oily clerks . I 've waited in their offices for hours at a time , only to be told that Mr. So-and-So was sorry , but he could n't see me as he was late for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince pinned the Iron Cross , was less important than some under-secretary 's dinner . " p. 93 KARL " Well , I suppose under-secretaries must eat , too . " WILLIAM ( Intent on his grievance )  --  " Now and then I 'd see some official or other . I 'd offer my services to him  --  to my country . He 'd say he was sorry , he could do nothing for me . I would do much better to return to my home and make up for the time I 'd lost in the war , instead of adding to the burdens of the government . Adding to the burdens ! They did n't find me a burden at Verdun , two years ago ! " KARL " Two years makes a difference . " WILLIAM " They would n't even look at my medals or listen to the history of them . Half of them had never smelt powder . Then they 'd bow me out of their offices and a hundred others like me would go in and come out just as I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , their interest in us ended , too . " KARL " It 's you who are ungrateful , William . Was n't the war fought in your interest and mine  --  in the interest of the race ? " WILLIAM " In my interest ? What are you talking about ? " KARL " Why , of course . Do n't you remember ? We were growing weak and effeminate , so we went to war in order to grow stronger and manly again . Well , here we are  --  we two who went away together . Just see what a blessing the war has been to us . To be sure , you say that you 're in rags and penniless and starving and you 're missing an arm  --  but no doubt the other arm is twice or three times as strong as it was . And as to starving  --  why , that 's the best thing in the world for you , you know . It makes you ambitious . It 's a mistake to feed a man too well . He loses interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never mind about me . The point is we 've been re  --  re  --  what was old Halbe 's word  --  oh , yes , of course  --  rejuvenated ! That 's it , we 've been rejuvenated . Dear old Halbe ! We 've done him an injustice ! We 've never recognizd him as a humorist. " p. 94 WILLIAM ( Surlily )  --  " Well , you were always so wise , you always had ideas and theories about things ; why the devil did n't you stay home ? I met a lot like you in the trenches . They talk and talk , but that 's all it amounts to . " KARL " Oh , so I should have stayed home , should I ? So that my good friend and superior officer , Lieutenant William Dreier , could have shot me as a something or other  --  a coward or a traitor . No , thank you . But wait  --  wait , friend William ! The next generation will do things differently . When that one in the cradle there arrives at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world and more  --  let us say , cowards and traitors . Yes , things will be different then ! I know ! My ears have made up for what my eyes have missed . " WILLIAM " The next generation ? What 's that to do with me ? Does that make it easier for me ? Does that lessen my country 's ingratitude ? " KARL " Quite true . I 've been forgetting all about your misfortunes . Well , go on . And so , when you became convinced of your country 's ingratitude , you decided to come home ? " WILLIAM " I was almost penniless . My shoes were worn out and I could n't buy new ones . My money did n't last long enough . When it was gone , I had to go without food . " p. 95 KARL " Did n't you pass any farm houses ? " WILLIAM " Do you think I 'm a beggar ? " KARL " Of course , you 'd sold all your medals ? " WILLIAM " My medals ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them must be of gold or silver . " WILLIAM ( Clasping them proudly )  --  " Do you think I 'd part with one of these ? I have n't fallen as low as that . Honor still means more to me than life . " KARL ( Sighing )  --  " It must be terrible to be blind . " WILLIAM " What do you mean ? " KARL " Nothing . And , so you 've come back to ask Margaret 's forgiveness ? " WILLIAM " Margaret 's forgiveness  --  for what ? " KARL " For the way you left her  --  for the things you said . " WILLIAM " I 've come back to take my place at the head of my house . " KARL " And where do you think your house would be , if it were n't for Margaret ? " WILLIAM " I do n't understand you . " KARL " I 'll soon make you understand . Suppose Margaret had taken you at your word , after you left , had ended her life ? " p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that , has she ? " KARL " How do you know what she 's thought of ? Much you knew or cared what she was thinking or doing while you were tramping about the country . Suppose , instead of going on as she always did , helping others , thinking of everybody but herself , she had listened to your damn nonsense and put a bullet through her head ? " WILLIAM " Do n't talk of it ! " KARL " Yes , I 'm going to talk of it until you get some sense into your head . What would you do , if that had happened , I 'd like to know  --  if you 'd come back here and found your wife , dead , and your home gone to smash ! You 'd crawl into some hole and die like a wounded animal . You talk about your place ! I 'll tell you where it is  --  on your knees asking her to forgive you . That 's your place  --  at Margaret 's feet . " ( A lantern is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern ! There 's someone coming ! " KARL " That 's Margaret ! " ( They both sit in silence for almost a minute , waiting tensely for Margaret 's entrance . At length the door opens and she comes in  --  she is astonished ) MARGARET " William ! " p. 97 WILLIAM " Yes , I 've come back . " MARGARET " How thin and pale you are ! And your feet  --  why they 're bleeding . " ( She hurries into the kitchen ) WILLIAM " Margaret " ( She has already gone out . In a few minutes , she returns with a basin of water . She sits on the floor , unwraps the bandages from one of William 's feet and begins to wash it ) WILLIAM ( Clearing his throat )  --  " Margaret , I have something to say to you . " MARGARET " Later , William , We 'll talk later . " ( Margaret washes in silence ) WILLIAM ( Suddenly )  --  " Karl , you are right  --  my place is at her feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " The other one , now . " ( She unwraps the bandages , as
