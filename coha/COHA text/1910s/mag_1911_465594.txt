pERHAPS nothing illustrates better the vicissitudes of pronunciation in English than a study of what is called the " Irish brogue " ? that method of pronouncing English which distinguishes people born in Ireland from those in other English-speaking countries . It is more than mere pronunciation . however , that differentiates Irish English . There are many quaint forms of speech and some expressions and usages that are distinctive . This lingual mode , for it is scarcely to be called a dialect , is usually presumed to be a deterioration of language due to lack of education and contact with legitimate sources of English . It proves after a little study to be a preservation of the old method of pronouncing English , which has come down to a great degree unchanged in Ireland from Shakespeare 's time . It was during Shakespeare 's life in Elizabeth 's time that the English language first gained a firm foothold in Ireland . The neighboring island had been annexed under T-Tenry II. , and a number of Anglo-Normans had taken up their residence in it ; but instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irish ; and indeed , as has been often said , these families , who include the Burkes and all those whose family names begin with Fitz and many another that is now thought distinctively Gaelic , - became more Irish than the Irish themselves . Even much later immigrants from England adopted Irish as their spoken language . In Elizabeth 's time , however , it came to he realized that if there was to be any real affiliation of the two countries , then the Irish language must be supplanted by English , and a definite effort in this direction was made . This change of speech , resented and resisted , was nevertheless successfully accomplished all over which readers of Harper 's will remember as having been originally published in this magazine , Professor Lounsbury says : " Nearly all eighteenth - century orthoepists pronounced yes as if it were spelled this . Indeed , Walker took the pains to assure us that while it was a mark of incorrectness and vulgarity to give to yet the sound of yit , the best and most established usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus reprobated , was undoubtedly a survival of what was once good usage . The triumph of e over in its pronunciation merely preceded its later triumph in yes . " This encroachment of the sound of i upon c was very common in all English words at that time , nor indeed have we entirely got away from the influence of this tendency at the present time . Examples are not hard to find . Of course we all say a young woman is pritty , except some very affected people who insist on declaring her pretty . No one would think of *pronouncing the very word English with an e sound at the beginning of it . Now as of old we talk about ThyUsk , of course . Most people say wirnmin and not wimmen , though the latter sound is asserting itself more and more . It is not surprising , knowing as we do about the encroachment of i on short e in the olden time , that Irishmen continue to say min , pin , and sind , instead of men , pen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but conservatism . The preservation of a similar tendency to the encroachment of e upon a is to be noted in many Irishisms , some of which are shared by most English-speaking people . An Irishman is likely to say ketch for catch , and in proper names he says Welch for Walsh , and , with the rest of the world of course , says reddish for radish , though the a sound is said to be coming into use as the more elegant pronunciation of the word . On the other hand , the e sounds by a sort of compensation , as it were , were often changed to a , especially when they occurred before r . An Irishman still says clerk for clerk , and clergy for clergy , but all the world did that in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ; and some of these a sounds for a axe still retained in such words as Derby and Berkley . Only the Irishman , however , still says serpent , though with the history of English pronunciation before us it is easy to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be traced far back in our English speech . For instance , the Irishman from the country districts of Ireland still talks about goold for gold . This is supposed to he a significant index of degeneration of speech and ignorance on the part of the speaker . This very pronunciation goold was so common in England when Walker wrote his pronouncing dictionary that that lexicographer , in the words of Professor Lounsbury , " looked upon it as a disgrace to the language that indolence and vulgarity had thus been enabled to corrupt the o into the sound it then had . Still , he deemed it too firmly entrenched ever to disappear , " This curious sound of o , as it would seem to us , will not be so surprising , however , if we recall that even the word Rome was in the olden time pronounced as if it were spelled room . In " Julius Caesar " Shakespeare represents Cassius as punning on the word Rome , using room for the other term of the pun : Now is it Rome indeed and room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the case of goold it manifestly pained him to make the admission , that the o of Rome seemed irrevocably committed to the sound represented by the o in the word move . The oo sound of o is not nearly so unusual as we might think , and was very common in many words in the seventeenth century . It is with regard to the diphthongs , however , that the Irish sin most mortally if we are to accept the modern canons of pronunciation as absolutely final . Every self-respecting Irishman is likely to say that be resaves a favor instead of receiving it , and in every other word in which ei occurs after c , and is usually pronounced long a , lie utters the long a . As a matter of fact , ei is normally in English pronunciation , so far as anything can he normal in so changing a mode , long a . No one ever thinks of pronouncing rein or vein , or feign or reign , or any of a dozen other words that might be named , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was true also in the words receive , deceive , conceive . etc. , until the eighteenth century , when , to the disgust of a number of very intelligent people , some simpering city folk began to change the fine old-fashioned long a sound for the long e . In spite of the opposition of those who thought they knew better and who set themselves firmly against the new movement , the simper maintained itself , and all the world now indulges in it , except the Irishman , who , having been out of the current of vicissitudinous English pronunciational variation , still maintains the habit of his fathers and of all the English forefathers . Another flagrant example of Irish pronunciation , a very stigma of the brogue , is the Gaelic custom so well represented by the anecdote told of the Irishman who , being asked which he preferred . neether or neyether , said that nayther would do . At least in this combination the pronunciation of ei as long a would seem surely to be quite out of the question on any good English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what Mr. Richard Grant White had to say many years ago with respect to the pronunciation of just these words . He considers that the Irish pronunciation has complete warrant in the history of the language . He said : " The analogically correct pronunciation of these words is what we call the Trish one , either and nattier ; the diphthong having the sound which , it.has in many words in which ei is , and apparently has always been , so pronounced ? weight , freight , deign , vein , obeisance , etc . This sound , too , has come down from the Anglo-Saxon times , as we have already seen , the word in that language being wgther ; and there can be no doubt that in this , as in some other respects , the language of the educated Irish Englishman is analogically correct , and in conformity to ancient custom . His pronunciation of certain syllables in ei which have acquired in English usage the sound of e long , as , for example , conceit , receive , and which he pronounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E had of old the sound of a long , and i the sound of e , particularly in words which came to us from or through the Norman French . " Other diphthongs can he illustrated quite as strikingly . Of course the Irishman says Waite and not teeth when he wants to imply that he is talking about the giving of instruction . Even in Pope 's time , however , ea was very frequently if not commonly pronounced long a . We have the well-known couplet : There are many other examples that show that this was the common pronunciation of the ea during the preceding century . Shakespeare 's tendency to make puns has enabled us to know just how vowel and diphthong sounds were rendered in his time . One of them helps us in this matter of ea . In the speech of Leontes to Paulina , when in the second scene of the second act of " The Winter 's Tale " she fails to persuade him to give up his foolish jealousy of his wife and recognize her child as his , Leontes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wards beat and baits would have been entirely lost only that the two diphthongs were sounded in the same way . In lir . Ellis 's table of vowel and diphthongal pronunciations in Shakespeare , as quoted in Fleay 's Manual of Shakespeare , ea is said to have been pronounced commonly in the time of the dramatist as a in mare , rarely as e in eve , very rarely as a in the French word chatie , and occasionally as a in met . With regard to ei Mr. Ellis says that it is usually pronounced as ey in they or as a in mare , and only rarely as ay ( eye ) . To revert to ea , there are of course two vowels in it , and the question that has always disturbed pronunciation has been which of these should predominate . Long ago the a predominated , and even at the present time the a sound is much more heard than is the e . For instance , in such words as heart and hearth the a is persistently maintained . During the seventeenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency was rather to emphasis on the broader vowel sounds than on the slenderer ones . Fleay says , " The fact of the matter is that especially during the last quarter of the sixteenth and the first quarter of the seventeenth century the English pronunciation was less fixed than almost at any other time in its history . " Spelling also was very uncertain , and men spelled and pronounced with no idea of following rules , but quite satisfied if only they were understood . There are some among us at the present time who might sigh for that precious era when one could pronounce as one pleased and spell as one pronounced . With regard to the Irish pronunciation of the consonants , practically the same thing is found to be true as for the vowels . Certain consonantal differences in Irish English , that are usually set down as due to ignorance or at . least to provincialism , are really vestiges of the Shakespearian pronunciation of English . The most prominent of these are con-corned with the addition or the suppression of h in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty with h at the beginning of words . They occasionally drop it in the middle of words or at the end , while occasionally they insert it following a t or a d where it does not exist . A typical example is murther for murder , and another shoulther for shoulder . For this usage there is excellent warrant in Shakespeare , and it is generally conceded that this was the accepted pronunciation in Elizabeth 's and Xames 's time . For certain omissions , as for instance in the word nothing , often pronounced nawtin by those of the Irish who have most faithfully preserved the old-time pronunciation and who have most of the brogue , there is also justification in the old time . Without some such suppression of the h the pun that is well known to occur in the title of Shakespeare 's " Much Ado About Nothing , " which is also Much Ado About Noting N. e. , Hero 's actions would he lost . At the end of words the omission of h is well illustrated in the familiar Irish expression " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a term that is often affectionately used by the Irish in speaking of their native land . One old Irishwoman refused to believe that she could go to heaven in happiness unless the road thither led through what she called in her pronunciation the " owl dart . " Her expression illustrates a number of phases of Elizabethan pronunciation . In the first place the o of old was pronounced ow , for o was very unsettled in its pronunciation , and before kl usually took this ow sound . Richard Grant White , for instance , does not hesitate to say that soldier was pronounced sowldjer at this time . Secondly , when two consonants occurred at the end of a word and the next word began with a vowel sound , in old-fashioned speech the final consonant was carried over to the next word , so that it was rather hard for one unused to the language to recognize just where the division of words really was . This has made this colloquial expression " the owl dart " a puzzle to even many of the Irish themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is only an example of the a sound predominating , as in heart , and the final h is suppressed . This suppression of final is was rather common among the Irish , who , for example , said and still say wid for with , and even wiciout for without . Another consonant. that is often suppressed by the Irish is the l in certain words . An Irishman is likely to say , " Well , it is your own faut . " In this , however , he is following the genius of the language rather than modern customs . There are many words in which 1 is thus suppressed normally in English , . and Professor Lounsbury notes that in such words as half , folk , calm , and walk , as indeed practically whenever I is followed by f , 1.7 , or m , it is suppressed . Everybody suppressed it in fault until the end of the eighteenth century . As a matter of fact , the I had been originally absent from the spelling , for our word came to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1 was adopted into our spelling , but did not get into our pronunciation for a full century later . Pope and Swift regularly rhymed it with words like ought , and brought , and thought , and taught . Even so late as Doctor Goldsmith 's time we find such rhymes in the Deserted Village ( 1770 ) as aught and fault , and at that time it was probably a perfect rhyme . Doctor Johnson in his dictionary says that ( in his time ) " the is sometimes sounded and sometimes not . In conversation it is generally suppressed . " There is another interesting feature of the pronunciation of English by the Irish which recalls the changes that have taken place in the vocalization of our English speech as a consequence of certain changes in the habits of many people in our more matter-of-fact modern times . There is a distinct tendency of late years to throw the accent back as far as possible in the pronunciation of long English words , thus making it more and more difficult to use the language to advantage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English-speaking people , and this is doubtless the principal reason for the ready neviescence in the unfortunate habit of throwing back the accent , which makes it so trying to the public speaker to secure at a distance the facile hearing of the ends of his words . The Irishman is still a born orator , however , and so he has not yielded to any great extent to this tendency . He still accents many words on the penultimate syllable which we Americans and the English accent on the antepenultimate . In so doing , however , the Irishman is maintaining the old-fashioned pronunciation . He says contrary , of course , but so did Shakespeare . The Irishman , of course , says demonstrate and contemplate , but be also accentuates the penult in cases where most of us are accustomed to hear and to use the antepenultimate accentuation . It most not be forgotten that in this ease he is following the old-time method of pronunciation . There are some very surprising things to be found in this matter . Professor Lounsbury calls attention to - what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of tho accent in these long words . Few men were better situated than Rogers to know how the intellectual people of England pronounced their own language . At his table most of the wits and writers assembled , and he was familiarly acquainted with them . Ho was quite indignant over the antepenultimate accentuation in words that now seem to us almost impossible of pronunciation any other way . He said : " The now fashionable pronunciation of several words is to me , at least , offensive ; cein template is bad enough , but balcony makes me sick . " Professor Lounsbury adds : " At the present time it would produce a similar nauseating effect upon many to hear the accent fall upon the second syllable of this last word , as was once the usual practice . " Rogers 's expression , however , should form ample justification for the Irishmen who insist on clinging to the accent on the penult in so many words . The Irish have some rather interesting peculiarities in the use of verbs , which , like everything else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degeneration , at least , if not worse . These peculiarly Irish verbs and favorite Irish forms of verbs are really representatives of good old English expressions . Most unsophisticated Irishmen will use the expression af eared instead of afraid , though contact with English-speaking people of other countries soon diverts them from it because of the ridicule that attaches to its use . Af eared is. however , the most familiar form of the verb meaning " to be afraid " extant in Shakespeare 's time . It is to be found in most of his plays , occurring altogether some thirty times in them , and no fewer than four times in " The Tempest , " Shakespeare 's latest and perhaps most studied composition . The same thing is true of a number of other Irish verbs which are not so familiar . A very common expression among the Trish is , " It is mizzling , " meaning that it is drizzling . The verb to mizzle is a good English word that was in very common use two centuries ago . There are certain tense forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are supposed to be characteristically Gaelic , though they really represent fossil forms of English tenses no longer in common use Some of them , indeed , are very significantly expressive , so that it is too bad that they have been allowed to drop out of usage , because they helped to express shades of meaning which otherwise demand roundabout phrasing . A single example will suffice to show what we mean . How often has it not been said in academic circles that we have no equivalent for the Greek aorist , and how often has this poverty of tense expression in English not been deplored . This tense deficiency is , however , true only as far as English English goes . In Irish English the lack is not felt . Any one who has ever tried translating most of the forms of the Greek aorist after the model of the Irish expressions , " I am after doing it " ? with the curious present sense that the aorist sometimes has ? or , " I was after doing it , " or , for certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be after doing so and so , " will usually find that he has a better equivalent for the Greek meaning than can be obtained by any other circumlocution , however studied it may be . The Irish enjoy certain distinctions with regard to the use of auxiliaries as well as of verbs themselves that.are worth while tracing to their historical source , because the investigation makes it clear that it is not because of any fault that their usage is different , except in so far as the clinging to old-fashioned forms , which were eminently correct in their day , can be attributed to them as a fault . For instance , there is a rather well-grounded impression that Irishmen find it much more difficult to maintain the correct usage of shall and will than do most other English-speaking people . According to one well-known anecdote , all of the London papers are edited by young Irishmen , only an Englishman must he kept on the staff " in order ' to keep the shafts and wills straight . " Now it so happens that if Shakespeare himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict grammarian he would probably be found guilty on many counts in this matter . The present usage of shall and will had not as yet developed at the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century , when Shakespeare was writing English and the Irish were learning the language . Our greatest of writers , then , does not follow the rules which were only made after his time , and most Irishmen still talk Shakespeare 's English . In the same way , many other words that are supposed to be characteristically Irish corruptions , introduced into English by the failure of the uneducated Irish tongue to get around the peculiarities of English words , prove on closer examinations to be irreproachable old English . A few examples will suffice to illustrate this , though a great many might readily be given . Most Irishmen , for instance , say drouth , and not drought , which is now the more generally accepted English word for thirst or for a season of dry weather . The Century Dietiouary notes , however , that drouth is etymologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sometimes thought to be an Irishism . English-speaking people , as a rule , in England itself or in America , talk of the weight of a thing rather than the heft of a thing , but heft is good English and has an excellent warrant in etymology . An Irishman will sometimes talk of taking a man by the thrapple , or thropple , instead of throat , Thrapplo is a good old Anglo-Saxon expression , and is much nearer to the old word throat-boll , the prominent part of the throat , than our modern mutilation which employs only the first syllable . Throte-bolle is to be found in Chaucer in the Reeve 's Tale , showing the comparative antiquity of the original form of the expression in that " well of English undefiled . " Certain words that occur frequently in the mouth of the Irish , much more frequently than their use by others who talk English would seem to justify , prove to have an interesting history when investigated . Irishmen use again much more commonly than most people , and this is usually set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is , on the contrary , a reversion to the best days of Elizabethan and Jacobean English , as may be readily illustrated by quotations from the writers of these periods . Ben Jonson in " Every Man Out of His Humour " says : " Bid your fellows get all their flails ready again I come , " using an expression that now seems almost hopelessly Gaelic . Lord Bacon frequently says , " As much or as many again , " " I-Talf as much again , " and similar phrases . Any one who thinks that the frequent use of this word by the Irish is at all due to any influence of theirs , or indeed to anything else than their preservation of the modes of English taught them in Shakespeare 's time , need only look up the word again in a Shakespeare concordance , and see how many times and in how many different ways the great English " master of them that know " lies employed it . In Bartlett 's Concordance it will be found to occur altogether some five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of again as an adverb , which now seems to many to be a hopeless Irishism , it will he as well to take up the other sense of the word in which it is used as a preposition . The word is very rarely so employed now by English-speaking people in England or in this country , though it is very commonly used in this way by the Irish . What more familiar expression among them , for example , than " He fought agin us , " the e rather than the a being emphasized in the pronunciation . The almost universally used form of the preposition " against " is practically never employed by them . The Irishism is , however , actually purer speech than that which has taken its place . Prepositions ending in st , such as against , amidst , amongst , Professor Lounsbury notes , are corrupt forms that have crept into use in spite of the protests of the educated and the guardians of language . Some claim of euphony , real or . opposed , iii the terminal consonants st has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same etymological category as onest ? if that is the spelling by which the familiar colloquial sound wonst may be conveyed . This latter is frankly recognized as a vulgarism . Its recent popularity seems to portend , however , that it will become in time that nondescript thing , good English , as its analogue against and other words have become . Doubtless even then the Irish peasant , especially from the country districts , will cling to the inure cermet form " once " as he has done with regard to " again , " and will very probably be laughed at for his conservatism ? which will perhaps be stigmatized as ignorance or incapacity . It is evident . I think , from what I have said , that the Irish brogue , far from being a degeneration of language or a token of ignorance , as it is so often presumed to be , is really only a nice exhibition of a clinging to old-fashioned ways and modes of speech , all the more admirable because clinging to anything old , no matter how good it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term brogue is said to come from the word used for the coarse shoes worn by the Irish peasantry . Their dialect , like their shoes , was supposed to be rough and suited only for themselves , a thing by itself that no one with any sense of propriety could be expected ever to use . Instead of this it proves to be fine old-fashioned English , somewhat out of date , it is true , but not the less interesting for that . It is like a good old pair of hand-made shoes which its owner may cling to even though they are unfashionable , because there is so much of comfort in them , and it is bothersome to adapt oneself to the newfangled ideas in font-wear . While the many changes have been occurring in our English speech , the Irish have gone on enjoying the privilege of using the old form and preserving it for future generations to study in the life . When the Wife of Bath in Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales is represented as talking with something of a brogue , many people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be because char acters such as she , when put upon our modern stage , are almost invariably represented as using this broad pronunciation . There is a much better reason than this , however . It is probable that this mode of speech reproduces , more closely than any other that could well he devised , the actual fashion of talk of herself and the company . It should not be limited to her , moreover , but all the others should also have a touch of brogue . If Shakespeare were to come back to us talking as he did in his own time , his speech , not only in pronunciation , but in many more essential characters , would be better represented by what we know as the Irish brogue than in any other way .
