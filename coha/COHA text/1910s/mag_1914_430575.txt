The European war has produced a flood of literature of all sorts . England and Germany have published " White Papers , " Russia , " Orange Papers , " and Belgium , " Gray Papers , " containing such portions of their official diplomatic correspondence as they severally chose to make public in presenting their part in the negotiations resulting in war . A perusal , and still more a careful study , of these documents brings the conviction , not that any one nation is wholly in the wrong , but ? as each claims to be right ? that we need another and better standard of determining what is right for a nation . This observation holds not only of the official publications but also of the increasing unofficial presentations of the several nations ' cases . These latter are already numerous . To England 's defence come Sir Edward Cook with a short summary entitled " Why Britain is at War , " and Mr. J. M. Kennedy with the more extended " How the War Began " ; both rest on the documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Britishers , the texts of which they reproduce in part . " Why We Are at War : Great Britain 's Case " is issued by the members of the Oxford Faculty of Modern History . Of the English presentations at hand this is the best ; with its introduction on the preliminaries of the war , and the text of the document , it makes a useful handbook . The Germans have not lagged in the competition to capture public opinion . We have at hand a pamphlet entitled " Die Wahrheit iiber den Krieg , " prepared jointly by Paul Dehn , Dr. Drechsler , Dr. Franeke , and seven other prominent Germans , and known to have been circulated broadcast . It is this pamphlet which ( in a substantially literal English translation under the title " The Truth about Germany " ) was given to Americans leaving Germany . To counteract its influence Mr. Douglas Sladen has written " The Real Truth about Germany ' " which , taking up the German publication paragraph by paragraph , gives the viewpoint of the English in refutation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given as the text in the English edition by Mr. Sladen . The latter 's chapter " Who Is to Be Victorious ? " ( in which it is argued that Germany will not continue to respect the Monroe Doctrine ) does not appear in the original . We have no means of explaining this discrepancy and mention it without meaning to reflect on any one . But what of it ? A book of this kind , consisting as it does of opinions of men with different premises , converts but few . " The Case of Belgium in the Present War , " the work of the Belgian delegates to the United States , is an account of the violation of the neutrality of Belgium and of the laws of war in Belgian territory by Germany . It contains diplomatic correspondence and the findings of the Belgian commission in the form of a number of surprising affidavits and statements of witnesses . These latter are in a number of cases not so convincing as to be above question . Another group of books , less directly concerned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear . " The Russian Army from Within " is the work of Mr. Barnes Steveni , who for twenty-seven years has lived in Russia . Though written in the greatest haste , the book is readable and instructive . The peasant , who , according to Mr. Steveni , is the backbone of the army , is of medium stature , and as a recruit more often than not illiterate , careless , procrastinating , happygo-lucky , slavish , superstitious ; the finished material is excellent , hardy , stubborn , self-sacrificing , and ready to die , one of his proverbs being " Life is a farthing . " He is a child of nature , easily satisfied , but also subject to fits of passion . " A great fault of the Russian army is its poorly managed Commissariat . . . So long as the Russian Government persists in the questionable practice of paying its officials and public servants about half the wages due to them this evil will never be eradicated . " On the prospects of the war Mr. Steveni says , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . provided that her officers and generals are on a line with her brave and hardy soldiers , and that the alien races subject to her sway remain loyal . " " The German Army from Within , " by " a British Officer who has served in it " is a  | moderately interesting account of personal experiences . It is unsympathetic and far from flattering to the German army . Says the anonymous author : " I speak with knowledge of both English and German soldiers ? privates , non-coms. , and officers of rank ? and I am firmly convinced that one British Tommy is the equal of three.Germans of the same rank " ; and , elsewhere , " The artillery , too , is much given to stale technicalities , circus tricks , and so on , and to adherence to conservative notions of artillery operations . " However , these are merely opinions . What value this book has lies in its narrative of army life in Germany . " The Secrets of the German War Office " by the pseudonymous Dr. Graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . It purports to be the experiences of a German secret agent , and the circumstantial story and the obvious knowledge of the countries visited as well as the specific facts mentioned , make it seem a true narrative . Chapters have been printed in magazines , which seem to take the story for what it pretends to be . Still , as someone has remarked , the author is either a faker or a traitor . Certain it is that the story of the secret agent 's betrayal by his own country and his consequent defection to England is a bit thin . An acquaintance who claims to have been in the German secret service for some years declares the book to be a fake , though he admits that its author knows some of the practices of the German Intelligence Office . Whether the book is history or romance it is fascinating reading and it is no wonder that the first edition was exhausted in two days and the second in two weeks . Two books by the oft-mentioned General von Bernhardi are at hand . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German original published in 1911 . It is a technical work which discusses the problems of modern warfare and proposes certain changes in the methods now in use in Germany . General von Bernhardi is an excavalry officer with wide experience and knowledge of military history . In this work he seeks to discover " not only the nature of war of today in theory , but also to develop from this cognition a superior principle of action , . . . " " It seemed to me possible and useful to con. duct war from the outset in accordance with distinct principles recognized a priori , and to master spiritually the powerful forces bound to be let loose in it , instead of leaving them to their innate impulses , in opposition to the Italian general who insists that in a war of the future only the original direction given to the masses can be intended , but that afterwards the stream will , so to say , move on automatically . ' . We Germans shall in the next war be obliged to fight against enemies far superior in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numerical one . ' " The book which has made General von Bernhardi famous , is " Germany and the Next War , " first published in 1912 . The vogue of this book in the present crisis , which is the " next war " the author had in mind , is indicated by the many editions appearing . The sudden demand of the reading public for this book may be explained in the words of Mr. Bryce . General von Bernhardi 's doctrines , based on Treitschke 's , he says , " would have deserved little notice , much less refutation , but for one deplorable fact , that action has been taken by the government of a great nation . . . which is consonant with them and seems to imply a belief in their soundness . " General von Bernhardi has accordingly come to be regarded as the spokesman of the partly imagined and at best undefined Pan-Germanism , made so well-known in English-speaking countries by Mr. Roland Usher 's clever book . Two chapters of Bernhardi are , at the present juncture , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Next War , " the other on " The Next Naval War . " We shall attempt a resume of these , giving the author 's words where possible . " England , France and Russia have a common interest in breaking down our power . This interest will sooner or later be asserted by arms . " For a continental European war , General von Bernhardi thinks , the British Territorial army may be left out of account as " its military value can not be ranked very highly . " Germany will have to deal only with the British regular army : " It is very questionable whether the English army is capable of effectively acting on the offensive against Continental European troops . In South Africa the English regiments for the most part fought very bravely and stood great losses ; on the other hand , they completely failed in the offensive , in tactics as in operations , and with few exceptions the generalship was equally deficient . The last manceuvers on a large scale held in Ireland , under the direction of General French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English army in a favorable light so far as strategical ability went . " The tactical value of the French troops is , of course , very high ; numerically the army of our neighbour on the west is almost equal , and in some directions there may be a superiority in organization and equipment ; in other directions we have a distinct advantage . The French army lacks the subordination under a single commander , the united spirit which characterizes the German army ,  | the tenacious strength of the German race , and the esprit de corps of the officers . France , too , has not those national reserves available which would allow us almost to double our forces . " In Russia " hatred of Germany is as persistent as ever , " and public opinion would favor a war in the west . So far as Russian troops go they fight with great stubbornness . But in the Japanese war the " Russian army quite failed on the offensive , in a certain sense tactically , but essentially owing to inadequacy of the commanders and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presumed that the spirit of Russian generalship has completely changed since the defeats in Manchuria . . . . This army must therefore always be met with a bold policy of attack . " General von Bernhardi expects the revolutionary elements in Russia ( and also Japan and China in the East ) to operate as restraining forces against Russia in the next European war ? one of the few instances in which he conspicuously misjudged what has happened . General von Bernhardi proceeds to consider what forces Germany can count on against England , France , and Russia . He does not regard the Triple Alliance as solid : " We are not even sure of their diplomatic help , as the conduct of Italy at the conference of Algeciras sufficiently demonstrated . It even seems questionable at the present moment whether we can always reckon on the support of the members of the Triple Alliance in a defensive war . . . . If we consider how difficult Italy would find it to make her forces fit to cope with France , and to protect her coasts against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tripoli has created a new possession , which is not easily defended against France and England , we may fairly doubt whether Italy would take part in a war in which England and France were allied against us . " Austria is undoubtedly a loyal ally . . . . Nevertheless , there is cause for anxiety , because in a conglomerate State like Austria , which contains numerous Slavonic elements , patriotism may not be strong enough to allow the Government to fight to the death with Russia , were the latter to defeat us . The occurrence of such an event is not improbable . When enumerating the possibilities that might affect our policy , we can not leave this one out of consideration . " We shall therefore some day , perhaps , be faced with the necessity of standing isolated in a great war of the nations , as once Frederick the Great stood , when he was basely deserted by England in the middle of the struggle , and shall have to trust to our own strength and our own resolution for victory . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nation ? must be a war for our political and national existence . This must be so , for our opponents can only attain their political aims by almost annihilating us by land and by sea . If the victory is only half won , they would have to expect continuous renewals of the contest , which would be contrary to their interests . They know that well enough , and therefore avoid the contest , since we shall certainly defend ourselves with the utmost bitterness and obstinacy . If , notwithstanding , circumstances make the war inevitable then the intention of our enemies to crush us to the ground , and our own resolve to maintain our position victoriously , will make it a war of desperation . " We must therefore prepare not only for a short war , but for a protracted campaign . We must be armed in order to complete the overthrow of our enemies , should the victory be ours ; and , if worsted , to continue to defend ourselves in the very heart of our country until success at last is won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her forces on winning herself a position , and on keeping that position , can not be conquered . " General von Bernhardi 's forecast of the probable campaigns of Germany 's " next war " ( and particularly what he has to say about Belgium 's place in them ) has contributed more than anything else to give his book its wide notoriety : " If the war . . . be waged against us by France in combination with England , it may be assumed that the allied Great Powers would attempt to turn our strategical right flank through Belgium and Holland , and penetrate into the heart of Germany through the great gap in the fortresses between Wesel and Flushing . This operation would have the considerable advantage of avoiding the strong line of the Rhine and threatening our naval bases from the land side . " The main issue for England is to annihilate our navy and oversea commerce , in order to prevent , from reasons already explained , any further expansion of our power . But it is not her interest to destroy our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attain the supremacy in Europe . " England 's participation in the land war will show desperate energy " only so far as it pursues the object of conquering our naval bases . " " Our western frontier , " General von Bernhardi continues , " in itself strong , can be easily turned on the north through Belgium and Holland . No natural obstacle , no strong fortress , is there to oppose a hostile invasion , and neutrality is only a paper bulwark . " In the naval actions of the " next war " Ger-many " will be thrown on her own resources and will have to protect herself singlehanded against superior forces which will certainly press her hard . ... As regards materiel and training , it may be assumed that our fleet is distinctly superior to the French and Russian , but that England is our equal in that respect . Our ships ' cannons will probably show a superiority over the English , and our torpedo fleet , by its reckless energy , excellent training , and daring spirit of adventure , will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen whether these advantages will have much weight against the overwhelming superiority of an experienced and celebrated fleet like the English . " English commerce must be attacked : " The prizes which fall into our hands must be remorselessly destroyed since it will usually be impossible , owing to the great English superiority and the few bases we have abroad , to bring them back in safety without exposing our vessels to great risks . The sharpest measures must be taken against neutral ships laden with contraband . Nevertheless , no very valuable results can be expected from a war aganst England 's trade . " Under these circumstances , nothing would be left for us but to retire with our war-fleet under the guns of the coast fortifications , and by the use of mines to protect our own shores and make them dangerous to English vessels . " " It would be necessary to take further steps to secure the importation from abroad of supplies necessary to us , since our own communications will be completely cut off by the English . The simplest and cheapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps neutral Belgium .... " General von Bernhardi is certain that Germany " must lose no time in preparing a road on which we can import the most essential foodstuffs and raw materials , and also export , if only in small quantities , the surplus of our industrial products . " But without the aid of land forces to attack German naval bases from the rear , the allies , in his opinion , " could not obtain a decisive result . " The prospect of any successful issue for Germany in naval warfare against the combined French and English fleet " shrinks into the background " : " But we need not even then despair . On the contrary , we must fight the French fleet , so to speak , on land ? i. e. , we must defeat France so decisively that she would be compelled to renounce her alliance with England and withdraw her fleet to save herself ? from total destruction . Just as in 1870-71 we marched to the shores of the Atlantic , so this time again we must resolve on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports and destroy the French naval depots . It would be a war to the knife with France , one which would , if victorious , annihilate once for all the French position as a Great Power . If France , with her falling birth-rate , determines on such a war , it is at the risk of losing her place in the first rank of European nations , and sinking into permanent political subservience . Those are the stakes . " A valuable commentary on General von Bernhardi 's book is " Germany and England , " by the late Professor Cramb , of Queen 's College , London . This book , which was reviewed in THE M AL of October 16 , is an attempt to interpret to Englishmen what Cramb considered the newer spirit of Germany . As exponents of this German spirit he uses General von Bernhardi and men of his school , such as Treitschke and Delbriick . If General von Berhardi really represents a considerable influence in German thinking , and what Cramb wrote had any real influence in England , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither book poured oil on troubled waters .  |
