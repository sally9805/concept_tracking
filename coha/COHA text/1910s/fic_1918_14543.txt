When the curtain is well up , MRS . RIGLEY , the minister 's wife , a very nice , refined-looking woman of probably thirty , dressed in a one-piece dress of navy blue silk , relieved with collar and cuffs of white silk , and wearing her hair very plainly , hurries in through the door at the left and comes forward to the window , where , drawing aside the portire with which the window is hung , she looks out anxiously . At this point , there is a sudden burst of laughter out at the right , which causes her to turn and hurry across to the archway leading to the hall . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( out at the front door ) . Well , you know , " He who loves the danger shall perish in it ! " ( This quotation causes another outburst from the two ladies at the front door ) . If you 'll excuse me  --  ( MRS . RIGLEY glances out into the hallway ; then , taking a folded telegram from the bosom of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and commences to read it rather excitedly . ) MRS . ZOOKER ( out at the front door ) . We know what you went through last November ! THE OTHER WOMAN ( at the front door , and speaking simultaneously ) . Do n't mention it , Doctor ! Not at all , I 'm sure . p. 3 REVEREND LORING RIGLEY It 's too much for me ! MRS . ZOOKER I 'll be right in , Reverend . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY You 'd better , Mrs. Zooker ! you know , " The good die young " ! ( The ladies are again convulsed by the Doctor 's brilliancy . ) MRS . ZOOKER Oh , ai n't he terrible ! ( The outer door is heard to close ; and , immediately , Mr. Rigley comes laughing into the hallway and hangs his hat upon the hall-tree . ) MARY ( advancing and taking the rather large , flat black book which he extends to her ) . Is that Mrs. Zooker out there ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( removing his overcoat ) . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the book over to the little table at the left of the mantelpiece ) . Are they coming in ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Mrs. Zooker is , immediately , yes ; she has one of my lists . ( Hangs his overcoat on the hall-tree . ) MARY Well , you have n't been standing out there in the cold , have you ? p. 4 REVEREND LORING RIGLEY I should say I have n't ! MARY ( coming back towards the hall door ) . Well , listen , Loring ! REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( coming in through the hall door , rubbing his hands ) . It 's gotten fearfully cold ! ( MR . RIGLEY is a baldheaded blond , with a slightly pedantic manner of speech , and a dignity , at all times , far in excess of even the dignity of his calling . He is a trifle stout for his forty years , although the clerical garb is not unbecoming to him . He wears black , heavy-rimmed nose-glasses with a black tape over his right ear . ) MARY ( handing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago ; and I 've been terribly anxious till you 'd get here . ( She touches an electric button at the right of the mantelpiece , and the room becomes illuminated  --  by means of the floor lamp over at the left . Then she starts across the room towards the window . ) REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Is it for me ? MARY No , it 's for me . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Bad news ? MARY No , it 's from my brother Joe ! p. 5 REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( reading the telegram ) . Eugene What ? MARY ( coming back to him ) . Eugene Tesh . He 's that boy you 've heard me speak of that used to go to school with my brother Joe and me  --  back in Baltimore ; we used to live next door to each other when we were children . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY What 's this ,  --  " plays Youngstown the twenty-ninth " ? MARY Yes , that 's to-night ; that 's the reason I 've been so anxious till you 'd get here . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a finger of her left hand ) . You see it says , " played Newark two weeks ago . " ( To RIGLEY ) . And Joe must have seen him ; because it says , ( Indicating the telegram again ) . " Asked about you  --  told him you were living in Youngstown  --  gave him your address  --  he is going to walk in on you when he plays Youngstown the twenty-seventh  --  thought I 'd better tip you off . " ( She straightens up and looks at RIGLEY ) . And , you see , to-day is the twenty-seventh ! REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( with a puzzled expression ) . What does it mean ,  --  he " plays Youngstown " ? p. 6 MARY He 's on the stage ! ( RIGLEY turns and looks at her as though she had just told him that she had decided to go on the stage herself ) . He went on the stage shortly after he left school ; it must be fifteen years ago . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY You mean that he is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me speak of Eugene Tesh ! REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( handing her back the telegram with a touch of state , as he passes in front of her and proceeds towards the little table at the left of the mantelpiece ) . I ca n't say that I have . MARY Well , his name is always in the newspapers ; he 's a dramatic star . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( picking up the black book and opening it , with a suggestion of ceremony ) . I am not familiar with the names of dramatic stars . MARY I thought perhaps you might have seen his name on one of the theatrical bill-boards . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY I never look at theatrical bill-boards . MARY ( coming a little forward at the right of the center table ) . I suppose Joe thought he 'd better send me this wire so that I 'd be sure and be in , in case Mr. Tesh comes . p. 7 REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( closing the book , with a rather uninvolved expression ) . Well , you can be in if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she meets the look ; then he starts for the door at the left . ) MARY ( taking a step or two towards him ) . Well , you 'll see him if he comes , wo n't you , Loring ? ( He stops and turns to her , then comes back a step or two . ) REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Is n't that rather a strange question to ask me ? MARY Why so ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY You understand the opposition of our church to the theater ? MARY But , this is n't the theater , Loring ! REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Your friend is of it , is n't he ? MARY Yes , of course . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Very well , then . Besides , I think I have sufficiently emphasized my personal opposition to the theater ; the life of the stage is not compatible with the life of a Christian , and I see nothing to be gained by association with its people . MARY Well , what can I do ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY You can do nothing very well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have any of the members know that we were entertaining stage folk . p. 8 MARY They need n't know anything about it . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY How could you prevent it , if he should walk in while Mrs. Zooker is here . ( He looks at his watch ) . What time is he coming ? MARY It does n't say in this wire . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY It 's eight minutes past five now . MARY ( glancing at the clock on the mantelpiece ) . Well , if he has to play to-night , I do n't see how he 's going to come out here , unless he comes before dinner . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( replacing his watch , and starting for the door at the left ) . Tell Mrs. Zooker to bring her list right into the study . ( He reaches the door and stops ) . And-a- ( He turns to MARY ) . If it should be necessary to introduce your friend to her , I should suggest that you refer to him as an acquaintance , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gone . ( MARY looks at him steadily ; he turns and starts through the door ) . You 'd better put something around your shoulders  --  this room is n't any too warm . ( MARY stands for a second irresolute ; then , suddenly , starts to follow him ; but the voice of MRS . ZOOKER in the hallway  --  at the right  --  arrests her ; so she replaces the telegram in the bosom of her dress and stands looking at the hall door. ) p. 9 MRS . ZOOKER ( in the hallway ) . If you 'll wait there for a second I 'll call her . ( Appearing at the door leading into the hallway ) . Why , there 's a gentleman here to see you , Mrs. Rigley . MARY Oh , is there , Mrs. Zooker ? MRS . ZOOKER ( sidling in , and standing a little to the right of the door ) . Yes , he 's right out here at the door . MARY ( glancing in the mirror over the mantelpiece , and touching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rigley said to go right into the study . MRS . ZOOKER ( starting across towards the door at the left ) . Oh , all right , I will . MARY ( going out through the hall door ) . Are n't you frozen ? MRS . ZOOKER No , I do n't seem to mind the cold very much . MARY You 're lucky ! ( Speaking to TESH at the front door ) . Is this Eugene Tesh ? ( MRS . ZOOKER , who is just leaving the room through the door at the left , pauses , and tiptoes back to the left of the mantelpiece ; from which point she endeavors , by dint of divers peerings and strainings , to see what is going on at the front door . She 's a poor old thing , this MRS . ZOOKER , with a wizened little face and no teeth ; and a get-up generally that is redolent of rummage sales and vanished vogues . She wears a skimpy coat of faded black  --  three-quarter length  --  and a heavy gray skirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Her hat is black  --  a little toque , rather rusty , and trimmed with a dab of withered violets , from whose center looms the remnant of a saffron-colored ostrich tip . She has a very ratty muff , of nameless fur , depending on a soiled and knotted cord ; and , around her neck , she wears a stringy scarf , one end of which is thrown back over her shoulder. ) p. 10 EUGENE TESH ( at the front door ) . Then , you have been expecting me ? MARY Only for the past fifteen minutes . I 'm so glad to see you again , Gene ! EUGENE TESH And I am certainly delighted to see you too , Mary ! MARY You certainly have grown up ! ( At the approach of the voices , MRS . ZOOKER scurries through the door at the left . ) EUGENE TESH So have you ! MARY ( laughing , and appearing at the hall door ; hanging TESH 's hat on the hall-tree ) . Have I ? EUGENE TESH Rather ! ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ) . Come right in , Gene . ( After taking a few steps forward and to the left , she stops , and faces the hall door . TESH appears ; and takes the room in at a glance ) . I suppose we 've been thinking of each other as we were at school . EUGENE TESH Yes . ( He starts down towards the center table . He is a dramatic star , of considerable reputation , with a personality possessing that quality which has been defined as stellar . He is tall and thin ,  --  has a lot of soft-looking black hair and is rather austerely pale ; although this latter characteristic is somewhat nullified by a certain charm of manner , and the suggestion of a twinkle in his eye . He wears a long , beautifully tailored coat of excellent black , with a high , rolling collar ; and , under it , a perfectly cut , double-breasted sack suit of the same material . He is quietly gloved and spatted ; wears a gorgeous shawl scarf of steel-blue silk around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver. ) p. 11 MARY I had this wire from Joe only fifteen minutes ago , saying that you were to play here to-night ; otherwise I do n't suppose I should ever have known that you were in town at all . EUGENE TESH ( standing just above the center table ) . I had intended to walk in on you and surprise you . MARY Well , you certainly have ! EUGENE TESH ( removing his gloves and tossing them on the table ) . But Joe has given it away . ( He leans over to look at a small framed photograph on the table . ) MARY ( standing to the left of the center table ) . Well , I suppose he only did that to make sure that I 'd be in , so that you would n't have your trip out here for nothing . Wo n't you take off your things , Gene ? EUGENE TESH ( lifting his cane from his left arm ) . I 'll take off my cane . MARY ( laughing a little , and indicating the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Put it there . EUGENE TESH ( holding the cane toward her ) . You see I carry a cane now . p. 12 MARY So I see . Is that the sign of age ? EUGENE TESH ( turning to her , after having hung the cane on the back of the armchair ) . Sign of an actor . You seem to be very nicely fixed here , Mary . MARY Yes , we 're comfortable . EUGENE TESH Joe tells me you married a minister . MARY Yes ; Doctor Rigley . EUGENE TESH How do you like him ? ( Checking himself ) . I mean , do you get along well with him ? MARY Yes ; very well . EUGENE TESH You do ? MARY Yes . EUGENE TESH ( commencing to remove his coat ) . I 've never been in a minister 's house before . MARY Have n't you ? EUGENE TESH No ; it 's quite like other people 's houses , is n't it ? MARY You 're quite like other people , Gene . ( He laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 'd seen the way that old woman stared at me out at the door . ( He folds his coat over the back of the armchair. ) p. 13 MARY Who , Mrs. Zooker ? EUGENE TESH ( removing his scarf ) . The old woman that let me in . MARY Yes , that 's Mrs. Zooker . EUGENE TESH Does she work here ? MARY ( coming forward to the chair at the left of the center table ) . No , she just helps my husband with the church work . Sit down , Gene . EUGENE TESH ( placing the scarf across the back of the chair , and moving around to the front of the chair ) . I ca n't stay a moment , Mary ; my train was two hours late . MARY ( sitting at the left of the table ) . Did you just get into town ? EUGENE TESH ( sitting at the right of the table ) . Ten minutes ago ; I came out here in a taxi . MARY Well , you can sit down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel yet . MARY ( resting her elbows on the table ) . And , what have you been doing all these years , Gene ? EUGENE TESH ( picking up the little framed photograph from the table ) . Acting , all over the place . Is this your husband 's picture ? p. 14 MARY No , that 's Abraham Lincoln . EUGENE TESH ( setting down the picture , and picking up a little black book ) . And , what sort of a man is your husband , Mary ? MARY Oh , like most ministers , I suppose . EUGENE TESH But , I do n't know any ministers . What book is this ? MARY That 's our church manual . EUGENE TESH Very interesting , I suppose ? MARY If you 're a good church member . EUGENE TESH ( putting it down on the table , as he rises ) . I 'll have to get a copy . ( MARY laughs a little , and rises also . ) MARY I suppose you never go to church , do you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were approaching a window ) . No , but I have a very intimate friend who has been there . Is this your church out here ? MARY Yes ; do n't you think it 's pretty ? EUGENE TESH ( nodding his head slowly ) . Hum-hum . I should say romantic . MARY Rather ; we had three weddings in it last month . p. 15 EUGENE TESH ( casually ) . It is n't so innocent as it looks , is it ? MARY Are you married , Gene ? EUGENE TESH ( turning to her suddenly ) . What ? MARY I say , are you married ? EUGENE TESH Why , not this season . ( He resumes his observation of the church . ) MARY ( turning away from him , laughing ) . You 're perfectly dreadful , Gene ! ( Turning back to him ) . Are n't you really married , Gene ? EUGENE TESH No , really , I 'm not , Mary . MARY Why , I thought you 'd have been married years ago . EUGENE TESH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the window at the left ) . I should n't care for it . MARY ( crossing over back of the center table , and moving down to the right of it ) . Well , how do you know whether you would or not ? EUGENE TESH I have played husbands so often that I am quite disillusioned . MARY Are you playing the part of a husband in this piece you 're doing now ? p. 16 EUGENE TESH Yes ; he 's one of those very good husbands ; I 'll be glad when the season is over . ( Coming away from the window ) . By the way , Mary ,  --  where is your husband ? MARY In his study , I believe . EUGENE TESH Does he know I 'm here ? MARY I have n't told him . EUGENE TESH Going to ? MARY ( rather embarrassed , and smiling ) . Not necessarily , Gene . ( He stops , inclines his head and raises his eye-brows comprehendingly . ) EUGENE TESH Is he opposed to the theater ? MARY Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TESH Oh , really ? Are you ? MARY Indeed , I 'm not ! ( TESH laughs ) . I 'm crazy about the theater , and always have been . EUGENE TESH Well , do you go ? MARY I ca n't very well ; he 's so dreadfully opposed , personally . EUGENE TESH ( glancing over his shoulder towards the door at the left ) . I suppose it 's a lucky thing Mrs. Zooker did n't know that I was an actor a while ago , or she would n't have let me in at all . p. 17 MARY I guess not . But , really , Gene , I have n't been to see a play since I 've been married ; and that 's nearly seven years ago . EUGENE TESH ( sitting on the edge of the table ) . Oh , dear me ! MARY Can you imagine that ! EUGENE TESH No . MARY And you were playing in New York three years ago , while we were there  --  EUGENE TESH Is that so ? MARY Yes ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you ; but I simply could n't manage it ; and it nearly broke my heart , because I 've always been dying to see you on the stage . EUGENE TESH Well , we must try and manage it to-night , Mary . MARY I do n't think we 'll succeed . ( TESH thinks keenly for a second , then glances towards the door at the left . ) EUGENE TESH Has your husband ever been on the stage ? MARY Heavens , no ! EUGENE TESH You should have told him that he ought to have been ; it invariably removes any prejudices . MARY ( very much amused ) . I 'm afraid he 'd shoot me , Gene ! p. 18 EUGENE TESH Hah ! Not the slightest danger , my dear girl ; that is the flattering word ; the one compliment that has never failed . Tell any man , woman or child that he should be on the stage ,  --  and you 'll find him quite as susceptible as a cat is to catnip . MARY Why is that , Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time or other in his life , experienced the desire to be on the stage . Of course , he may not admit it ; but he has , just the same ; and if he has n't , all you 've got to do is tell him he should be on the stage , and he will experience it . ( She laughs ) . I tell you , Mary , that is the universal susceptibility . And very naturally so ; the most fundamental instinct of human life is to express oneself ; and the stage is perhaps the most complete form of self-expression ; so that  --  when a person is stage-struck  --  he is simply struck with the desire to express himself more completely . If I were to tell Mrs. Zooker  --  or your husband  --  or anybody  --  from the minister to the mechanic  --  that he should be on the stage  --  why  --  the first thing you know he 'd start inquiring about the fare to New York . MARY ( laughing a little , and going up to the mantelpiece ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Zooker that they should have been on the stage while I 'm in the room . p. 19 EUGENE TESH Why not ? MARY ( coming down at his left , carrying a little old-fashioned photograph in a black frame , which she has taken from the mantelpiece ) . Because I 'd never be able to keep my face straight . ( TESH laughs ) . Here 's a little picture of my husband ; it 's ages old , but it is n't a bad picture . He had it taken in Boston I think , a long time ago . EUGENE TESH Does he look like this ? MRS . ZOOKER ( sidling through the door at the left ) . You 'll have to excuse me for bothering you , Mrs. Rigley  --  ( MRS . RIGLEY turns , and TESH rises . ) MARY Oh , are you going , Mrs. Zooker ? MRS . ZOOKER ( crossing towards the door leading into the hallway ) . Yes , I 've got to run along ; it 's after five . I told Mr. Rigley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go over that other list . ( She has reached the hall door , and TESH has moved slowly towards the left . ) MARY Oh , Mrs. Zooker ! ( MRS . ZOOKER turns ) . I want you to meet Mr. Tesh . ( TESH turns . MRS . ZOOKER melts and shrinks , as MARY puts her arm around her waist and leads her slowly down to the right of the center table , talking as she comes ) . This is a boy that I went to school with in Baltimore , nearly fifteen years ago . p. 20 MRS . ZOOKER Oh , is that a fact , Mrs. Rigley ! MARY And we have n't seen each other since . Mrs. Zooker , Gene . EUGENE TESH ( advancing very graciously , and crossing to the right in front of the center table ) . How do you do , Mrs. Zooker ? MRS . ZOOKER I 'm pleased to meet you , I 'm sure . EUGENE TESH Thank you . MRS . ZOOKER ( looking straight ahead ) . You 're welcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his left shoulder in the direction of MARY , who has gradually come down on the left of the center table , and is arranging the photograph of Abraham Lincoln , he turns back to MRS . ZOOKER . ) EUGENE TESH What company are you here with , Mrs. Zooker ? ( MARY looks up suddenly . ) MRS . ZOOKER Sir ? EUGENE TESH I say , what company are you playing here with ? MARY ( laying her hand on TESH 'S arm ) . Gene , Mrs. Zooker is n't on the stage ! EUGENE TESH Beg pardon ? p. 21 MARY I say , Mrs. Zooker is n't on the stage . EUGENE TESH ( turning back to MRS . ZOOKER in polite surprise ) . Oh , is n't she ? MARY No . EUGENE TESH ( turning slowly to MARY ) . Why , I thought I understood you to say that Mrs. Zooker was in the profession ? MARY No , I did n't , Gene . EUGENE TESH ( turning back to MRS . ZOOKER , rather amused ) . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( He laughs faintly ; and MRS . ZOOKER , not knowing what else to do , laughs a little too ; then TESH turns back to MARY ) . I was quite sure you said that Mrs. Zooker was in the profession . ( But MARY has slipped across back of him towards MRS . ZOOKER . ) MRS . ZOOKER What 's he sayin ' ? MARY ( placing her hand on MRS . ZOOKER 'S arm ) . Mr. Tesh thought you were an actress , dear . MRS . ZOOKER Who , me ? MARY Yes . MRS . ZOOKER ( turning suddenly away from MARY , to the right ) . Good night ! ( She breaks into a cackling , self-conscious laugh , and goes up to the hall door ; and MARY crosses down to the extreme right . MRS . ZOOKER turns at the hall door and speaks directly to MARY ) . I 'll have to tell our Lena that ! p. 22 MARY Yes , you must . MRS . ZOOKER ( coming slowly forward again at the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what there is about me that 'd make anybody think that ! ( She laughs again ) . Oh , dear !  --  What made you think it , Mr. Tesh ? EUGENE TESH What did you say , Mrs. Zooker ? MRS . ZOOKER I say ,  --  what made you think I was an actress ? EUGENE TESH Well , I do n't know that I could say exactly , Mrs. Zooker , but ,  --  well , you gave me that impression . MRS . ZOOKER Is that a fact ? EUGENE TESH Yes . MRS . ZOOKER ( turning to MARY ) . What do you think of that ! ( She laughs again ; then settles her muff ) . I guess it must have been my voice . EUGENE TESH It may have been . MRS . ZOOKER Because I know when I was growing up ,  --  people always used to say that I had quite a voice . EUGENE TESH Well , you have appeared publicly , have n't you ? MRS . ZOOKER ( becoming a bit serious ) . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was married I used to go on quite a bit  --  p. 23 EUGENE TESH ( raising his finger ) . Ah ! MRS . ZOOKER At the little affairs we used to have at the Sunday school . EUGENE TESH You recited , did n't you ? MRS . ZOOKER Yes . EUGENE TESH Dramatic recitations ? MRS . ZOOKER Very dramatic . EUGENE TESH I should imagine you would do those best . MRS . ZOOKER Is that so ? EUGENE TESH Yes ,  --  there is a distinctly dramatic quality in your voice , Mrs. Zooker . MRS . ZOOKER Is that a fact ? EUGENE TESH Distinctly . MRS . ZOOKER ( turning to MARY and breaking into a laugh ) . Now , what do you think of that ! ( Turning back to TESH ) . Well , now , that 's a funny thing , because since I 've been married , I 've kinda give it up . EUGENE TESH Ah , do n't you think that was a mistake , Mrs. Zooker ? MRS . ZOOKER Well , yes , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my husband has always carried on so , whenever I 've went on . p. 24 EUGENE TESH I see , I see . MRS . ZOOKER Of course , he has no talent of any kind his-self , so I do n't suppose he can understand how anybody else can have any . ( She nods rather vigorously at the conclusion of this remark , and TESH joins her in the nodding . ) EUGENE TESH Yes , that 's the way it goes , Mrs. Zooker . MRS . ZOOKER But , do you know , it 's a funny thing , Mr. Tesh !  --  It just seems like the Irony of Fate  --  I have a daughter  --  EUGENE TESH Ah , yes ? MRS . ZOOKER ( turning to MARY ) . Our Lena  --  ( MARY smiles and nods ) . Mrs. Rigley here has heard her  --  she 'll be fifteen the twenty-first day of this coming May ; and , do you know , she just seems to have took that from me . EUGENE TESH You mean , her talent ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , last Thanksgiving Eve  --  ( Checking herself ) . No , I 'm telling a lie ; it was New Year 's Eve . EUGENE TESH I was going to say  --  MRS . ZOOKER We were having a little entertainment down at the Guild ; and she done that piece of Longfellow 's , called , " Ring the Bells "  --  p. 25 EUGENE TESH Ah , yes , yes ! MRS . ZOOKER And , do you know , she was just wonderful , really ! And as I sat there watchin ' her , goin ' through her gestures , and takin ' her part off so good ,  --  I just began to realize what a fool I 'd been to give it all up . ( TESH appreciates her tragedy , with a slow , serious nod ) . And I made up my mind , then and there ( turning to MARY ) that if our Lena 's cut out for the stage ,  --  I 'll never raise my voice to keep her from it ! EUGENE TESH You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZOOKER Never ! She can go to the heights , ( with a dramatic gesture ) and I 'll never stand in her way ! ( The clock strikes five-thirty . ) EUGENE TESH You 're a very sensible woman . MRS . ZOOKER ( turning abruptly to MARY ) . Well , I 've got to run along  --  it 's half-past five ! ( She starts for the hall door , then remembers and steps back to TESH ) . Well , I 'm awful glad to have met you , Mr. Tesh , I 'm sure . EUGENE TESH ( taking her hand ) . Thank you , Mrs. Zooker ; I 'm sure I 'm very pleased to have met you , too . p. 26 MRS . ZOOKER ( holding his hand ) . I 'm goin ' to ast you an awful personal question , if it would n't be makin ' too free ? EUGENE TESH ( smiling ) . Not at all , what is it ? MRS . ZOOKER Ai n't you an actor ? EUGENE TESH Yes . MRS . ZOOKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that funny ! I never set eyes on Mr. Tesh before in all my life ; and yet , the minute I seen you at the door , I knowed you was an actor ! EUGENE TESH ( amused ) . Well , you know the old saying , Mrs. Zooker , " The eagle knows the eagle . " MRS . ZOOKER ( breaking into a laugh ) . Well , I guess there 's somethin ' in that , too ! EUGENE TESH Indeed , I guess there is . ( He turns away slightly to hide his amusement ) . Yes , indeed . MRS . ZOOKER My husband has been an eagle for twelve years . ( TESH moves to the window at the left ) . Well , I 've got to skip along . ( She goes up to the hall door and turns again MARY has crossed back of her to the mantelpiece ) . Do you show here to-night , Mr. Tesh ? p. 27 EUGENE TESH ( turning from the window ) . Yes . MRS . ZOOKER How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , and the rest of them . MRS . ZOOKER Well , of course , we do n't think there 's no place in the world like Youngstown . EUGENE TESH I 've never seen anything just like it . MRS . ZOOKER I 'm sorry Mr. Tesh could n't have met our Lena . MARY Yes , it 's too bad . EUGENE TESH Is she the one who recites ? MRS . ZOOKER Yes ; she 's not home this afternoon , or I 'd have her come over , and do one or two of her little pieces for you . EUGENE TESH That 'd be lovely . MRS . ZOOKER She went to that lecture at the Guild . MARY Oh , did she ? MRS . ZOOKER Yes ; and I 'm kinda anxious till she gets home to hear how it was . Good-by , Mr. Tesh . EUGENE TESH Good-by , Mrs. Zooker . MRS . ZOOKER I guess my husband 'll think I 've eloped . ( She laughs , and they join her , out of courtesy ; then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall door , and stands looking into the hallway after her ,  --  and TESH takes a walk down around the settee and up again to the left-hand corner of the mantelpiece ) . Now , do n't come out here in this cold hallway with me ! p. 28 MARY I wo n't . MRS . ZOOKER That 's the way people gets their death . I 'll let myself out . MARY All right , Mrs. Zooker . ( The outer door is heard to close . MARY turns and looks at TESH , then goes down to the right of the center table , laughing ) . You 're perfectly terrible , Gene ! EUGENE TESH ( suddenly , and starting down at the left of the table towards her ) . Listen ! You do n't think there 's any danger of her bringing her daughter over here , do you ? MARY I do n't think she 's home . EUGENE TESH You know , I 've heard a few child wonders in my time . ( RIGLEY appears at the left door . ) MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up towards the mantelpiece ) . What is it , Loring ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Has Mrs. Zooker gone ? MARY Yes , this minute ; did you want to see her ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( crossing in front of her to the hall door ) . I did , yes ; but it 's unimportant ; she 'll be over again this evening . p. 29 MARY Yes , she said she would . ( MR . RIGLEY glances out into the hallway , then turns and recrosses the room , giving TESH a penetrating and disapproving look as he goes . TESH , however , is occupied with an examination of the little photograph , which he still holds in his hands . Just as RIGLEY reaches the door at the left , MARY calls him ) . Oh , Loring ! ( He stops , and turns to her ) . I want you to meet Mr. Tesh . ( TESH turns quietly and rests his fingers on the center table ) . This is the Eugene Tesh that you 've possibly heard me speak of  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( turning to TESH and half laughing ) I 'm ashamed to say how many years ago . My husband , Gene . EUGENE TESH ( inclining his head pleasantly ) . How do you do , Mr. Rigley ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY How do you do , sir ? EUGENE TESH I should have known you from your photograph . MARY I 've just been showing Mr. Tesh that old picture you had taken in Boston . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY That 's quite an old picture . EUGENE TESH Taken before you entered the ministry , was n't it , Mr. Rigley ? p. 30 REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( coming forward a little ) . Oh , yes , yes . EUGENE TESH I noticed you were n't wearing the frock . MARY I 've always been trying to persuade him to have some new pictures taken , but he simply wo n't do it . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY That 's quite a good picture . MARY But it 's ages old , Loring ! And , besides , it is n't very ministerial-looking , either . Now , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that picture , I 'd be more likely to think it was the picture of a well-to-do business man than a minister . ( TESH laughs deprecatingly ) . Would n't you , Gene ? EUGENE TESH No , I should hardly say a business man . MARY Well , you 'd never say a minister , would you ? EUGENE TESH No , I do n't think I should . MARY Now , you see that , Loring ! EUGENE TESH ( looking at the picture , with his head a bit to one side ) . I 'm afraid I 'd be more inclined to think it might be the picture of an actor . ( There is a slight pause . MARY turns away smoothly , touching her hair , and moves over towards the right ; and her husband , looking over his glasses at TESH , begins to melt , very visibly . Then he sways towards TESH , breaking into a very orthodox little chuckle. ) p. 31 REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( taking the photograph ) . That 's very funny . EUGENE TESH I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  REVEREND LORING RIGLEY No ,  --  you 're not the first that said that . EUGENE TESH ( glancing at MARY , who has come down to the right of the center table and is standing on a line with him ) . No ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY My photographs invariably give that impression . EUGENE TESH Is that so ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Invariably . EUGENE TESH Then , there must be some truth in it , Mr. Rigley . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( vastly pleased ) . Well , " what everybody says " , you know ! ( He bursts into delighted laughter . ) EUGENE TESH ( laughing with him ) . Indeed , that 's very true ! ( As MR . RIGLEY 'S laughter continues , TESH glances at MARY , and she looks away . ) REVEREND LORING RIGLEY You know , Mr. Tesh , it 's a most extraordinary thing  --  that nine out of ten persons who see this photograph , are of the impression that it is the photograph of a dramatic artist . p. 32 EUGENE TESH Yes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to understand why that should be so . EUGENE TESH Well , frankly , Mr. Rigley , I ca n't see how anybody who would be at all familiar with the dramatic earmarks  --  could come to any other conclusion . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Is that so ? EUGENE TESH Take this line here , for example . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( looking closely ) . You mean  --  EUGENE TESH From the tip of your nose to the top of your upper lip . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Yes , yes , I see what you mean ! EUGENE TESH That line is essentially dramatic . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Is that so ? EUGENE TESH Essentially . Then , of course , the eye is an unfailing indication . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( looking closely at the picture ) . I do n't know that I have ever noticed the eye particularly . Excuse me just a moment , till I get my other glasses ! EUGENE TESH That 's quite all right . p. 33 REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( hurrying to the mantelpiece , removing his nose glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It 's rather difficult to see anything very closely with these . ( TESH glances at MARY significantly . ) EUGENE TESH Mr. Rigley , have you ever seen a photograph of Edwin Booth ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( picking up a pair of enormous , rimmed spectacles from the mantelpiece , and settling them on his nose ) . Edwin Booth , the actor , you mean ? EUGENE TESH Yes . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( coming forward ) . Yes , I believe I have , Mr. Tesh . EUGENE TESH Did n't anything strike you particularly ? REVEREND LORING RIGLEY About Mr. Booth 's picture , you mean ? EUGENE TESH Yes . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Well , really , it 's been so long ago , I would scarcely remember . EUGENE TESH Well , the next time you have an opportunity of seeing a photograph of Mr. Booth , I 'd like you to compare it , right in around the eyes , with your picture here  --  right in here ( he points to a certain spot on the picture , which RIGLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get what I mean . ( He passes in front of RIGLEY and continues over towards the left ; while MARY moves from her position at the right up towards the mantelpiece . MR . RIGLEY , however , remains perfectly still , looking intently at his photograph. ) p. 34 MRS . ZOOKER ( in the hallway out at the right ) . Here we come right in , without ringing ! ( Appearing at the hall door , and speaking back over her shoulder to LENA , who is evidently out at the street door ) . Close that door , dear ! ( To MARY ) . I thought I 'd like to have Lena meet Mr. Tesh ! ( To MR . RIGLEY , who has turned from his contemplation of the photograph and is looking at her rather grandly ) . Excuse me , Doctor . ( RIGLEY inclines his head , a bit condescendingly , and passes over in front of the table to the right , where he resumes his study of the picture ) . Hurry , Lena ! ( Addressing MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her position just to the left of the door ) . I did n't think she 'd be home from the lecture yet , but she sez it was over before five . ( LENA has straggled in during this last speech , and comes forward a few steps , when her eye lights upon TESH ; she stops dead , and looks at him steadily and appraisingly ; and he looks at her in puzzled curiosity . MRS . ZOOKER stands looking from one to the other very affably . Presently , she takes LENA by the arm and addresses herself to TESH ) . This is the girl I was speakin ' to you about  --  our Lena . ( TESH advances a step or two , and MARY passes above him , and goes down to the left of the settee. ) p. 35 EUGENE TESH ( bowing very graciously ) . How do you do , Lena ? LENA ( casually ) . Hello . ( LENA , as her mother has already observed , will be fifteen the twenty-first of this coming May . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit too much bust  --  if one may so say . But then LENA is " perhaps just a bit too much " all over . And no wonder ; for she 's forever eating . Something . Always chewing . One of those little fatties that does n't care where she is or how she looks , so long as there 's refreshments . And it 's very possible that " how she looks " is of less concern to her than " where she is " ; for she 's been wearing the same coat for the last five years . And it 's a very dirty coat too  --  by this time  --  naturally . A gray-green  --  long ago outgrown , and without a button . But LENA does n't mind that . She never gets cold . She just gets red  --  the color of her hat . A little pot hat of rose-colored felt , much too narrow for the width of LENA 'S face , and trimmed with a buckle of pea-green patent leather ; and a brief , frightened-looking little quill in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extremely tight-looking strap of black elastic under the chin . Incidentally , LENA is just about at an age when she can wear her mother 's shoes , and , at present , she appears to be taking advantage of the possibility . Not with the most complete success , however , as the shoes , an old brown pair , with tan-cloth tops , have , owing to the weakness of LENA 'S ankles , turned in and out respectively ; an effect which is scarcely improved by the absence of the tongue of the right shoe and the consequent glimpse of the white stocking between the laces . When the coat is removed , there is revealed a washed-out middy blouse with a bow of broad red ribbon fastened with a ten-cent brooch  --  instead of the customary tie-effect  --  and a wide , black , patent leather belt around her waist . There is also a knee-length skirt of crimson satine , trimmed with two folds of itself near the bottom . Her hair is swept back from her face , rather than combed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red ribbon at the back of her head . The removal of her hat discloses perhaps the only surviving specimen of the old-fashioned circular back comb . And the heavy tan mittens have a past , too. ) p. 36 MRS . ZOOKER ( snatching LENA 'S hat off , and rushing over to put it on the buffet at the right ) . Mr. Tesh is an actor , dear ; and I thought if you 'd just run over one or two of them little pieces that you done New Year 's Eve at the Guild , it might give him an idea of your talent . ( Running back and dragging LENA 'S coat off ) . You remember that piece you done New Year 's Eve , do n't you ? LENA ( disinterestedly ) . I done two pieces New Year 's Eve . MRS . ZOOKER Yes , I know ; but I mean the first one you done ,  --  when they clapped you so ; about ringin ' the bells ? LENA Oh , that was " Ring Out Wild Bells " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's the one I mean . ( Speaking to TESH , as she crosses to place the coat on the armchair in front of the fireplace ) . I do n't think Mr. Tesh has ever heard that , have you , Mr. Tesh ? EUGENE TESH I do n't believe I have , Mrs. Zooker . MRS . ZOOKER ( settling the collar of LENA 'S blouse ) . It 's an awful dramatic thing , but I guess that 's right in your line , ai n't it ? p. 37 EUGENE TESH ( smiling ) . Quite so . MRS . ZOOKER ( guiding LENA to the center of the room ) . Now , stand right there , dear , and do that for Mr. Tesh . LENA I do n't think I remember it any more ! MRS . ZOOKER Well , say what you remember , dear . LENA ( to TESH ) . I ai n't spoke it since New Year 's . MRS . ZOOKER Well , it 'll come to you as you go along ; ( turning to TESH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if you do break down . EUGENE TESH That 's quite all right . MARY Sit here , Gene . ( He sits down on the settee , and MARY remains standing at the left . ) MRS . ZOOKER ( backing away from LENA to the right ) . Now , stand right up straight , dear ; and do n't forget your gestures . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( for TESH 'S benefit ) . Try and get the full , round tone , Lena . ( He glances at TESH , and then looks straight ahead . p. 38 LENA Yes , sir . ( TESH turns and looks at MARY , then waits for LENA to begin . She is busy , however , with the work of taking off her mittens , and , presently , TESH turns to see the cause of the delay . There is an end of lace  --  probably , from her petticoat or pants  --  hanging below the hem of her skirt ; and TESH becomes conscious of it . Immediately LENA comprehends the object of his attention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then TESH turns away , and , looking straight ahead , awaits the ordeal . LENA extends her mittens towards her mother ) . Hold these . ( MRS . ZOOKER advances , takes them , and resumes her place . TESH has turned to see the nature of this last postponement , and again resumes his attitude of resignation . ) MRS . ZOOKER ( as LENA continues to prepare ) . Go on , dear . LENA ( holding the sides of her skirt with both hands , and breaking into a faint , flat voice ) . " Ring out , wild bells , to the wild sky , The flying cloud , the frosty light ; The year is dying in the night ; Ring out , wild bells , and let him die . " MRS . ZOOKER Louder , dear ! ( TESH turns and looks at MRS . ZOOKER ; so does LENA ) . Louder . p. 39 LENA ( turning to resume , and speaking a little louder ) . " Ring out the old , ring in the new  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year is going , let him go ; " ( Here LENA makes a kind of lunging gesture towards TESH , which causes him to start slightly , and move quietly to the other end of the settee ) . " Ring out the false , ring in the true , " ( The telephone bell rings twice . ) MRS . ZOOKER ( as LENA turns to her ) . Go right on , dear . ( To MARY , and starting towards the telephone at the left of the hall door ) . I 'll answer it ! ( Picking up the telephone ) . Go right on , Lena ! LENA I forget where I was now ! MRS . ZOOKER " Ring out the grief that saps the mind , " LENA ( turning to TESH , smiling ) . Oh , sure ! " Ring out the grief that saps the mind , For those that here we see no more ; " MRS . ZOOKER ( into the telephone ) . Mr. Who ? ( TESH turns to MARY , but she is watching MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feud of rich and poor , " MRS . ZOOKER ( into the telephone ) . Magoon ?

ZOOKER , into the telephone ) . Why , there 's nobody here by that name that I know of ! ( TESH is in a still panic . ) LENA " And ancient forms of paltry strife ; " LENA AND MRS . ZOOKER ( speaking at same time ) . ( LENA ) . " Ring in the nobler modes of life , " ( MRS . ZOOKER ) . Well just a minute , and I 'll see ! LENA " With sweeter manners , purer laws . " LENA AND MRS . ZOOKER ( speaking at same time ) . ( LENA ) . " Ring out the care , the want , the sin , " ( MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a woman here lookin ' for a man called Magoon ! p. 41 LENA AND RIGLEY ( speaking at same time ) . ( LENA ) .

ZOOKER ( speaking at same time ) . ( LENA ) . " But ring the fuller minstrel in . " ( MRS . ZOOKER , into the telephone ) . Why , Mr. Rigley sez you must have the wrong number . LENA " Ring out false pride in place of blood , " MRS . ZOOKER ( into the telephone ) . This is Hillcrest , two four . LENA " The civic slander and the spite ; " MRS . ZOOKER ( into the telephone ) . You 're welcome . ( She sets down the telephone . ) LENA " Ring in the love of truth and right , " MRS . ZOOKER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speaking to TESH and MARY as she goes ) . Excuse me. p. 42 LENA " Ring in the common love of good . " ( Here she pauses , and , placing her hand to her mouth , turns and looks at her mother . ) MRS . ZOOKER Ca n't you remember the rest of it , dear ? LENA No , I think that 's all I remember just now ; ( turning to TESH ) it 's been so long since I done it . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( extending his arm magnificently , and breaking into declamation , as he struts across in front of the table towards TESH ) . " Ring out old shapes of foul disease , " RIGLEY AND LENA ( speaking at same time ) . ( RIGLEY ) . " Ring out the narrowing lust of gold ; " ( LENA , turning suddenly to her mother ) .

" ( As the picture is knocked off the table , MRS . ZOOKER utters a short screech , and rushes over to the right to pick it up . RIGLEY turns to TESH ) . How is that ? p. 43 EUGENE TESH ( applauding , in which LENA joins ) . Bravo , Mr. Rigley ! Bravo ! ( MRS . ZOOKER has picked up the photograph of Mr. Lincoln , and is giving it to MARY , who has crossed back of the settee to a point above the center table . As MRS . ZOOKER hands MARY the picture , she makes a whispered comment to the effect of its not being broken , to which MARY nods , as she rearranges it on the table . ) REVEREND LORING RIGLEY There 's another verse or two , but they 've escaped my mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit , and laughing delightedly and self-consciously , and comes right down again . ) EUGENE TESH I consider you a very great artist . ( MR . RIGLEY lifts his hand deprecatingly , and , still laughing delightedly , turns , and goes up to the mirror over the mantelpiece and comes down again . ) MRS . ZOOKER ( having come down at the right of the table , and crossing in front of it towards TESH ) . See here , Mr. Rigley ! ( RIGLEY turns to her , from the center of the room ) . Mr. Tesh said a while ago that I ought to be on the stage ! REVEREND LORING RIGLEY He was flattering you , Mrs. Zooker. p. 44 MRS . ZOOKER Well , maybe he was ; but I think he ought to tell you the same thing . ( LENA is still standing in the spot where she delivered her recitation ; but , at this point , her eye rests upon TESH 'S cane on the back of the armchair , and she moves towards it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is standing down at the right , observes her ; and , anticipating her motive , steps to her side just as she is about to pick the cane up , and whispers that it might be safer to let it alone . LENA does n't accept the suggestion with any too good grace , however ; for , when MARY turns away , to resume her place , LENA turns on her heel with a sneer , for canes in general , and wanders back towards the settee . ) REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( overflowing with deprecation , as he passes in front of TESH to the left ) . Oh , nonsense , Mrs. Zooker , nonsense ! MRS . ZOOKER Do n't you agree with me , Mr. Tesh ? EUGENE TESH Perfectly  --  perfectly  --  Mrs. Zooker ! I 'm afraid if the pulpit had n't gotten Mr. Rigley  --  the theater would ! MRS . ZOOKER ( putting her arms around LENA , who has wandered in at her left ) . But , what do you think of my little girl , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 45 EUGENE TESH ( speaking very carefully ) . Why , Mrs. Zooker  --  I think if your daughter lives  --  she has a future . MRS . ZOOKER Do you hear that , dear ? ( LENA sneers and smiles , and buries her face in her mother 's shoulder ) . She does some comical pieces , too , but I guess she 's forgotten them by this time , have n't you , dear ? ( LENA shakes her head affirmatively , still keeping her face in her mother 's shoulder ) . Do n't you remember that Irish piece you used to do , about the cook ? ( LENA shakes her head negatively ) . She used to do one of them pieces where she had to take off the Irish brogue ,  --  and she 'd have you dyin ' in it . EUGENE TESH I 'd imagine she 'd be delightful . MRS . ZOOKER You 're sure you do n't remember that piece , dear ? MARY ( coming a step or two forward from the right ) . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if you want to be back in town by six . EUGENE TESH ( rising ) . Yes , I must go immediately . ( To RIGLEY , on his left ) . I 'm very sorry , Mr. Rigley . ( RIGLEY bows. ) p. 46 LENA ( standing right in his way , as he starts across to the back of the center table ) . Is that your automobile out there ? EUGENE TESH Yes . LENA Do you travel around in that ? MRS . ZOOKER ( brushing LENA out of TESH 'S way ) . No , dear , he travels round on the trains . ( TESH proceeds across to the center table and picks up his scarf and overcoat from the back of the armchair ) . Where do you show to-morrow night , Mr. Tesh ? EUGENE TESH In  --  a  --  Akron , Ohio . LENA Where was you last night ? EUGENE TESH Erie . ( Handing his overcoat to MARY ) . Please ? MRS . ZOOKER P , A ? EUGENE TESH Yes . MRS .

I have a sister living right outside of Erie  --  at Overbrooke. p. 47 EUGENE TESH Is that so ? MRS . ZOOKER Yes ; you might have went out to see her . EUGENE TESH Yes , it 's too bad I did n't know about it . LENA Where do you go after you go where you go tomorrow night ? EUGENE TESH ( laughing ) . I think I shall have to send you my route , Lena . MRS . ZOOKER ( coming forward at the left of the table , followed by LENA ) . Oh , Mr. Tesh !  --  do you know a young man by the name of Harry Culverson ? ( TESH comes down around the right of the table ) . He 's a distant relative of my husband 's . EUGENE TESH Why , I do n't believe I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZOOKER Oh , yes , he 's right in your line ; that 's the reason I thought you might have run across him . EUGENE TESH What company is he with ? MRS . ZOOKER Why , the last letter we had from him , he had charge of the elephants , with the Barnum and Bailey Circus . EUGENE TESH No , I 'm afraid I do n't know him , Mrs. Zooker , I 'm sorry . LENA Do you ever get ashamed when you first come out ? p. 48 MRS . ZOOKER She means nervous . EUGENE TESH Oh , sometimes , yes . MRS . ZOOKER Lena does , too . EUGENE TESH Is that so ? ( MRS . ZOOKER nods . ) LENA Is it true that Pearl White is the most beautiful woman in the world ? MRS . ZOOKER ( rather violently , and turning LENA towards the back , by the shoulder ) . Shut your mouth , Lena ! MARY ( taking a step or two to the buffet , where she leans ) . Do n't forget your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going immediately . ( LENA crosses above the table and comes forward at TESH 'S right . ) MRS . ZOOKER I suppose you run across some awful funny people travelin ' round the country the way you do , do n't you , Mr. Tesh ? EUGENE TESH Yes , very funny indeed , Mrs. Zooker ,  --  very funny . LENA How do you get your laundry done , when you 're always on the go ? MRS . ZOOKER ( sharply ) . Do n't ast so many questions , Lena ! ( LENA gives her mother a withering look , then swishes a few steps to the right and slightly forward ; then she stops , and makes a face of contempt for her mother . TESH stands watching her ; so does MRS . ZOOKER ) . Oh , there 's a question I wanted to ast you , Mr. Tesh , before I forget it ! Did you ever show in a place called Hutchinson , Kansas ? p. 49 EUGENE TESH Hutchinson , Kansas ? I believe I 've passed through there several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . EUGENE TESH Yes , I know where it is . MRS . ZOOKER Well , the reason I ast you , is ' cause we had a neighbor went out there to live some years ago ,  --  EUGENE TESH Oh , is that so ? MRS . ZOOKER And she sent Lena the loveliest postal card of Niagara Falls . Lena saves them . ( TESH turns and looks at LENA ) . She has quite a collection . So , if ever you run across a very fancy one , she 'd be delighted to have you send it to her ,  --  would n't you , dear ? LENA Sure . EUGENE TESH Well , when I get back to New York ,  --  I 'll send her one of the  --  Rocky Mountains . ( He starts to go , turning away from MRS . ZOOKER to the right . ) LENA ( rather condescendingly , as TESH smiles at her in passing ) . Thank you . MARY Have you everything , Gene ? EUGENE TESH ( picking up his gloves from the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves up to the center of the room , and LENA follows her , crossing in front of the center table. ) p. 50 MRS . ZOOKER Well , Mr. Tesh , what do you think I ought to do about this girl ? Do you think she belongs on the stage ?  --  She 's always acting ! LENA ( turning away , considerably embarrassed ) . Oh , I am not ! ( TESH laughs , and looks at MARY , who reflects his amusement . ) MRS . ZOOKER Now , you are too , dear ! EUGENE TESH There are very few of us who are not always acting , Mrs. Zooker ; it 's only when one learns how not to act ,  --  that one really belongs on the stage . MRS . ZOOKER . Well , what do you think I ought to do with her ? EUGENE TESH What are you doing with her now ? MRS . ZOOKER Why , she 's a waitress down in Schuster 's Bakery  --  on Fridays and Saturdays ; but she 's terrible dissatisfied ; sez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EUGENE TESH Well , that is n't a bad idea ; many waitresses have done very well in the pictures . However  --  personally , I think your daughter is a bit young to think of leaving the Bakery . MRS . ZOOKER Well , I think that myself . EUGENE TESH ( casually picking up his cane from the back of the armchair ) . Besides , in a bakery , an actress can always be reasonably sure of getting something to eat . p. 51 MRS . ZOOKER Yes , that 's true enough . EUGENE TESH However ,  --  if her genius continues to develop ,  --  I think it would not be a bad idea to take her to see a play occasionally . MRS . ZOOKER ( a trifle disconcerted ) . Well , of course , we do n't go to the theater very much  --  on account of the church being opposed , you know . EUGENE TESH Is your church opposed to the theater ? MRS . ZOOKER Yes . EUGENE TESH And why ? MRS . ZOOKER Well , I guess Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORING RIGLEY Well , I think Mr. Tesh understands that church people do not usually associate the two institutions . EUGENE TESH But , I think they should be associated , Mr. Rigley . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Well  --  EUGENE TESH Personally , I 've always regarded them as simply different branches of the same profession . ( RIGLEY makes a sound of amusement , but TESH cuts it off by a quick gesture ) . Of course  --  I speak of the two institutions in their best sense . p. 52 REVEREND LORING RIGLEY I 'm afraid one does n't see much of the best sense of the theater nowadays , Mr. Tesh . EUGENE TESH One does n't see anything at all , Mr. Rigley , if one does n't look . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY That 's true enough ; but , then , one hears so many dreadful things of the people of the theater . EUGENE TESH Perhaps , you mean one reads so many dreadful things . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Well , probably , probably . EUGENE TESH Frankly  --  I 've read a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at RIGLEY ) , but I go to church occasionally ; and I know some very good people who go to the theater regularly . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY No doubt indeed . LENA I know some girl 's got a ticket to see you to-night . EUGENE TESH I 'll leave a ticket for you , Lena , if you want to see me . LENA ( suddenly seizing her mother 's arm ) . Can I , Mom ? MRS . ZOOKER ( trying to silence her ) . Sh-sh-sh- p. 53 LENA Can I ? ( MRS . ZOOKER glances at TESH with a shade of apology for LENA 'S eagerness . ) MRS . ZOOKER Well , you could n't very well go alone , dear . EUGENE TESH I shall leave a ticket for you , Mrs. Zooker ; you can go with her . MRS . ZOOKER ( laughing a little ) . Well , I guess Mr. Rigley 'd have to be consulted about that . EUGENE TESH I shall leave a ticket for Mr. Rigley , also . ( They all laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TESH Bring him along with you  --  and , if he sees anything in my play that in any way endangers your salvation  --  why  --  then he need never allow you to go to the theater again . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY What is the name of your play , Mr. Tesh ? EUGENE TESH The Open Mind . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY The Open Mind ? EUGENE TESH The Open Mind . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY And what is the idea of it ? EUGENE TESH It 's about a man who had an idea that he was very good ; and that everybody else was very bad ; until one night he went to see a play ; and in one part of this play , the theater was so dark that the audience could n't see one another . And , presently , he heard various people around him  --  weeping  --  over  --  the injustice that was being done to the hero , and later applauding , when the villain was killed ; and it gave him an idea  --  That if people sitting in the dark  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and applaud the downfall of iniquity  --  why  --  these things must be very vital to them ;  --  perhaps more so than they were to him , because he did n't weep ; and he did n't applaud , either . p. 54 REVEREND LORING RIGLEY What did he do ? EUGENE TESH He opened his mind , Mr. Rigley  --  wide open ; because he saw that he had been mistaken all his life . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY And it took the theater to correct his mistake ? EUGENE TESH Precisely . The theater gave him the only opportunity that one has  --  of seeing people in the dark . REVEREND LORING RIGLEY ( in a lighter vein ) . What did he do then ,  --  become an actor ? EUGENE TESH No , no ,  --  he became a minister . ( They all laugh . MARY passes up to the hall door and takes TESH 's hat off the hall-tree ; then remains standing at the door ) .

ZOOKER shoots across back of him and takes up her position just to the right of the door . ) REVEREND LORING RIGLEY Indeed , that 's very true , I might . EUGENE TESH ( turning at the door ) .
