" Story of My Life and Work , " by C. Frederick Wright , will be published next month by the Bibliotheca Sacra Company . The following volumes are announced by Houghton Mifflin Company : A large-paper edition of John Muir 's " A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf " ; " A Man of Athens , " by Julia Dragoumis ; " Harvest Moon , " by Josephine Preston Peabody ; Sara Cone Bryant 's " Stories to Tell the Littlest Ones , " illustrated by Willy Pogany ; " Favorites of a Nursery of Seventy Years Ago , " compiled by Edith Emerson Forbes ; " Old Tavern Signs , " by Fritz Endell . One has a curious feeling in reading J. Lewis May 's graceful translation of Anatole France 's " Pierre Noziere " ( Lane ; $1.75 ) that the book was written in a vanished age of the world  --  in some golden afternoons a great while ago . The impression is partly due to the reminiscential character of the miscellany , and partly to one 's shock at the incongruity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which pervades the volume . The first book contains some delightful sketches of the author 's childhood and early youth . The second , consisting of " notes written by Pierre Noziere in the margin of his big ' Plutarch , ' " assembles characteristic fragmentary speculations on human reason and prejudice , with a dialogue in praise of ignorance , happily termed a " lovers ' quarrel " with the intellect . The third book comprises Pierre Nom:6re ' S travels in France . Pierre was not a great traveller . What he loved was to wander about amongthe peasants in Brittany , or to settle down is a little town in the valley of the Somme and draw deep into his lungs the fragrance of the sweet soil of France , to dream over the ancient churches , to revive the legends of local saints , ' to study the vestiges of pagan superstition lingering among the Christian observances of the simple folk of the countryside . He is an antiquarian , tender and devout , drawing the very soul of poetry from northern France , now devastated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , speaking of the work of architectural restoration , " to witness the destruction of even the smallest stone in an ancient building . . . . Time employs nor mallet nor chisel , his tools are the sun , the moonlight , and the north wind . He brings the handiwork of the craftsman to exquisite perfection What he adds is alike indefinable and beyond all price . " So tranquilly msthetic is his contemplation at times that he delights in the note which a picturesque beggar adds to the landscape : " These beggars are one of the beauties of Brittany , one of the symphonies of that land of moor and rock . " A torpedo boat putting out to sea troubles him a little  --  aesthetically , also ; yet " no doubt people like them because they have a formidable aspect and titillate the gentle love of carnage that purrs placidly in the depths of every bourgeois breast . . . . Monsieur Reran said he wished they would set scientists and philosophers to command such craft , instead of sailors ; for philosophers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to be blown into the air . " This is the placid purring of golden afternoons a great while ago . How all that has been blown into the air ! Mr. Joseph McCabe , the author of " The Tyranny of Shams " ( Dodd , Mead ; $160 net ) , is one of the leaders of the new enlightenment which is sincerely striving to ameliorate the conditions of the downtrodden . He believes that mankind has been steadily growing wiser and better and apparently that the New Jerusalem would be an accomplished fact but for the handicap imposed by outworn traditions . After an introductory chapter to indicate how widespread is the spirit of revolt against the old order , he deals in turn with fallacies underlying the present conceptions of armies , nationalism , politics , economics , education , morality , and religion . This is a big order which one might expect to find attempted in a single volume only by a dreamer . But Mr. McCabe insists that he is above all practical and that he has limited himself to suggestions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , here and now . The fine gusto with which the book is written , as well as the show of genuine learning in several fields , will doubtless hearten many humanitarians who , like himself , are convinced of man 's perfectibility and are not much impressed by the failures of previous ages . With all its shortcomings , it is a remarkably stimulating volume . The goal of the author 's aspirations is human brotherhood ; he would wipe out relentlessly all barriers which check it . So the " sham " of patriotism would tend to disappear by the use of a universal language , which would at a bound remove many of the misunderstandings that cause friction among peoples Yet to prove that he is not so utterly a modernist as to be insensitive to the treasures of past civihzation he suggests that the classics of all tongues might properly be translated into this worldlanguage ! Nor is Mr. McCabe more practical when he discusses the " idols of the home . " Insisting that to enjoy some measure of happiness is every one 's birthright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard free love as the concern of no one but the persons engaged in it So obsessed is the author by man 's highmindedness when unhampered by artificial restraints that he fails to see the ben efits of hardships in the achieving of , personal character and integrity . Such blindness verges , of course , on the pure naturalism of Rousseau . Enough has been said to indicate the somewhat careless ease with which Mr McCabe overrides difficulties which all ages have tried in vain to solve . Yet his volume is instinct with a vigorous desire to alleviate misery , and contains just condemnation of the selfish policy of laissez faire , particularly of the militaristic sham . Horace T. Bridges , head of the Ethical Society of Chicago , seeing the waning power of the church to-day , has come to the rescue with his study of " The Religion of Experience " ( Macmillan ; $1.50 net ) . He has noted clearly many of the difficulties of the present situation , and the remedies he proposes are in some cases sound . We like his advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to combine the roles of Miss Jane Ad-dams , Dr. Graham Taylor , Professor Zueblin , and Billy Sunday . There is good counsel in such words as these : The clergyman ought to reserve at least four hours of every working day ( that is , of every day ) , for reading and study , apart from the immediate work of preparing his discourses and his material for class teaching . If he does this conscientiously , he may , by the time he is forty , be really competent to grar.r.lz needs of our age . In doing this work , he ought to be as jealous of his time , and of the claims of his task , as any banker or editor or doctor or lawyer . He ought to repudiate as essentially unreasonable the idea that he is to be constantly at the disposal of the outof-work , or of idle members of his congregation seeking the luxury of private spiritual consultation and personally administered soothing syrup . Much also of Mr. Bridges 's philosophy is sound , notably his analysis of the evolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through the imagination of M. Bergson . He is right in maintaining that the one thing for the religious teacher to aim at in these days is to put his doctrine on the positive basis of psychological experience . But  --  and here Mr. Bridges is only a victim of the age  --  it does not appear that he has any experience to offer that is really religious in its nature . When he comes to the practical application of his theories his supposedly spiritual insight evaporates into those philanthropical and sociological concerns which he blamed the preachers for following at the expense of religion . We have nothing to say against Philanthropy and political reform , but the pulpit can never regain its power until it speaks again to the individual soul of a need other than , and deeper than , these . The true religion of experience can be proclaimed only by those who have found for themselves the peace that passeth understanding . The most notable item in Volume XLIX of the Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society ( Boston : The Society ) is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , written between 1863 and 1872 . The letters , most of which are dated at Oxford , are filled with racy comment on the political events of the moment , particularly in England ; and there are some sobering reflections upon the decay of manners and morals in France . A. humorous reminder of the uncertainties of American railway travel just after the Civil War is found in a letter of November , 1868 , written upon Smith 's arrival in New York en route to his duties at Cornell : " I go on this evening by the Erie Railway to Ithaca , and as about one train in every three on the average arrives at its destination safely on that line , and seven out of the last ten have smashed , there is a fair chance of my being at Cornell College to-morrow morning , " Other items of note include letters from , or relating to , the painter Smibert ; some notes and documents on . Du Pont , Talleyrand , and the French spoliations ; the correspondence of John B. Davis , a Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster , Samuel Bowles , and others ; and a valuable paper by Charles H Hart on Peter Harrison , the architect of King 's Chapel and the Redwood Library . Four letters of Rufus King , 1784-1786 , throw light upon the public opinion of the time regarding the West . " Very few men , " wrote King , " who have examined the subject will refuse their assent to the opinion that every citizen of the Atlantic States , who emigrates to the westward of the Allegany is a total loss to our confederacy " A paper by Harold Murdock , entitled " Historic Doubts on the Battle of Lexington , " traverses once more the long-standing controversy between Lexington and Concord over what was said and where it was done . The gifts of the year include the Lopez-Champlin manuscripts , upwards of three thousand in number , relating to the history of American colonial commerce ; files of antislavery and abolition journals , deposited by the surviving children and representatives of William Lloyd Garrison . and forming " practically a complete record of the journalistic career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers of Charles Deane . The memorial sketches of deceased members , some of them singularly long delayed , include the names of Frederic W. Putnam , the ethnologist , John D. Long , William Everett , Phillips Brooks , Charles Gross , Lucien Carr , long a valued contributor to the Nation , and Edward H. Strobel . In a brief treatise on " The Universe as Pictured in Milton 's Paradise Lost " ( The Abingdon Press ; 75 cents net ) Prof. William Fairfield Warren , of Boston University , has undertaken to clarify the difficult matter of Milton 's cosmology . Briefly , he holds that the action of the epic takes place in a Macrocosm , " the hollow universal orb " ( VII , 257 ) , which is " limitless space , " but must be thought of as " orbicular , or sphere-like " ( p. 35 ) ; that in this Macrocosm are " three spatially distinct regions " ( p. 35 ) ? Heaven , which is uppermost , Chaos , immediately underneath , and Hell , immediately below Chaos ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell beneath by the Empyrean , " a hollow sphere , or world-shell " ( p. ; that the upper and lower halves of the universe are " counterparts " ( p. 36 ) ; that Heaven-gate and Fell-gate , which are in a perpendicular line , are the only openings between Chaos and outer space ; that the solar and stellar world , here styled the Cosm , is probably to be thought of as homocentric with the Macrocosm ; thatthe earth , which may or may not revolve , is the centre of the Cosm , and that the pole of the earth was at first perpendicular . This much Professor Warren thinks reasonably certain He is somewhat doubtful on several minor points which he suggests for further discussion . It is regrettable that conclusions generally sound could not have been presented with more attention to accuracy of statement . The fact that the same person is called both John Andrew Rimes and George H. Rimes within two pages ( pp. 72 and 74 ) Is trivial ; so is the fact that incorrect citations are given more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 671 should be VI , 871 , or on p. 47 , where IV , 433 should be IV , 233 ) . There are more serious errors . For instance , Professor Warren says ( p. 15 ) that " as Hell 's territory is simply the expropriated undermost part of the original domain of Chaos , according to h. 1002 , it Hell can not be a bounded and shut-in dungeon , but is in reality ' the dark unbottomed , infinite Abyss ' ( ii , 405 ) . " In. the context , however , II , 405 plainly refers not to Hell but to Chaos : But , first , whom shall we send In search of this new World ? whom shall we find Sufficient ? who shall tempt with wandering feet The dark , unbottomed , Infinite Abyss , And through the palpable obscure find out Cais uncouth way . . .3 And again , Professor Warren says that the gates of Hell are " ' high ' in the fiery concave of the horrid roof . ' " ( p 15 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a single quotation , are founded upon three separate passages , which , as a matter of fact , do not exactly support his inference : and gates of burning adamant , Barred over us , prohibit all egress ( II , 436-7 ) Satan Now shaves with level wing the Deep , then soars Hp to the fiery concave towering high ( II , 634-5 ) . At last appear Hell-bounds , Mgh reaching to the horrid roof , And thrice threefold the gates ( II , 643-5 ) . Even though the three passages are all duly cited , one scents the special pleader and grows suspicious of the conclusions . Any final account of Milton 's cosmology must be more exact in its use of the Poem itself . It must explain , among other things , how a " limitless space " can be " orbicular , or sphere-like , " and how , if Hell is shut out from Chaos by a sphere which bounds Chaos , that sphere can furnish Hell , beneath it , with a concave roof . Professor Warren 's account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is hardly final . Of all the books on the war , the reviewer has come to dread those on Gallipoli as most pathetic records of the failure of a gallant enterprise on the very brink of success . Somehow , we do not expect to find that , when the story of the defence of Kutel-Amara is written , it will leave us with so poignant a sense of depression . Though Corporal John Gallishaw 's " Trenching at Gallipoli " ( Century ; $1.30 net ) gives only a glimpse of the operations , from the section of trench held by the small Newfoundland contingent , with a frank , vivid perspective that is refreshing , yet , like his predecessors , he can not suppress the inevitable instances of the chaos that made the great attempt sofutile . Mr. Gallishaw 's simple story is full of the quiet heroism and suffering that was entailed , but it merely strengthens the impression of useless human sacrifice . Gallipoli must ever remain in British military annals as a monument to the system that evidently had learned little from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand forth as another worthy and pathetic tribute to the sheer bravery of the fighting man , whose worst enemies were neither Turks nor Germans , but those incompetent members of the high command who were foisted upon Sir Ian Hamilton by social influence . Thus it would seem fortunate that a Newfoundlander from Harvard should record for British eyes the ungarnished story of the lot that fell to his comrades and the other Colonials under this crass ineptitude . We hope that other Colonials will write with franker and wider knowledge of the situation . Then the glory of Anzac will not be wholly in vain . Whatever skeletons are aired after the war , at least it seems certain that , by virtue of the heroic sacrifices at Anzac and in France and Africa , the Colonial Premiers will take part in that final Allied council which shall decide upon terms of peace . " Alcott Memoirs " ( Badger ; $1 ) , compiled from the journals and memoranda of the late Dr. Frederick L. H. Willis by his daughter Edith Willis Linn and Henri Basin , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the Concord illuminati . Dr. Willis when a boy of fourteen began to spend his summers with the Alcotts in Concord , and he boarded with them later in Boston while he was a student in the Harvard Divinity School . Near the end of his life  --  he died in 1914 at the age of eighty-four ? he planned to write his recollections , and made some notes on the famous personages whom he had met in his youth . From the material at hand the editors have made short chapters on Dr. Willis , the Alcotts , Fruit-lands , Emerson , Thoreau , Margaret Fuller , Hawthorne , and Thomas Starr King . Dr. Willis testifies that his life was profoundly influenced by this group , and that the influence was of very fine quality ; but his record contains little that is new and nothing that is important . Henryk Sienkiewicz , the Polish novelist , died on November 15 at Vevey , Switzerland . Born in 1846 , the son of a Polish country squire , Sienkiewicz was educated entirely in Poland , finishing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced a monograph upon a famous Polish poet of the sixteenth century , Szarznski , and about the same time began to write short stories over the signature of " Litwos " ( Lithuanian ) . At the age of twenty-two , after he had left the University , he began a gypsy life , which led him to every corner of Poland . From Poland he drifted , to Russia , at one time editing a newspaper in St. Petersburg . In 1877 , while in Paris , he became interested in the scheme to found in America a Polish commonwealth of expatriated artists and musicians . This fraternity , which was reduced to a mere handful of enthusiasts , among them Helena Modjeska , settled near Los Angeles , Cal. , and called their settlement Anno Luni . After the failure of the colony , Sienkiewicz returned to Poland , and in 1880 began his great series of historical novels . " Fire and Sword , " " The Deluge " and " Pan Michael " were first published in a Warsaw journal , translations appearing simultaneously at Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America . " Without Dogma , " a psychological novel of modern thought , appeared in translated form in 1893 , and was followed two Years later by a social study of contemporary life in Poland called " Children of the Soil . " Neither book was a popular success . " Quo Vadis , " his best known work , which enjoyed a phenomenal success , was published in 1896 . Among his other works may be mentioned the humorous " A Prophet in his Own Country " ; " Yanko , the Musician " ; " A Knight of the Cross , " " Hania , " " The Third Woman , " and a series of essays concerning his American experiences and impressions . Since the outbreak of the war , with its disastrous consequences to Poland , he has from his retreat in Switzerland issued appeal after appeal to the civilized world to aid in the relief of the sufferers in his devastated country . He was president of the General Relief Committee for Victims of the War in Poland , and was an indefatigable ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for the miseries of his compatriots . In 1905 he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature .
