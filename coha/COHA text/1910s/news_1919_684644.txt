txt The world regards Theodore Roosevelt as an embodied personality who added dignity and power to American citizenship and American freedom . He never expected to be remembered by his exploits in Africa and South America ; his addresses or his books . But he did declare that his monument was-in the Panama Canal . Behind ' the Roosevelt construction of the Panama Canal is a more dramatic story of human force and personality . It was not Theodore Roosevelt who took Panama and made the building of the Canal by the United States o possibility . It was Lieut . Col. Philippe Bunau-Varilla . HOW ROOSEVELT TOOK THE CANAL ZONE William Morton Fullerton , the newspaper correspondent , told me a few weeks ago in Paris that he once asked Roosevelt at Oyster Bay how he could declare that he took the Panama Canal Zone and Roosevelt replied : " I took the Panama Canal Zone , but I took it from Philippe , who handed it to me on a silver platter . " Six months ago I was bound eastward from Halifax on the steamship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to Paris and he fulfilled his promise made previously in the United States that he would some day tell me the inside story of the Panama Revolution . It took many hours for him to narrate history covering several decades , and tilt record was only finished at his beautiful home near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris just before I left France . ONE MAN AGAINST A NATION It is a dramatic story of human personality covering the fight of a generation in foiling the machinations of Germany in its attempt to destroy the spirit of France , prevent the building of the Panama Canal , and lay the foundation for an attempted world conquest . Lieut. - Col . Bunau-Varilla was at one time engineerinchief for the Panama Canal and previously for the French Government . It was he who solved the difficulties of the Culebra cut and landslides . THE SUEZ AND PANAMA CANAL FLOTATIONS In 1 &69; the Suez Canal was opened with the shares at one-half of their par value of $100 . There was doubt If the canal would ever be used . Eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price at the opening of the canal . De Lesseps was never an engineer . He was a diplomat and as the French consul in Egypt secured from Mohammed All a concession for the construction of the canal by the French . Bad he kept his founders ' shares he would have been worth $25,000,000 , but he would keep nothing for himself and he let all the profits go to others . When de Lesseps in 1881 began the flotation of Panama Canal shares , he had become the idol of the French people . They subscribed liberally to the undertaking , and 1,400,000 yards of earth were being moved monthly in 1886-7-S . In 1557 the canal company accepted BunauVarilla 's idea of a lock canal and in three years the canal could have been opened . HOW FRENCH CONFIDENCE WAS DESTROYED The company offered 720,000,000 francs in bonds for subscription . On the day set for the subscription some mysterious force telegraphed all over France that de Lesseps was dead . There was a panic on the Bourse at the opening and Panama Canal shares fell off 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less than half the loan , were subscribed . Of course it is now well understood that the German ' military party engineered that panic . Instead of the canal being put into operation , the courts in 1S92 condemned de Lesseps and his son to five years imprisonment for promoting a financial swindle . It had been declared that six million tons would pass through the canal the first year , and the courts now decreed that the canal was absolutely impractical . CUTTING THE SINEWS OF A NATION This wrecking of the Panama Canal enterprise brought distrust of the masses against all the scientific , political , financial and intellectual people of France so that it was impossible for France thereafter to defend in war . Bunau-Varilla saw that the corruption which lost the war ; in 1S71 , together with the Panama Canal failure , had cut the sinews of the French nation , and endangered the life of his country . He knew that there was then only one power in the world that could make a success of the Panama Canal and thereby restore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1901 he came to the United States to fight the Nicaraguan Canal proposition . He battled alone at first , but finally won out and proved that the Nicaraguan Canal was in a volcanic zone . Twenty days before the final vote was taken St. Pierre Martinique was destroyed by volcanic action . In July , 1992. the Spooner law was passed whereby Congress authorized the President to build the Nicaraguan Canal if he could not buy the Panama Canal . In the beginning no senator was in favor of Panama . In the end Panama won by 12 votes .. eotevinia 's ONLY RIGHT It was in the original concession from Colombia to the French that transfer could not be made to another government without the consent of Colombia . On the passage of the Spooner resolution , the government of Colombia took the initiative and , without beine : asked , offered to facilitate the transfer of the concession from the French Government to the United States . Two hundred and fifty-five million dollars had been Tut into the canal in shares and bonds . of which 00 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 200 million of French money in the canal . The French sold the canal concession and its assets to the United States for $40,000.000 and paid a 20 ' . ; dividend to the individual security holders . It was agreed that the United States should pay $10. n00.000 cash to Colombia and $250 , - 00e annual rental . ewe INFLUENCE AGAIN It was a de facto government in Colombia and a reference to popular vote on such a matter had never been thought of . There was no precedent for it . : etldenly the Tapers of Bogota , the capital of Colombia , burst forth with the demand for a popular vote . Then the agitation against the United States began . The sueeess of the Suez Canal was pointed to and it was whispered that Berlin stood ready to loan Colombia the money to build the Panama Canal and let the profits of the enterprise go to Colombia . The result was a vote in repudiation of the contract with the United States . THE BLOODLESS PANAMA REVOLUTION Later the people of Panama , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set up as an independent government . Bunau-Varilla from Paris assisted in this rebellion . He borrowed in Paris the first $100,000 . He wrote-the declaration of independence for Panama , designed its flag , wrote its constitution copied after that of Cuba , made the plan of campaign , assisted to organize the government and become the representative of the Republic of Panama at Washington and was recognized by all the leading governments of the world . It was a bloodless revolution ; a battle of wits . The Germans had told the Colombians that the United States would go into Nicaragua and fail . Then the Germans would put their money behind Panama and the Colombians would get the profit . TILE COMM A NS AND COLOMBIA LOST Hay drew up the treaty with Panama . Bunau-Varilla drew a new one giving clearer and simpler terms and the latter was accepted by Hay exactly as written . Last year Gen. in Paris told Lieut. - Col , Bunau-Varilla that the two principal papers in Bogota were still owned by the Germans . DESECRATING ROOSEVELT 'S MONUMENT Roosevelt declared : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Germans came into the open in their fight for the destruction of France , and the conquest of the world , Roosevelt and his sons offered themselves to the cause of American freedom and democracy . Father and one son are dead and a Republican Senate now proposes to defame his record and the record of the Republican Party by payment of $25,000,000 to Colombia , for her part in a German conspiracy against the peace of the world . Colombia parted with whatever rights she had in Panama 30 years ago and her agreement to accept $10 , - 010,000 for her assent to the transfer from the people of France to the people of the United States was assumed by the new Republic of Panama . The people of Panama alone had the natural territorial right to the Panama Canal route . To now pay $25,000,000 to Colombia is an infamous insult to the men living and dead who defeated the Hun at Panama and made possible the uniting of the " world 's naval force in its defensive warfare against conquest and tyranny . How is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama ? " A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR PEACE If we are to pay $25,000,000 either because German bankers in Colombia and the international exchange market need the money , or to show our good-will toward all South American countries with whom we are more or less in alliance under the Monroe Doctrine , or to establish a precedent in international justice as respects the territorial integrity of nations , the situation should be clearly understood . If we pay Colombia $25,000,000 because we so quickly recognized the new Republic of Panama , may we not by the same rule hereafter be called upon to pay billions to China ? THE FUTURE JAPANESE SETTLEMENT President Wilson is doing exactly the same thing to China that President Roosevelt did to Colombia  --  and worse . President Wilson recognizes the right of Japan to take at Shantung 88,000,000 of the best population of China and a rich territory as large as the five New England states outside of Vermont . If the United States Senate approves , why may not the Orient later call upon us for billions of indemnity ? as the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; China to recognize Japan 's separation of the Shantung Peninsula and Uncle Sam to pay the bill and make everyone happy all around ? except the taxpayer in America . U. S. Expenditures Decrease Washington  --  The Treasury started in August with a net balance of $810,764,988 ; ordinary expenditures for July . $878,41.1,108 , against $1,259,782,599 for July 1 , 1918.
