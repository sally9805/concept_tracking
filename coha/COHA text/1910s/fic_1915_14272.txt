The living room of Strickland 's apartment . At the rear , a doorway , heavily curtained , leads into another room . At the left of the doorway , a bay window , also heavily curtained , is set into the diagonal wall . Near the center , an ornate writing desk , upon which is a telephone . At the right , the main entrance . The furnishings , in general , are luxurious and costly . As the curtain rises Strickland , kneeling , is burning papers in a grate near the main door . Benson , his valet , is packing a suitcase which lies open on the writing desk . It is ten-thirty ; a bitterly cold night in winter . STRICKLAND Benson ! BENSON Yes , sir . STRICKLAND Close the window : it 's cold . BENSON goes to the window . The window is closed , sir . It 's been closed all evening . STRICKLAND shivers and buttons his coat tightly . Benson . BENSON Yes , sir ? STRICKLAND Do n't forget a heavy overcoat . BENSON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh linen ? BENSON Yes , sir . p. 3 STRICKLAND Collars and ties ? BENSON I 've looked out for everything , sir . STRICKLAND after a pause . You sent off the trunks this afternoon ? BENSON Yes , sir . STRICKLAND You 're sure they ca n't be traced ? BENSON I had one wagon take them to a vacant lot , and another wagon take them to the station . STRICKLAND Good ! BENSON I checked them through to Chicago . Here are the checks . He hands them over . What train do we take , sir ? STRICKLAND I take the midnight . You follow me some time next week . We must n't be seen leaving town together . BENSON How will I find you in Chicago ? STRICKLAND You wo n't . You 'll take rooms somewheres , and I 'll take rooms somewheres else till it 's all blown over . When I want you I 'll put an ad in the " Tribune . " BENSON You do n't know when that will be , sir ? STRICKLAND As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks . It may be a couple of months . But you will stay in Chicago till you hear from me one way or the other . You understand ? p. 4 BENSON Yes , sir . STRICKLAND Have you plenty of money ? BENSON Not enough to last a couple of months . STRICKLAND producing a large pocket-book . How much do you want ? BENSON Five or six hundred . STRICKLAND takes out a few bille . Stops . Wait a minute ! I left that much in my bureau drawer . He goes toward the door . BENSON Mr. Strickland ? STRICKLAND Yes ? BENSON It 's the midnight train for Chicago , is n't it ? STRICKLAND Yes . He goes into the next room . BENSON waits an instant . Then he lifts the telephone receiver , and speaks very quietly . Hello . Murray Hill 3500. Hello . This Finley ? This is Benson. He 's going to take the midnight train for Chicago . Pennsylvania . You had better arrest him at the station . If he once gets to Chicago you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forget me , will you ? I want five thousand dollars for it . Yes , five thousand . That 's little enough . He 's got almost three hundred thousand on him , and you wo n't turn in all of that to Headquarters . Yes , it 's cash . Large bills . Strickland 's step is heard . Midnight for Chicago . Benson hangs up the receiver and is busy with the suitcase as Strickland enters p. 5 STRICKLAND Here 's your money , Benson . Count it . BENSON after counting . Six hundred dollars , thank you , sir . He picks up the closed suitcase . Shall I go now ? STRICKLAND No . Wait a minute . He goes to the telephone . Hello , Madison Square 7900. Pennsylvania ? I want a stateroom for Chicago , midnight train . Yes , to-night . BENSON Do n't give your own name , sir . STRICKLAND No . The name is Stevens. Oh , you have one reserved in that name already ? Well , this is Alfred Stevens. You have it reserved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have n't any other ? He pauses in an instant 's thought . Then , decisively : Never mind , then . Good-by . He turns to Benson . Benson , go right down to the Pennsylvania , and get the stateroom that is reserved for Alfred Stevens . You 've got to get there before he does . Wait for me at the train gate . BENSON Yes , sir . STRICKLAND Do n't waste any time . I 'll see you later . BENSON Very well , sir . He takes up the suitcase , and goes. p. 6 STRICKLAND left alone , opens drawer after drawer of the desk systematically , dumping what few papers are still left into the fire . Outside a wintry gale whistles , and shakes the locked window . Suddenly there is a knock at the door . He pauses , very much startled . A little wait , and then the knock , a single knock , is repeated . He rises , goes to the door , opens it . Who 's there ? THE GIRL I , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : perhaps under twenty-five : possibly still younger . A somewhat shabby boa of some dark fur encircles her neck , and makes her pallid face stand out with startling distinctness from beneath a mass of lustrous brown hair . And as she steps over the threshold she gives a little shiver of comfort , for it is cold outside , and her thin shoulders have been shielded from the driving snow by a threadbare coat . She enters the warm room gracefully , and little rivulets of melted ice trickle to the floor from her inadequate clothing . Her lips are blue . Her hands tremble in their worn white gloves . A seat before a blazing fire , or perhaps , a sip of some strong cordial  --  this is what she needs . But Strickland has no time for such things . He greets her with a volley of questions . STRICKLAND Who are you ? THE GIRL Who , do n't you remember me , sir ? p. 7 STRICKLAND No . THE GIRL I 'm from the office , sir . STRICKLAND The office ? THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stenographers , sir . STRICKLAND Oh . I suppose I did n't recognize you on account of the hat . What do you want ? THE GIRL There were some letters which came late this afternoon  --  STRICKLAND interrupting harshly . And you 're bothering me with them now ? He crosses to the door , and holds it open . I 've got no time . Good night . THE GIRL timidly . I thought you 'd want to see these letters . STRICKLAND Plenty of time to-morrow . THE GIRL But you wo n't be here tomorrow , will you ? STRICKLAND starting violently . Wo n't be here ? What do you mean ? THE GIRL You 're taking the train to Chicago to-night . STRICKLAND How did you know  --  He stops himself . Then , with forced ease . Taking a train to Chicago ? Of course not ! What put that in your head ? p. 8 THE GIRL Why , you told me , sir . STRICKLAND I told you ? THE GIRL You said so this afternoon . STRICKLAND harshly . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . No , sir ? She produces a time-table . Then I found this time-table . She holds it out . He snatches it . STRICKLAND Where did you find it ? THE GIRL On your desk , sir . STRICKLAND On my desk ? THE GIRL Yes , sir . STRICKLAND suddenly and directly . You 're lying ! THE GIRL Why , Mr. Strickland ! STRICKLAND That time-table never reached my desk ! I lost it between the railroad station and my office . THE GIRL Did you , sir ? But it 's the same time-table : you see , you checked the midnight train . He looks at her suspiciously . I reserved a stateroom for you . STRICKLAND astonished . You reserved a stateroom ? p. 9 THE GIRL smiling . I knew you 'd forget it . You have your head so full of other things . So I telephoned as soon as you left the office . STRICKLAND biting his lip angrily . I suppose you made the reservation in my own name ? THE GIRL No , sir . STRICKLAND immensely surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other name : you did n't want your trip to be known . STRICKLAND No , I did n't . A good deal startled , he looks at her as if he were about to ask , " How did you know that ? " She returns his gaze unflinchingly . The question remains unasked . But a sudden thought strikes him . What name did you give ? THE GIRL Stevens , sir . STRICKLAND thunderstruck . Stevens ? THE GIRL Alfred Stevens . STRICKLAND gasping . What made you choose that name ? THE GIRL I do n't know , sir . STRICKLAND You do n't know ? p. 10 THE GIRL No , sir . It was just the first name that popped into my head . I said " Stevens , " and when the clerk asked for the first name , I said " Alfred . " STRICKLAND after a pause . Have you ever known anybody of that name ? THE GIRL No , sir . STRICKLAND with curious insistence . You are sure you never knew anybody of that name ? THE GIRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't remember it . STRICKLAND abruptly . How old are you ? He gives her no time to answer . You 're not twenty , are you ? THE GIRL smiling . Do you think so ? STRICKLAND continuing the current of his thoughts . And I 'm forty-seven . It was more than twenty-five years ago. You could n't have known . THE GIRL after a pause . No , sir . STRICKLAND looking at her with something of fear in his eye . What is your name ? THE GIRL Does it matter ? You did n't recognize my face a few minutes ago ; my name ca n't mean much to you . I 'm just one of the office force : I 'm the girl who answers when you push the button three times . She opens a handbag . These are the letters I brought with me. p. 11 STRICKLAND not offering to take them . What are they about ? THE GIRL opening the first . This is from a woman who wants to invest some money . STRICKLAND How much ? THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you turn it over to the clerks ? THE GIRL The savings of a lifetime , she writes . STRICKLAND What of it ? THE GIRL She wrote that she had confidence in you . She says that she wants you to invest it for her yourself . STRICKLAND You should n't have bothered me with that . He pauses . Did she inclose the money ? THE GIRL Yes . A certified check . She hands it over to him . STRICKLAND taking the check , and putting it in his pocketbook . Write her  --  oh , you know what to write : that I will give the matter my personal attention . THE GIRL Yes , sir . She says she does n't want a big return on her investment . She wants something that will be perfectly safe , and she knows you will take care of her . p. 12 STRICKLAND Yes . Of course . What else have you ? THE GIRL A dozen other letters like it . STRICKLAND All from old women ? THE GIRL seriously . Some of them . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . He says that when he gets a little more he 's going to open a store , and go into business for himself . Here is another from a girl whose father was an ironworker . He was killed accidentally , and she wants you to invest the insurance . Here is another from  --  but they 're all pretty much alike . STRICKLAND Why did you bring them here ? THE GIRL Every one of these letters asks you to do the investing yourself . STRICKLAND Oh ! THE GIRL And you 're leaving town to-night . Here are the checks . She passes them over . Every one of them is made out to you personally ; not to the firm . STRICKLAND after a pause . You should n't have come here. I have n't time to bother with that sort of thing . Every man who has five dollars to invest asks the head of the firm to attend to it himself . It means nothing . I get hundreds of letters like those . p. 13 THE GIRL Still  --  STRICKLAND What ? THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't keep on coming in . She smiles . It 's a wonderful thing to inspire such confidence in people ? STRICKLAND Do you think so ? THE GIRL It is more than wonderful ! It is magnificent ! These people do n't know you from Adam . Not one in a hundred has seen you : not one in a thousand calls you by your first name . But they 've all heard of you : you 're as real to them as if you were a member of their family . And what is even more real than you is your reputation ! Something in which they rest their absolute confidence : something in which they place their implicit trust ! STRICKLAND slowly . So you think there are few honest men ? THE GIRL No : there are many of them . But there is something about you that is different : something in the tone of your voice : something in the way you shake hands : something in the look of your eye , that is reassuring . There is never a doubt  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid ! Simply splendid ! She pauses . What a satisfaction it must be to you to walk along the street and know that every one you meet must say to himself , " There goes an honest man ! " It 's been such an inspiration to me ! p. 14 STRICKLAND To you ? THE GIRL Oh , I know that I 'm just one of the office force to you . You do n't even know my name . But you do n't imagine that any one can see you as I have seen you , can work with you as I have worked with you , without there being some kind of an effect ? You know , in my own troubles  --  STRICKLAND interrupting . So you have troubles ? THE GIRL You do n't pay me a very big salary , and there are others whom I must help . But I 'm not complaining . She smiles . I  --  I used to be like the other girls . I used to watch the clock . I used to count the hours and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's different now . STRICKLAND slowly . How  --  different ? THE GIRL I thought it over , and I made up my mind that it was n't right to count the minutes you worked for an honest man . Strickland turns away . And there is a new pleasure in my work : I do my best  --  that 's all I can do , but you do your best , and it 's the least I can do . STRICKLAND after a pause . Are you sure  --  I do my best ? Are you sure I am an honest man ? p. 15 THE GIRL Do n't you know it yourself , Mr. Strickland ? STRICKLAND after another pause . You remember  --  a few minutes ago , you spoke the name of Alfred Stevens ? THE GIRL Yes . STRICKLAND Suppose I told you that there once was an Alfred Stevens ? The girl does not answer . Suppose I told you that Stevens , whom I knew , stole money  --  stole it when there was no excuse for it  --  when he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him plenty . But the chance came , and he could n't resist the temptation. He was eighteen years old then . THE GIRL gently . Only a boy . STRICKLAND Only a boy , yes , but he had the dishonest streak in him ! Other boys passed by the same opportunity . Stevens did n't even know what to do with the money when he had stolen it . They caught him in less than twenty-four hours . It was almost funny . THE GIRL He was punished . STRICKLAND nodding . He served a year in jail . God ! What a year ! His folks would n't do a thing for him : they said such a thing had never happened in the family . And they let him take the consequences . He pauses . When he got out  --  stopping to correct himself  --  when he was let out , his family offered him help . But he was too proud to accept the help : it had n't been offered when he needed it most . He told his family that he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they could n't find him . He left his home town . He came here . p. 16 THE GIRL And he has been honest ever since ! STRICKLAND Ever since : for twenty-eight years ! It was hard at times , terribly hard ! In the beginning , when he had to go hungry and cold , when he saw other men riding around in carriages , he wondered if he had n't made a mistake . He had knocked about a good deal ; he had learnt a lot , and he would n't have been caught so easily the second time . It was almost worth taking the chance ! It was almost worth getting a foot of lead pipe , and waiting in some dark street , waiting , waiting for some sleek honest man with his pockets full of money ! It would have been so simple ! And he knew how ! I do n't know why he did n't do it . THE GIRL Tell me more . STRICKLAND He managed to live . It was n't pleasant living . But he stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did to stay alive : it was humiliating ; it was shameful , because he had n't been brought up to do that kind of thing , but it was honest . Honest , and when he walked home from his work at six o'clock , walked home to save the nickel , his betters never crowded him because they did n't want to soil their clothes with his honest dirt ! He had thought the year in jail was terrible . The first year he was free was worse . He had never been hungry in jail . THE GIRL Then his chance came . p. 17 STRICKLAND Yes , it was a chance . He found a purse in the gutter , and he returned it to the owner before he had made up his mind whether to keep it or not . So they said he was honest ! He knew he was n't ! He knew that he had returned it because there was so much money in it that he was afraid to keep it , but he never told them that . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he worked  --  worked because he was afraid not to work  --  worked so that he would n't have any time to think , because he knew that if he began to think , he would begin to steal ! Then they said he was a hard worker , and they promoted him : they made him manager . That gave him more chances to steal , but there were so many men watching him , so many men anxious for him to make a slip so that they might climb over him , that he did n't dare . He pauses . THE GIRL And then ? STRICKLAND The rest was easy . Nothing succeeds like a good reputation , and he did n't steal because he knew they 'd catch him . He pauses again . But he was n't honest at bottom ! The rotten streak was still there ! After twenty-eight years things began to be bad . He speculated : lost all the money he could call his own , and he made up his mind to take other money that was n't his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run off with it ! It was wrong ! It was the work of a lifetime gone to hell ! But it was the rottenness in him coming to the surface ! It was the thief he thought dead coming to life again ! p. 18 THE GIRL after a pause . What a pity ! STRICKLAND He had been honest so long  --  he had made other people think that he was honest so long , that he had made himself think that he was honest ! THE GIRL Was he wrong , Mr. Strickland ? STRICKLAND looking into her eyes ; very quietly . Stevens , please . There is a long pause . I do n't know what sent you : who sent you : but you 've come here to-night as I am running away . You 're too late . You ca n't stop me . Not even the finger of God Himself could stop me ! I 've gone too far . He goes on in a voice which is low , but terrible in its earnestness . Here is money ! He pulls out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cent of it mine ! And I 'm stealing it , do you understand me ? Stealing it ! To-morrow the firm will be bankrupt , and there 'll be a reward out for me . He smiles grimly , and bows . Here , if you please , is your honest man ! What have you to say to him ? THE GIRL very quietly . The man who has been honest so long that he has made himself think that he is honest ca n't steal ! p. 19 STRICKLAND hoarsely . You believe that ? THE GIRL opening her bag again . I was left a little money this week : only a few hundred dollars , hardly enough to bother you with . Will you take care of it for me  --  Alfred Stevens ? STRICKLAND Good God ! And utterly unnerved he collapses to a chair . There is a long pause . THE GIRL crossing slowly to the window , and drawing aside the curtain . Look ! What a beautiful night ! The thousands of sleeping houses ! The millions of shining stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how the stars and the lights meet ! So that one can not say : " Here Gods ends ; Here Man begins . " The telephone rings , harshly , and shrilly . Strickland goes to the receiver . STRICKLAND quietly . Yes ? You 're afraid I 'm going to miss the train ? Yes ? Well , I 'm going to miss the train ! I 'm going to stay and face the music ! Hysterically . I 'm an honest man , d'ye hear me ? I 'm an honest man . And furiously , he pitches the telephone to the floor , and stands panting , shivering , on the spot . From the window a soft radiance beckons , and trembling in every limb , putting out his hands as if to ward off some unseen obstacle , he moves there slowly . Did you hear what I told him ? I 'm going to make good . I 'm going to face the music ! Because I 'm an honest man ! An honest man ! He gasps , stops abruptly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The window is closed  --  has never been opened  --  but the girl has vanished . And as Strickland , burying his face in his hands , drops to his knees in awe . The Curtain Falls.
