FROM the kindergarten to the university , our present educational system is encountering searching criticism and undergoing radical readjustment . Few persons of liberal mind will fail to agree that the most auspicious aspect of this revolution is the wide-spread tendency to vitalize education by bringing it into closer contact with the actual life , present and future , of the student , a tendency of which the growth of industrial and agricultural , indeed of all forms of vocational training , is the most striking example . Education in America for the first time gives signs of becoming genuinely democratic . The very persons , however , who welcome these changes most enthusiastically should be the ones to insist most strenuously that whatever was sound in the old education should not be lost . As one of the chief repositories of this education , the college , together with the department of liberal arts of the university , presents , therefore , a problem of peculiar interest . Two things about the college , at any rate , are certain : it still has a function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficiently . What is wrong with the college ? As I ask myself that question , I find my mind traveling back to a certain organization of which I was once a member . It was a small group of relatively insignificant persons ; and yet , as I have listened in the last few years to reiterated indict- ments of our present collegiate education , I have found the conviction growing within me that that little organization , in its trivial way and on its restricted scale , had caught the secret which the American college has missed . The wind bloweth where it listeth ; the body of which I speak was nothing but a high-school debating-society- . It was nothing but a debating-society , but it had got hold of a miraculous power , to define or even to describe which I shall not try . I can only put down a few of its results . It had the knack , somehow or other , of taking raw and callow high-school freshmen and sophomores and instilling into them , sometimes with a suddenness that was startling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , social , and ethical , and an equally- furious desire to discuss them endlessly . ' My- memory may play me some tricks of exaggeration as I look back , but as I remember it , we boys came to reckon time in those days from one Friday night to the next . In their turmoil and fervor , the meetings themselves stand out in my mind as a sort of vivid contrast , especially in the matter of demands for the floor , with certain prayermeetings I have attended . Social functions , even dances , could not compete with them . If there was an athletic event on a Friday afternoon , the club did not adjourn in the evening to help celebrate the victory . The debate was held as usual , merely with added zest and an access of virtue . No January blizzard was severe enough seriously to impair the attendance . The meetings began on the dot , and ended when it was no longer possible to force or bribe the janitor to keep the building open . Most of my other high-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into fog and haze compared with the vivid memories of that society . I have no doubt that , in any absolute sense , its meetings were as absurd , its debates as wild and whirling , as any that were ever held . The product , then and there , was useless ; but the spirit back of it all ! That was authentic . That was , and is , a living thing . 1 use the word " spirit . " But no one word will do . It was a something in the air , an atmosphere , a tradition , a grip , a pressure , an urgency , an uplift , a quickening of the will , an intellectual enthusiasm , an esprit de corps . What one calls it is of no account . The point is , it is what the American college of to-day is most in need of . And the question is , how is it to get it ? THE UNIFYING INFLUENCE OF COLLEGE SPIRIT Now , the first fact to be grasped with regard to this spirit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can inhabit only a body where there is unity . It is no idle chance that the phrase " college spirit " has come in our day to have oftentimes an almost exclusively athletic connotation . The reason is that on the athletic-field we have team-work among the players and unity of interest on the part of all . The conditions for the emergence of an intellectual college spirit are the same . Whatever makes for the intellectual integrity of a college , renders more likely the appearance of this spirit . Whatever impairs that integrity , acts as a potent spell to keep it at a distance . A normal boy or girl of college age , introduced into an atmosphere of high intellectual pressure , can no more resist it than a bit of coal can avoid incandescence in the furnace . He can no more resist it than a person can resist the hush that falls over an audience in the presence of eloquence , or the spirit of panic , once under way , in the burning theater . A tone and tradition of mental enthusiasm once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the current will be from the whole to the parts . But in the meantime the problem is more complex , and calls for more drastic action . In every college in the country there are at present a large number of students who are intellectually alert . Why , then , do not their individual enthusiasms fuse into that collective enthusiasm of which we speak ? There are various reasons , but a fundamental one is the presence among them of a large number of students who have come to college for social reasons , or because , as the phrase runs , it is " the thing to do , " or , vaguer still , for no reason at all . We all slip too easily into the feeling that the presence of these students in the college community , while not beneficial , to be sure , is at least not positively harmful . A more fatal blunder could not be committed . They are the intellectual non-conductors that break the circuit , that  | insulate the real students from one another , and so prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of one student who is mentally inert may be of more avail in this matter than to acquire three who are mentally awake . It is at first a question not so much of size and range as of continuity . If a number of old friends look forward to an evening of congenial reminiscence round the fire , it may be more important that all the strangers go than that all the friends remain . The one false note mars the whole melody . The one chilly and unresponsive guest dissipates the spirit of festivity . THE INCUBUS OF THE IDLE STUDENT LOOKED at in this light , we see how specious are the arguments which have led us to tolerate the college idler so long . Clinging to the remote hope of his regeneration , we have permitted him to contaminate hundreds with the virus of intellectual listlessness . The time for tolerance is past . War measures are now necessary . The first and crying need of the American college to-day is the ejection , the ruthless ejection , of the man with the idle mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when conditions are less desperate , we may be able to treat him more leniently . But , then , the chances are that he will either be converted or will eliminate himself , for college will have become a place where a man with an idle mind will feel as uncomfortable as a churl in fine society . In bringing this condition about , however , we must not lose our sense of distinction . Greater vigilance over the intellectual life of the college must not be interpreted to mean that the poorly prepared student shall never be admitted , or that the man who gets low marks shall be instantly dismissed , or that the girl who is ruining her health over her books shall be tacitly applauded . I am not speaking of mental endowment or of mental results . I am speaking of mental hunger , a very different thing . The curve of mental hunger can not be plotted from statistics in the registrar 's office . But all this is not enough . This is only the preparation of the soil . Next there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alert is the indispensable condition ; but , as in that little de- bating-society , above them and around them and within them must be the unifying force of a central intellectual interest . A dozen words and phrases come to the tip of my pen to indicate what this interest might be , but I will not let myself put them down . All are inadequate , and each is bound to arouse the antagonism of some one who has another name for the same idea . But whatever we call this focusing power , who can doubt that a step of prime importance toward its attainment is the complete abolition of the compartment type of modern college ? the college , I mean , made up of intellectually water-tight departments ? In other words , we must wage unrelenting war on the spirit of narrow specialization . It was probably necessary , while our universities were being placed on a firm basis , for our colleges to pass through a period of the domination of this spirit . But that necessity is past . Hereafter specialization should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should stand out more and more clearly as the duty of the college teacher to humanize his subject , to bring it home to the lives and experience of his students , to relate it to other subjects the study of which they are pursuing . And to this end we must exorcise a superstition that looms in the path ? the obnoxious doctrine that largeness of outlook means lack of thoroughness and accuracy ; that the presence of imagination means lack of respect for facts . It ought to mean , and it can mean , just the opposite . No one whose mind is healthy loses interest in the towns and cities because he has seen a map of the whole country . THE ATTITUDE OF THE TEACHER TOWARD HIS SUBJECT IN this condemnation of the water-tight department I do not mean to include the system of major subjects , or the value of intensive study along some definite line . I refer , rather , to a distinct and easily recognizable attitude on the part of the teacher . Every one who has been through college has undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one extreme example of the type ? the man who teaches even the most elementary course in his subject as if all the stu- dents in the class were to give exclusive attention for the rest of their lives to his own particular little province of human knowledge . With the feeling of large leisure that this sense imparts , he begins far from the center , and with correspondingly imperceptible motion proceeds ? well , the students have no notion whither he is proceeding , for they are plunged into abysmal ignorance as to that part of the intellectual universe into which they have suddenly been dropped . Will not the real college teacher , on the other hand , remember that most of his students are never to follow the subject much further in the classroom and that the probability of their maintaining an interest in it on their own account will depend very largely on the degree to which they grasp it as a whole and the extent to which its relations are made plain to other parts of their experience and other subjects in the curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat his material in this way , is not that proof once for all that , whatever his scientific standing in his own field , he is no college teacher ? Fortunately , we have . all had teachers of the broader type . It was my own good fortune to have such an instructor in mathematics . I mention it here chiefly because , if mathematics can be humanized , any subject can . It was not that professor 's custom to make wide excursions from his subject . It was rather a passing illustration here , an application there , now a telling analogy , now , a specially vivid diagram ? devices sufficient to touch the thing to vitality , to render the most abstract of subjects the most concrete , until gradually we came to feel mathematical truth as a law permeating all life ; and so a realm that might have been one of dead signs and symbols was transmuted into a veritable temple of intellectual beauty . That man was , to the core , a college teacher . Moreover , there exists the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student who in a formal way does well in this subject and in that , but who apparently never dreams that any two of his classrooms are in the same universe . On the other hand , there is the student who stops at the teacher 's desk as he comes in to observe that the point the class was discussing last week came up the next day in a course in economics ; or who remarks in the midst of the recitation , " There was a good illustration of that in the morning paper , " or , " Is n't that where the middle ages were wiser than we are ? " or , " The psychologists have proved that that is n't so " ; or who , better yet , is overheard , after the class has been dismissed , continuing the discussion with some fellow-student and bringing in some telling example from literature or chemistry or philosophy or his own experience . This is the type of student that is meat and drink to the teacher ; for these are the evidences of mental life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of the classroom . And this type of student , at the present time especially , is a far better asset to a college than the highest honor student of the merely intensive sort . He is the thread that strings the intellectual beads of the college community . Happy is the institution that can capture a number of his kind . THE CORRELATION OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE VITAL THIS process of correlating , of vitalizing , of humanizing knowledge , a process to which both teachers and students must contribute , is the very essence of making education liberal . It is also the essence of making education practical . Indeed , is it not about time for us to recognize that , in any high sense , liberal and practical mean the same thing ? The long conflict between the two doctrines of which these are the watchwords has been due to the fact that while each stands for a great truth , each has become identified in many minds with a great falsehood . The great truth in the doctrine of the liberal education is the perception that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away often bestows the best control over things that are detailed and near . The great error in the doctrine is the false inference that anything that is distant and removed must , ipso facto , possess that power . The great truth in the doctrine of the practical education is , the perception that nothing is worth while that does not relate itself to the every-day life of man . Its great error is the belief that the only things that possess that relationship are things of an immediate , bread-andbutter nature . It is not enough , the prac- tical education must remember , that a subject enables a student to get results ; those results must be shown to be worth while in the light of human life as a whole . But it is also not enough , the liberal education must remember , that a subject has a relationship to the real and palpitating issues of human life ; it is necessary that the student be made to see and feel that connection clearly , constantly , and vitally . " But how , " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are demanding at the outset of the college course that which should be its end and consummation . " Precisely . That is the paradox that confronts every teacher ? the educational paradox , it might be called : the curious fact that only through an interest in the whole can one arouse an interest in the parts ; that what logically should be the fruit and outcome must , by a queer twist in the nature of things , he likewise the seed and startingpoint . How , for instance , does a small boy learn the game of base-ball ? Why , by learning the game of base-ball , of course . We would never dream of initiating him into the mysteries of that sport by delivering in his presence an elaborate disquisition on the kinds of wood of which base-ball hats may be made . When he has once grasped the game as a whole , however , he will then listen eagerly to the most recondite discussion of anything related to it , whether it be the materials of which bats are made , the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biography of some star player of the last generation . He will subject himself to any hardship , physical or mental , to obtain the practical or theoretical knowledge that makes up a real comprehension of the game . But anterior to all this is his interest in the game of base-ball . SPIRIT SHOULD COME BEFORE DISCIPLINE THIS simple principle we sometimes seem to lose sight of in our education , consistently putting the cart before the horse . In the days of the Renaissance , when people had caught a vision of a new world , they studied Greek with avidity because they believed it was a path into that world . We reverse the process . We set our students to grinding Greek verbs in order that in an indefinite future they may come in contact with the Hellenic spirit , when what they wanted was a touch of the Hellenic spirit to transform the Greek'grammar into a book of magic . We set them to cutting up earthworms when what they wanted first was to have their thoughts turned toward the mystery of physical life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due time a knowledge of that language may prove an incentive to read Dante , never perceiving that a craving for Dante might be made the strongest incentive for studying Italian . We red-ink and blue-pencil their compositions , believing , with a touching faith , that there is some intrinsic beauty in correct spelling and perfect punctuation that will appeal to the undergraduate mind ; and all the while what they needed was a sense , however dim , of the wonder of literary creation . What is true of the separate subject is true of collegiate education as a whole . We do not go to college to do four years of drudgery in order that the rest of our lives may be made easier and brighter . We go rather to catch a vision that will hold our faces toward the goal even amid the blackest passages of our later experience ; for tasks in hours of insight willed Can be through hours of gloom fulfilled . There , in a couplet , is the whole philosophy of the liberal education , and of its practical relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we deny vision to our young men , let us not complain later if the people perish . But the discipline of the old education ! What , some one cries , is to become of that ? This theory that work should be attractive , what is it but the abominable modern doctrine of making everything interesting , of offering our mental pabulum in predigested form , of bringing everything down to the intellectual level of a baby ? Let us not lose our sense of distinction . It is nothing of the sort . I agree that the modern doctrine referred to is abominable . I agree that we must have discipline ; that nothing can take the place of the hard task systematically performed , of the difficult obstacle systematically overcome . I even go so far as to believe that it would not be a bad thing to compel every student to pass a few courses that are dis- tinctly disagreeable , though I would immediately add that it is a good rule for every teacher to leave to his colleagues the duty of providing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one need not make a task disagreeable in order to get discipline out of it . One merely has to make it hard . We must rid our minds of the superstition that to make work attractive deprives it of its difficulty . To make it easy may make it attractive ; but to make it attractive is not necessarily to make it easy . A few years ago I heard of a college student who quite voluntarily spent his whole Christmas vacation in a finally successful attempt to solve a single problem in the integral calculus . The subject had been made fascinating to him . That did not make the problem any easier ; it merely would not let him give it up . The truth at the heart of the whole matter , however , may be seen in its simplest form in the case of children . A mother tells her little girl to pick up her blocks , which lie scattered on the floor . The child pouts and gives no sign of obeying . The mother suggests that the blocks are stones and the basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones are in the well within a minute . The example is a trivial one , but the principle it illustrates is at the root of human achievement . Education will reckon ill if it leaves it out . Let us go the whole way with the most orthodox , therefore , in the demand that college work be made difficult ; but let us also go the whole way with the most revolutionary in their demand that it be made human and appealing . Then we can preach the gospel of the joy of work without fear that it may degenerate into the perilous doctrine that a man should labor only at the tasks for which he has an inclination , develop only in the direction along which he is already well endowed by nature . Now , in conclusion , as we return from these reflections on things as they ought to be to the conditions that actually exist , we realize how deep is the discrepancy . When I try for a moment to picture the American college as it is , I find that it comes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , in a dormitory room , dimly visible through clouds of tobacco smoke , are a dozen undergraduates discussing batting averages or listening to a large man on a couch who is explaining in detail how the foot-ball game of the afternoon was lost . Here is a lonely figure , a note-book under his arm , emerging late at night from the chemical laboratory . Here , in the hall outside the classroom , is a group of young men and maidens filling out dance-programs . Here is a pale girl at her desk , her head wrapped in a towel , cramming her memory with German irregular verbs . Here are four men about a table in a fraternity house exulting over the recent capture of an important college office from their rival . Here , late in the evening , are two other men preparing copy for the college paper . Here are three young women boarding a trolley-car on their way to a social settlement in the city . Here ? But why go on ? Any one of us can continue the picture , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the thing is plural and not singular . Every one of these things , we recognize , is in its own place and proper measure commendable ; but in their detached and exaggerated form they indicate what a travesty our colleges are of what they ought to be . THE STUDENT SHOULD HAVE A VITAL INTEREST IN LIFE " OF what they ought to be . " As I let that phrase linger in my mind , there comes before me another picture . Again it is a group of students . I am not sure whether they are gathered about the teacher 's desk after the recitation or are lingering at the table after the dessert or are sprawling in various postures , long after they ought to be in bed , in some dormitory room . The place is unessential . All I know is that they are discussing . History is hurling the lie at economic theory . Economic theory is retorting in like kind . Religion is coming to the deadly grapple with science . Philosophy is endeavoring to arbitrate a dispute between biology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now belligerently , with the ancient . Mathematics and metaphysics and music and poetry are comparing their points of agreement and difference . It is that old high-school debating-society , only on a grander scale , exalted , purged of its grosser absurdities , with  | wider interests , in closer contact with facts and the authority of experience , its spirit of argument not exactly gone , but transmuted and sublimated out of a narrow , logical dialectic into a loftier and more tolerant intellectual curiosity . As I let the picture linger in my imagination , I realize that those students are not alone . Behind them and above them there are spirits present : the men and women , the ideas and purposes , that , in whatever sphere of activity , are shaping the life of the present and opening paths into the future ; and beyond and far outnumbering these , the master minds and master conceptions of the past . An ordinary college room has suddenly been transformed into the forum of the ages . Here Darwin rubs shoulders with Empedocles , Charlemagne with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nietzsche passes judgment on St. Paul , and Prometheus is confronted with the superman . Here Marconi and ilozart sit at the feet of Pythagoras , and Plato at the feet of William James . Here , in this debate of the centuries , is made plain the subtle bearing of Democritus on democracy and the occult relations that connect Pericles and Pompeii and Pasteur , Rembrandt and Ibsen , Copernicus and Cromwell , Mephisto and the Sphinx . Here Heraclitus expounds the Revelation of St. John the Divine , and Tacitus and Ferrero discuss the philosophy of history . Here ? for the vision grows even more grotesque ? we behold Archimedes criticizing the theories of Mr. Frederick W. Taylor , and Mr. Taylor in turn explaining to Hamlet why he was inefficient . Here Duns Scotus , warmly seconded by.Mr . Dooley , reopens his old feud with the Delphic Sibyl , and we hear , at last , the comments of Karl Marx on the battle of Marathon . Here we detect Jack Falstaff in close communion with St. Francis , and trace the hidden influence of Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chrysanthemums to Aristotle , and Mr. Pickwick appears to Mrs. Piper in a trance . Here " But this , " some one impatiently exclaims , " is mere insanity . " It is quite the opposite . It is the very diversity that insures the sanity of the seeker after truth . It is the very plurality that renders unity safe . For it is out of just such far-fetched juxtapositions , out of just such contrasts , paradoxes , incongruities , and conflicts , out of just such warfare of the lower orders of knowledge , that there emerges that higher knowledge for which there is no adequate name , but which makes up that something that is at once mental justness , the power of criticism , the standard of selection , creative vision , wisdom , philosophy ? philosophy not in the modern and pedantic , but in the ancient and bracing , signification of the term . And this it is , more fundamentally than anything else , that the student comes to college to attain . He comes not to acquire the superficial polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more crack-brained , pettifogging researcher ; not to heap up a little pile of information , or to acquire a few tricks of skill , which a few years later can be converted , unit for unit , into bread and butter . He comes rather to acquaint himself with the problems of the world as it now is , to make his own all that is choicest in the inheritance of the past , and to catch a vision of the world as it ought to be ; and to do all these things not for their own sakes , but to the end that when he approaches his own particular task in the practical world , he may bring to it background , amplitude , imagination , grasp , the combined daring and restraint , serenity and tenacity , of the disciplined mind . HERE is at least a partial program for the regeneration of the American college : ( 1 ) Eject from the student body the intellectually inert . ( 2 ) Eliminate from the faculty the narrow specialist , who at his best belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) Encourage , among teachers and students , in the classroom , and still more out of it , every influence that tends to unify , to socialize , to humanize knowledge . And let it be remembered ? for I have not forgotten that little debatingclub ? that one important means to this end is simply the creation of a current of vital ideas . Let every one talk , then , talk ardently and endlessly , each about the subject of his special interest , but all about that larger something in which these special interests inhere , and for which , indefinite as the term is , we have no better name than life .
