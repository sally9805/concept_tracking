txt The Treasury is urgent in collection of taxes , but slow in payment of Its bills . The first is right , the second is wrong . It is clear that the Treasury can not pay its bills unless it makes its collections . But It is just as true that the Treasury 's wants can not be supplied with goods unless the Treasury pays for what it orders . The Treasury ought to pay more promptly than commercial custom llecause its money comes so easy . But that is the reason why Government is such slow pay . Officials can not realize that their pen scratches are real money . They deal in abstractions , and can not appreciate that the money not paid by the Treasury has already been paid out by these trying to collect it , who are embarrassed by their inability to get business treatment from paymasters rolling in wealth . The extent to which this troubles those who have to pay foe labor and materials before they can work on Treasury orders is indicated by the extent of the orders . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplanes or other things which cost money , but which are not in popular use . It comes nearer to the average contractor to point out that the Treasury has bills to pay on account of goods ordered . ? such as 37,000.000 yards of bobbinet , ' 15,500,000 yards of khaki . 21,000,000 yards of cotton drilling , and so on . These goods must be made before they can be supplied , and the wages and material costs must be advanced before the bills can be sent to . the Treasury . The Treasury should pay as soon as the bills are approved , and there should be no delay about the approval . But the delay is flagrant . Chicago contractors complain that they can not get repayment of $50,000,000 which they had to pay out before they could make the goods the Government demanded . Philadelphia makes the same complaint for its textile trade . The goods are wanted so urgently that the Government will promise to pay enough to enable the installation of further facilities of manufacture . But the Government 's backwardness sends the sellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account as well as for commercial credits . Thus tardiness of Treasury payment becomes congestion of credit and obstruction of trade . That is worse for the little contractors than for the big ones . Tn proportion the little men need their money more , for their credit is less . But it is the big contractors who are favored by the Treasury . When it is a matter of spending billions for ships the Treasury thinks nothing of an advance of multiples of millions . But when the bargain is for a million pairs of shoes the Government will not advance thousands . It sends the contractor to the banks for help , sometimes for help given on pledge of the Government 's promise to pay . Uncle Sam always pays  --  eventually . When he is asking for money himself he appreciates that he who pays quickly pays twice . That is just as true of payments for goods as of collections of taxes . The Government 's slowness of payment partly explains the plea for slowness of demand of tax payments .
