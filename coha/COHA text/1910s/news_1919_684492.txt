txt Director General was well pleased with the arrangement under which he took over the railways for Government operation . He informed the Senate committee that the standard return was $100.000,000 less than the railways had earned under private management . That advantage , together with economies to be realized from unified operation , led him to hope for a surplus above the guarantee . If that was not a fair start , then he was frank to say that he did not know what would he fair . Leading critics of the railways went so far as to put similar expectations into figures . The savings over private operation were to be from $400.000,000 to $1.000,009.000 . The increase of expenses in 1918 was just about the larger estimate of savings , but that was about equal to the increase of rates , and so cancels out of the comparison . What could he fairer than that shippers should pay the Government 's increase of wages ? That would leave the taxpayers to cover only the deficit below the guaranteed standard return , above which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . February last year was about the worst month known for railway earnings , on account of the worst Winter weather for a generation . February this year was about the best known for weather conditions , but the net operating income was worse than last year by $2,225,000 . The trouble no longer is such congestion of excess business that it can not be moved . There is no congestion ? because the traffic is itself declining . Gross earnings are still improving , because the increase of rates is now effective , and the roads collected $350,844000 more money . But expenses are increasing faster than the increase of rates . February is a shorter month than January . hut the fewer days did not prevent the roads from equaling January 's $37,000.000 deficit below the guaranteed return of the three-year average . The average monthly deficit for 1919 is double that for 1918 , and Is about equal to one-half of the guarantee . Thus far in 1919 the roads have earned $28.000.000 toward a guarantee of $1 : : x0.000.000 on an average . or 8102,000,000 if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings . This dismal record is made under conditions favorable for realizing the glowing promises referred to above . For years the railway critics have declared that the railways should look for their profits to the increase of their business in proportion to their " overhead " expenses . The increase of profit on the unit of work was to be a sufficient reward for refusal of higher rates , and for patience in enduring the costs put upon the roads in punishment for their misconduct . During 1918 the roads enjoyed an increase of one-fifth in tonnage and one-quarter in passenger business , and they fell $202,000.000 below earning their guarantee . That record may be equaled , hut it is unlikely to be surpassed soon . If the railways are to earn their guarantee , either there must be another increase of rates or there must be increase of efficiency among the workers . The prospect that the States will come to the relief of the roads and Government operation is slight , and yet it is worth notice that Indiana has repealed its 2-cent-fare law . The repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trouble for the railways when they were thought to be making too much money for private owners would put another face on the matter . But a policy of constant wage increases would offset that . The confidence entertained last year that Government operation would supply the resources for the benevolence impossible . ill private operation . has been weakened since , and the taxpayers , whose burdens have risen with , tie railWayStii'zlges disbursed on their sot account , would view with alarm the opening of another cycle of wage increases just as the cost of living seems turning downward . The signs of a ripening of public opinion are beginning ? to appear . The Philadelphia Board of Trade has adopted a platform demanding the return of the . roads to private management , and the reorganization of the Interstate Commerce Commission with a view to protection of railway investors as  --  well as shiTspers . Similar action has been taken by the New York State Grange , which unanimously adopted a disparaging comparison between public and private operation . The Grange is opposed to Government operation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and urges its representatives in Congress to bring the experiment to an end immediately , now that the occasion for it has ended .
