T//E housemaid of a college president had been offered a situation in the family of a New York millionaire . As he wage promised her would have denuded the academic cupboard , she was asked ? a shade respectfully ? by the president , whether she intended to accept . ' No , ' replied the girl primly , ' I think I prefer to remain in a middle-class family . ' Let the reader hesitate , therefore , before deciding hastily that . he is too use or too foolish , too rich or too poor , to be within bowshot of the housemaid 's innocently poisoned arrow . For to be described as belonging to the American middle class to-day is something between a compliment and an insult . To disentangle the one from the other , let me invite you first to give ear to a parable which has the added virtue of having been snapshotted as it was happening . THE PARABLE Twelfth week of the strike in Elm-port . It began in April . Until June , the strikers had managed to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation , suckled in the creed that the natural rights of man are the common-law rights of eighteenth-century Englishmen , reproachfully terms ' disorder . ' Then befell the riot . A woman was killed outright by a revolver-shot fired , some say , by the police , seine say by the strikers . Ten people , mostly mill-operatives , were carried to the hospital with cracked sconces or bullet wounds . Nineteen strikers were thrown into jail on charges of riot or murder . Parades were forbidden . The Poles were denied the use of their own society hall for strike meetings ; and the town invoked an ordinance aimed at freedom of speech and public assemblage . A sympathetic clergyman offered his churchyard as a meeting-place . The town government retaliated with another ordinance , to prohibit any meeting on property abutting on a public highway , ? this , somewhat on the principle of the French Assembly which decreed that no deputy should be a crown minister . ' Say , rather , gentlemen , ' replied that statesman sarcastically , no deputy named Mirabeau ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution , a strike-leader , haranguing his fellows , was dragged to arrest . The town later voted twelve thousand dollars for special police . These reserves , by an amazing blunder in tact , were recruited in part from the police of Lawrence ,  - -  the worst-hat o l by mill-workers of any constabulary in New England . The theatre of this bitter warfare with its threatenings and slaughter is a sweet , gracious port-town , once a fishing village , quaintly nestled among great , dome-like glacial hills and majestic sweeps of salt marsh washed by a sounding surf among sand-dunes . There are three towns in Elmport . One is a winding of elm-arched streets among I he ample , gambrel-roofed homesteads of two centuries ago . Wide chimneys and peaked dormers shoulder among the boughs of sleek maples , shapely elms , and ancient oaks . Burnished colonial brasses gleam in the sunshine on front doors . Gardens , behind white fences and hedges of box , are gay with old-fashioned flowers . In the cool , dint parlors of these stately houses , amid ancestral mahoganies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores of the town ( which are maintained by the wages of the operatives ) , or go to their daily tasks in the city , or live on the incomes of their investments ( including stock in these strike-fel tered mills ) . Across a stone bridge of pre-revolutionary date , under the gaunt walls of the mill buildings , lies the second Elm-port , ? the new . Its streets shimmer in the blistering glare of sun on shade-less asphalt and brick walls ; its door-yards are grassless ; its wooden tenements stand bleak in winter , sweltering in summer . Here are no crimson rambler roses to sound their note of color against greenery ; here is only hard-eyed poverty intensified by the grim battle of strike-time , when wages have stopped and expenses are going on . Against the old Elmport of farmers and sea-capt ; tins is set the new , ? a mill population of alien birth . These two are working out their destinies .

When the t rouble at Lawrence , the year previous , was ended , it was evident that something must be done to revindicate before the country the repute of that city . Not that Lawrence was worse governed than many another American city , but that the strike , applying the acid test to the efficacy of our institutions , revealed their defects in the worst possible light . Was there , then , a conscientious effort to remedy the conditions which had produced the strike ? There was not . But a wealthy citizen , dying , left five thousand dollars to build a memorial flag-pole . Instead of removing the causes which created the protest of the foreign laborers in the mills , your sole idea was to rebuke the protest . This was the reply of the middle class . You substituted the symbol for the thing . In Elmport it was the same . ' As a rebuke to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town to our national institutions , ' Elm-port resolved ? to arbitrate the strike ? No . The attempt at this was a failure because the mill management denied that there was ' anything to arbitrate . ' To mitigate the discontent by scouring up the reeking tenements ? No . A militant young clergyman had proposed this , to be promptly checked in his generous enthusiasm by the revelation that the rents from these tene- meets were sustaining his own parishioners , certain of whom , when he tried to put through a housing ordinance in spite ( Willem , fought him tooth and nail and defeated the ordinance . No . To vindicate its reputation and prove its loyalty , Elmport resolved ? to have a Fourth-of-July parade . This was the answer of our old American middle class ? the people who ikon our independence and freed the chattel slaves ? to the wage-slave rebellion . They would bandage a poison-rd wound with the national colors . So Elmport was gay with flags . The July sun drenched yellow gold on the sourly elms , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The parade flowed past .

In the white-paneled parlor of one of th ? ? se colonial houses which the architect Inigo Jones need not have been ashamed to acknowledge , among the marble-topped tables and Sheraton chairs of the old order , a Protestant minister is trying to formulate an answer to the question : ' What shall Elmport do about it ? ' a question equivalent to ' What shall the Anglo-Saxon American middle class do about it ? ' And this is his answer : ? ' If the Constitution of the United States did not forbid us to imprison men for their political beliefs , we ought to clap these I.W.W. leaders into jail and keep them there . ' ' But , ' interposes the questioner mildly , NV/ I 11 a motion toward the parade which is passing the windows of the parsonage , ' is n't your celebration today in honor of a struggle to put an end to that kind of procedure ?

He and they were honoring the symbol and ignoring the thing . ' Mouth honor , breath . ' Let the old issue appear in a new guise , and that new guise was , to them , a disguise . A fortnight earlier , the town of Lexington , now a comfortable , middle-class suburb where there are no very rich and no very poor , was celebrating its two hundredth anniversary . The press of the following day duly recorded that the speakers ' excoriated ' the I.W.W. Now , while it is possible to look on the I.W.W. without unqualified approval , it is also possible to understand its syndicalism as the symptom of a disease . Lexington was denouncing the symptom under the impression that this was to eradicate the disease . That the Spirit of ' 76 , which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the town common , is in our midst again in the form of a labor revolt had not even remotely occurred to these ancestor-worshipers . They were Elm-port ing . Certain enterprising students of history ( who have suspected that there are some aspects which fail to get themselves written in books which publishers can afford to print ) have made the enlightening discovery that the abolitionists in the ' 50 's were saying things about the flag much more revolting , to people whose loyalty was more implicit than discriminating , than anything yet tittered by our Et-tors and our Haywoods . They , too , were hated , feared , and ' excoriated . ' They , too , were upbraided for assailing our national institutions ' ( among which was the institution of chattel slavery ) , by people whose intentions were of t he best , whose business transactions were at least commercially honest , whose private lives were above reproach , and whose only error was the somewhat serious one of having got their patriotism wrong-side-up-withcare .

At Gettysburg , on the same day that Elmport was parading , t he great American middle class held an anniversary observance which was full of heartache . Did it occur to any of them that , had the nation listened to the voice of its conscience , in the abolitionists of the thirties and forties , there might have been a way to avoid the tempest of death that swept t hat field of horror ? Did it occur to them that for the want of that ear to hear they paid , as poor , heartsick Garrison said they would pay , in their blood , in their tears , and in the precious lives of their loved young men ? Does it occur to their children , the American middle class of to-day , that we stand once more in the ' 50 's , with the voices of the slavery abolitionists crying in the wilderness ? THE MESSAGE Dear friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me beg you , most of all , to believe that I am not saying what I shall say for the fun of the thing . I would rat her some one else said these things and said them better than I can ; but I have waited for that some one to speak until I can wait no longer , for the time is growing short . You must let me do it as best I can , and make allowances for my bluntness , not for my sake but for your own ; for there is no longer time to beat around the bush . And remember this : everything I shall say hurts my pride as much as it hurts yours , ? or would , if I had not begun to see that in an hour like this , pride is a sorry guest . I , too , supposed that we were already doing all that could be expected of us , and found that we had shamefully betrayed our trust . And it stabbed me as shrewdly as it will stab you , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am one of you . Your children have been my playmates , and your young men have been my loyal friends . I have buried my beloved dead with you , and with you I ask no greater honor than to be thought worthy to lie down to sleep when my work is done . I speak as a friend to friends , so let it be with the frankness which is the privilege of friendship . II Is it possible that you do not realize the jeopardy of your position ? If your diplomats , under the flimsy pretext of national honor , are beguiled by wily financiers into a war for the pawing of investment chestnuts out of a foreign fire , you are the ones who must do their fighting , ? and pay the taxes afterwards . If there is a panic , you pay the bills . Let an internal revolution come , and you are the ones who , unless you have the wit to see that your cause is one with the revolutionists ' , will be called out to ' put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ? all honor to you for it ? the burden-bearers . And in your ignorance you are needlessly making them heavier . Heavier they will be , too , before they are lighter . The store that once kept your family in comfort is being elbowed by price-manipulation , restricted credit , and favoritism to the chains of big establishments . Your snug practice , legal or medical , is challenged by the hordes of fledgling professionals crowded out of the academic nest each June by the popular delusion that a laity can support a swarm of practitioners on its bodies and estates Ia whom it is well-nigh outnumbered . The frontier has vanished . To ' go west ' to-day is to exchange a battlefield where you can fight among friends for a battlefield exactly like it except that you must fight among strangers . The schooling which once equipped your children for their grapple with life now delivers them over to he mercy of any employer whom the fierce necessities of competition force to coin their youth and their ambition into his narrow margins of profit . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it escapes defilement , it is thinned by artificial standards of living which arc fast reducing wives and children to the position of luxuries for the few . Your city children marry late , if at all ; and the children they think they can afford are half the number they would normally desire . Meanwhile , the manufacturers are bracing open the gates to Southern European immigration , partly because it is cheaper to produce wares with low-priced human machines than with higher-priced patented machines , ? in many cases invented but uninstalled until an alarmed middle class , scenting the danger , shuts off the supply , ? and partly in terror of the truth , that once this influx ceases , the now fluid racial and class alignments will solidify and gripe our national vitals with a class-struggle , within a generation . Rather than face the gale and live it out , they are willing to run before it at the cost of shattering the vessel on a lee shore . The competitive tide of this lower standard of living is pitilessly creeping up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the vain assurance that it will crawl no higher , and protest desperately against a thing known to you as the high cost of living . And you lend a credulous car to any politician with contempt enough for your intelligence to assure you that it can be mended by tariff-revision , currency reform , restriction of immigration , control of trusts , or any or all of these , including an underdone hash of economic compromises styled Progressivism . Now it happens that the procession is already moving at a rate which leaves none too much time for a middle class to put itself at the head of it . Those who were complaining six years ago that it was moving at glacier speed are now complaining that it is moving like an avalanche . For every great revolution is preceded by a period of unrest which generates its own momen- tum . The symptoms of these birth-throes are always the same : challenge of betrayed stewardships and a pitching of traditions into the dust-bin . Cromwell was a child of revolution , not a father . The skeptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impromptu cannoneer ' ; an academic discussion of the rights of man primed those muskets at Lexington ; yet in this hour which makes the most supreme demand on your patriotism since those decades of anti-slavery agitation which kindled the fires of the sixties , you are braying yourselves hoarse over professional baseball . It is cold comfort to be told by historians that the middle class defied the Pope in the fifteenth century and won the greatest revolution in history ; it cut off the head of Charles I in 1649 and of Louis XVI in 1793 ; it won the American War of Independence ; finally , only a generation ago , it fought the Civil War ' , for this may mean merely that disputes which might have been settled by your brains had to be settled by your blood ; that an alert social conscience might have avoided that ghastly river of slaughter through which we have always been wading to justice and ' peace .

' Nor should this be construed to impugn the character and good intentions of our recent immigrants . For whatsoever vandalism they engender , we shall have the neglect and oppression of them , permitted by you under our own government in our own mill cities , to thank .

' Who that has seen the streets of a city in strike-time patrolled like an armed camp , can rid his brain of that pestering image of society as the fool dancing on the crust ? Also , it is one of history 's axioms that the social order which conceives change as least likely is the most liable to change . The poor know what they want . The rich know what . they do not want . You ? hardly know that a dispute is going on .

' Ministers , in moments of candor , have confessed their distress at having to recognize that parishioners who conform to every traditional test of righteousness , ' people you ca n't help loving , ' nevertheless stand in some public relation to the community in which they are not only obstructionists but actively mischievous . No amount of willingness to do the right thing will get the right thing clone , so long as the huge mass of these well-intentioned people is conscientiously bent on the wrung thing .

I am forced to remind you that the political refugees in the Plymouth Colony , to whom you owe whatsoever free institutions have been spared to you by nineteenth-century industrialism , warmly applauded their English brethren for beheading a monarch on whose behalf a large slice of horrified middle class ? your own prototypes ? urged that identical plea . If a Stuart king 's was an acute case requiring a desperate remedy , what assurance have we that a powerful monarch , who had achieved the wedlock of the domestic virtues and the deleted material of silence , quite as universal and far more effective than the conspiracy of silence which you delude yourselves into believing has concealed the facts of sex from your children .

Besides , butte ticket-seller and manager might , in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary , be able to persuade themselves that the storm would blow ? ? ? - er . Do not suppose , therefore , that it will be easy to obtain the kind of information you need from the three great organs of public instruction ? the colleges , the churches , and the newspapers .

When I speak of the churches , I speak not of the clergymen but of their congregations , ? of you , to be explicit . In a time when prophets and righteous men have discovered that , rich and poor , scholar and deck-hand , we are all lost or all saved together , and that the surest path to salvation is to forget that you have a soul in making the lot of your fellow man such that he can seek salvation , ? by the same path , ? your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own souls .

The ministers , poor fellows , are bursting with this message ? if you would only untie the gag . To their everlasting honor be it acknowledged that they are , as it is , blowing up in their pulpits and resigning at the rate of about one a week . They see that the church has , in the moral life of the community , only a veto power . It can no longer enact , or enforce . As with the doctor , we have made the minister a tradesman .

The doctors have discovered that the way to eradicate disease is not to cure but to prevent it . The ministers have begun to 10 A MESSAGE TO THE MIDDLE CLASS take the hint from medicine . They have begun to suspect t hat the way to eradicate sin and suffering is not to wash souls for the next world but to provide tubs for t he taking of a daily bath in this . Yet when our tradesman minister tries to substitute sin-prevention for the sin-cure which was generally fashionable at the end of the nineteenth century , we quite naturally complain that this is not the article we bargained for , and buy our wares of another tradesman who keeps the kind we use . The formula for this transaction is : ' Stick to the gospel and let business alone . ' The pinch is that the extra bathtubs for souls in this world would have to be paid for out of the dividend checks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the church people who defeated the housing ordinance . Besides , a congregation , well knowing that a business run on strictly Christian principles would , as things are , last about fifteen minutes , so resents the exposure of this connived-at imposture that a minister courageous enough to proclaim practical Christianity does so fully realizing that t he consequence may be dismissal . The one thing middle-class Christians most resent is Christianity . Nor need you expect to be told of the thunderstorm by your colleges . To expect them to assume a moral leadership which would instantly pitch them into conflict with the rich testator whose favor they are obliged to woo is to expect fire to be wet . For them to plan on building them more stately mansions ? dormitories , chapels , lecture halls ? by attacking the methods whereby their donors accumulated the funds would be to suppose a testatorial magnanimity which the history of will-making does not bear out . It is shrewd comment that the radical clubs in the colleges were started , not by the faculty , but by the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these knowledge factories , but by their customers , who created a demand for goods which had not been on sale . Within the year , the professors of political economy have taken steps to protect their freedom of speech ? the first academic trade-union . Waste no reproaches on the presidents and faculties for having betrayed a stewardship . No more than you or I can they afford to quarrel with their bread-and-butter . The greatest engine of all is the sorriest out of gear . It is not so much that the newspapers are edited from their business offices : it is not so much that they are directly edited by their advertisers . They are edited out of the timidities and prejudices of you , their middle-class readers . If your paper ventured to tell you the obvious truths , that for any able-bodied man or woman to live without working is a crime against society more grave than most of the offences which your judges punish with outrageously disproportionate sentences ; that every penny of wealth is created by the community and rightly belongs to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , you would stop a paper which printed such seditious blasphemies and buy one which told you what you wished to hear . A newspaper-owner is an ordinary man , counseled by the peculiarly public nature of his business to be extraordinarily cautious . It is easy for him to keep friendly with his advertisers since both realize in a tacit cordiality t hat their bread is buttered on the same side . The reporters are overworked , underpaid , and too blas6 with the eternal excitements of their trade to consider what it all means , even if they had the wit to guess . The prophet Isaiah might speak to them with the tongues of men and of angels , and the morning papers would record that the prophet Isaiah also spoke .

When t he interests of the public clash with t he interests of the owners , as they do hundreds of times a day , to suppose that the proprietors will espouse the public cause to the detriment of their own is to suppose that they will behave differently from all the other tradesmen into whose class we have thrust them . The only two parties who know that the newspapers are not to be trusted are the radicals who maintain a none-too-trustworthy press of their own , and a small group of financiers who pay a statistician a high price for a weekly news-service on the understanding that they alone are to have the advantage of acting on the information it contains .

The colleges do not teach it because educated people do not demand it : educated people do not demand it because the colleges have never taught them its importance .

You probably know that your Anglo-Saxon blood has already ceased to predominate in this country . It is not alone that the oligarchy of money is fast reducing you industrially ; but that this property-worship and dividendolatry are sucking t he very blood from the veins of the nat ion , penalizing marriage , killing your children unborn , killing your very race . Do not suppose that these words // spring from hatred of the rich . And do not make the blunder of hating he rich . Lift not your hands to them for help , nor in hatred , for they as impotently move as you or I. Hate the order which made them rich to their poverty , and help them to make an end of it . You have one refuge : to cast in your lot with the under-dog . Unless you accept the leadership , it will pass from von , as it has done before , to another class who are the idealists . Their need has made them so . They stretch hands to you for help . Make no mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think twice . All your traditions , all your teaching , all your ambitions have bidden you . tspire to the estate just above you . The only refuge from capitalism which the capitalist has offered you is to become a capitalist . The prize which has been dangled just beyond your fist is the contemptible existence of living wit bout working . You have always been taught that once you had scrambled through the doorway to the employing and owning class you would he safe . You have seen that . doorway contract . You have seen it grow harder and harder for your sons to fight their way in ; you have seen the sons of those already in thrust out . You have seen the struggle turn murderous . They arc still telling you that your only refuge from the mire of poverty lies in getting in . Does it ever occur to you that your only hope lies in exactly the opposite direction ? in keeping out , in persuading others to keep out , and in joining forces with the plundered and the outcast ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to tithe sides with the oppressed , your unlooked-for reward would be a sudden and overwhelming power to end oppression ? Does it ever occur to you that , once you joined forces with thepoor ( who , you have been told , can not help you ) , together you would be suddenly invincible and need no longer dread each other , ? nor the rich , nor poverty ? VI Golden pour of summer sunshine over Elmport : churchbells booming their solemn noonday- jubilation ; sunlight and shadows of foliage flickering on the white walls of the ancient houses ; blue-coated veterans marching with faces stern and set ; ' Lawrence Police ' on the badges of the constabulary ; and , over the empty , silent mill , flowing gallantly to the noon breeze , in bitter mockery , ? the national colors . I had journeyed to Elmport to see an old New England town celebrate its great national holiday of political liberty during a struggle for industrial liberty . I had seen the foreign immigrants eager , interested , and respectful , - if a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That protest was a bit absurd . But there was in it a deeper pang , an ache of pathos which struck to the heart . It was so well meant . It was so utterly beside the point . A town piteously bewildered . It knew t hat . a justice of the superior court and a saintly bishop were stockholders in the Elmport port mill , and that . therefore the strikers must be in the wrong . The townspeople were saying to the ( which had accepted the leadership which they them- ; wires had rejected ) : ' You challenge our institutions . We answer your challenge by pointing to our flag , ? the flag for which , in tears and agony , we gave our young sons to death in battle half a cent ury ago . Our eyes are full of angry tears , and our hearts are full of bitterness at your insult . For the future , affront this flag at your peril ! ' Such was the reply at . Elmport . Such is the reply of that old New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnifying lens . Such is the reply of the American middle class from ocean to ocean . It clues not understand . It will not sympathize . It can only intensely resent . And now let me tell you the answer of radicalism to the middle class . It is the basement of the Belgian hall in Lawrence . Overhead , a strike meeting is in progress . Except for its occasional thunders , down here all is order and quiet . At a long table , thirty children are eating their evening meal . They are saying nothing because most of them are too little to talk , and if they could , there are hardly any two who could understand each other 's tongues . Every morsel they are tucking into their tiny mouths is the gift of a family in some other New England mill city which has gone without in order to be able to send it . A strike-leader , who had been haranguing the meeting , came downstairs from the hall above , flushed with denunciation . Something in the communal aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children sat in the deepening dusk eating the bread of sacrifice , brought a quick gush of tears to his eyelids . He turned away murmuring , Is this as near to the brotherhood of man as we can come ? ' Dear friends , would it not be better to stop calling this radicalism ? Would it not be better to call it the good news of that kind elder brother of us all , the carpenter of Nazareth ?
