txt The mass of information and mar chinery of organization that made possible the Citizens ' Preparedness Parade of Saturday will not follow to the dump the thousand cubic yards of rubbish which the street cleaners swept up after ithe million watchers of the parade had gone home . At least one permanent body with preparedness for its purpose has grown from the parade , and it may , be that a body as big as the parade itself will be formed . The new society le the Insurance Club , formed from the insurance division of the parade , which mustered more than 8,000 marchers . George T. Wilson of the Equitable is the President of this club . " I do n't know what the Parade Committee will do , " Mr. Wilson said last night , " but we insurance men have made plans to keep our organization and to work for preparedness . We have appointed a Committee on Program to report this week . We may affiliate with the Home Defense League . If the Parade Executive Committee decided to make itself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing is certain , however  --  the Insurance Club has come to stay , and will do something definite and lasting for the defense of America . " C. R. Clifford , another member of the Parade Executive Committee , hopes that the Parade Committee will effect a permanent organization , and pointed out yesterday that this committee , in organizing seventy or more industries and professions , had acquired data concerning the sentiments of more than 200,000 men ? an invaluable aid to preparedness . " At the last meeting of the Executive Committee on May 10 , " side Mr. Clifford yesterday , " the spiri eemed to be that their work should not end with a parade . When Mr. Sherrill refused an invitation to a. testimonial dinner he said he was only one of 200 men who had made the parade possible , and suggested that the executives of the parade have a dinner in honor of no one . George T. Wilson was made Chairman of the Dinner Committee and is arranging for the gathering . " Just think , there are 200 men banded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about seventy-two callings . They can check up not only the name of every man who marched , but they have the name of every man who did not march and why . ! This is vital information , And It would seem a great pity if the men having this information were not held together in a permanent organization . I hope and believe that the organization of the ? executives of the parade will follow the dinner . " Continuing his discussion of the ? parade , Mr. Clifford touched upon the part of the politicians in the movement . " In getting up the parade , " said Mr. Clifford , " we did not have to contend much with lack of enthusiasm for preparedness , but we did have to contend ; with skepticism . We were constantly met with the queries : ' What Is back of It all ? Where is the politics in it ? ' And we had the hardest kind of a Job keeping politics and the politicians out of the parade . I could tell you what politicians tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of us dared go to lunch with a politician or to be seen on the street with one . " Colonel Sherrill yesterday touched upon the attempts of the politicians to use the parade . " From the very beginning we were resolved that ours should be a nonpartisan demonstration of constructive patriotism and not in any sense ' a criticism of anybody or anything . Notwithstanding many attempts to give the movement a partisan character , we carried out our purpose . All banners contrary to our policy were removed from the column and the men marched solely for adequate preparedness . " But do n't let us forget that it took six whole weeks of hard work by hundreds of men to put this great demonstration on the street , and yet we did not equip or provision or transport a single man . This proves that those who say that a citizen army of 1,000,000 men is available overnight are talking political bosh. r ' It is a patriotic pleasure to be able to deny all rumors that our GermanAmerican fellow-citizens were hostile to the parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the leading German language newspapers in the city indorsed the parade . " Secretary Roger W. Allen , speaking of the parade , said : " It accomplished everything we expected it to accomplish . It compelled the country to take cognizance of the almost universal demand for adequate preparedness . The parade did not constitute this demand , it only voiced it . The fact that so many men-180,000 , more or less  --  paraded for preparedness is not ate whole story by any means . Their coming out was only a demonstration of the sentiment of the city and ' nation . " Mr. Allen said also that a probable surplus in the treasury of the parade association would be contributed to the Plattsburg Training Camp Association . After the parade 400 street cleaners worked from 10 P. M. until 1 A. M. and removed 1,000 cubic yards of rubbish . " And listen to this . " said Commissioner Fetherston yesterday .

Boy Scouts distributed membership application blanks , and it was announced yesterday that they obtained 20,000 , members .
