 |p674  WHEN Canning uttered his famous declaration in the House of Commons that he would call in the new world to redress the balance of the old , he little thought how that declaration would be carried out . We have entered the war and we are now engaged in the great effort to redress the balance of the old world . It will be remembered that the last Presidential election turned and was decided upon the assertion that the President had kept the peace and that he would continue to keep the peace . Many Democrats , I think , voted for the Republican candidate , but many more Republicans voted for Mr. Wilson on the sole ground that he had kept the peace ; and although the margins in many States were narrow , the result was decisive . The President , on the 18th of December , almost immediately after the assembling of Congress , sent to the powers , the other nations of the world , what was known as the " peace note , " which seemed to be the logical deduction from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanced that the note appeared almost simultaneously with Germany 's first attempt to bring about some sort of German peace ? an unlucky coincidence . The President followed up his note by an address to the Senate in favor of a league for peace , what might be called a peace plan . That was on January 22 , 1917 . Both the peace note and the peace plan brought forth much criticism and caused but little satisfaction here . It is not , therefore , without interest in this connection to consider for a mo-  |p675  ment their reception in Germany , which does not seem to have accorded entirely with the enthusiasm of Count Bernstorff , who , in a New York newspaper , compared the President 's note to the Star of Bethlehem . There has recently been published a book entitled " My Four Years in Germany , " by Mr. Gerard , which is very interesting and very instructive as to the effect of the President 's position in the winter of 1916-1917 upon German opinion . It appears from Mr. Gerard 's book that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German press ? and I suppose Germans generally , although that does not matter ? all felt that after the election carried upon the peace issue and after the President 's peace note there was no possibility of the United States going into the war ; that neither the President could advise war nor that the people would follow him into war if he should advise it . They were also dissatisfied with the " peace plan " because it was not in every respect as consonant with German plans and as thoroughly friendly to Germany as they expected and desired it to be . @# THIS attitude of the German mind is an interesting illustration of the point at which the Germans have been curiously inefficient ? their utter failure to form any just judgment of the psychology of other nations . They were perfectly confident that England would not come into the war . They believed England to be on the verge of civil war , and it broke on them with a shock of tremendous surprise when England went unitedly into the war upon the invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar surprise was occasioned in Germany when we acted and went to war with practical unanimity . I do not think that the fact of this German belief in our determination to have peace at any price was decisive of their action ; I believe that they would have taken the same action in any event , but they were , nevertheless , proceeding upon that belief . They followed up the President 's plan for peace by declaring a new submarine zone , and stated in their note  |p676  to us that we could send one ship , painted as nearly as one could make out like a barber 's pole , once a week to some given port , but that with this insulting exception they were going to make the new submarine campaign ruthless and all-destructive . The Chancellor stated that this new campaign had been delayed merely because they were waiting until they had completed a sufficient number of submarines . We realize now just what that statement meant . It meant that the assurances which they had given to this country after the Sussex incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false , and that they knew them to be false and meant them to be so ; that they had no idea of carrying out any one of those assurances . Therefore , when they issued their declaration of the new zone they , of course , broke all the assurances which they had given this country , and thereupon the President severed relations with Germany on the third of February , 1917 . The Congress was then drawing toward its last days . It was a period of very deep anxiety and very severe strain , because it was not at all clear what we were going to do . The President asked for authority from Congress to arm merchantmen . A bill for that purpose passed the House and came to the Senate in the closing days of February . It was reported unanimously from the Foreign Relations Committee , but in the Senate a resistance in the form of parliamentary obstruction developed on the part of a small group of Senators who have since , with a few exceptions , been resisting or seeking to injure directly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were in the last day of the session , the cloture could not be applied ; there was not time for it and there was , therefore , no method of giving the President by law the authority asked for . I was inclined myself to agree with him that he could have armed the merchantmen without specific authority from Congress . The importance of Congressional action , it seemed to me then , was that in this way we gave the crews of merchantmen and all men on board a military status and took them out of the possibility of being treated as pirates . There was a defect in our ex/ isting laws which ought to have been covered . But however that may be , the bill failed and Congress adjourned . The President at first was inclined not to call the new Congress until the last possible moment . There were three large , regular appropriation bills which went over , and this made it necessary in any event to summon Congress before the end of the fiscal year , which was June 30 , 1917 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German government , and on the 21st of March the President called Congress in extraordinary session . Congress convened on the 2nd of April , 1917 , and the President came before the houses that same evening and delivered the message which all the world read , a most admirable message and a very powerful statement of the American case . Four days later Congress passed the war resolution declaring that a state of war existed with Germany , and it was at once signed by the President . HOW HAY INJURED THE COUNTRY-GARRISON 'S RESIGNATION AS I have been to a certain extent a participant in what has happened since that time , I may be permitted to call attention to the conditions we in Congress were obliged to meet and to what we have done . It is to be remembered , in the first place , that we were practically wholly unprepared . There was a strong movement for preparation immediately after the war in Europe opened in 1914 . At that time the President discountenanced the movement and referred to those who were urging preparation as nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and he made , as you will recall , a tour through the country strongly urging preparation . The Secretary of War had a plan for increasing the regular army , having what he termed a " continental army " as a reserve of 400,000 men , and also for making large expenditures for munitions . Unfortunately , the chairman of the House Military Committee , Mr. Hay of Virginia , who has since been made a judge , had held that position for many years , and had always resisted doing anything for the proper increase of the regular army . He , too , had a characteristic  |p678  plan which really did nothing , and the President accepted Mr. Hay 's plan . This resulted in the retirement of Mr. Garrison from the Cabinet . I think that I am speaking within bounds when I say that Mr. Hay by his policy did more injury to this country at a great crisis than any one man I have ever known of in either branch of Congress . Therefore , when war was declared two precious years had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the army . Even the regular army appropriation bill for this year had not been passed on March 4 . It was one of the bills which had gone over . The navy fared better . The chairman of the House Committee on Naval Affairs is Mr. Padgett of Tennessee ; he has been for many years chairman of that committee , has a remarkable knowledge of everything connected with the Navy and is a very wise and liberal-minded man . Mr. Padgett in 1916 prepared a bill which had in it a good deal of legislation in addition to the appropriations , and in due course it came over to the Senate . It so happened that I was one of the sub-committee of two to whom the bill was referred , and as the full committee adopted the bill without a change , and as the Senate subsequently adopted the committee bill without a change , I think I may say that Senator Swanson of Virginia , who , owing to the illness of Senator Tillman , was the acting chairman of the committee ( and to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really framed the Senate amendments , two hundred and fifty in number . I mention this merely because I am trying to show what happened to the navy and what a benefit even this one year of preparation proved to be . SWEEPING NAVAL PREPARATIONS THE Naval Bill of 1916 was really a great legislative measure with incidental appropriations . We legislated for the Naval Reserve ; we created the naval militia ; we provided for taking over in time of war the revenue cutter service and the coast survey service . We revised the law in regard to the personnel of the Navy , regulating promo/ tions , and a vast mass of other detail legislation , all making for the preparation of the Navy . We appropriated $313 , - 000,000 , covering the largest programme ever made in this country , and as large , I think , as has ever been made in almost any country for a single year , and it seemed at that moment a very large amount . Today it seems very moderate . That bill passed in August , 1916 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation in it , for not much was needed , but we increased the appropriations . We gave the President $150,000,000 for the purchase of submarine chasers and patrol boats and to expedite the building of vessels already contracted for , and we made further large authorizations . This bill appropriated over $500,000,000 It was the 3rd of March when that bill became law , only a month before war was declared . The other bill was passed less than a year before . Yet the fact that even this amount of preparation had been made has been of inestimable value . And if you will pause a moment to think you will recall how little has been said about preparation in the Navy since the war began and comparatively little money voted ? I say comparatively ? a good many hundred millions have been added , but comparatively it has been little . The Navy was able to move at once . Before April , 1917 , had expired we had destroyers on the coast of Ireland , and we have been adding to them steadily , until now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the water . There has been a great deal done in Congress in addition to this . Great powers have been granted to the President , necessary powers , as I think , wisely granted , as I hope . The part of the work with which I came in closest contact was that which fell upon Congress , the work which Congress was called upon to do and which could be done only by Congress . Congress has its defects ; nobody is more aware of that than I ; but sometimes it is without reason made a pack-horse for every fault that can be found or imagined . The newspapers steadily charged Congress with intolerable delay and that we were wasting time in discussions . The  |p680  best answer to this charge is to state what Congress actually has accomplished . I might say in addition that Mr. Balfour and the heads of other missions who were here spoke not only in praise , but with wonder at the amount that was accomplished in Congress , and the newspapers , I think in getting impatient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass and ought not to have passed without discussion bills which entirely revolutionized what we are pleased to call our constitutional privileges and rights , and that it was inevitable and proper that there should be some discussion about them . Delays , grievous delays , there have been , but not in the legislative branch of the Government . WHAT CONGRESS HAS ACCOMPLISHED N OW as to this question of Congressional delay . This is what the Congress has actually done since the declaration of war on the 6th day of April , 1917 . We first passed a general deficiency appropriation act appropriating $163,000 , - 000 , of which $100,000,000 was for national security and defense and for each and every purpose connected with the war . We passed an act authorizing the issue of bonds to meet measures for national security . This act appropriated $3 , - 000,000,000 for establishing credits for foreign governments and $2,000,000,000 to meet domestic expenditures , and a certain additional amount to consolidate and take up some small outstanding loans . We passed an act giving an additional midshipman to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriation act carrying $223,000 , - 000 for the support of the army for the regular fiscal year . We passed an act authorizing the President to increase temporarily the military establishment of the United States ? this was the act which authorized the selective draft of a million men ? and there was a great deal of subsidiary legislation connected with it . Members will recall that it took England and Canada some three years to pass conscription acts . We passed a resolution authorizing the President to take over for the United States shipping owned in whole or in part  |p681  by any corporation , citizen or subject of any nation with which the United States may be at war . This covered the German vessels , something over 500,000 tons . They are now all in the service , practically , and serving as transports for our troops . We passed an act to increase the commission and warrant an enlisted strength of the Navy from 87,000 to 150,000 men and of the Marine Corps from 17,000 to 30,000 . We passed the regular act making appropriations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Risk Insurance Act ; and then the regular act appropriating $147 , - 000,000 for the sundry civil expenses . We passed the deficiency bill appropriating S3,281,000,000 for the military and naval establishments , and this act appropriated , among other things , $405,000,000 for an emergency shipping fund . We passed an act to punish acts of interference with foreign relations , known as the Espionage Bill . It contained really twelve different bills which had been introduced on these subjects , consolidated into one measure . We passed an act ? I am leaving out many small ones ? appropriating $640,000 , - 000 to increase temporarily the Signal Corps of the army and to purchase , manufacture , maintain , prepare and operate airships ; and also an act in connection with it authorizing the United States to take possession of a site for a permanent aviation station . We passed the River and Harbor Bill , carrying $27,000 , - 000 , which looks very moderate at this time . We passed an act enlarging the Interstate Commerce Commission . An act appropriating $11,346,400 to stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuel Act , appropriating S162 , - 500,00o for the conservation of food products and fuel . N act to authorize an additional issue of war bonds ; a second bond issue under which the second loan was made . That act made an additional appropriation of $4,000 , - 000,000 to extend credit in the United States to our Allies and  |p682  for the expenses incident to the preparation and issue of bonds and certificates ; and it authorized an additional issue of $3,000,000,000 of bonds to meet the loans to foreign governments ( that covers the $3,000,000,000 of the first act ) and an additional issue of one-year certificates of indebtedness beyond the $2,000,000,000 and an issue of five-year war-saving certificates , making $5,000,000,000 , carrying all together $7,000,000,000 of new loans up to the third issue . We passed an act appropriating $5,650,000,000 to supply deficiencies in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1918 . This is the largest appropriation act ever passed by this or any other country . We passed an act to define , regulate and punish trading with the enemy , and for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trading With the Enemy Act , " a very important act . We passed an act to provide revenues to defray war expenses and for other purposes . This provides approximately $2,500,000,000 of revenue to defray the expense of Government . That is the Tax Bill , of which I shall say a word presently . We passed an act to provide a military and naval family allowance , compensation and insurance fund , known as the Soldiers ' Insurance Act . We passed an act authorizing the Shipping Board to license the use of vessels of foreign registry and construction for the coastwise trade for the period of the war , and one hundred and twenty days thereafter . Some of the important legislation enacted by Congress in 1918 includes the Civil Rights Bill ; increasing midshipmen at the Naval Academy ; the Post Office Appropriation Bill ; continuing the President 's one hundred million dollar appropriation ; the bill to call the Philippine forces into the service ; the bill to amend the Espionage Act to punish persons obstructing Liberty Loan issues and recruiting ; the Agriculture Appropriation Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill to extend the provisions of the Espionage Act to include women alien enemies and to provide for internment ; the Railroads ' Control Bill ; the Legislative , Executive and Judicial Appropriation Bill ; the ordnance testing in the Navy , appropriating  |p683  a million dollars for this purpose ; the bill authorizing the third Liberty Loan issue ; the bill creating military zones around shipyards ; the War Finance Corporation Bill ; the bill appointing three Assistant Secretaries of War , and many other smaller bills of significant value to the war policies of the Nation . THE BILL THAT CAUSED THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY THE bill which caused the greatest difficulty and consumed the most time was the revenue bill . Bills to spend money and bills to borrow money reaching into the billions passed in a few days , and sometimes in a few hours . There was no opposition to either spending or borrowing in Congress or in the country so far as we could see . But when it came to imposing taxes the scene changed and cheerfulness and unanimity disappeared . The bill came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1917 , and the Committee on Finance , of which I happened to be a member , had that bill for over two months in committee , meeting every day for six or seven hours a day , literally every day . We then had three weeks of debate in the Senate , where there were differences of opinion which had not appeared before on the bond bills and the appropriation bills , and it then went to conference , where it remained for nearly three weeks , and which was the most disagreeable part of the whole business . The House appeared to be obstinate ; the Senate , of course , was firm . The result was a great deal of debate , which filled whole days for three weeks , including Sundays . The result is that we imposed upon this country for the fiscal year 1917 , including the taxes already imposed by existing law , between $3,800,000,000 and $4,000,000,000 , a larger sum to take from a people in taxation than has ever been attempted by any nation in the world . I was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went beyond the line of safety in the taxation of profits and of incomes ; and I am afraid we have done so , but we had great difficulty in holding the rates at the figures established by the committee .  |p684  To give an idea of what these taxes amount to , the percentage of expenditures to be raised by direct taxation was 36.02 per cent . The highest proportion of taxes to loans in providing for expenditures in time of war was in the last year of our Civil War , when we raised as much as 30 per cent . of the expenditures by taxation . We are now raising 36.02 per cent. , and the percentage to be met by Government obligations is 63.98 per cent . The percentage raised by direct taxation by other countries involved in the present war , was after three years of war : It is , of course , sound finance to take a large proportion of the expenditures from taxation , but this principle can easily be carried too far ; can , in fact , be made ruinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overlook was the fact that it was essential to our financial stability and success to keep business as productive and active as possible . For that purpose you must have a certain surplus , so that business can extend and maintain itself . You also must look to that same surplus for all your loans . There was nothing else to do , nowhere also to go for money . It required a great effort and a strong contest in the Senate to defeat a proposition to put a tax of 76 per cent . flat on all profits , war profits and peace profits alike , so we have not been as excessive as some people desired , because there were members of both House and Senate who thought this was an excellent time to seize upon " criminal wealth . " Men , munitions and money are the essential things . We have the money ; the munitions are beginning to come in . I will give one example which will give an idea of what lack of preparation means . The departments came in on the 2nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates for the com/ ing year , $5,563,000,000 , and we passed our original revenue bill , which was confined to war profits , on those figures . Twenty days later the heads of departments came in with additional estimates for appropriations reaching nearly six billions . When the last appropriation bill had passed , between the time that it came to the Senate and while the Senate Committee had it under consideration for a report , they brought in $700,000,000 additional estimate . One item let me speak of as an illustration . We had been told in past years that we were well off in field artillery . They came before us ? General Crozier , the head of the Ordnance Department , and others ? when these great estimates came in , additional estimates , and informed us that for an army of a million men we needed 16,000 pieces of field artillery , the bulk of them 3S , which correspond to the French 75s ; but all kinds , including mortars up to as heavy as 9-inch guns , which would take a year to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only enough to train our troops here , and when war was declared , no shells to speak of . Of course this lack of preparedness has increased the expenditure enormously because everything has to be done in such haste and in the most expensive way , but still slowly , with much stumbling and confusion , it is being clone . THERE MUST BE NO PEACE ON THE STATUS QUO ANTE BELLUM BEFORE concluding , one word about the situation as it appears to us in Washington . It is the intention of the President and the administration at this time , I know , to carry this war through , and that is the intention of the overwhelming majority in Congress , the settled purpose of many who were very reluctant to go to war , as well as of many who thought we ought to have gone to war long before the time when we did . The Government , Congress and President mean to carry the war through . Yet , we see the newspapers filled with talk about peace , which all comes directly or indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is accidentally very like what the Germans are suggesting . We have had a note from the Pope , we have had resolutions in Congress , and we have had a great deal of general irresponsible talk about peace . This talk all proceeds with slight variations on the basis of the status quo ante bellum . To my mind ? and I know this is the view of the administration ? every man , the President who delivered the war message and Congress who voted for war , would be guilty of the blackest crimes if they were willing to make a peace on the status quo ante bellum and recreate the situation which existed before the war . If we send our armies and our young men abroad to be killed and wounded in Northern France and in Flanders with no result but this , our entrance into war with such an intention was a crime which nothing can justify . The intent of Congress and the intent of the President was that there could be no peace until we could create a situation where no such war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of the status quo ante bellum simply means that Germany will have a breathing space and the whole horror will come over again , with the chance that we shall not be all united as we are now . We must have peace with victory , complete victory ; no other will stand or be worth having . The President in his letter to the Pope stated what is the absolute truth ? that we have no one now we can negotiate with . We can not negotiate with a government which has declared that treaties are scraps of paper , to be torn up when it feels like it . We can not make peace in the ordinary way . We can not , in the first place , make peace except in company with our Allies . There may be no written conventions or treaties , but it would brand us with everlasting dishonor and bring ruin to us also if we undertook to make a separate peace . Therefore , there is only one alternative , and that is to bring Germany to her knees and force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make the world safe ? not merely safe for democracy , but safe for all the Allied free countries to pursue their own way in security and work out their own salvation .  |p687  If we had not gone into this war and Germany had won it we should have been compelled to fight alone . We must win the war ; we shall win this war . Of the final result I have no sort of doubt . But the feeling in Congress ? I mean of the great majority of both houses ? is that the discussion of of any peace at all or any argument for peace is little short of hostility to the United States and is distinctly helpful to Germany . I am sure that such is the feeling of the administration ? as sure as I can be of anything which has been directly told me . This is the situation in which the country stands today ; this is the legislation which Congress has passed .                  @ @ @
