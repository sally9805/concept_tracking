SIR ? Are there not reasons to fear that our State universities are allowing themselves to be flattered , persuaded , and driven into attempting much more than any human institutions can successfully perform ? Instead of devoting themselves to one definite and all important but difficult task , the traditional task of universities since there have been universities , these institutions must now have , or pretend to have , a hand in the business of everybody . Knowledge is power ; the State university is the home of knowledge , therefore , the State University must make it its direct and immediate business to see that everything in the State which maintains it goes right , from the drawing up and enforcement of laws , to the installation of sewerage systems in all the small towns of the State , and the instructive entertainment of rural communities at country schoolhouses on long winter evenings . Of course , the very last thing in the world that any sensible man would think of arguing is that the State should deny itself the privilege of calling into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , wherever it can find them , provided it can offer them acceptable terms , and conditions under which they can do their work with decent effectiveness But all men , including even university presidents and professors , are of limited powers The man who spends himself in delivering university extension lectures , serving on commissions , and helping to whip legislation into some kind of tolerable shape before it is placed upon the statute books of the State , can not also spend himself in teaching his classes made up of students in residence at the university . One of the very worst results produced by this spreading out of the State universities is that it is uniting with many other agencies to bring into discredit the " mere teacher . " It may be said , indeed , that there probably never was a time in the history of higher education when the university Professor as a type was more respected than he is to-day , in this country , at any rate . That is true , no doubt But he is respected because he serves on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads some movement which makes a dramatic appeal to the public attention , or perhaps merely excites and keeps excited the news instinct of the reporter for the daily press . He is not respected as a good teacher , or even as a teacher at all If the good teacher is indeed a disappearing type in university faculties , it is because the east wind of discouragement is blowing him out of the profession Even the man or woman of fine character has some natural longing for the substantial rewards of life for the public respect , and for appreciation of intelligent and devoted service , shown in such ways as those in which it is given to university administrative officers to indicate such appreciation , for example Not the least of the evils wrought by this tendency towards undue expansion into the fields of the world , indeed , is its mischievous influence on the ambitions of members of the university faculty . The men who become accustomed to the idea that academic glory and newspaper renown are to be won , not by teaching , but by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value to the importance of getting themselves numbered among those who are " doing things " even within the limits of the university world . Among no class of men will you hear more talk about " executive ability " than among the senior members of a college faculty , nowhere will you see more wise yet troubled shaking of the head when it becomes a question as to whether Mr. A. is really qualified , by virtue of his executive ability , to fill some pettily higher Position in the faculty than he now holds . Can it be that the cause of the evil here under discussion is to be found in an altogether wrong attitude of the public towards the State university ? We read with admiration of the sacrifices made by the early settlers in many parts of this country in order that the men and women who grew up there might be educated . When these early settlers founded schools and colleges , they were not thinking of immediate economic gain . Nor did they imagine that they were constructing a machine through which directly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society that call for a little knowledge out of the ordinary In founding institutions of learning , of every grade , these pioneers were , above all things , giving evidence of their belief in the value of a man For ' many Years now , that pseudo-philosophical thinking which has had the ear of the respectable world , and has , in particular , dominated the notions regarding matters social and political that have found expression in American academic circles , has systematically depreciated the importance of the individual man , and has cried up that of society , of man in the mass Can it be that the public has at last in living fact come to accept this doctrine , and that it no longer believes in the supreme value of the individual man , the one real human unit , and the proper subject of all our concern ? However this may be , the members of the faculties of- State universities have in recent years been made disagreeably aware that the questions in which the authorities are really interested , and therefore , supposedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How successful have you been in starting the young men and women who have sat under your instruction in the paths of sound thinking ? How deeply have you instilled into them respect for the truth , and the determination to let their conduct be guided by the best understanding of things as they actually are that we can at present attain , rather than by long current and mistaken no- , tons presenting them as they have been supposed to be ? Have you done the utmost that in you lies so to direct the thinking of these young people that they will hereafter make it a chief business of their lives to form clear ideas as to what Justice is , and what it demands in specific human relationships , and be constantly loyal to the obligation to help those ideas prevail in the world ? No , the interest of the public in the operations of State universities is apparently to be gauged by questions like these ' How many more students have you turned out  --  the correct phrase , ? this year than last ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get here , by every device humanly employable , so that you can turn them out next year , and next year , and the year after that ? How many hundred university extension lectures have the members of your faculty delivered in the State during the past year ? How many hundred correspondence students have been induced to add their names to your roll of students ? How many hours a day does each member of your faculty work ? What have you done for the butter-makers of the State ? the cheese-makers ? the fruit-growers ? Above all , what have you done for the farmers ? Finally , have you used every means in your power to keep the newspapers of the State talking about you , always remembering that it does not much matter what you have them say about you , so long as there is a a large element of brag in it ? Is it true that this sort of thing represents the attitude of the public of the State to the university ? If so , is the fact of good promise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. October 7 A PROTEST . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR We hear a good deal these days about elevating the stage There seems to be a feeling among educated people in general , and a few managers in particular , that the profession is sadly in need of culture and refinement A year or so ago , Mr Daniel Frohman made a plea for the enthusiastic reception of college graduates within our ranks . " The stage will find its best recruits in the universities , " he wrote . or something to that effect . More recently still , Mr. Belasco , bemoaning the absence of real gentlemen qualified to do gentlemen parts , has offered to train a certain number of young actors in this much-neglected art . Is it then true that education and good breeding form a valuable foundation for a stage career , and are Messrs Frohman and Belasco quite sincere in professing to be in search of actors thus equipped ? I confess I am somewhat skeptical on this score , and in view of my own personal experience and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts are justified . To me there is no question but that culture of mind and manner is a handicap in this profession , at least at the start . This wonderful thing called personality that seems so essential in " landing the job " is nothing more nor less , nine times out of ten , than a lack of refined sentiments , an ill-bred . willingness to blow one 's own horn , a callousness to snubs , and , above all , the ability to push one 's self and one 's cause , regardless of means or of consequences . These things the true gentleman , or true lady , will not do . If she has no " pull " she will go with the mob to the agencies to look for her engagement . She will stand in the back , of course , seeing that others are there before her , and so entitled to first consideration . If the door to the agent 's inner office is closed , and marked " Private , " she will not open it . She will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress When her turn comes to speak , her voice will be low , so that she may not attract attention Mr. Agent will , of course , doubt her ability to throw it across the footlights . When asked of her experience , remembering the words of Emerson . " Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar , but is a stab at the health of human society " ? she will tell the truth . Being modest , she will not speak at all of her real achievements By this time , Mr. Agent is quite convinced that she is hopeless as an actress , and shuts off the interview by telling her to come in again And yet  --  and yet , I read and hear constantly that just such men and women are wanted on our stage , men who have studied and travelled , Who speak several languages , who have polished manners and high ideals We regret , I hear it said , that our actors are not more like the English actors in general culture . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and settled for the good of all If we have come to the point where something besides blondined hair and rouged lips seems proof of histrionic talent , let us give these university graduates a trial . If not , let them be discouraged at once and in every possible way , so that they may turn their valuable training into channels where it will bring results . On my tour last season I became acquainted with a member of our company , who had graduated with high honors from Cornell . He spoke French and German fluently , and was also something of a musician He had gentlemanly manners and dignity of bearing He played a very insignificant part remarkably well , and one of my friends in the audience observed him particularly for a certain indescribable something that the others did not have Ou the one occasion when he was called upon as understudy to handle a " fifty-side " part on short notice , he did so without a single error Our stage manager told me it was the best understudy performance he had ever witnessed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years , and during that time has been employed just fifty weeks That is to say , he has had three years of enforced idleness in all , or has worked fifty out of two hundred and eight weeks . Three years spent in elbowing through the crowds on Broadway , in patient waiting for managers who never come , in breathing the vitiated air of their dreary offices . Three beautiful long years of vigorous youth gone , years for which other men in other professions , though struggling , too , no doubt , have certainly something to show . ' LOVELL OLDHAM . New York , October 10 . GENTLEMEN AT THE WICKET . To THE EDITOR OF THE NAr-ION : Sin . I am surprised that no one has replied to your correspondent Mr Baker 's banter , in your issue of October 3 , in regard to " gentlemen " cricketers The expression , " the Gentlemen of " a place or country is a time-honored cricket term , meaning an eleven composed of men who belong to different clubs and are not professionals As there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional cricket teams in this country , and as most matches are Played between clubs , the term is not often used here , but I do not think any other expression takes its place In England the term is familiar to every one , as is also the term " players , " meaning professionals In that delightful book , " The Cricket Field , " written in 1851 , I find the following on pages 63 and 64 of the American edition : In this year ( 1798 ) these gentlemen aforesaid made the first attempt at a Gentlemen and Players ' match , and on this first occasion the players won . There in London the play was nearly all professional : even the gentlemen made a profession of it . Your correspondent 's quotation from Kip-ling is too brief to express the main point , which is not a condemnation of " flannelled youths , " for those are not his words , but of the spectators , who , instead of either fighting their country 's battles , or working , or even playing some manly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men play cricket or football , just as here in America they crowd the bleachers to gaze at hired baseball performers , . who rarely even live in the cities which , they are supposed to represent KiPlIng , addresses the men who let others fight for them in South Africa , and says .

BINNEY Philadelphia , October 12 AMERICAN AND FOREIGN LABOR To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Six Two statements in your recent editorial paragraph against the restriction of immigration ought not to be allowed to . go unchallenged You state , " But American labor will enter certain lines of work on no terms . " As a matter of fact , there is no kind of work which American laborers will not do , if they are paid enough or if the-conditions are made sufficiently attractive In some cases , it is true , there are other than financial conditions involved . The thoroughbred Southerner firmly believes that there are certain kinds of work which a white man will not do on any terms because such work is " niggers ' work . " Yet we know perfectly well that where negro laborers are few white men do this work as cheerfully as any other Similarly , in certain sections where foreign labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that American laborers can not be had on any terms , such work being regarded as " fit only for foreigners . " And yet we know perfectly well that where foreign labor is absent , American laborers do the work cheerfully , if they are paid for it . On the Pacific Coast it is asserted by certain prejudiced people that white men can not be procured to do certain kinds of work , such work being regarded as Chinaman 's work Yet where there are no Chinese there is not the slightest difficulty in getting white men to do , the work , provided satisfactory wages are paid . You also state that " The United States needs immigration more than any other country , because men rise rapidly in the social scale , as they can not elsewhere . " How much we need a man is indicated by how much we are willing to pay him It may be-true that we need an immigrant more than some other countries , as evidenced by the fact that we pay him more Yet the need can not be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day Ifwe had to face the alternative of dispensing with his services or paying $2 per day , and we decided to dispense with his services , that would indicate that we did not need him $2 worth If we did need him very badly , we should obviously be willing to pay him $2 . I know it is customary when the choice is offered of two alternatives to choose both , yet in some cases we can not have both This is a case in point . We have the alternative of industrial peace with high wages , brought about automatically through the operation of supply and demand , or we may have an abundant supply of cheap labor But we can not have both . If we choose to have an abundant supply of cheap labor , we must expect to have the struggle for high wages carried on by revolutionary methods If we choose industrial peace , we must expect to reduce the supply of cheap labor , and have wages forced up automatically through the sheer scarcity of unskilled labor .
