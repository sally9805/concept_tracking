txt The managers of the Eastern railroads I Continued at loggerheads yesterday with ' the associated brotherhoods of trainmen and conductors who launched the present threatening controversy by their demand for higher wages . Neither side gave in an inch , but both sides promised to keep the peace until the arrival here of the members of the new Board of Mediation and Conciliation . Both sides were hoping that at least the head of that board , Judge Chambers , would arrive in New York this afternoon and ' . enter upon his task of bringing the cils-1 putants together , but word came from Washington that he would not be here , till Monday . As to his chances of success , President Seth Low of the National Civic Federation expressed last evening his confidence that the new board would smooth out the tangle . There is Just one big question for the mediators to treat with such powers of conciliation as they may be able to command . Shall the railroad managers be allowed to press their own grievances for arbitration at this time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a matter to be considered by the Board of Mediation and Conciliation . The mediators will find themselves confronted : with the task of bringing together two parties , one of which has issued an ultimatum , while the other has issued no ultimatum . ? Trainmen Stand Their Ground . The chiefs of the brotherhoods ' have said flatly that they would not for a moment consider the admission to arbitration at this time of the managers ' stipulations . They repeated that yesterday . The managers , on the other hand , have not said that they would insist upon the admission of their own grievances as the only condition under which they would accept arbitration , and it was considered highly significant that they let yesterday pass without making any such flat statement . With both sides standing their ground , there was room only for guesswork as I to the outcome of the mediators ' work , but the guess most frequently made was I that the managers would be persuaded ' at least to postpone the pressing to ar-i bitration of their own stipulations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a statement last night from his home at Bedford Hills . There are many points to be discussed relating to the stipulations on which the arbitration will be based , " he said , " and it is the business of the new Board of Mediation and Conciliation , appointed by the President under the Newlands late , to make every effort to bring the parties to an agreement on such Points , for without such an agreement on the stipulations there can be no arbitration . Knowing the members of this board as I do , I am confident of their ability to do this . Both sides , I am informed , will wait the arrival of the board . " While the brotherhood chiefs agreed to await the arrival of the mediators . they made it clear that they were waiting only to see if the mediators could induce the managers to withdraw from the stand taken by them on Wednesday evening , and that if the mediators failed in this there would be a strike without further discussion . To show that they were in earnest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern territory of the critical points in the situation developed this week and directed every member of their Committee of One Thousand to ! stay off railroad duty and as near as possible to the other end of a telegraph wire where an order to act would find him ready . Send Out Strike Warning . The brotherhoods had their committees and sub-committees so organized that , if the Newlands bill had failed to pass last Tuesday , the strike order could have been carried into elect by 6 o'clock that evening , notwithstanding the extensive territory to be covered . Yesterday , the chiefs , through their Committee of One Hundred , which is on duty in this city , sent out instructions through that territory to the 100,000 members of the brotherhoods warning I them to be ready for a strike on less than twenty-four hours ' notice . The relaxation that followed the first news from Washington that the strike danger had been averted had to be counteracted by fresh orders in view of the re , newed danger that the brotherhoods and managers could not agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member yesterday a copy of the managers ' grievances and accompanied each copy with these significant instructions : You will understand that the Managers ' Committee really proposes a reduction in pay for every man now in the service , the greater proportion of such reduction being directed against passenger men and local freight men in the abolition of all monthly guarantees and against yard and road brakemen in . the insistence that the same classification shall be applied to all members ofine crew . Copies of this are being furnished local Chairmen In sufficient numbers for them to see to It that each member and non-member of our class secures a copy at once . It is needless to say that no arbitration embodying these propositions will even be considered , and it insisted upon by the managements , only one result can follow , namely : The setting of the hour for retirement from the service . Local Chairmen will remain out of duty until otherwise instructed by their general Chairmen or the undersigned , and will remain where communication from their general Chairmen by wire or letter will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seth Low of the National Civic Federation arrived at the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Building in East Forty-fifth Street and , in company with Chairman Easley of the federation 's Executive Council , went before the managers to urge them to withdraw ? from consideration at this time the eight stipulations which , the brotherhoods say , will mean a strike If they are pressed . The conference between the managers and the federation 's officers lasted for three hours and after it was over , two letters were issued , one to Mr. Low and one to the chiefs of the brotherhoods . Here is the letter to Mr. Low : July ls. 1913 . Mr. Seth Low , Bedford Hills , N. Y. : My Dear Mr. Low : Replying to your letter of the 17th inst. , and referring to our conference to-day in regard to the question of the arbitration between the conductors and trainmen and the Eastern railroads , represented by the Conference Committee of Managers : Permit us to say first that we appreciate deeply your interest in this matter and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We think that the difference of opinion which seems to have existed between us is the result of a misunderstanding , for it is our purpose to carry out , to the fullest extent , any pledges made by our Presidents , and we are glad to have your assurance that nothing in your letter was intended to charge intentional bad faith .

Very truly yours , CONFERENCE COMMITTEE OF ' MANAGERS . By ELISEA . LEE , Chairman . The threatened strike upon the Erie stayed in the shadow yesterday . The seventy-five commiteernen from among the trainmen and conductors on the three Erie roads met at the Broadway Central Hotel yesterday morning , but the meeting did not last long and resulted in no action . The brotherhood chiefs , confronted with the danger of having to call upon 100,000 men to walk out of the trains and tra.in3. - ards all the way from Maine to the M I River , prefer not to bother wit .. a problem involving only a. few thousand Erie employes , and are holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
