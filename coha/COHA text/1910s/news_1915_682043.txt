txt " Max " Breitung knows at least two of the alleged German spies under arrest in New York , and was on especially friendly terms with Paul Deache. who is said to be a Bavarian officcr . They met at the time the Elronprinzessin Cecilie. with $10,000,000 aboard , turned back when approaching the English coast , and reached Bar Harbor in safety with the treasure at the outbreak of the war . Breitung and Deache were both aboard . The former was going back to Germany to spend his vacation , he Laving been in the United States about two years . Deache and one of the other men , believed to be Scholz , called upon Breitung at the New York office of E. N. Breitung , where he was employed , and sought his aid in buying copper and other supplies . Those facts were obtained today from relatives and business associates of Max Breitung after he had started for New York on the 10:30 o'clock Lake Shore train . Albert Breitung of Chicago , who is a cousin of Max Breitung 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday night at the Stratford Hotel , where the latter was staying . Breitung freely admitted that he knew Daeche and spoke very highly of him . Apparently a strong friendship had sprung up between them , begotten not only of nationality and partisanship , but also of the fact that they were both comparative strangers in a strange land . Stoddard Hancock of New York , also an employe of the Breitung banking house , who has been in Chicago for three months . discus.ed the matter tonight at the Stratford with the utmost frankness . Advised to Return to New York . " I am not a stranger to Chicago , " said he , " for I was formerly in charge of the Chicago branch of the house In the Marquette Building . The branch was closed when the business slump occurred . Late last July I returned to Chicago on business for the firm , and Max has made two or three trips here on the same business . He had been here about a week on this last trip . This morning while eating breakfast I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those New York arrests . I immediately called his room and told him . He came to my room and agreed that the only thing for him to do was to return at once to New York . " While we were discussing it he received a telephone call from E. N. Breitung at Marquette . Mr. Breitung had also read the article and he told Max to go back to New York at once . Max hastily packed his grip and took the Lake Shore train for New York . was not accompanied by any Secret Service agents . He went of his own accord , and I am certain he knows nothing of this matter . " Most certainly he never supplied any money , for , while he is a young banker , the fact remains that he is not a capitalist , and is working for a salary . " Max knew two of these men and liked one of them especially . They met . I believe , aboard the Kronprinzessiu Cecilie . It is entirely possible that Max has known of the purchase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in which many are engaged . " When United States Secret Service men went to the Stratford Hotel this I. orning they learned that Breitung had hurriedly left for New York after a long telephone talk with his cousin , E. ' Si eitung , who was at his Summer home in Marquette , Mich . Coming to be Arrested . " Max Breitung , who is supposed to be a German spy , is my cousin , and he left the Stratford Hotel , Chicago , for New York to hunt up whatever policeman has a warrant for him , " said E. N. Breitung this evening , when asked at Marquette whether he could explain Max Breitung 's alleged connection with German activities in New York . " I am not at al : alarmed over Max 's situation , for I was myself accused of being a German spy and agent . If there is anything at all to give basis for suspicion against Max it will be found to lie in the fact that he may have subscribed money to some fund or other represented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day , just as I left New York , to a fund for buying tobacco for German prisoners in war camps . I ca n't swear that the money was used for that purpose , but that 's what I gave it for . " This spy business is largely nonsense . I went to the State Department in Washington and to some of the newspapers before I could get relief from the recurring insinuations and accusations that I was a German agent . Tile State Department helped me out readily , as I ant known well there . " Max did n't run away from New York , " said Mr. Breitung . " He came to Chicago in response to a telegram from me. and I left him there to complete some business . He was publicly registered at the hotel and this morning // BREITUNG I ( NEW SPY PLOTTERS // wired me that he was going to New York to find out what he was wanted for . " SPY CASE IN FEDERAL HANDS . Suspects Held in $25,000 Bal1 Seibs Accuses Breitung . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested on Sunday in New Jersey towns on the charge of conspiring to build mines for the destruction of munitions ships the Federal authorities yesterday took full charge of the case . Lieutenant Robert Fay , said to be the head of the plot , and Walter E. Scholz , said to be his brother-in-law ? were taken from the New Jersey police yesterday by William J. Flynn , Chiet of the Federal Secret Service , and are in the Tombs awaiting a further hearing before United States Commissioner Houghton next week . The status of Dr. Herbert Kienzle of 301 ) West Eighty-sixth Street , arrested here on ' Monday by New York detectives and Federal agents , is the same , though he is likely to be bailed out today . Paul Daeche , the fourth man arrested , preferred to have his hearing in Jersey City , but he , too , is now in charge of the Federal authorities . The fifth man sought in the alleged conspiracy is Max Breitung , a cousin of E. N. Breitung , the banker . He was in Chicago when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately started back to New York to face the charges , and is expected this morning . His cousin has announced his intention to assist him in every way , being confident of his innocence . Silent as to Men High Up . Meanwhile the Secret Service officials and the Federal District Attorney 's ' office have suddenly become silent as to possible developments of the case . No one will say how much higher the plot may go , if it goes higher at all , or whether there is evidence in hand to indicate that there is a connection between this alleged conspiracy to destroy munitions ships and other activities of German agents in connection with fires , explosions , strikes , and passport frauds . Fay talked freely , so freely as to arouse distrust , on Sunday night , and Scholz on Monday afternoon . Yesterday , after he had brought Fay and Scholz from Weehawken , where they had been detained since their arrest , Chief Flynn questioned Fay closely for two or three hours . The Chief would give little indication as to Fa had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for involving Captain von Papen and Captain Boy-Ed , Military and Naval Attaches of the German Ernitassy in Washington , and that Fay had insisted that his plans went no further than the blowing up of freighters loaded with-ammunition . Fay , however , is said to have admitted that when he sailed for America he had a letter to " a high official , " which he destroyed for fear it would be found on him . The silence of the officials is con ' strued in various ways . A dispatch from Washington yesterday said that Federal officers expressed doubt that a case could be made out against the defendants , in spite of the tact that Fay and Scholz had admitted that they had made mines and were anxious to try them . The Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice , under A. Bruce Bielaski , has not been connected with the case , the whole affair being handled by the Federal Secret Service and the local police . There was talk yesterday of friction between these two bodies , although Chief Flynn matched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a declaration that the Secret Service appreciated highly the work done by the police in making the arrests and running down the conspirators . Fay Warned Big Sums . The Washington officials of the Department of Justice who feared a case could not be made were not named , but it appeared yesterday that the Federal District Attorney 's office did not share their skepticism . The unwillingness of all concerned to talk about the matter yesterday was attributed by some to the possibility of much more extensive developments , the arrest of some of the " men higher up , " whom Fay is believed to have been shielding in his ready confession . That there were men far up is indicated by the fact that Fay spent more than $30,000 , according to the Secret Service men , and that he mentioned as much as half a million as a reward for a ship Captain who might fall in with his plans . The source of such sums is something the Secret Service is now looking into , and , with Chief Flynn 's men in charge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope of the plot remains undefined . A precaution against possible action of the men who have been furnishing the funds to get the prisoners out of reach of the authorities was taken yesterday when the complaint against Paul Daeche , the only one of the prisoners who had his hearing in Jersey City , was so drawn that any of the three men arrested in New York could be rearrested on that complaint also . Each of the prisoners had been held in $25,000 bail . and only one of them has furnished it as yet ; but it seems to be the impression in Government circles that if the ramifications of the plot are as extensive , and its higher members so well provided with funds as seems to be indicated , it is not impossible that wealthy Germans might be willing to pay up the claims of surety companies if the prisoners should jump their bail in order to remove Inconvenient evidence from the reach of the authorities . Precaution against this is found in the fact that any of the prisoners bailed in New York could at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total bail provided for each could thus be doubled . Incidentally , it is noteworthy that Fay , who seems to have been well provided with money , and is said to have mentioned a sum as high as half a million dollars as being at his disposal , told United States Commissioner Houghton yesterday that he had no money to hire a lawyer . Max Breitung 's cousin , E. N. Breitung , the capitalist , bought the steamship Dacia , last Fall from . the HamburgAmerican Line and sent her toward Germany with a cargo of cotton , only to have her captured by a French cruiser . Max Breitung is Secretary and Treasurer of the Oil Well Device Company of 11 . Pine Street , of which his cousin is President . He is not connected in any way with the Oil Well Supply Company of 90 West Street . He came to the United States three years ago , and was put to work in E. N. Breitung 's offices at Marquette , Mich . About a year ago he was transferred to New York , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Device Company of late . He is about 25 years old . " I do n't believe there can be any truth in the charges against Max , " said Mr. Breitung at Marquette yesterday . " I am under the impression that he has taken out his first naturalization papers . He has been interested in pro-German movements and has subscribed to various funds . If he is involved in any way in the present cases it must be through subscriptions of money , and I believe he did not know how trill ; money was to be used , if it was employed for any Improper purpose . The idea that when I bought the Dacia I was in any way acting on Max 's suggestion or for agents of the German Government is absurd . Max did n't know anything about the Dacia purchase until the deal was well under way . Then when I found it necessary to be absent from New York for some time , I turned the deal over to him to complete . As a matter of fact , he did not approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would make me some money . The United States Government is thoroughly familiar with my part in the transaction . As for this difficulty that Max is in , I have instructed my New York representatives to assist him so far as may be necessary " Seibs Denies Trapping Fay . Paul Seibs , the man who was responsible for giving the plot away and who was referred to as being connected with the Secret Service by some officials yesterday vigorously denied that he had in any way acted as a stool pigeon . As a matter of fact , according to the police , he was accidentally instrumental in bringing the affair to the notice of C. L. Wettig , a chemical engineer , of 17 Battery Place , a naturalized American citizen , who decided that the purchase of explosives by Germans needed to be looked into . Wettig , it is understood , told what he had learned to the Naval Attache of the French Embassy , who has an office in the French Consulate General , and he notified Police Commissioner Woods . Investigation thus set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seibs has desk room with Wettig in Room 941 of the Whitehall Building at Battery Place , where Wettig is in business as the Whitehall Trading Corporation . Seibs yesterday protested against the statement that he had acted as a decoy for the police , that he had used an alias from time to time , ' and that he was an officer in the German Army . I never even did military service , " he said . " I failed to pass the physical examination , and while I suppose I should be in the ranks by this time if I had remained in Germany , as my class in the Landsturm has been called out , I have never actually had any experience at rill . " I lived in America for several years before the war , most of the time in Chicago , and it was there that I became slightly acquainted with Max Breitung . I was in Germany when the war started , and last Winter I got into connection with some large electrical interests in Germany and went to Sweden to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade in copper via that country . Backed by these German interests , I founded the Gothenburg Trading Company , which was to import copper from the United States and export it to Germany . Then , in February , I came to the United States to further the business of this concern . I took the name of Karl F. Oppegaard while crossing the Atlantic , and succeeded in passing as a Swede , and thus escaping the British naval officers who have been taking Germans off of neutral " ships . When I came to this country I visited Washington and talked to several officials , but eventually found that because of the strict regulations about ultimate destination which the British blockade was enforcing I would be unable to get my copper trading started . This left me without work and I got desk room with Mr .. Wettig'and alerted to build up a business as a dealer in metals and chemicals . Says Breitung Bought Explosives . " I had known Dr. Herbert Kienzle while I was trying to get the Gothenburg Trading Company on a business basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max Breitung , and one day last Summer he wanted to buy , through me , some chlorate of potash . At that time I did not suspect that he wanted it for explosives . I sold it these purchases , and they went from him to Kienzle and from him to Pay . But I never met Fay until about two weeks ago , when Kienzle told me he wanted to buy some T-N-T . I hesitated , but I needed the money . So I asked no questions about whkt it was for , but I did ask him who the man was . He told me he would introduce me to him . So I met Fay in City Hall Park , and I told him I would get him some trinitrate of toluol . Then I went to Wettig , through whom I had been purchasing my explosives , and arranged to get the T-N-T kthrough him . And the next thing I new Secret Service officers were asking me what I knew about it . " Sought to Bribe Russian . The police , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his intention to blow up " the biggest chemical plant in the country , " which he did not locate more definitely than somewhere in New Jersey . They say , too , that according to the stories they have heard from Fay and Seibs , Fay knew of Seibs 's connection with the Gothenburg Trading Company and suggested after that venture failed that he might try to run copper into Germany by bribing the Captain of some Russian snip which should sail from the United States with copper for Russia . " The Russians are all crooked , anyway , " said Fay , according to this story . " Get hold of a Captain who could be persuaded to accidentally steer his ship into waters where German warships could capture him . There would be half a million dollars in it for the Captain . " Benno Loewy of 204 Broadway , attorney for Dr. Herbert Kienzle of 309 West Eighty-sixth Street , who was held in 1$211,000 bail by Commissioner Houghton on Monday afternoon for a further hearing on Nov. 4 , came near to getting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , for the bond with the Casualty Company of America , and Kienzle was brought down to the Federal Building to go through the last formality prior to being released . Then it was discovered that the only official of the company who was empowered to countersign bonds for more than $10,000 had left for the day , so Dr. ' Kienzle had to be taken back to the Tombs . He denied that he was guilty , but beyond that would say nothing . Turned Over to Federal Officers . In the court of Recorder George Rander of Weehawken , who had held Fay , Scholz , and Daeche after their arrest . there apepared yesterday morning , Mr. Drew , representative of the office of County Prosecutor Robert Hudspeth , and William J. Flynn , Chief of the Secret Service , who had warrants for all three , charging them with Federal offenses . After consultation with his superiors Mr. Drew agreed to the dismissal of the State charges of disorderly conduct and bribery , on which they were held , and Chief Flynn placed them under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had counsel , was told by his lawyer , August Ziegner , that he had a right to he arraigned before the nearest Federal Commissioner , rather than to go to New York for arraignment , and that he could be taken to Jersey City if he wished . He said that he had nothing in common with Fay and Scholz and would prefer to have his hearing in New Jersey , so he was turned over to Joseph A. Kavanaugh of the Secret Service and Fay and Scholz were brought to New York by Chief Flynn . Fay and Scholz , after spending some hours in conversation with Chief Flynn , finally came up before Commissioner Clarence S. Houghton at 4 o'clock . The complaint against them was that used in the case of Kienzle the night before , I charging that Robert Fay , Walter Scholz , Paul Daeche , Max Breitung , and Herbert Kienzle " at and within the City of New York , did unlawfully , feloniously , and corruptly conspire and agree among themselves maliciously to attack and set upon a vessel belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel of their money , goods , and merchandise laden on board thereof . " Fay asked that the complaint be read , and when Commissioner Houghton had reached the words , " laden on board thereof , " Fay interrupted . Before he could make it clear what he wanted to say , the Commissioner asked him to wait until the reading was finished , and Fay did not return to the point . Bail Fixed at $25,000 . Then the two men who , according to the Secret Service , have spent more than $30,000 on their plot against munitions ships , said that they had no funds to employ counsel . At Scholz 's request , seconded by Fay , Commissioner Houghton agreed to appoint attorneys to represent them ; bail was fixed , at the request of Assistant United States District Attorney John C. Knox , at $25,000 each , and the hearing was adjourned till 2 P. M. on Nov. 4 the same time set for the continued hearing on Kienzle . Commissioner Houghton appointed Louis Jersawitz of 220 Broadway attorney for Fay and Abraham Snydecker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clients at the Tombs yesterday evening and declared that they would not waive examination and would fight the case all the way . Meanwhile Daeche had been taken to Jersey City and arraigned before United States Commissioner James V. Carpenter , Jr . His uncle , Emil Da , eches , with whom he lived at 141 Hutton Street , Jersey City , was in court with two or three friends . The form of the complaint was the same , but in this document the conspiracy of Fay . Scholz , Breitung . Daeche , and Kienzle is also alleged to have occurred in New Jersey . In place of the specific acts alleged in the New York complaint , which are that to effect the objects of the conspiracy Breitung paid $112 to Paul Seibs about Aug. 15 , and Fay paid $23 to Seibs about Oct. 21 , is the charge that on or about Oct. 24 Daeche concealed explosives in Weehawken . May be Rearrested . The effect of this , it is understood , is that if any of the men are released on bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other and held until more bail is provided . Whether such action will be taken is regarded as uncertain , although if the Government should find reason to believe that wealthy and influential Germans are willing to pay the loss incurred by the forfeit of the bond , it might feel that it would be safer to rearrest any of the men who might be suspected of planning to jump bail . August Ziegner , Daeche 's counsel , asked for delay , so the hearing was put over till Wednesday , Nov. 3 . Bail for him , too , was set at 525,000 , and as neither his uncle nor his friends were able to raise it he was locked up in the Hudson County Jail . The police have made no more discoveries of explosives hidden on the Jersey side of the Hudson , and they gave the impression yesterday that they have possessed themselves of about all the effects of Fay and Scholz . Mrs. Mathilde Scholz , wife of the prisoner , Walter E. Scholz. and said to be the sister of Robert Fay  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 131 Palisade Avenue , West Hoboken . She left that address , however , about a year ago , and it is understood that she is in Germany . Another of Fay 's activities in this country was discovered yesterday when it was made known that he had been a frequent visitor to New Brunswick , N. J. , where he displayed much interest in the Perlin Powder Works . He is said to have visited the plant several times . Fay used to go to New Brunswick about noon and stayed usually till sunset , returning to Jersey City . He made a number of friends in the city and was generally popular . That he had designs on the powder factory , however , is contradicted by the statements which he made to the police on Sunday and to Chief Flynn yesterday morning . He has always denied that he had any intention of attacking ammunition factories , saying at first that he thought only of blowing up ships , and yesterday telling Chief Flynn that he could do more damage by blowing up the plants that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
