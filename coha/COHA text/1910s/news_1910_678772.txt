txt The most complete round-up of alleged . counterfeiters ever made by the United States Secret Service Department reached its climax yesterday when sixteen prisoners . who are believed to have floated more than $50,000 of spurious money , were arraigned before United States Commissioner Shields . In addition to these men twenty others , all of the , same gang , so the Secret Service men say , were arrested last Fall and are now serving terms in Sing Sing varying from one to seven years . Tile leaders of the band are alleged to be Ignacio Lupo , w Ho was one of the suspects in the famous " barrel murder " of 1903 ; Giuseppe Morello , who is said to be wanted for a murder in Italy , and six others . all of whom , the police say , have been suspected of being connected wit h the , " Hand . " Lupo , Morello. and their six associate leaders of the band were placed under $15.000 ball by Commissioner Shields for trial next Monday . The other eight , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having lent their services in circulating the bogus money which the others turned out , were held in ** bail . The men were arraigned by Chief Flynn of - he local Secret Service Bureau , who with ten men had been working for nearly a year to round up the gang . Almost a year ago Flynn 's men found a large number of counterfeit two and five dollar bills in circulation . The bills had been struek off from zinc plates . instead of steel . Such as the Government uses . and the engraving , while of such a character as to deceive one not closely observant , was of rather rough finish , compared with some of the counterfeit work which the Secret Service men had come across . The bills had been dipped in coffee to give them the appearance of having been handled . thus tending to cover up whatever crudity might otherwise appear . it look Flynn and his men several months to get a clue to the men who were putting this money out . Before they had made any arrests some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were passed on the street cars and with merchants . Also a number of up-State cities Were flooded with them . Early last Summer Chief Flynn 's men obtained a tip that la grocery store at 335 East Ninety-seventh Street was being used as a distributing ' place.for the bogus money . The store was run by Giuseppe Morello , Antonia Maloni , and Antonio Cecelia . Two deteetives took a room ill a tenement opposite the grocery and watched . They saw men and women enter the store to buy groceries , and they also noticed that there were some men who would go into a rear room , where the three men had an office . They : observed , too , that these callers would after emerging from the store look furtively around and stealthily disappear . One day the detectives , after being satisfied that these mysterious callers were going there to get the counterfeit money , swooped down on three of them . From them the detectives learned that the three proprietors of the store sold the bogus money , getting , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thee-dollar bills . They immediately arre fed Cecalia and Maloni , but Morello got away and was not caught until a few days ago . . Having found the clearing house for the counterfeit money , the Secret Service men set at work to ascertain where it was made , but this was not such an easy task . They found other men who were circulatling the money , and , up to Nov. 15 last , they made twenty arrests . Of these seven were arrested in Manhattan , seven in Brooklyn , four in Jersey City , and the others up-State : The Secret Service men watched the movements of others of the gang , and eventually found that supplies such as ink and stationery were being sent to Highland . ' N. Y. About two weeks ago two of the Secret Service men went there . They were not long in finding that the supplies had gone to a farmhouse about three miles from the railroad station . They rode out tO%the farmhouse , which is located in an isolated spot , and made inquiries . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of counterfeiters had been using the farmhouse , they had abandoned it only a week before , and had disappeared . The farm was now in the hands of a respectable old couple who had just moved in . The Secret Service men went through the farmhouse and found in the cellar some old dies that had been used in the counterfeiting and other paraphernalia left by the gang . They also saw marks upon the cellar floor where the press had stood . After more inquiries they learned that two of the gang , Salvator Chia , and Vincenzo Giglio , had been seen at Highland only . a few -- days before . and ' that they had gone across the river to Poughkeepsie . The agents went there , and , after a search through the Italian colony , found the two men and arrested them . After their prisoners were locked up here the Secret Service men arrested a group of men who had acted as their allies in disposing of the money . They learned that Lupo and Morello. whom they had been trying to catch for months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturday they caught their melt . In the meantime the agents - had ascertained from some of the men under arrest that the gang had buried its counter  --  letting press and many of the dies . in pasture land on the Highland farm . The agents will go up next week and dig them up . Chief Flynn said yesterday that the gang had . so far as lie could estimate , placed $50,000 of counterfeit money on the market , but that possibly it would be found that the amount was considerably more . His men confiscated a bundle of $4,000 spurious twos and about $1,000 in fives at the grocery store in Ninety-seventh Street , and had , recovered more of it at the homes of the gang . aang. tliught that all the band had been caugl and that there would be a cessation of p ssing of bogus twos and fives , at least for a while .
