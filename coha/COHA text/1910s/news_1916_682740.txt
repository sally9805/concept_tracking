txt Mr. Gerard 's Reception . I wish to protest against the unneutral stand which a part of our citizens are taking in regard to matters of strictly American character . In this morning 's TIMES I read the announcement that " German-Americans are asked not to take part in the official reception by the citS to Ambassador James W , Gerard . " This seems to me to be a breach of neutrality as well as disloyalty to our country . Ambassador Gerard 's activities may not have conformed to the wishes of the Imperial German Government and of the GermanAmericans here , but his activities certainly were to the best interests of this country . That a part of our citizens should attack a Federal officer for no other reason than that he was true to the interests of his country seems beyond belief . Still we see this occurrence daily and no one seems to protest I against such abominable tactics . Have we really relinquished our pride as a nation and become subservient to the wishes of our hyphenated brethren ?
