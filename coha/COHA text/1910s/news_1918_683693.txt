txt It is now nearly two months since the National Housing Association brought to the President 's attention " the pressing need of prompt meas " ures to secure proper housing ac " commodations for the very large " body of Industrial workers required " to man the Plants tor the manutact " ure of munitions , the construction of " ships , and other industries essential " to the prosecution of the war . " The creation of a board with power to act in the emergency was ? recommehded , that-Tis to say with authority to make loans for the purchase or leasing of the lands and the construction of quarters . Within a day or two Mr. D. B .. CALDwELL of the War Shipping Committee . of the Merchants ' Association has reviewed local needs in a letter to Chairman HURLEY of the United States Shipping Board . In New York and vicinity there are eighteen yards In which ships are building or under contract with the Government . In November they Were employing 31,0S6 men , and , if their schedules are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this force . Housing for the shipworiters is a perplexing problem . It involves the holding of the men to their task , for wages are high in all the trades . Most of the men employed can find no accommodations near the yards , and come long distances to their work , starting early and returning home late . Moreover , men who come here from other localities encounter a dearth of tenements for themselves and their families . It is obvious that the contractors must hire married as well as single men . Even when new plants are established near a large city  --  take the great yards under development on the Newark meadows , for instance  --  it wo n't do to expect the thousands of workers to look out for themselves within easy riding distance of their jobs ; the reason is that the supply of lodgings is limited . If 10,000 newcomers appeared in Newark today . to join the shipyard forces , it is doubtful whether a third of them could be accommodated in that city . It will be futile to expect companies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridgeport , to which at least 40,000 war workmen have flocked , public-spirited citizens have raised a good deal of money for housing , but the end of their resources has been reached . Unless the Government comes to the relief of the munition plants in Bridgeport there will be heartbreaking delays In deliveries for the allied forces , Including the United States Army . " Ships , ships , ships : " is the constant cry , but they will come from the yards very slowly , unless this housing problem is solved expeditiously . What must be done ? The Government has before it this recommendation of the Committee on Wartime Housing of the National Association : The creation of a Housing Administration of the Federal Government , with authority to lend money appropriated by Congress for the building of rentable houses at war plants , on land condemned , if necessary , the money to be provided in the discretion of the President and advanced on suitable security . This is ' the remedy , briefly stated . Conditions in the contracts would assure the Government against loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an this page , Chairman ATTERBURY of the Committee on Wartime Housing of the National Aesociation urges permanent structures for workmen at the war industries plants , arguing that as Great Britain , planning for the future and spending large sums of money , la building workmen 's houses to last , the United States should follow suit , unless . to use the vernacular , it is willing to take England 's dust In postbellum trade competition . This is an aspect of the subject that calls for a good deal of deliberation . Mushroom housing , buddenslek building , would , of course , he resented by the workmen , who , if their quarters were not habitable , would desert in droves . The housing must certainly be good enough to hold them . How substantial and durable it should be is a question for the experts and the economists , with this consideration always in mind , that unnecessary delay in producing munitions and building ships can not be tolerated .                 @ @ @ @
