WHAT follows is the account of a rather notable success , granted only the point of view which happens to be held by ourselves , Barbara 's parents . Of course , we can speak only from this point of view , and commensurately with our own understandings . By saying that we have achieved a success with the first steps in Barbara 's education , I mean that the results so far produced , unlike those often produced by the public schools , are of the general sort we should have chosen in advance , if one could only choose results . Unfortunately , one can choose only means , which may or may not yield the results expected , according to one 's skill in choosing and the material one has to work with ? also one 's luck . We may be entirely unwise and wrong in our fundamental conception of what a normal five-year-old daughter should be ; as to that , we can only he ourselves , subject to correction by experience . But , granted our conception , we have found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human aspiration is ever realized . Our few simple but novel contrivances have proved themselves to be a successful way of getting from nowhere to a certain specified goal , supposing that one wishes to get there . That is their claim to attention . For the sake of open-mindedness , I am going to admit that we often have doubts about the basic wisdom of what we are doing for and to Barbara . It may be best in the long run to pour yourself into your child , as we are trying to do ; on the other hand , it may be best to let your son or ( laughter run wild , form associations by accident , and be taught mainly by experience and necessity . Fostering a child 's natural sense of order and beauty may be , for all we can say , a sorry preparation for life in a world of prevalent dullness and ugliness ; giving such guidance as we have given may lead only to a more painful disillusionment in a scheme of things in which every one is ultimately left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man more interested in the well-being of the young than in any other one social problem , frankly lamented that parents could not go off into the woods , lay eggs to be hatched posthumously , and forthwith die . He may have been right . No one can ever really know , for the reason that it will never be possible to put identically the same grist through two different mills and compare the results . One can do only what one is . One is denied the fine sanction of knowing that what one is is the best thing to be . Civilization , too , can do only what it is . For better or worse , it has committed itself to education , guidance ? the idea that life can be made more orderly by inculcating a sense of order , and more interesting by developing resources within the individual 's own mind . It is " an organized conspiracy against nature " ; it means deliberately to prepare the individual for a better world than he is presently going to find himself living in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask a great deal of it and be disappointed than to ask nothing in particular and get it . Accepting this paradox of education ? as for our part we can no more help doing than we can help the color of . our eyes ? we face the problem of how to pack into the being of our child the fullest possible store to fall back on when the emptiness of other things becomes oppressively manifest . This , I repeat , may not he the real problem . But perhaps we shall never know about that . Anyhow , we like our way of solving it better than any way we have seen . And we are disinterestedly glad to set the facts down here for the sake of any value they may have to those who , content to begin with our assumptions , are anxiously weighing the agencies for turning those assumptions into practical and palpable results . We were made , parentally speaking , on the day when Barbara discovered the typewriter . Discovered it , I mean , as an object worthy of sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was just under three years old . Her erudition at that time consisted of the alphabet ( learned earlier through a curious habit of not allowing her go-cart to proceed by a street-corner until the street-sign had been expounded to her ) , plus a few words and numbers , acquired through the same process and from head-lines . Perhaps I should also add some fifty tunes , which she had learned to recognize , when they were played , whistled , or hummed , through simple repetition . She also knew from across the room every page and bar of the Just-So Songs ( Edward German 's music to Mr. Kipling 's words ) , and every syllable on each , because she had unconsciously associated the words with the figuration of the notes and staves on each page . And she was always seeing A 's in the gables of houses and H 's in football goal-posts . This is only to say that she had the normal child 's curiosity and acquisitiveness . But the real , the commemorable beginning was the day when she walked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I finished copying a manuscript on the typewriter . " Tell me a story about it , " said she . It was a period when all conversation was by hypothesis a story . I set it down here , as to my own eternal credit if Inever do another so creditable thing , that I forgot how busy I was supposed to he . I took her up and turned the contraption ' round and showed her exactly what made the bell ring . " Tell me about it again , " said she ? another inveterate formula of this period . In half an hour she knew how to put a paper in , straighten it , slide the carriage , strike letters , use the space-bar and the backspace , turn the platen up , and take the paper out . The next day she knew the names of all the characters on the keyboard , even to the absurd supernumerary ? ' s and ' s and * 's , and how to produce each , including those which required the shift-key . The third day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the typewriter , her mother sitting across the room and dictating thus : " Capital D-e-a-r-space-capital C-o-u-si-n-space-capital H , " and so on . It was three lines of typescript long , and it took an eternity of concentration ? probably a half-hour ? but she did it in one burst , refusing to be stopped . Three months later she was taking many simple words of her dictation as words and not as letters ; she had learned how to spell them by doing it repeatedly . Thus , at three years and three months she had learned a perceptible amount of reading ? by the strange process of reading her own typescript ! Literally , she had learned a form of writing before she knew anything whatever about reading . That was in June , 1917 . In October , 1918 , at four years and seven months , she wrote her notes of acknowledgment behind the mysteriously closed doors of the study , emerging quaintly to ask one of us how to spell " interesting " or " particularly , " showing us only the finished result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope of mere professional authorship by refusing to allow her precious documents to be " edited . " Her note-hooks of April , 1919 , show that she understood plurals and how they are formed from singulars ; also that the plural of " baby " is " babies , " whereas that of " monkey " is monkeys " ? to accomplish which , you will observe , it is necessary to know a vowel from a consonant . Learning to tell them apart , let me add , is an attainment which would not be speeded by calling them something else ? e. g. , " fat letters " and " lean letters " ? in the fashion of the " baby-room " ; for a child adores technicalities of diction , and is most interested when learning things that adults know , and calling those things by their adult names . It would be easier , grotesquely supposing that one wanted to , to teach some five-year-old children " oxymoron "  - -  both the word and the thing ? than to do the same for many high-school students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at her prompting , over words in - ometer ? thermometer , anemometer , dynamometer , speedometer , barometer ? she spelling them by the sound , learning the meanings by cross-examination of me , and afterward typing the words . This when she was four years and nine months old . Now , at five years and three months , she easily distinguishes nouns , adjectives , and verbs ; also the difference between a phrase and a sentence . The reason why we have not as yet handed her a copy of the Concise Oxford Dictionary is that we are weakly fond of seeing her run to us with her questions about spellings . A great deal of the net accomplishment thus far is ascribable , certainly , to the typewriter . In a. multitude of ways we become more and more convinced of the expediency of letting the typewriter be , so far as a machine can , the center and genesis of the first processes . It seems topsy-turvy , to be sure , to let a form of writing precede every form of reading ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have yet discovered , no disadvantage that is not readily superable . Learning to read is speeded enormously when it takes the form of understanding what one 's own fingers have just produced ; the rate of production is so slow at first that every word is learned thoroughly , letter byletter ; spelling , therefore , is acquired almost without teaching it ; and the elementary phonetic laws of the language follow likewise . There is a great deal of incidental training for every finger of both hands ; for it proves to be easier to teach the correct fingering than to allow the keys to be struck , as Stevenson played the piano , " with two melodious forefingers . " Barbara has now fingered with automatic correctness for so long that she would be temporarily helpless if , for instance , her left little finger were hurt . This muscular training is distinctly profitable in connection with the piano . There is also a far greater advantage namely , that typewriting is physically so easy , and the result so legible , that all the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing script is for several years so laborious that the mere physical act of forming the letters is all-absorbing . Let the typewriter be made the center of one 's scheme of early training and the passion for getting original stories down in visible and permanent form can have begun at four and , by five , advanced to a point inaccessible to many children of ten not so trained . Of this advantage , as it worked out in our experiment , I must say a word later . Suffice it here to suggest that this early release of powers is one way to avoid the dissatisfaction and consequent nervous drain of being thwarted or inhibited . When my daughter has finished reading Cinderella , " and followed it by inventing her own little fantasy of a rabbit who offered his paw and his heart to any little girl who could wear his ears for slippers , the ability to set it down exactly in typescript means more to her ? more , T mean , of vivacity and glow and recreation ? than could be got out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only serious disadvantage is the obvious one of postponing script for a little . This , so far as it concerned the reading of script , we overcame by a very simple device . We allowed Barbara to mark every new word she came to in her day 's reading , and every word of which she was particularly fond . Her mother then wrote the marked words in a column on the left-hand side of one page of a note-book , after which Barbara copied them in type on a loose sheet ruled by hand to match the spacing of lines in the note-book . The finished list , was cut out and pasted on the right-hand side of the page . Barbara soon read script easily and without reluctance , to say no more of the training got by ruling her own lines , doing her own cutting and pasting , and typing the words exactly on the ruled lines , which happened to be spaced differently from the automatic spacing of the platen on the machine . We kept up this training almost daily for several months ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list as well as typewrite it . Here is one typical list , from " Letting in the Jungle " in the second Jungle Book : disorderly , brethren , average , ancestor , enviously , sensitiveness , heliograph , triumphantly , porpoises , unconcernedly , translated , torture , accompany , haft , tethered , penitently , insolently , sacrifices , commerce , conscience , vermin ? some of the words new to her , some of them old favorites . I cite this list in full in order to emphasize one of the points of which we have made ourselves surest ? that it is fallacious and inept to distinguish between " hard " and " easy " words . Any word is only a word , in point of difficulty : " grandfather " is not . a whit harder than " grand " or " father " ; " commendable " is only " mend " preceded by " com " and followed by " able , " all of which arc inevitably familiar separately . A child can soon be brought to the point of studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine times in ten , by being taught to see in each long word a combination of familiar short words , prefixes , and suffixes . It was not only Barbara 's boredom with primers and second and fourth readers , but also the utility of the normal vocabulary and normally constructed sentences , that drove us to the Just-So Stories , the Jungle Books , Puck of Pook 's Hill , the Golden Treasury , Longfellow 's Poems , Alice in Wonderland , and the other present favorites of Barbara . No wonder many young children find reading dull when they are constantly taught by implication that they must wait years before they can go beyond the nauseous monosyllabic vocabulary of the orthodox first reader ! No wonder they read metallically and without inflection when they are condemned for years to the style of " I see a cat . The cat is black " ! This sort of simplification is not natural , but artificial ; and it is abnormally and perversely artificial , for it piles up gratuitous difficulties for the teacher by wantonly sacrificing the interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure is that the staring and gigantic type used in elementary readers has something to do with the strained and painfully uplifted voices in which schoolchildren read aloud . This exaggerated print is one more product of a false assumption about what a child 's intelligence really is . Into the discard must go the whole notion that children love to be appealed to through coarse , gross . sprawling dimensions , broad belts and blocks of primary colors , vapid impressionistic simplifications of reality . They do n't . They love the fine , the microscopic , the hair-drawn , and they love verisimilitude . Impressionism is an adult and sophisticated growth . Barbara , for instance , goes instinctively to her Arthur Raekham , her M. B. de Monvel ; and in them she picks out by preference the most vanishingly fine details . She knew what a comma and a question-mark and a hyphen were before she could pronounce their names ; something about them made her chuckle , as new words often do before she knows what they mean ? e. g. , " jabber . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefinger through a whole volume of print before she could read a single word . One result of our encouraging , not stultifying , this normal childish attention to small details is that she has always read things as they are punctuated , with variety and an instinct for the proper accent . It was astonishing to hear her reproduce at first sight , say , the mocking irony of Mowgli 's glorious chant on the death of Shere Khan the tiger , or the dainty humor of Suleimanbin-Daoud 's conversation with Balkis in The Butterfly That Stamped . Her own compositional style , too , thanks to this same childish capacity for detail , has sentence-structure and the visible symbols thereof ? unlike the original efforts of sundry university freshmen with whom her father has now and then had dealings . And when , at four and a half , she undertook to write script herself , there was found to be no need for letters a foot high or great , sweeping arm movements ; she wrote a hand of civilized proportions as soon as she saw how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fully as legible as the staring round-hand of the schools , besides being much more mature . It is in connection with writing that can best illustrate the general construc-tive doctrine of this article ? that the way for elementary teaching to succeed better is to offer more , not less ; to make work interesting by making it a chal-lenge to abilities in the child , not by dis-guising it as play . Whenever we have failed temporarily with Barbara we have always discovered in the end that it was because we had asked too little to interest her , not too much for her to accomplish . When , for instance , we began to be annoyed by her indifference to writing ? it was when she was four and a half , and it seemed absurd for a child who could read and compose as she could to be still unable to write with a pencil ? we tried to teach her to form the individual letters , beginning with the simplest . The undertaking dragged , and cost more in effort than the results were worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Barbara that perhaps shemight like to write " clock . " Clocks were , at this period , the consuming passion of her existence . Mrs. Clock upstairs in her room and Mr. Clock downstairs were treated exactly as the graven images of heathendom are by their devotees . Bowls of food and flowers were set before them daily ; dances and songs were demonstrated solemnly in their presence ; books were stood open facing them , that they might read the word " clock " and know that they were worshiped ; and they had to be kept one minute apart so that the striking of each could be ceremonially attended by Barbara , if possible with a parent in each hand . At the notion of writing " clock , " the child gleamed . The first day she covered a note-book page with " clock , " in a gawky but legible hand ; the second day it was " pendulum " ; the third , " tick-tock . " Beginning on her fifth birthday , she wrote a few dated sentences each morning , usually to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the same with Arabic figures ; she showed no interest in making them with a pencil until she had in her bead all the arithmetic of the numbers up to twenty ? extracted , of course , from a clock-face , along with odds and ends of geometry and mechanical drawing . Her writing of numbers practically began with whole arithmetic lessons . But for our lucky faith that she could somehow copy whole words before she had formed a single letter reasonably well she might still be signing her name in type . Our principal indictment of elementary education is that it is administered by those of little faith ? in the child . I fear it has too much faith in itself and in methods to have much left over for anything else . These , then , are some of the results . It seems to me that they make out a case for the regular daily lesson . I do not say that the subject of this treatment , if she were a prodigy or a genius , might not be where she is as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in parenthesis , and disguised as something else . But I am very sure that Barbara ? an example , as it seems to us and to others who know her , of absolute and beautiful normality in mind , disposition , and body ? owes a good half of her attainment to the fact that she has been trained into accepting , expecting , and wanting her daily school tasks at a regular and recognized hour when she is fresh for them . As for the correlation of work with play , the child 's ingenuity manages that better than we could . Precisely because work is work and play is play there is a special additional triumph for her in floating a bridge between them . She takes pride in her work as such ; and ? a sufficient justification even if there were no other ? she plays better all the time because of the perceived difference between play and work . Before she could read at all she would walk through the fields and woods saying aloud all the rhymes she could think of to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rhymes . AL a later period she invented for bedtime an odd language game which began with commanding me to " say something incorrect . " I quoted all the solecisms I could remember offhand from some years of reading undergraduate themes , and she corrected them with chuckles of glee . This was very bad pedagogy , but a very good game ; and I see no possible objection to it so long as it is not allowed to make the child priggish about correctness in the presence of those who really do not know how to speak correctly . Whenever Barbara finds in play anything of especial interest , such as learning by demonstration how a willow whistle or a box-kite is made , she is sure to say , " Oh , mother , may we have this for a writing lesson to-morrow ? " Of course she always may ; wherefore her diversions acquire an added zest , and her lessons proceed in a constant atmosphere of special privilege . She will sit for a whole afternoon , if the day be warm , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drying lawn , her crowd of toy animals surrounding her ; and when she comes in she will go in sober silence to the typewriter and set down the homemade lyric which has been evolving itself in her head all that time : And then she will come to me with music-paper and insist that I write down the home-made tune as she hums it ; after which she will copy in the words under the proper notes and pick out the melody on the piano from the notes . Who will say that the " animal-patch " does not mean more to her that day because she knows she is going to signalize it , to her own liking , in song , and more the next day because she has so signalized it the day before ? Any one who doubts that work and play can be made contributory to each other should be present at our house between eight and nine of a pleasant summer morning . Breakfast is over at twenty minutes past eight . Barbara wants to go out into a neighboring field to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , or whether the first buttercup is out yet . Yes , she may go ? if she will be sure to come back at nine . Before the last stroke of nine has sounded from our slow-striking village clock you hear her feet come pounding down the hard pathway . She arrives breathless , partly with running , but more with laughter at the sheer deliciousness of this transition between the two things she chiefly loves ; and on her way up the stairs you hear her shrieking that it is nine o'clock and " Time for school , mother ! " And then the house settles instantly into an absorbed and business-like quiet . They take , after all , so little time , these daily lessons , and cause so slight a variation from the make-up of a child 's ordinary schedule , that it is difficult to see how any one could dislike them as unreasonably exacting . One hour and twenty minutes a day , distributed among reading , writing , and typewriting , with one or another of these giving way in rotation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that is the utmost extent of the routine . The rest of the time from sun to sun , except for a rest-hour spent quietly alone , is occupied with playing out-of-doors , in an ecstasy of abandonment to sun and wind ; picking baskets of flowers and watching birds and chasing butterflies ; holding long conversations with her imaginary playmates , one of whom has been her constant familiar for three years ? in short , with all the things a child of five is supposed to be doing . I see nothing in our regime to spoil or taint her wholesome childish normality . Even in her lessons she becomes in no wise priggish . She would be hopelessly lost , I fear , in a school system which could not make room for the herd of miscellaneous toy animals which she tethers to the legs and rounds of the chair before she sits down to her work . She would never dream of considering her arithmetic paper finished until she has decorated it with a picture , cut out and pasted on , or with birds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is a five-year-old child , not a baby " grind . " The only difference is that all the items of her play mean more because every one of them is interfused with the same eager quality of imaginativeness which has already been applied to books and study , approved and fostered in connection with them , and thereby intensified in connection with everything else . Every butterfly that we see in the fields is The Butterfly That Stamped in the garden of Suleiman , and The Butterfly That Stamped in the story is , of course and naturally , the one we chased in the field this afternoon . Every night at bedtime Barbara is allowed to read to us consecutively for a half-hour from the Kipling story which she has last finished piecemeal in the morning lessons : and the proof that she does this with delight is that she always teases for a minute more to " fasten it off " ? by which quaint phrase she means reading the poem at the end . Thus work and play are each intensifying to the other ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalesce more easily when an explicit difference is made between them than when one is ambushed behind the other . The use of playthings as a basis for lessons can be carried much farther than I have as yet suggested . For example : One morning last spring Barbara 's mother said , " What are we going to have for a writing lesson to-day ? " The answering suggestion was , " I am going to describe Grandfather Bunny " ? a toy animal of endearing association . " Very well , " said her mother ; " write that down for your first sentence . " It was so done ; and then followed a page of description ; and then ? " That is how Grandfather Bunny looks . " And behold , there was an unexceptionable paragraph ? the construction of which Barbara understood , at five years and two months , as well as T do at thirty and two years , and could duplicate as easily on any subject within her scope . But only by dint of regularity and method ! And this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " 1 " and " we " ? used only because Barbara 's parents have an equal stake in the game and are agreed in all the essentials of how it should be played ? and to confess that most of the method and all of the regularity have been supplied by Barbara 's mother . And she is so very busy , much of the time , with other things than being Barbara 's mother ! On very many mornings the instruction is carried on by a housewife with , literally , a mop in one hand and a duster in the other , or from another typewriter in an adjoining alcove , with only occasional visits of inspection to the school-room . This I note for the encouragement of any interested parent who fancies that to live this humane life with one 's children takes great resources and abundance of leisure . It takes , principally , the faith in the child ; and , after that , the will and the patience . So much for the practice . Now I am going to put all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of any one who may care to dodge it entirely . Probably no one doubts the importance of the subject , or the urgency of the need for a great number and variety of just such frank interchanges of experience as this . The trouble has been thus far that across practically all interchanges on this subject , the rudiments of early education , has lain the trail of the serpent of academicism ? or , to call the deadly thing by the deadliest of its names , pedagogy . It is the paradox of education that the professional has less at stake than the amateur has . The professional is a teacher or " educator , " and the most that he has at stake is a theory or a reputation . But the amateur is always a parent ; and his stake is no theory , but the child itself . What I seriously distrust is the whole idea of sugar-coating knowledge and the processes of acquiring it . The process of elementary education has been theorized out of the domain of work and into the domain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overworked or inherently defective in sympathy , does , to be sure , often wear thin ; and it is common enough to find even first-graders who will jump at an excuse to escape school for a morning . Nevertheless , the trouble with the play-method of education is not that the illusion of play . wears thin , and is indeed perhaps impossible to sustain when you have great numbers of pupils to the single teacher . The trouble is that the method is itself evasive and inept . Children would really get more fun , more play , out of education , and be less anxious to dodge it on occasions , if there were no attempt to palm it oft on them as play . Theprimary grades are so intent on keeping children amused that the ina , chinery of amusement is over-elaborated and made an end in itself . What wonder if the machinery become at last transparently what it is ? mechanical ? What wonder if it break down of its own complexity ? Every cultivated parent must have discovered that it takes the lower grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach an alert child what he is capable of learning in a half-hour , and a whole school year to teach him vaguely what he could master accurately in little more than a month . There are reasons and reasons for this discrepancy ; but the chief of them is that primary education has got into the clutches of pedagogic experts who assume that the methods which alone succeed with mental defectives must by the nature of things prove doubly efficacious with normal intelligences . No one would pretend that teaching a young child to read , write , and figure does not demand a certain amount of time and patience . But many an elementary teacher according to the newer modes would be astounded to learn how much less time and patience it takes if all of both is expended on teaching the child what you think he ought to know , and none on concealing from him that you think he ought to know it . No one , of course , wants a child of three or four driven to lessons . But exactly this mischance is avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as something else . The whole idea of a lesson is so novel to a child 's nature and earliest experience that he will jump at . the idea with an avidity roused by nothing else in the world , not even a new toy . And if this avidity for what is novel be taken advantage of while the novelty lasts the whole matter of lessons can immediately be brought under the operation of the greatest labor-saving device as yet known to human experience ? habit . It is difficult to say whether children are more radical or more conservative , more eager to do what they have never done or more insistent on doing what they have always done . The fact is that they are both in an astounding degree . The easiest way to get them to begin learning is to offer them a lesson . The easiest way to make them keep on learning is to allow them to have lessons with frequency and , above all , regularity . The most important fact about children is the fact of their unutilized reserve powers , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and William James . Probably this doctrine is suspect among careful parents because of its association with the manufacture of infant prodigies ; but that is a quite unnecessary and fortuitous association , as I hope I have shown by example . Children hunger to know things ; and they have an almost terrifying facility in learning them . I have a strong impression ? I speak here as a layman , subject to correction if science knows more about the matter than every-day experience does ? that a child suffers more nervous wear and tear from being thwarted or slighted in its desire to learn , than from being deliberately instructed in the exercise of its mind . Every time a parent says , " There , now , run away and play and do n't ask any more questions , " or , " You 'll understand all about it when you 're older , " he is putting the child 's organism under the nervous strain ofcuriosity repressed and ungratified . This is as wearing , if its visible effects are a criterion , as running a motor-7r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents do not gratify or direct its curiosity and you find a child fretful , peevish , and habitually tired . The child 's face lights , and the wrinkles in its disposition smooth out , the instant one says , instead , " Come here and I 'll tell you what little I happen to know about it ; and then , if you like , we can look it up in the big encyclopedia . " Even if I happen to be wrong on this point , one consideration seems obvious : that the wear and tear of ungratified curiosity is a drain without any corresponding replenishment , whereas the building-up process after mental exertion is instantaneous and automatic . So , at all events , it has seemed to us , on the basis of experience . And , likewise on that basis , we have hit upon some simple , practical ways of making the first rudiments of learning call out of a child the whole array of eager powers and abilities which any normal child certainly has , hidden away somewhere and waiting to be appealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivable from them , that we are happy to pass along to other parents who , like ourselves , find it necessary or expedient to put themselves in the place of the public or private elementary school .
