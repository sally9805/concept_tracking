Notes from the Capital WILLIAM F. McCOMBS . Having worked so long and faithfully for others , William Frank McCombs has been trying this season to do something really worth while on his own account . Widely varying estimates of his chances of success float into Washington , but all agree that , whatever the ultimate outcome , he will have made a highly creditable run , and that , if he gets the coveted Senatorship , he will have nobody to thank for it but himself For he is running , not on the record of the Democratic party as a whole , or of President Wilson as an . individual , but on his own record of success four years ago , when the Presidential race was everybody 's till he came into it with his good horse system . As the first successful campaign manager his party had known for sixteen years , he was in line for about any important office he wished under the new Administration , and the common expectation was that he would be the next Postmaster-General . He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly administered , is as strictly a business enterprise as the Treasury , and business methods are McCombs 's specialty . Instead of that , the glittering gift of the Embassy to France was offered to him and declined . The declination was ostensibly based on the expense to which he would be put in Paris , and the prolonged absence from his country and his law practice which would be necessary ; underneath everything lurked , I suspect , his consciousness that diplomacy , with its labyrinth of secret features , was not the most attractive occupation for a man who has always worked above-ground and whose special strength he s in this methodical use of material open to every one . Although , technically speaking , Woodrow Wilson was first named as a Presidential candidate at Baltimore , in the summer of 1912 , actually he dates his start in the race a good deal further back , for McCombs , as a student of political history and economics in the class of 1898 at Princeton , had picked out his favorite professor as a " coming man " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the possibilities latent in Grover Cleveland , Mayor of Buffalo ; and the friendship formed in the classroom was kept up actively after the younger man 's graduation , his course in law , and his upbuilding of a practice in New York . Meanwhile , conditions in Democratic politics were ripening for a new departure . Bryan the brass bound and Parker the timid had had their day , and the great body of intelligent Democrats were clamoring for candidates who could cut loose from the old leaders and the old standards and modernize the party . McCombs read the signs aright , and prepared to take advantage of them . He saw that a fresh generation of voters were coming into the foreground of affairs . and that everything depended upon a successful appeal to them . He- knew a great many of them , scattered over the country , and to these he wrote , expressing his views of the situation and his hopes for the future . Their responses he analyzed , entering on a white index-card the name and address of every correspondent who agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other one with appropriate memoranda in all cases . The cards he filed in their proper order , in a cabinet , till he had within reach of his hand a pretty complete directory of the live young men who were Democrats , near-Democrats , forward - looking independents , and uncertain but possible recruits of every stripe , in the United States , running up well into the hundreds of thousands . When a circular letter or document was to be mailed , or an inquiry to be made , in a certain neighborhood , or an emissary was to be sent there to do active canvassing , McCombs had the local map before him , as it were , and could direct his energies intelligently for producing the surest results This was the way be prepared for and handled the Baltimore opportunity , and landed this man at the head of the party ticket . This was the way he conducted the subsequent campaign . It was by this guide , also , that he was able to distinguish between the real " Wilson , men " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , pressed forward to reap the fruits of viotory . It was Lamont 's general method repeated , but with a less crude mechanism . It was also quite in keeping with the personality of its author , which has not a taint of spasmodic emotion in it . His face , with prominent nose , its strong jaw , its wide , full mouth , and its winged eyebrows , impresses you with its seriousness in repose ; only when it lights up with a smile  --  a phase never overworked  --  do you see it at its best . His unconscious trick of looking at you out of the corners of his eyes would , if you did not know the kindness of his nature , make you think he was suspicious of your motives ; but when you notice that the lines in his forehead intensify with this movement , you realize that he is merely trying to make sure of your meaning . He is not an effusive talker , but a prize listener . On the platform he is a ready speaker , free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orator he is untrained , although he is a Southern man all through , born in Missouri forty-one years ago , of Kentucky-Alabama parentage , and started on his educational course in a Tennessee school . His Southern-ness permeates his speech , which , in spite of his twenty years in the North , still retains some of the slurring consonants and gentle drawl of his ancestral section . All that he says , however , is matter-of-fact in form , logical in presentation , sane in sentiment , and pleasantly expressed ; indeed , it was his amiable temper and agreeable manner which , in his university days , made him a social favorite in spite of his inability , due to an injury of his childhood which left him permanently lame , to join his mates in their athletic sports . If McCombs reaches the Senate , we shall hear more of him as a committee worker and a general pilot of legislation than as a brilliant performer on the floor . He may not prove a Webster , or an Edmunds , or a Root ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of his own well marshalled , it is safe to say that he will do New York at least as much credit as Mr. O'Gorman , and probably a good deal more .
