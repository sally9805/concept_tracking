Treasurers or agents of political committees and district committeemen or Captains are required to make the same kind of an accounting of their receipts and disbursements for primary election purposes as they are required to do on the occasion of a general election .

Heretofore , in reporting general election expenditures , Treasurers of committeees and candidates have lumped such disbursements , staling that $50 or $500 , as the case might have been , had been disbursed to election watchers and poll workers . Now , under the amended Corrupt Practices act , every payment to a poll worker , watcher , and messenger must be given in detail . together with the name , address , and nature of service given .
