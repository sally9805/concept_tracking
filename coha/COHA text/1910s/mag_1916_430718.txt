 |p553  IF the Supreme Court of the United States upholds the Oregon law which limits all labor in all industries to ten hours a day , the principle that any trade becomes a dangerous trade under excessive hours of labor will stand incorporated as part of our Constitutional theory of government . Other States may be expected to enact similar laws ; but , while in the courts the judges and the lawyers are debating and determining the nice points of legal doctrines , along comes a stupendous fact , like the great war in Europe , and , without fiat or force , places the shorter working day within the eager grasp of American labor . " If the war lasts another year , the big industries of this country will be run on an eight-hour day , " so the Commissioner of Labor , Mr. Wilson , is reported to have said . Such a prophecy is little less than astounding to those familiar with the bitter industrial struggles of the past . If such a change has come , or even if it be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietness and ease with which it has made its way . Remember that the eight-hour day has been the bone of fiercest contention for more than a generation . Corporations have sworn , and still swear , that they will die if subjected to it . Labor has waged bloody warfare to get it ? in vain . Remember that in 1877 the eight-hour men ran a locomotive forty miles an hour into the Pittsburgh roundhouses where the Pinkertons slept ; that in 1885 the Chicago Haymarket tragedy resulted from urging " eight hours . " And now industry is being eight-houred as peacefully as if the land were having a change of climate . Already Alaska and thirteen States have the eight-hour day in all mines , and eight States and Alaska have legislated for it in reduction works , smelters , and the like . Last year 's report of the New Jersey Department of Labor showed that over 25,000 workers in twenty-four factories received for the first time the eight-hour day . The four brotherhoods of railway operatives , 450,000 men , have made a concerted demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , made eight hours " ne of their recent demands . - Munition factories throughout the country are mostly running on a three-shift , eight-hour basis . All with as little bloodshed and violence as though a half-degree of heat had been added to the temperature or an inch to the year 's normal rainfall . If the whole land should come to the eighthour day , it will be a very good thing or a very bad thing for these United States , which need not concern us here ; but , good or bad , the growing sweep of the shorter day needs to be understood . For such study a town where the schedule is in general operation makes the best laboratory . Bridgeport , Connecticut , is such a town . For nearly a year its workers have earned their daily bread in eight hours . This is how it came about : In 1914 , when the great war broke out , Bridgeport was a typical New England manufacturing center . With the exception of the Union Metallic Cartridge Company , a branch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of peace . Corsets and machinery were its staple products . For these labor was never in stringent demand , and employers could always count on surplus workers to stiffen requirements and lower the wage scale . A year later conditions were overturned . America was flooded with war orders , and Bridgeport awoke to find itself the munition center of New England . The " Arms Company , " as the Remington Corporation is called , hastily completed and put into operation there one of the greatest arms plants in the United States , the largest single factory of any kind in Connecticut , under the same general management as the Union Metallic Cartridge Company . its allied branch . On the pay-roll of the Metallic Company in 1913 had been 3,200 men . In 1916 it and the Arms Company together employed over 12,000 . The town 's population jumped from 102,000 in 1910 to 150,000 in 1916 , with another 10,000 expected during the coming year . With the Arms Company as pacemaker , every machine shop in the city , corporate or private , has increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy with hub caps for automobiles , has doubled its capacity in order to fill war orders . Mills formerly urning out parts of machinery , door-knobs , or musical instruments are rushed with work on war supplies . All of Bridgeport is either making munitions , making parts of machinery to manufacture munitions , or  |p554  making money feeding . housing , clothing , and amusing the army of laborers that overflows the town . The whole city is blown big with a war order boom . Land , houses , food , and , most of all , workers , are at a premium . - Near the big factories houses are being completed at the rate of one a day . Dormitories for 4.000 women have been built by the Remington concern , and dwellings for 500 married men . It is estimated that homes for 7.000 families are needed at once . Furnished rooms are almost impossible to obtain . Rents have increased proportionately more than wages . Machinists are most in demand and . have the strongest union . In two years their membership has jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thirty cents an hour to fifty cents . Still unsatisfied , their slogan now is for " a cent a minute " ? sixty cents an hour . Unskilled labor , formerly glad of a steady wage of $10 a week , now puts on airs and swaggers off to find $15 . Full credit for this state of affairs is taken by organized labor . Employers are inclined to admit that without labor 's concerted action the gains to the workers might not have been so quick or so large . but claim that such a steady succession of victories could have been brought about only by the pressure of the law of supply and demand . The full power of that law and its application to the Bridgeport situation make interesting reading . Trouble started on July 12 , 1915 , with the iron-workers in the up-going Remington Arms plant , who struck against being classed and paid as carpenters . The millwrights joined them , and on July 20 the machinists in both the Arms Company and the Cartridge Company 's shops voted to join the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half for overtime , and double for holidays and Sundays . The general manager of the Remington plants had little means of knowing the true state of affairs ? that the union leaders were doing the tallest bluffing of their careers , that hardly more than five per cent of his machinists were organized . But he did know the immense volume of the company 's contracts , that millions hung on his ability to deliver the goods , and that he could not afford to haggle with his workers . On July 24 the Remington concern granted its workers the fortyeight-hour week , an increase in wages , and the three-shift , day and night , schedule . By this time the Locomobile Company was staggering under orders for three-ton trucks for England . Unlike the Remington companies , it belonged to the local branch of the National Association of Manufacturers , an association which had publicly announced its opposition to the forty-eight-hour week . Flushed with earlier success , the machinists decided to try for victory over the Locomobile Company in order to break the solidarity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers put into operation on July 31 a profit-sharing scheme said to advance wages about thirteen per cent . Union leaders rejected this , and insisted upon eight hours with ten hours ' pay . Refused by the company , it was then up to the leaders to incite and organize the men . As part of their campaign they printed and distributed free to machinists all over Bridgeport ten thousand copies of a little newspaper entitled " The Labor Leader , " which carried across its face verses like these : " We mean to make things over , we 're tired of toil for naught , We have n't enough to live on , nor even an hour for thought . We want to feel the sunshine , we want to smell the flowers , We know that we are worth it , and we mean to have eight hours . " These jingles , together with the arrest of , three leaders for attempting to , address their men at noon in a vacant tot rented by them , fired the employees of the Locomobile Company so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out on strike . On August 9 the company offered a choice between the bonus : plan and the eight-hour day with ten hours ' pay . On August 13 the men voted for the eight-hour day and returned to work . With these victories came the capitulation of Bridgeport so far as the munition factories were concerned . True , the Manufacturers ' Association met on August 14 and voted almost unanimously for the fifty-hour week , but when the Arms Company announced its willingness to employ all men blacklisted or dropped by other factories the end was in sight . Isolated strikes but served to tighten the workers ' determination as , one by one , the employers went down in defeat . A partial outline as given in the " Survey " of December 4 , 1915 , sums up the daily strife as follows : August 20 ? Six hundred Bryant Electric Company workers strike for eight-hour day and  |p555  improved shop conditions . Turnbull Company grams a fifty-tive hour week with sixty hours ' pay : no strike reported . Wolverine Motor Company grants forty-eight-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company workers strike . Connecticut Electric Company workers strike . Coulter &; McKenzie Machine Company workers strike ; demands OM &; in one hour . August 2-t ? Holmes &; Edwards Company men return to work at fifty-five hours ' pay for forty-eight hours ' work . Five hundred workers out at Crane Valve Company demand $.3 for eight-hour day instead of $2.50 for nine boars . American Chain Company men out . Sixty men out at Spring-Perch Company . Canfield Rubber Company workers strike for forty-eighthour week , higher pay , and better shop conditions . August 25 ? Bridgeport Metal Goods Cos pany gives forty-eight-hour week with fifty-five hours ' pay . Canfield Rubber Company grants eight-hour day . Connecticut Electric Company workers return : granted fifty-hour week with fifty-five hcurs ' pay . August 31 ? American Graphophone Company gives forty-eight-hour week and 20 per cent increase . Bryant Electric Company strike settled ; workers get forty-eight-hour week with fifty-five hours ' pay . And so on , and so on , until in two and a half months fifty-five strikes were called , while in many shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to run to an average of eight hours with the same pay as for nine or ten . Machinists and highly skilled men have done even better . Unions in all industries are the rule rather than the exception . Even the Jitney Drivers ' Union grew out of Bridgeport 's object-lesson in the value of organizations against individuals . In the daily papers appeared and still run advertisements reading : " WANTEDALL-ROUND MACHINIST ; FORTY-EIGHT-HOUR SHOP ; " Or , " MEN WANTED EIGHT-HOUR SHOP . " While the men were fighting for eight hours in the munition factories a curiously sympathetic movement developed among the women . Union leaders have always admitted the difficulty of organizing women . They are looked on as the sluggish and inert members of the labor body . Bridgeport women hardly merit that reproach . On August 10 , just after the machinists had won in the Remington and Locomobile plants , three thousand women employed at the Warner Brothers ' Corset factory marched out of the buildings , down the main street to Eagle Hall , and announced that they had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nearly one hundred per cent of the Varner girls struck , joined the International Association of Ladies ' Garment Workers . and within three days returned to work . They had gained their forty-eight-hour week , twelve per cent increase in pay , promises that no girls under sixteen years should be employed , and a reduction of fines and thread expenses and recognition of the Union . Although they did not know it , they had also gained for their sisters in the smaller factories the same conditions . On August 25 the Batchellor . Crown , and La Resista Corset Companies conceded the same terms , Corset-making has long been a foremost industry in Bridgeport . From this time forth the corsetmakers mean to work but eight hours a day . Following the corset workers came the strikes of the laundry women . These were brief and uniformly successful . Bridgeport now has a yell-organized laundry workers ' union with the highest pay and shortest hours of any city in New England . Twenty-six thousand women returned to work during one week in Bridgeport after having won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to strike . The revolt of a part made victory for all . The city 's employers in every trade were obliged to meet the standard . ' Have you the eighthour day ? " a customer demanded of a saleswoman at one of the largest retail stores . " Sure , we have , " she beamed ; got it last summer along with the rest of the town . No , we do n't have a union , but we can always leave and get a job in the Arms Company if we like . " That " job in the Arms Company " lies at the bottom of all Bridgeport 's industrial conflict . The employers are always conscious of it and the workers never forget it . " The worst thing that ever happened to Bridgeport was the coming of the Remington Arms Company , " declared a retired manufacturer , ex-mayor of the town . " They 've completely upset the labor market , demoralized it . Why , now , when you want to hire a man , do you ask him for references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes his demands on you about time and wages and takes or leaves the job as he likes . " " Yes , " broke in the banker , " things used to be all right in Bridgeport before the Remington people came here , We never had agitators marching down our streets , stirring  |p556  up our workmen to demand double wages and short hours . They 've actually offered to take on any men laid off at other plants for making trouble . I do n't see what we 're coming to . " " I have a letter in my pocket , " said another manufacturer . written to one of my own machinists . asking him why he kept on working long hours for poor pay , when the Arms Company stood ready to give him for eight hours more than he now earned in ten . That letter is signed by one of the Remington officials . I had to raise the wages , of course . " Along with testimony like this should be put that of the shopkeeper , that never were his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , that deposits have mounted with each month of high wages , so that every bank has had to stay open one night in the week to handle workmen 's accounts ; and of the amusement makers , who are coining money . Morning performances have been given at some of the " movie " houses to meet the demands of the shift which knocks off at eleven at night and goes to work at three in the afternoon . The one public library has doubled the seating capacity of its reading-room . In the morning this room is filled with husky young men who probably never were in a library at that time of the day before . For the first time in their lives a space for reading , for leisure , has occurred . It 's not surprising if they are still a bit shamefaced about being seen with a book instead of a dinner-pail . Got ta go somewhere , " growled one burly workman to another , as they climbed the stairs to the reading-room . " A man ca n't sit in a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon " Ten-Hour-a-Day " case now pending before the Supreme Court there has been filed a remarkable brief which sets forth in novel language " the world 's experience on which legislation limiting the hours of labor is based . " In this brief it is contended that the good effect of the shorter working day is conspicuous by the growth of temperance , which results automatically when working hours have been reduced . " The brief quotes the book of an English steel manufacturer , " The Shorter Working Day , " describing the reduction of hours from twelve to eight in a manufacturing establishment in Northwich , England , as follows : " We have never had any reason to regret the change . To the men it has had the material effect of improving their health and decreasing the amount of drunkenness , which was very great indeed , " and " here is positive evidence that the bane of this country , drunkenness , can be traced to the inhuman hours of labor . " Again , in commenting upon the general Australasian standard of work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in spite of high wages and short hours , the consumption of spirits has greatly decreased in the colonies . Indeed , the active agitation of the publicans against the eight-hour day proves that they did not anticipate any increase in their profits through the increase in the ccmforts of a laboring man 's life . " The brief sets forth American experience by quoting a report made to Congress by the United States Committee on Labor ( 1901 ? 2 ) ( House Report No. 1793 ) , which confirms the argument that " the additional leisure given to labor in every instance of the shortening of the work day has resulted in a decrease of intemperance among laborers , " and goes on to the flat statement that the " proposition that without variation the elimination of intemperance , poverty , pauperism , ignorance , crime , and the accompanying evils , moves parallel with and proportionate to the increase of the social opportunities of the laboring class , stands without impeachment of its historical accuracy . " Against this testimony Bridgeport 's police force is inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first part of 1915 in arrests for crimes growing out of intemperance . Investigators place in rebuttal facts to prove that of the seven licensed dance halls in the city , in three liquor is openly sold ; that none of the public school buildings is used as a community or social center ; that the Young Women 's Christian Association has just made an appeal for funds to increase their admittedly inadequate facilities ; that the City Planning Commission has reported that with " the great increase in population there has been very little increase in park acreage ; " that many workmen are unable to bring their families to the city because of lack of housing accommodations ; and , finally , that up to a very recent date no action seems to have been taken to develop , either privately or from a community view-point , public recreation or to attempt the public supervision of private amusements .
