And if they were merely made up to cause talk , certainly they succeeded . Perhaps if somebody less tricky than Peter Mink and Tommy Fox had started these odd tales , the rest of the wild folk might have been quicker to believe them . Anyhow , the news offered the best of excuses for gossip . And many of the field- and forest-people repeated it so often that they almost began to believe it themselves . All but old Mr. Crow . He declared stoutly that the whole thing was nothing but a hoax . " You ca n't fool me ! " he told people . But when they said that they had no intention of trying to , he had to change his statement . " I mean "  - -  he explained --  " I mean that neither Tommy Fox nor Peter Mink can fool me . They ca n't make me believe that they 've seen anybody hanging by his tail in a tree-top . " " Why not ? " asked Mr. Crow 's cousin , Jasper Jay . " Becaws --  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " Because , " he replied , " no ' possum ever came so far North as this . I 've spent a good many winters in the South , and I ought to know . And besides , " he added , " although a ' possum can hang by his tail , there never was one that could throw a stick or a stone . And I ought to know , for I 've spent a good many winters in the South , where the ' possums live . " Everybody had to admit that old Mr. Crow must know what he was talking about . And people began to feel rather foolish when they realized how near they had been to letting those two rascals -- Peter Mink and Tommy Fox -- deceive them . As for old Mr. Crow , having persuaded his neighbors to his way of thinking , he began to be more pleased with himself than ever . And he spent a good deal of time sitting in a tall tree near the cornfield , with his head on one side , hoping that his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that agreeable pastime one afternoon when -- thump ! something struck the limb on which he was perched . Mr. Crow gave a squawk and a jump . And then he glanced quickly toward the ground . There was no one anywhere in sight . So Mr. Crow looked somewhat silly . For a moment he had thought that Johnnie Green had thrown something at him . But he saw at once that he was mistaken . Of course it could have been nothing more than a dead branch falling . He settled himself again , trying to appear as if he had n't been startled , when -- plump ! something gave him a smart blow on his back . Old Mr. Crow flopped hastily into a neighboring tree . And this time he looked up instead of down . At first he could see nothing unusual . And he had almost made up his mind that something had fallen out of the sky , when a head showed itself from behind a limb and a queer , wrinkled face peered at him . Mr. Crow did not recognize the face . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never seen an odder . But if he thought the face a queer one , it was not half as peculiar as the stranger 's actions . For , as Mr. Crow watched him , the stranger slipped into full view , hanging by his tail and one hand from a limb , while with the other hand he waved a red cap . Old Mr. Crow 's mouth fell open . For a time he said never a word . And for him , that was quite out of the ordinary . II No ' Possum At first old Mr. Crow could scarcely believe his eyes . He stared and stared . Certainly it was no ' possum that he saw . And yet the stranger was hanging by his tail . There could be no doubt about that . Even as Mr. Crow watched him he waved both hands at Mr. Crow , and swung by his tail alone . The old gentleman was terribly upset . During all the summers he had spent in Pleasant Valley he had never seen any such person there before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wondered if he was not ill . He knew he had eaten a good deal of corn that day . And he half hoped that that was the trouble -- that perhaps he saw something that was n't really in the tree at all . Then he remembered the blow on his back . Had the queer person in the tree-top struck him ? ... Mr. Crow grew angry . " Did you hit me ? " he called . " I 'm not sure , " said the stranger . " But I think I did , for I saw you jump . " " Then you threw something at me ! " Mr. Crow screamed . " Oh , no ! " the other replied . " I did n't throw anything at you , sir . I merely dropped something on your back . " Mr. Crow choked . Perhaps it was as well that he could not speak just then . He coughed and spluttered and swallowed and swayed back and forth , trying to get his breath . And he had begun , at last to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but knocked him over . The stranger gave a shrill whistle . " I threw something that time ! " he jeered . Old Mr. Crow felt that he had been terribly insulted . He looked as dignified as he could . And he would have turned his back on the stranger -- had he dared . While he was wondering whether he had better fly away , or stay and quarrel with the rude person who had pelted him , the boorish stranger leaped from the tall tree into the smaller one where Mr. Crow was sitting . Then , dropping nimbly from limb to limb , with the help of his hands and his feet and his tail , he stopped at last when he had reached Mr. Crow 's level . One thing was certain . The stranger was bold as brass . He looked Mr. Crow up and down . And then he said : " You 're a gay old bird ! What 's your name ? " Now , no doubt some people would have been angry . But Mr. Crow rather liked to be called gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people knew he was very old . And everybody was aware he was a bird . So he said hoarsely : " My name is Mister Crow -- and please do n't forget the Mister . " The stranger put on his flat-topped red cap and touched the visor smartly with his right hand , in a military manner . Old Mr. Crow could n't help admiring the newcomer 's clothes . He that you have on , " Mr. Crow observed . " I should n't mind having one like it myself . " The stranger seemed pleased . And he touched his cap again . " I 'm afraid you ca n't have a suit like this , " he said . " It 's a uniform -- that 's what it is . And , of course , a plain Mister like you ca n't wear a uniform . But I wear one because I 'm a soldier . " Old Mr. Crow was disappointed . But he soon brightened up . Though he was n't a soldier himself , at least it was pleasant to know one . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger . " What 's your name ? " he asked . " Major Monkey , " said the newcomer , knocking off his cap with one hand and catching it with the other as it fell . " When you speak to me , please do n't forget the Major , " he added . III Getting Acquainted Major Monkey and old Mr. Crow had a long talk . They got on famously together , because the old gentleman liked to pry into other people 's affairs and the Major loved to talk about himself . In reply to Mr. Crow 's questions , Major Monkey explained that he was a great traveller . And having found himself in the village a few miles away , he had taken a notion to see the surrounding country . " This is a delightful spot , " the Major remarked . " And if your neighbors are half as pleasant as you are , I think I 'll stay right here for the present . " Naturally , old Mr. Crow was flattered . He could n't remember when anybody had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pleasant Valley , " he told Major Monkey . " As for the neighbors -- well , you 'll find them a queer lot , mostly . " " What 's the matter with them ? " the Major asked him . Thereupon old Mr. Crow shook his head . " They 're not at all like me , " he replied slowly . " Of course , there 's my cousin , Jasper Jay . He 's not a bad sort -- except that he 's rude , noisy , and a good deal of a rascal . But the others -- well , most of them are too greedy . If I did n't watch this cornfield closely some of them would n't care if they did n't leave a single kernel for anybody else . " " Do you like corn ? " the Major inquired . Mr. Crow swallowed once or twice before answering . " I can eat it , " he said finally . " It keeps one alive , you know . But if you 've never had any , I advise you not to touch it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Mr. Crow . " I 'm delighted to be of help to a stranger . And if there is anything else I can do , do n't hesitate to call on me . " Major Monkey thanked him again . And then he said : " I 'd like to get acquainted with all the neighbors -- such as they are . And I would suggest that you give a party and invite me and a lot of people to come to it , so I can meet them . " Old Mr. Crow bit his tongue . It struck him that Major Monkey was just the least bit too forward . " What about refreshments ? " Mr. Crow asked him . " It 's easy to see that you do n't know the neighbors . I can tell you that they have enormous appetites -- every one of them . " " Oh ! that 's easily arranged , " said Major Monkey . " Tell everybody to be sure to have his refreshments before he comes to the party . " " A good idea ! " Mr. Crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a party , for he quite liked the prospect of introducing everybody to " his old friend , Major Monkey . " " You 're sure you do n't know anybody in this valley except me ? " Mr. Crow asked . He did n't want to divide with anyone else the honor of being a friend of anybody so imposing as the Major . " I have n't spoken to a soul but you , " Major Monkey assured him . Mr. Crow said he was glad of that . And then he asked the Major to keep out of sight until the time came for the party to begin . At first Major Monkey objected . And not until Mr. Crow promised to have the party that very day -- an hour before sunset -- did he consent to hide himself . " Where 's a good place ? " he asked Mr. Crow . " That tree is hollow , " said Mr. Crow , pointing to the one in which he had first seen the Major . " Just slip inside that hole there , about half way up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " Major Monkey scrambled back into the tall tree . And Mr. Crow watched him narrowly until he was out of sight . Indeed , the old gentleman even continued to stare at the hole after his friend had vanished inside it . IV Wanted -- A Lodging Afterward old Mr. Crow had to admit that he must have been forgetful . He had told Major Monkey to hide inside the hollow tree . And being a total stranger in the neighborhood , of course the Major did n't know that an owl lived there . So he entered the dark hole boldly . And soon he came dashing out of it much faster than he had gone in , shrieking at the top of his voice . Old Mr. Crow was poised on a branch , as if he were waiting for something . And he almost smiled as he looked at the Major and saw that he was shaking . The poor fellow 's teeth were chattering , too . " What 's the matter ? " Mr. Crow called to him . " There's -- there 's a Tiger inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's a Tiger , for I saw his eyes . " " Nonsense ! " Mr. Crow exclaimed . And he burst into a loud haw-haw . " It 's nothing but an old Owl . I forgot all about him . A fine soldier you are -- afraid of an old Owl ! " Major Monkey straightened his cap and looked as soldierly as he could . " You 're mistaken , in a way , " he told Mr. Crow . " I admit I was afraid . I was afraid I had frightened him , waking him up so suddenly . So I retreated . " Old Mr. Crow stopped laughing and looked very thoughtful . It occurred to him that Major Monkey was a somewhat slippery person . Certainly he could slip out of a hole about as easily as anybody Mr. Crow knew . " You 'll have to find some other place for me to hide , " the Major announced . " I do n't want to stay in this tree all day , for I should n't like to disturb a gentleman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You see that old haystack ? " he said at last , pointing across the fields . " Go and burrow under that . And be back here exactly an hour before sunset . " Major Monkey saluted . " That suits me , " he said . And then he turned and scurried down to the ground , leaped quickly upon the fence , and galloped off along the topmost rails . * * * * * Mr. Crow spent a very busy day inviting everybody to his party , to meet his old friend , Major Monkey . " He 's a famous soldier , " Mr. Crow explained , when people asked him questions . " And I hope you 'll all wear your best clothes , because the Major himself is very handsomely dressed . There 's gold braid on his coat , and on his cap , too . " The old gentleman talked so much about the Major 's uniform that a good many of the neighbors thought that Mr. Crow ought to postpone his party for a few days , until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them some new clothes . But Mr. Crow would n't listen to them . " No ! " he said . " We must n't wait . My friend the Major is a great traveller . There 's no knowing when he will take it into his head to move on . And if you want to meet him there 's no time like the present . " Well , people were so busy getting ready for the party that there was a great flurry everywhere all day long -- except at the haystack , where Major Monkey was hiding . And even he did not have so dull a time as you might suppose . Luckily , he had discovered a lone apple tree near-by . And being fond of fruit he crept out of the haystack every few minutes and gathered apples . What he could eat , he ate greedily . And what he could n't he hid under the stack . And on the whole , he had rather a pleasant time . V Meeting Major Monkey Everybody was prompt when the hour came for Mr. Crow 's party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Mr. Crow had talked so much about his old friend Major Monkey and the Major 's gold-braided uniform that people simply could n't wait to see the stranger and his fine clothes . There was just one difficulty : the Major himself was not on hand . Old Mr. Crow began to be terribly worried . But he tried not to let anybody know that he was disturbed . " He 'll be here soon , " he said when people asked him where Major Monkey was . " I 've never known my friend the Major to break an engagement . He 's a bit late -- that 's all . I only hope he is n't lost . You know he 's a stranger in these parts . " Now , Mr. Crow was sitting in a tree , gazing toward the haystack in the distance , where he had told the Major to hide . And he had hardly finished speaking when a big red apple struck the tree just above his head with a loud smack and broke into bits . Mr. Crow jumped . And so did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scatter , Major Monkey peeped from behind a neighboring tree and uttered a piercing whistle . " Do n't go , friends ! " Mr. Crow cried to his companions . " Here he is now ! Here 's Major Monkey himself .... That 's only one of his jokes , " he added , for he noticed that some of his cronies appeared somewhat nervous . Major Monkey drew nearer . His face bore a wide grin ; while in his hand he clutched another red apple , which he threatened playfully to throw at the company . " Do n't do that , Major ! " Mr. Crow called . " You might get hungry , you know . And if you do , you can eat that apple . " Major Monkey touched his cap to Mr. Crow . He seemed to think that was good advice , for he lowered the hand that held the apple . On hearing Mr. Crow 's suggestion the whole company began to laugh . They seemed to think that Mr. Crow was joking . " Who ever heard of anybody going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And turning to Mr. Crow , he asked him where the refreshments were . The old gentleman seemed taken aback . " I declare , " he gasped , " I forgot to tell you all to have your refreshments before you came . " " Is n't there going to be anything to eat ? " Fatty Coon asked him anxiously . Mr. Crow shook his head . " It really does n't matter , " he said , talking very fast . " You know , I invited everybody to meet my old friend , Major Monkey . And here he is , all ready to tell you about his travels . But first we 'll have a little music . " It was now the Major 's turn to look uneasy . " Music ! " he echoed . " I hope you have n't gone and got a hand-organ ! " " No -- not that ! " said Mr. Crow . " The Woodchuck brothers are going to whistle for us . " " Oh ! " said the Major , who appeared much relieved . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care for that sort of music . I 've heard too much of it on my travels . " At a signal from Mr. Crow , the Woodchuck brothers stepped forward and started to whistle a lively tune , called " Clover Blossoms . " Being very fond of clover blossoms , the musicians began whistling in a most spirited fashion . But they had bad luck . Though he did not know the tune , Major Monkey insisted on whistling , too . And all the company stopped up their ears , except Mr. Crow . He stood the noise as long as he could . And then he ordered the whistlers to stop . " What tune were you whistling ? " he asked the Major . " It 's called ' Banana Blossoms , ' " Major Monkey explained . " You see , I 'm very fond of bananas . " Old Mr. Crow laughed . " The two tunes do n't go well together , " he said . " So we wo n't have any more music . " And Fatty Coon cried that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about things to eat it only made him hungrier than ever . VI Too Many Disputes On the whole , Mr. Crow 's party would have been a great success if it had n't been for Peter Mink and Tommy Fox . As soon as Major Monkey showed himself , after throwing the apple at Mr. Crow , those two began whispering slyly together . And when the Major climbed a tree and hung from a limb by his tail they both jumped up and said to Mr. Crow : " We saw Major Monkey before you ever did ! " Mr. Crow promptly flew into a rage . " You did not ! " he squalled . " Yes , we did ! " they declared . " We told people several days ago that we had seen a stranger hanging by his tail ; and nobody believed us because you said it was n't possible . You said nobody but a ' possum could do that , and that no ' possum ever came as far north as Pleasant Valley . " Old Mr. Crow was very angry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , he did not care to hear it . Certainly there was no use of his denying what they said . But an idea popped into his head . " Which of you saw the Major first ? " he asked . " I did ! " they both bawled at the same time . And then followed a terrible dispute : " You did n't ! I did ! I did ! You did n't ! " Now , that was exactly what Mr. Crow wanted . He had started Peter Mink and Tommy Fox to quarreling . " They 'll never agree , " Mr. Crow cried . " Let 's ask Major Monkey to settle the dispute ! Let 's leave it to him ! " And turning to his friend , the Major , Mr. Crow said : " Which of these two sharp-nosed rascals did you see first ? " Major Monkey took a bite out of his apple while he looked closely at Peter Mink and Tommy Fox . " I never saw either of them until I came to this party , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , because they were whispering together . " " There ! " Mr. Crow shouted to the whole company . " You hear what my old friend the Major says ? " Tommy Fox and Peter Mink stopped quarreling . " You did n't ask the Major the proper question ! " they objected . " We never said he saw us at all ! We said --  --  " But Mr. Crow waved them aside . " If you are n't too hungry , " he muttered to Major Monkey , " I 'd suggest that you let fly with that red apple . " The Major was only too willing . With deadly aim he flung the apple at Peter Mink and Tommy Fox . First it hit Peter on the nose , and then it bounced off and struck Tommy on his nose . And then the party came to an end in an awful uproar . For Peter and Tommy were very angry . Those that could fly flew away in a great hurry . And those that could run scampered quickly out of sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree and hung by his tail from a limb , where he swung backwards and forwards and made faces at Tommy Fox and Peter Mink until their rage was terrible to see . Mr. Crow did not desert his friend the Major . He remained in a tree near-by , to watch the fun . And there 's no telling how long it would have lasted had not Major Monkey pulled himself suddenly up on a limb and laid a hand across the front of his red coat . There was a look of pain upon his face . " What 's the matter ? " Mr. Crow asked him . " Are you wounded ? " he inquired . Knowing that the Major was a soldier , he could think of nothing but a wound that would make him act as he did . " I -- I 'm not sure , " Major Monkey replied . " It may be that I 've eaten too many apples . " VII The Major Has a Pain The party had come to an end ; nobody was left except old Mr. Crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast growing sleepy , for it was almost dark . And he wanted to fly home and go to bed . But he hardly felt that he ought to leave just then . There was no doubt that the Major was in great pain . He kept one hand pressed against the lowest button of his short red coat . His cap was awry . And his wrinkled face showed a careworn and anxious look . " How many apples have you eaten to-day ? " Mr. Crow asked his friend . " I have n't the slightest idea , " the Major answered . " After I had finished two dozen I lost count . " " My goodness ! " Mr. Crow exclaimed . " It 's no wonder you 're ill .... We 'll hurry over to the pasture and see Aunt Polly Woodchuck , the herb doctor . She 'll know what to do for you . " Major Monkey was more than willing . So they set out at once . The Major travelled through the tree-tops where he could , while Mr. Crow flew slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overtake him . In a little while they came to the pasture . And Major Monkey was glad to find Aunt Polly at home . Illustration : Aunt Polly Woodchuck Offered Him an Apple She was a wise old lady . She knew right away , without being told , that it was Major Monkey -- and not Mr. Crow -- that was ill . " You 're in pain , " she remarked to the Major . " I knew it the moment I set eyes on you . " Major Monkey moaned faintly . " I hope you 'll give me something to make me feel better , " he wailed . " I will , " Aunt Polly Woodchuck promised . And putting her hand inside a basket that she carried on her arm , she drew forth a red apple . " Here ! " she said , " eat this ! " Major Monkey drew back . " No ! " he groaned . " I do n't want any more apples . I 've had too many already . " Aunt Polly Woodchuck shot a triumphant look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . And she dropped the red apple back into her basket . " Now , " she went on , turning again to the Major , " I should like to ask whether you 're fond of corn . " Old Mr. Crow stepped forward quickly . " I object ! " he cried . " The less said about corn , the better ! " Aunt Polly Woodchuck hastened to explain that she meant no offense to anyone . " I merely wondered , " she said , " whether you gave your guests corn to eat at your party . " " Certainly not ! " Mr. Crow exploded . " Certainly not ! " And he glared at the old lady as if to say : " Change the subject -- for pity 's sake ! " " You 're a stranger in these parts , I take it , " Aunt Polly said , turning once more to Major Monkey . " No doubt you 've been used to eating different food from what you get hereabouts . " " That 's so , " the Major admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a baked potato now and then . " " Ah ! Cooked food ! " said Aunt Polly . " And if you had that sort of fare , you must have been living with men . " The Major looked uneasy . " I do n't care to talk about my past , " he murmured . " Just you give me something to warm my stomach a bit . That 's all I ask of you . " Well , Aunt Polly Woodchuck handed him some peppermint leaves . " Chew these , " she directed him . " And if you do n't feel better to-morrow I 'll lose my guess . " Major Monkey put the leaves into his mouth and made a wry face . " Have n't you a lump of sugar to make this dose taste better ? " he asked her . " There ! " Aunt Polly cried . " You 've been fed by men ! I knew it all the time . " Major Monkey made no comment on her remark . And settling his cap firmly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he and Mr. Crow went off . " Where are you going to spend the night ? " Mr. Crow asked him as soon as they were out of Aunt Polly 's hearing . " That haystack is a good place , " said the Major . " I believe I 'll live there as long as I stay in Pleasant Valley . " " It 's not far from the farmhouse , " Mr. Crow observed . " Perhaps you could steal -- er -- I mean find a little cooked food there now and then . " " That 's an idea , " Major Monkey told him . But he did not explain whether he thought it a good one or not . VIII A Secret When Major Monkey awoke the following morning his pain had left him . Creeping from the haystack where he had slept , he cast longing eyes at the red apples in the tree near-by . But he remembered his trouble of the evening before . And he remembered likewise what Mr. Crow had said about " finding " something to eat at the farmhouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green 's house . To be sure , he would have enjoyed sitting down with the family at the breakfast table . But he was afraid something might prevent his leaving after he had eaten . Luckily Major Monkey was a person who could usually find a way out of any difficulty . And now he made up his mind that a light meal of eggs was the very thing he needed in order to begin the day right . So he went straight to the woods and climbed the first tree he came to -- a pine tree just beyond the fence . There Major Monkey found exactly what he was looking for . In a warbler 's nest , a dozen feet from the ground , he beheld five speckled eggs . The owners of the nest were not at home . But knowing that one or the other would soon return , the Major did not care to linger long over their treasures . He noticed that one of the eggs was bigger than the others . " Really there are too many eggs here for this small nest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the big one I 'll be doing the owners a favor . " So he picked up the big egg , and holding it carefully in one hand he hurried away . When he had put some distance between himself and the nest , Major Monkey stopped to enjoy his breakfast . He was just on the point of opening the egg , when who should come up but old Mr. Crow . The Major quickly hid his breakfast behind his back . " Good morning ! " said Mr. Crow . " I hope you are feeling better to-day . " " Oh , yes -- thank you ! " said Major Monkey . " I 'm quite well again . " Mr. Crow 's sharp eyes pierced him through and through . " What are you holding behind you ? " he asked bluntly . The Major saw that he was caught . " It 's my breakfast , " he confessed , giving Mr. Crow a quick glance at what was in his hand . " I -- I found it , " he said . " Was n't I lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crow exclaimed disapprovingly . " What kind is it ? " " It 's nothing but a Warbler 's egg , " Major Monkey replied . The old gentleman smiled knowingly . And feeling more comfortable , Major Monkey opened his hand and gave Mr. Crow a good look at his prize . " That 's too big for a Warbler 's egg ! " Mr. Crow cried . " I found it in a Warbler 's nest , " Major Monkey insisted . " Were there any more like this one in the nest ? " Mr. Crow asked . " Oh , yes ! " the Major answered . " Were they as big as this egg ? " Mr. Crow inquired . Major Monkey explained that they were not . " Just as I supposed ! " the old gentleman exclaimed . " This is n't a Warbler 's egg . It 's a Cowbird 's egg . And you 've done that Warbler family a good turn by taking it out of their nest . " I know Mrs. Cowbird , " he went on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So she sneaks through the woods and lays her eggs in other folk 's nests .... I must tell of this , " Mr. Crow added . " People will think very kindly of you when they hear what you have done . " But Major Monkey begged him not to mention the matter to anyone . He pleaded so hard that at last Mr. Crow consented to keep the affair a secret between them . And Mr. Crow could n't help thinking that Major Monkey was one of the most modest people he had ever met . Then the Major opened the egg with great skill , and ate its contents without spilling a drop . " Now , " he said , " now I 'm ready for business . " IX The Major Has a Plan " What is your business , if I may ask ? " Mr. Crow inquired of Major Monkey . " Lately I 've been spending my time travelling , " the Major replied . " But you know I 'm a soldier . And while I 'm in Pleasant Valley I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked somewhat worried when he heard that . " I hope you are n't going to guard the cornfield ! " he said hastily . Major Monkey set his fears at rest . " We 'll let Farmer Green do that , " he said with a wink . " This is what we 'll do : we 'll band ourselves together and we 'll fight any strangers that come to Pleasant Valley to live . " " That 's not a bad plan , " Mr. Crow remarked . " But it 's lucky for you that you did n't form the army before you got here yourself -- else we 'd have had to fight you . " " Of course ! " Major Monkey agreed . " But trust me not to make such a mistake as that . " " Who 's going to be in the army ? " Mr. Crow wanted to know . " Everybody ! " the Major answered , with a wave of the hand that took in the whole valley . For as long as a minute old Mr. Crow was very thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless I can be a general , " he announced at last . " Why , certainly ! " said Major Monkey . " Certainly you shall be a general , Mr. Crow . " Mr. Crow swelled himself up and looked as important as he could . " Get everybody to come to the edge of the woods , near the pasture , early to-morrow morning , " Major Monkey commanded . " Are n't you going to do any of the work ? " Mr. Crow demanded . " I thought generals did n't have to do anything except look wise . " " It 's easier for you to get about than it is for me . But as soon as we have our army together I 'll take entire charge of it , " Major Monkey informed him . Mr. Crow was satisfied . After all , it would n't really be work , he told himself , to fly around and tell the people the news . In fact , the more he thought about the plan the better he liked it . So he bade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had flown out of sight the Major rolled over and over on the ground . And then he climbed a tree and swung by his tail from a limb , while he made an odd , chuckling sound . " A general ! " he said . " General Crow ! Why he never wore a uniform in all his life ! " On the following morning the field-and forest-folk began gathering at the edge of the woods near the pasture almost before it was light . And when Major Monkey left his snug bed in the haystack and went to the meeting-place he found an eager throng waiting for him . Old Mr. Crow was flitting about , talking in a loud voice , and ordering people around to his heart 's content . " Silence ! " Major Monkey commanded , as soon as he arrived . Mr. Crow opened his mouth to speak . But Major Monkey cut him off short . " The first thing a soldier has to learn is to obey , " he barked . " But I 'm a general ! " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so you 'll have to obey ' em , " said Major Monkey glibly . And poor old Mr. Crow did n't know what to say to that . But he could n't help looking rather grumpy . X The New Army " Now , then -- fall in ! " Major Monkey shouted to the whole company of field-and forest-folk . But nobody had the slightest idea what he meant . " You do n't suppose he expects us to fall in the brook , do you ? " Tommy Fox asked his nearest neighbor . If there was anything that Tommy disliked , it was getting his feet wet . Major Monkey soon saw that nobody knew what to do . " Form a long line , two deep ! " he directed . And then there was trouble , because everyone wanted to be in the front rank ( as Major Monkey called it ) in order to see everything . After a good deal of jostling and squirming on the part of the company , and much loud talk on the part of Major Monkey , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the pasture-fence . Major Monkey seemed much pleased as he walked up and down in front of his soldiers . And then he happened to glance up . There was Mr. Crow , perched on a limb over his head . " Here , you ! " the Major shouted . " Did n't you hear me say ' Fall in ? ' " " Certainly ! " said Mr. Crow . " But I 'm a general , you know . " " Well , what of that ? " the Major snapped . " So are all these people generals ! You did n't think -- did you ?  - -  that I 'd have anybody in my army that was n't at least a general ? " For a wonder , Mr. Crow said never a word . He was angry . But he did n't want to be left out of the army . So he decided that he had better obey . And he flapped down and took his place just in front of the front rank . " You must n't stand there ! " Major Monkey said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's no place left for you . So you 'll have to stand behind all the others . " That was just a little more than old Mr. Crow could bear . " I 'll do nothing of the sort ! " he squawked . " And I must say that this is shabby treatment to receive from an old friend . " Major Monkey certainly did n't want any trouble right at the beginning . So he hastened to soothe Mr. Crow 's wounded feelings . " Look here , " he said to the old gentleman , " if I were you I should n't care to be a common general . " " What else can I be ? " asked Mr. Crow with a hopeful gleam in his eye . " You can be the cook , " the Major suggested . " There are dozens of generals ; but you 'd be the only cook , you see . " Mr. Crow rather liked that idea . " I accept your offer , " he said somewhat stiffly . And then he marched down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monkey breathed a sigh of relief . He was glad that the trouble had proved no worse . And now he turned once more to inspect the crowd of generals that was to make up his army . " Here , you ! " he said suddenly , pointing to a brownish gentleman at one end of the front rank . " What 's your name ? " " Rusty Wren ! " was the meek reply . " Do n't stick your tail up in the air like that ! " Major Monkey cried . " You 're spoiling the looks of the whole army . " Rusty Wren replied that it was very hard for him to keep his tail down for longer than a few moments at a stretch . " I do n't believe I 'll be in the army , " he announced . " Probably my wife is wondering where I am this moment . So I 'm going home . " And thereupon he flew away toward Farmer Green 's dooryard , where he lived . " Well , we 're rid of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he noticed something else that was n't as it should have been . " Here , you ! " he called to Peter Mink . " Pull in your neck ! It 's too long ! It sticks out and spoils the looks of the whole army . " Now , Peter Mink was a rude fellow . And he made such a rude reply that Major Monkey discharged him on the spot . " Go away ! " he cried . " We do n't want any rowdies in our army . " XI War in the Woods Although Major Monkey had ordered him out of the army , Peter Mink declared that he was n't going till he was ready to leave . " Very well , " said the Major easily . " You may stay here ; and we 'll go . " But Peter Mink was an obstinate fellow . The moment the army started to move , he went along with it . And what was worse , he insisted on walking right behind Major Monkey , and trying to strut just as the Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And of course Major Monkey could n't overlook such behavior . " Order in the ranks ! " he shouted as fiercely as he knew how . The generals stopped tittering at once . For a minute or two everybody marched on in silence . And then the cry , " Halt ! " rang suddenly out . The generals all stopped . Major Monkey stopped , too . And his face seemed more wrinkled than ever as he looked every general in the face . Naturally , that took some time , for there were several dozens of them . " Who shouted ' Halt ? ' " the Major asked at last . But nobody knew . At least , nobody answered . And there was a good deal of low talking and craning of necks . For some reason or other , everybody peered at Peter Mink . But he stared straight ahead in the most innocent fashion . Major Monkey said nothing more . But he walked behind the army and picked up a stick . " Forward , march ! " he commanded then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk in the rear , just behind old Mr. Crow . Soon the cry , " Halt ! " sounded again . And as soon as he heard it , Major Monkey threw his stick with great force and caught Peter Mink neatly in the back of his head . Peter Mink toppled over where he stood . " There ! " Major Monkey remarked . " He wo n't bother us any more to-day . " And before the army had stopped gasping , he marched it forward again , leaving Peter Mink stretched upon the ground . Some of the generals objected , and said that they thought that Peter Mink ought to be looked after . But Major Monkey told them that they were in the army , and that it was war , and they must expect even worse things to happen . Now , Jimmy Rabbit was a tender-hearted chap . He could n't bear the thought of leaving even a rascal like Peter Mink wounded and alone . " I think you ought to send the cook back to take care of him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the cook -- spoke up and said that he was going to stay with the army . " I do n't see , " he said , " how you could get along without me . An army without a cook is as good as lost . " Major Monkey promptly agreed with Mr. Crow . " Certainly we must n't get lost , " he said . " If we were lost , the enemy never could find us . And we might wander about in the woods for years and years . " His remarks made some of the generals a bit uneasy . And one of them -- a soldier called Billy Woodchuck -- announced that he would have to be leaving . XII Over and Under When Billy Woodchuck talked about leaving the army , Major Monkey became greatly excited . He muttered something under his breath about deserters , and shooting them at sunrise . And he strutted up to Billy Woodchuck and asked him what he meant by quitting the army without permission . Though Billy Woodchuck hung his head , he insisted that he must go home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand guard in the clover-patch , while my father and some other old gentlemen feast on clover-tops . " " Are they expecting an attack ? " Major Monkey inquired , pricking up his ears . " Of course not ! " said Billy Woodchuck . " They 're not expecting one , or they would stay safe at home . But you never can tell what old dog Spot is going to do . My father and his friends would be disappointed if I did n't come . They would be angry , too . And just as likely as not I 'd be put to bed an hour before sunset . So I shall go home now , whether you give me leave or not . " " Then I 'll give you leave -- if that 's the case , " said Major Monkey . " I ca n't have anybody disobeying orders ; so I 'll give you leave . And I 'll dismiss the army until to-morrow .... The last man over the fence will be shot at sunrise , " he added . It seemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , everyone turned and ran like the wind . Naturally , nobody wanted to be last , after what Major Monkey had said . It looked , for a few moments , as if the whole army was going to cross the fence at the same instant . But Billy Woodchuck was so unlucky as to step into a hole . He fell head over heels . And by the time he had picked himself up and reached the fence all the rest were safe on the other side of it . Things looked very dark for Billy Woodchuck -- especially when Major Monkey grinned horribly at him between the rails and said : " Too bad , my boy ! But this is war , you know .... Please do n't forget the time ! To-morrow , at sunrise ! " Billy Woodchuck 's heart sank . He wished he had never joined the army . And then an idea came to him . It was such a simple one that it is a wonder he had n't thought of it instantly . Instead of going over the fence , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was vastly relieved . Even Major Monkey appeared to be delighted . " I 'm afraid "  - -  he said with a smile --  " I 'm afraid we 'll have to shoot the rest of the army at sunrise , for they went over the fence last . " But Mr. Crow spoke up and said : " Nonsense ! The rest of us went over first ! " Major Monkey had to admit that that was true . And he showed plainly that he was disappointed . Although he did not look the least bit cruel , it was clear that he had looked forward to shooting -- and the more the merrier . " It 's really a great pity , " he said , " that we ca n't have a shot at somebody . " XIII The Major Hesitates Major Monkey 's army soon became known far and wide . Its fame reached beyond Pleasant Valley , to the other side of Blue Mountain . And a good many persons who had been in the habit of making excursions into the valley now and then began to think that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good deal to do with spreading the news . He took several long trips , just to tell people that the army was ready -- and eager -- to fight all strangers . In fact , the Major said he wished Mr. Crow would mind his own affairs . For how was the army ever going to fight , if all the enemies kept out of its way ? All the generals began to tell one another that Major Monkey was a very brave soldier . And certainly he said nothing to change their opinion of him . He was always telling how much he liked to fight , and complaining that he was only wasting his valuable time in Pleasant Valley . In a way the Major was right . And probably there never would have been the least trouble if Johnnie Green and his friends had n't happened to have a picnic in the woods on the same day and in the same spot that the Major had chosen to call his generals together . Illustration : " You 're a Sneak-Thief ! " Jasper Jay said . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half-dozen other boys on hand to watch . So the generals lurked behind trees and wished that the picnickers would go away . Meanwhile Major Monkey himself sulked in the tree-tops , hidden high up among the leafy branches , where nobody would be likely to spy him . He watched the boys while they ate their luncheon , which they devoured as soon as they reached the picnic grove . And then he looked on while they played games -- hide-and-seek , and duck-on-the-rock , and follow-my-leader , and ever so many others . Now and then old Mr. Crow flew up and tried to talk with Major Monkey . But the Major had very little to say . And at last Mr. Crow lost all patience with him . " Are you going to sit here all day and do nothing ? " Mr. Crow demanded . " S-sh ! " Major Monkey said . " Do be quiet ! Do you want them to hear you ? " " I do n't care if they hear me , " Mr. Crow cried . " It 's plain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not driven away . " " No doubt ! " Major Monkey agreed , as he plucked a tender shoot off the tree and ate it . " But what can we do ? " " Do ! " said Mr. Crow . " What 's the army for -- I 'd like to know -- if not to fight ? " Major Monkey 's wrinkled face seemed somewhat pale . " Quite true ! " he agreed again . " But I 'm not sure we 're strong enough to do anything against these ruffians down below . I 'm not sure that I can depend on the army in a pinch . " To the Major 's great alarm , Mr. Crow squalled with rage . " You 've insulted me ! " he shrieked . And he made such a commotion that Major Monkey scampered off , beckoning to Mr. Crow to follow him . Just as they left , a stone came crashing through the leaves , thrown by some boy who had noticed Mr. Crow 's hoarse cries . And that made Major Monkey run all the faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had gone so far that the voices of the picnickers reached him only faintly . Old Mr. Crow , who had followed him closely , began to think that the Major was frightened . But he knew he must be mistaken when Major Monkey came to a halt and said : " Now we can talk without disturbing anybody . " So Mr. Crow repeated that in his opinion the Major had insulted him . " You 've just the same as said that I 'm a poor soldier ! " he declared . Major Monkey told him that it was not so . " It 's the generals that I ca n't trust , " he explained . " But you are different . You 're the cook , you remember . In the midst of a fight , you would n't be expected to cook . " " Then my part would be to do nothing at all ? " Mr. Crow inquired . " Exactly ! " Major Monkey cried . " And I 've no doubt that you 'd be a great success . " Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major 's remark pleased him . It made him all the more eager , too , to see the army attack Johnnie Green and his friends . " Let 's go back , " said Mr. Crow , " and drive those boys out of the picnic grove ! " But Major Monkey shook his head . " I do n't want to lose my army , " he said . " And besides we have n't any guns . " " You can throw stones , ca n't you ? " Mr. Crow asked him . " Oh , yes ! " said the Major . " Well , then -- if I were you I 'd get some stones down by the brook and go straight back to the grove and hurl them at the enemy . " He said so much more that at last Major Monkey yielded . And a little later he crept back through the tree-tops with all the stones he could carry . Hidden high above the heads of the picnic party , Major Monkey gave several short whistles . " The attack ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to see the fun . " Hullo ! " Johnnie Green shouted , stopping short in the midst of a game of leapfrog . " Who 's up there ? " And he peered into the greenery above . Nobody seemed to know the answer to his question . Certainly there was nobody missing from the picnic party . " I wonder if it 's Red Head ! " said Johnnie . " You remember he said he could n't come because he had work to-day . But he must have sneaked over here ahead of us and climbed a tree . " The words were scarcely out of Johnnie Green 's mouth when a small stone plunged down from the trees and struck one of his great toes . Being barefooted , Johnnie Green let out a yell . " Ouch ! " he cried . " It 's Red Head ! There 's no doubt about it . " If anybody else had any doubts , they faded quickly when a small shower of stones descended . " Stop that ! " the boys began to shout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with terrible punishments . Of course , Major Monkey was delighted . He knew that his army of generals could see -- and hear -- everything . And after he had thrown his last stone he felt so bold that he slipped down upon a lower limb , which gave him a better view of the picnic ground . One of the boys caught a glimpse of a queer figure above him . And with a shriek he turned and fled . His companions looked at him in wonder . And Johnnie Green could n't imagine what had happened , when his staring eyes beheld the Major hanging from a bough over his head . " It 's a monkey ! " Johnnie Green gasped . " Where in the world could he have come from ? " XV The Retreat Major Monkey quite enjoyed the amazement of the picnickers . And he did two very odd things , for the commander of an army : first he took off his red cap and made a low bow to Johnnie Green and his mates ; and next he swung off the limb of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys whooped with delight . " Let 's catch him ! " Johnnie Green cried . And then he shouted to the boy who had run away , and who stood a good , safe distance off , looking back and wondering what was going on . " Hi , Bill ! It 's a monkey ! " Johnnie bellowed . Bill came running back at top speed . " We 're going to catch him , " said Johnnie Green . " How 're we going to do that ? " asked the boy who had been frightened and run away and come back . Nobody answered him , for at that moment one of the youngsters flung a butternut at the Major , who caught the missile deftly and shot it back again . A howl of delight from the ground below greeted the Major 's ears . " Let 's stone him ! " somebody cried . But Johnnie Green said , " No ! We do n't want to hurt him . We 'll climb the tree and get him . " His friends agreed that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after another they began to shin up the tree where Major Monkey was still cutting his queer capers . The boys had no sooner started to climb after him than the Major gave a shrill whistle . He was calling for help . But there was not a general in sight anywhere . He could see not a single one of his whole army , except the cook , old Mr. Crow . And even he flapped away to a neighboring tree-top . As Mr. Crow remarked afterward , since he had to do nothing , he thought he could do it much better if he was n't too near . Major Monkey began to chatter . And Mr. Crow always declared that the Major trembled . There is no doubt that he was alarmed . He scrambled to the very top of the tree , while the boys went up , up , up -- until at last Major Monkey gave a scream and jumped into another -- and smaller -- tree , the top of which was far below him . He plunged , sprawling , through the leafy boughs until he managed to seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a squirrel . And long before the boys had reached the ground again Major Monkey was far away in the woods . * * * * * Mr. Crow took good care not to lose sight of Major Monkey . And when the Major at last stopped , panting , and slipped down to the ground to have a drink out of the brook , old Mr. Crow promptly joined him . " Aha ! " said Mr. Crow . " You were scared . You ran away ! " The Major wiped his mouth on the back of his hand and looked at Mr. Crow uneasily . " I came away -- yes ! " he said . Mr. Crow snorted . " A fine soldier you are ! " he cried scornfully . " You are n't brave enough to lead an army . I should think you 'd be ashamed . " Major Monkey seemed pained . He said it hurt him to have Mr. Crow say such cruel things . " It 's plain , " said he , " that you do n't know much about an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach you . Of course I had to leave . I 'm the leader of the army ; and I must keep out of danger . So when the generals failed to come to my rescue when I whistled for help there was nothing I could do except retreat . " For a long time Mr. Crow was silent . " You were scared , anyway , " he remarked at last . " I was n't ! " the Major protested . " You were ! " said Mr. Crow . " You were ! You were ! You were ! " Of course he was very ill-mannered . But Major Monkey was too polite to tell him so . Instead , he picked up a smooth stone out of the brook and threw it at Mr. Crow 's head . The old gentleman hopped aside just in time . And without waiting to dispute any further , he tore off as fast as he could go . " Now who 's scared ? " Major Monkey called after him . But old Mr. Crow did not stop to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Johnnie Green and his friends in the picnic grove , his generals declared that they wanted no leader that ran away from the enemy . And since they could n't agree on anyone else to take the Major 's place , they disbanded . So Major Monkey lost his army . But the loss did not seem to trouble him greatly . He was almost too cheerful . And his neighbors even claimed that his spirits rose higher each day . There is no doubt that the Major felt very gay . He was fast losing the lean and hungry look he had had when he first appeared in Pleasant Valley . And he became freer than ever as to manners . Nobody else could go about the woods with any comfort , because one never knew when he would have to dodge a stone . For Major Monkey liked nothing better than making a body jump -- unless it was bowling someone over when he failed to jump soon enough . In time the forest-folk grew quite weary of that sport . And they began to tell one another that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Monkey 's stone-throwing . But nobody could suggest any way to cure Major Monkey of his unpleasant habit . And at last Mr. Crow went to Aunt Polly Woodchuck and asked her if she could n't give the Major an herb of some sort to eat , which would make him stop wanting to pelt every head he saw . But Aunt Polly replied that it was n't possible . " The trouble with Major Monkey , " she said , " is that he eats too much as it is . And if I gave him still more food he would only throw more stones at you . " Mr. Crow exclaimed that he did n't want that to happen . " Then you 'll have to make the Major eat less , " said Aunt Polly Woodchuck . " On what sort of fare is he living at present ? " she inquired . Mr. Crow answered that he was n't quite sure , but he thought Major Monkey fed for the most part on cowbirds ' eggs . Aunt Polly Woodchuck shook her head . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't enough Cowbirds ' eggs in Pleasant Valley to make anybody so fat as the Major is getting . Unless I 'm mistaken , he 's taking the eggs of a good many others besides Cowbirds . " Mr. Crow became greatly excited . " Then he 's a thief ! " he squawked . " Major Monkey is an egg thief ! " And he flapped away across the pasture in a fine rage , to tell everybody what Aunt Polly Woodchuck had said . * * * * * A little later in the day Major Monkey began to notice that a good many of his neighbors looked at him very coldly . The birds , especially , glared at him as if they were actually angry . And wherever he went they set up a loud twittering . Some of them even flew at his head and tried to peck him as they darted past . At first he could n't imagine what was the matter . But before the day was done Jasper Jay let him know what made the bird people angry . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've found at last what makes you so fat . You 've been stealing eggs from every nest in the woods ! " " Tut ! Tut ! " said Major Monkey . " When a lazy Cowbird lays an egg in somebody else 's nest , the owner ought to be grateful to me for taking the egg out and eating it . " " It 's not that , " Jasper Jay replied . " The trouble is , you 've taken all kinds of eggs . " " Well , well ! " said Major Monkey . " To be sure , I may have made a mistake now and then . But what 's an egg or two , more or less , when one has a half-dozen of them ? " XVII Major Monkey Confesses Major Monkey seemed surprised when Jasper Jay told him that there was n't a bird family in the whole valley that felt it could spare a single egg . " Of course , " said Jasper , " nobody cares how many Cowbirds ' eggs you eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build nests of their own . And no respectable bird family likes to have a loutish young Cowbird to bring up with their own children . But you have gone too far . You have been stealing eggs right and left . And the time has come for us to put a stop to your thieving . " A number of Jasper Jay 's bird neighbors had gathered around him and Major Monkey while they talked . And they all spoke up and said in good , loud tones that Major Monkey was a villain -- and worse . Anyone might think that for once the Major would have acted the least bit ashamed . But he did not . He had not even the grace to say that he was sorry for making a few " mistakes . " Instead , he stuck his red cap on one side of his head and began dancing something that might have been a jig if it had been faster . His actions made all the birds very angry . And some of them exclaimed that there was no reason to make merry , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing and looked grieved . " Perhaps you would dance , too , if you had just had a good meal of eggs , " he remarked . A shriek went up from his listeners . And old Mr. Crow exclaimed loudly : " Put him out ! Put Major Monkey out ! " But nobody made a move . And Major Monkey turned to Mr. Crow and said : " What 's wrong ? Have I said something I should n't ? " " Said ! " the old gentleman echoed . " You 've not only said a terrible thing ; you 've done a still worse one ! For you 've just been stealing eggs again -- and you ca n't deny it . " A great clamor arose all at once . " Hear ! Hear ! " Mr. Crow 's friends cried . And Major Monkey had hard work to make himself heard . " Whose eggs do you think I 've been eating ? " he asked Mr. Crow . Not knowing the exact answer to the question , Mr. Crow pretended not to hear it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Major himself was not deceived . He winked at Mr. Crow and shied a pebble at him . " I 'll tell you , old boy ! " the Major cried . " I 've been eating hens ' eggs . " " Hens ' eggs ! " everybody repeated after him . " Hens ' eggs ! Where do you get ' em ? " " At Farmer Green 's henhouse , of course , " the Major answered . " I 've been going there regularly for some time . I find that the eggs are bigger than any I can find in the woods . " " It 's no wonder he 's getting fat , " Jasper Jay murmured as he gazed at Major Monkey . " You 'll have to stop eating so much , " Mr. Crow told the Major solemnly . " Aunt Polly Woodchuck says that the reason you throw so many stones is because you overeat and feel in too high spirits . " Major Monkey looked disgusted when he heard that speech . " Aunt Polly Fiddlesticks ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's talking about . Why , the more eggs I eat , the more time I must spend at the henhouse . And while I 'm there I ca n't throw stones here , can I ? " Everybody had to agree with the Major . At least , everybody but Mr. Crow remarked that what he said seemed true . " Now , friends , " said Major Monkey at last , " if there have been any eggs missing from your nests lately you ca n't blame me . " " Then whom can we blame ? " somebody cried . " I 'd hate to say , " was Major Monkey 's answer . But since he looked straight at Mr. Crow as he spoke , most of the company could not help thinking that the old gentleman was the thief , after all . And when he flew into a rage they felt quite sure he was guilty . " We always knew Mr. Crow was an old rascal ! " they exclaimed . And so Mr. Crow took himself off . But he soon recovered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And to tell the truth , he had taken a few eggs now and then -- when he thought no one was watching . XVIII Planning a Journey After they learned that Major Monkey was in the habit of going to Farmer Green 's henhouse for eggs , the wild folk began to have a better opinion of him once more . So long as he did n't steal birds ' eggs they were willing to overlook his stone-throwing -- if he did n't throw too many . Somehow they never seemed to think of Farmer Green 's loss . Or if they did , no doubt they thought that he had so many eggs that he would n't mind losing a few now and then . So it happened that Major Monkey found everybody most agreeable -- except old Mr. Crow , who never felt the same toward him again . But Major Monkey did not let Mr. Crow 's gruffness trouble him . He had so many other cronies that he frequently remarked that he had never spent a pleasanter summer . " I 've decided "  - -  he told Jolly Robin one day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've decided to stay right here in Pleasant Valley for the rest of my life . " " My gracious ! " Jolly Robin exclaimed . " Then you do n't mind cold weather . " Major Monkey asked him what he meant . And it surprised him to learn that all winter long deep snow lay upon the ground , and cold winds blew , and fierce storms often raged . Though it was a hot summer 's day , Major Monkey shivered at the mere mention of such things . And he pulled his red cap further down upon his head . " If that 's the case , " he said , " I certainly do n't want to spend the winters here .... I do n't see how you manage to live through them . " Jolly Robin laughed merrily . " Bless you ! " he cried . " I do n't stay here the year ' round . As soon as it begins to grow chilly I go South , where it 's warm . " Now , Major Monkey looked worried when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His queer face had screwed itself into even more wrinkles than it usually wore . But as soon as Jolly Robin spoke of going to a warmer place , the Major brightened at once . " I 'm going South too ! " he cried . " And if you 've no objection we 'll travel together . " Jolly Robin said that nothing would please him more . " I shall be glad to go with you -- if my wife does n't object , " he assured the Major . " Oh ! She wo n't mind , " said Major Monkey . " She can go with us . We 'll make up a party .... She 'll be lucky to go anywhere with such a famous traveller as I am . " Jolly Robin said somewhat doubtfully that he hoped Mrs. Robin would accept their plan . And then he dashed Major Monkey 's high hopes by remarking , " Of course , we always fly when we go South . " The Major 's face fell . He looked careworn and unhappy again . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you 'll fly low , and slowly enough , perhaps I can run through the tree-tops fast enough to keep up with you . I hope it is n't a long trip , " he added somewhat anxiously . " It 's about a thousand miles , " Jolly Robin told him . XIX The Major 's Scheme " I never can run a thousand miles through the tree-tops , " Major Monkey told Jolly Robin in a tone of great disappointment . " I do n't see how I can spend the winter in the South ; and I certainly do n't want to stay here , if it 's as cold as you say . " The poor Major looked so glum that Jolly Robin was sorry for him . " Ca n't you get a ride ? " he asked . " I could ride a horse , if I had one , " Major Monkey replied . " That 's not a bad idea , " Jolly Robin said . " But I 'm afraid you 'd have trouble finding a horse . Farmer Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long a trip . " " Well , I could ride a dog , " said Major Monkey . " There 's that dog at the farmhouse -- old Spot , as you call him . Surely Farmer Green would n't mind if I rode him away , for he 's nothing but a nuisance . " " Why do n't you ask Farmer Green ? " Jolly Robin suggested . But Major Monkey shook his head . " No ! " he said . " No ! I do n't want to do that yet . Before I speak to Farmer Green I prefer to make sure that old dog Spot is easy to ride on . " Jolly Robin looked puzzled . His mouth fell open . And for a few moments he stared at Major Monkey without saying a word . Illustration : The Man Began to Sing a Merry Song When he finally spoke , it was to ask Major Monkey how he was going to find out what he wanted to know about old dog Spot . " There 's only one way , " said Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's to ride him and see . " Jolly Robin thought what a bold fellow Major Monkey was . He entirely forgot the Major 's flight from the picnic grove . Riding a dog was such a feat as Jolly Robin himself would never , never attempt . And he was sure that if Major Monkey really undertook it there could be no doubt of his bravery . " How do you know "  - -  Jolly asked the Major timidly --  " how do you know that old dog Spot will let you ride him ? " " Do n't you worry about that ! " Major Monkey cried lightly , as he swaggered along a limb of the apple tree where they were talking . " Leave that to me . " And Jolly Robin thought what a stout heart beat beneath Major Monkey 's red coat , and how fine it was to be one of his friends . " I should like to see you when you first ride old Spot , " said Jolly Robin . " Delighted , I 'm sure ! " Major Monkey cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing my wife along , too . " Major Monkey was not so sure that he would care to have Mrs. Robin for an onlooker . " Women are likely to be timid , " he remarked . " They sometimes scream at the wrong time . And if your wife happened to cry out just as I was about to drop on old Spot 's back , he might jump . And that would spoil everything . " Jolly Robin decided that Major Monkey knew best . " We 'll keep this affair a secret , " he whispered . The Major nodded . " And now "  - -  Jolly Robin asked him --  " now where and when are you going to ride old Spot ? " Shutting his eyes tightly , Major Monkey wrinkled his low forehead until Jolly Robin began to fear that he was in great pain . " Are you ill ? " Jolly asked him . " No ! " said the Major . " I was only thinking . And it seems to me that the other end of the orchard , toward the farmhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... As for the time , " he added , " that will be when old Spot happens to come that way . " " I 'll be there , whenever that may be , " Jolly Robin assured him . XX A Fast Ride For once Mrs. Robin had reason to complain that her husband did not do his share of the work . Jolly Robin would spend most of his time at the further end of the orchard , talking with " that good-for-nothing Major Monkey , " to use Mrs. Robin 's own words . Whenever she flew over to speak to her husband , the Major was most polite to her , never failing to take off his cap and ask after her health . But Mrs. Robin had little to say to him . She had , however , a great deal to say to Jolly Robin . But no matter how much she urged him to stop idling and come home and help her look after their big family , Jolly insisted that he and the Major " had business to attend to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jolly began to feel somewhat uncomfortable . And he tried to get Major Monkey to go and ask old dog Spot to come to the orchard , instead of waiting there uncertainly for days and days . But Major Monkey would not consent to such a move . He was quite firm . " I do n't want to ask old Spot to give me a ride , " he explained . " Then how do you ever expect to get one ? " Jolly asked him anxiously . " Oh , there 's a way ! " was the Major 's mysterious reply . And that was all he would say . The longer Jolly Robin waited to see the fun , the more excited he became , and the more Major Monkey seemed to enjoy himself . " Old dog Spot ought to be here soon , " the Major kept saying . " I can see him now . No ! I 'm mistaken . " Jolly Robin had so many disappointments that one morning when the Major cried out that at last old Spot was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchard in about a minute and a half , Jolly could n't believe him . It was true , nevertheless . To Jolly 's delight , old dog Spot came darting in and out among the apple trees , with his nose close to the ground . He was following a trail made by Tommy Fox , who had visited the henhouse the night before . And he was so intent on what he was doing that never once did he glance up into the apple trees , where Major Monkey and Jolly Robin were watching him . Major Monkey dropped quickly down to a low-hanging limb . And as luck had it , Tommy Fox 's trail led old dog Spot right under the tree where the Major waited , hanging gracefully by his tail and one hand . As old Spot passed below him , Major Monkey loosened his hold on the limb and dropped squarely upon old Spot 's back . The moment he landed , the Major dug his fingers into Spot 's long fur and hung on grimly . And at the same instant old dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenzied yelp . Jolly Robin was glad that his wife was not present , for he knew that the sight , and the sound too , could not have failed to terrify her . Old Spot seemed almost out of his mind . For a few moments the poor fellow tore about the orchard in wide circles , hoping in vain that he might shake that strange load off his back . But he soon saw that his rider clung to him like a burr . And wheeling suddenly , Spot shot like a streak out of the orchard and flew across the meadow . Just before he disappeared behind a high knoll Major Monkey turned his face over his shoulder and looked behind . Then , holding on with one hand , with the either he waved his red cap at Jolly Robin . The next moment Jolly saw the Major and his strange steed no more . " They headed straight for the river ! " Jolly exclaimed . And he felt so worried about his friend the Major that though he went home at once , his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was more bother than help to her . Some time later Major Monkey limped back to his home in the haystack , dripping wet . His fine coat was torn . And he had lost his red cap . When Jolly Robin saw him he asked the Major if he had had a good ride . " Well , " said Major Monkey , " it was a good one ; but it was too fast . If I started to travel south on old dog Spot 's back I 'd reach my journey 's end before you had gone half way . " " Dear me ! " said Jolly Robin . " Then we ca n't travel together after all . " XXI A Sweet Tooth After his ride on old dog Spot , Major Monkey went to the henhouse for eggs even oftener than he had gone before . Perhaps he had become fonder of eggs . Or perhaps he had become bolder . Anyhow , he noticed that old dog Spot gave him a wide berth . Whenever old Spot saw him he tucked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . Now , Johnnie Green soon discovered that something -- or somebody -- was frightening old Spot almost every day . And having nothing else to do one morning , he made up his mind that he would watch and see what happened . So he climbed to the cupola on top of the big barn . And there he stayed for a long time , keeping a sharp eye on old Spot as he wandered about the farm buildings . It was a good while before anything happened . But Johnnie Green did not mind that . He had brought plenty of cookies to munch . And he pretended that he was a sailor in the crow 's nest of a ship , on the lookout for a sail . After a while he almost forgot what he was really doing . He was leaning far out of the cupola , shading his eyes with one hand , and stuffing a cookie into his mouth with the other , and gazing off across the meadow , when all at once he heard old Spot yelping . That sound brought Johnnie to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the barnyard , making for the woodshed door in great bounds . And behind him , perched on the roof of the henhouse , Johnnie saw a familiar figure . " It 's the monkey again ! " Johnnie Green cried . And he clambered quickly to the ground . But when he reached the henhouse Major Monkey had fled . Johnnie could see his red coat flickering among the leaves in the orchard . But he knew it was useless to follow . Although Major Monkey was aware that Johnnie Green had seen him again , he did not stop visiting the henhouse . To be sure , he became somewhat more wary . He never went inside the henhouse for eggs without first looking around carefully , to make sure that Johnnie Green was n't watching him . And for a time the Major kept an eye out for traps . He saw nothing of the sort anywhere . But one day when he leaped to the window-sill of the henhouse he was delighted to find a lump of maple sugar , which some one had carelessly left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed . And with something a good deal like a chuckle he ate the dainty greedily . It was the first bit of sugar he had tasted since he came to Pleasant Valley . And Major Monkey was very fond of sweets . Johnnie Green , or his father , or the hired man seemed all at once to grow terribly careless with maple sugar . The Major hardly ever visited the henhouse without finding a lump somewhere . And if his liking for eggs had n't brought him thither daily , his taste for sugar would have been enough to make him continue his visits . At last there came a day when Major Monkey discovered a thick pitcher on the henhouse floor . A chain was looped through its handle and nailed to the wall . The Major grinned when he saw the chain . " They do n't want this pitcher to run away , " he said to himself . Being of a most curious turn of mind , he looked into the pitcher . And then he promptly thrust in a hand . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers closed upon it greedily . His queer face wrinkled with annoyance when he found that he could not withdraw his hand . Empty , it could easily have slipped through the mouth of the pitcher . But with the sugar clutched in it , his hand stuck fast . XXII Caught ! Though Major Monkey tugged and tugged , he could n't pull his hand out of the pitcher . To be sure , if he had let go of the lump of maple sugar he might have withdrawn his hand easily enough . But the Major loved sweets too dearly to loosen his hold on any such toothsome morsel -- except to pop it into his mouth . So he struggled and fretted . He even tried to break the pitcher by knocking it against the floor . It might as well have been made of iron , it was so strong . And the Major only succeeded in hurting his own hand . Of course he made a great racket . And the hens , who had become used to his more stealthy visits , began to flutter and squawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monkey wanted to hurl the pitcher at them . But he could n't do that , with his hand stuck inside it . And besides , the pitcher was chained fast to the wall of the henhouse . And right there lay the Major 's greatest trouble . If the pitcher had n't been fastened he would have run off on three legs , to the woods , where he might have tried in peace and quiet to get at the sugar inside it . On the whole , Major Monkey spent a most unhappy quarter of an hour in the henhouse . And the worst moment of all came when the window dropped with a loud bang . Then the sound of steps on the threshold made the Major turn his head . There stood Farmer Green with a broad smile on his face , and Johnnie Green with his mouth wide open and his eyes bulging . And with them was a dark-skinned man , short , and with rings in his ears , and a bright neckerchief tied about his throat . " Aha-a ! " cried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ! " And picking Major Monkey up in his arms , jug and all , he patted him fondly , saying , " Ah-a ! Bad-a boy ! He run-a da way from da ol ' man , no ? " Then -- for a soldier -- Major Monkey did a strange thing . He began to whimper . But there is no doubt that he was weeping because he was glad , and not because he was sorry . The little , dark man was his master . And the Major was very , very fond of him . He knew , suddenly , that he had missed the little man sadly while he roamed about Pleasant Valley . Though Johnnie Green was staring straight at him , Major Monkey clung to his captor and held his wrinkled face close to the little man 's cheek . " He sorra now ! " the little man said to Johnnie Green . " What 's his name ? " Johnnie inquired . " Jocko ! " said Major Monkey 's master . " Dat nice-a name , eh ? " Johnnie Green thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of it . It was a long time since he had heard it . No one had called him " Jocko " since that day -- weeks before -- when he had run away from his master , the organ-grinder , in the village . XXIII The Major Goes South Out of one of his pockets the hand-organ man pulled a stout collar , from which dangled a long , thin chain . And Major Monkey made no protest when his master buckled the collar about his neck . To tell the truth , the Major appeared to like being a captive . He was enjoying , especially , the maple sugar which the hand-organ man had turned out of the pitcher for him . At the farmhouse , a little later , Major Monkey went through all his tricks for Johnnie Green and the rest of the family . Though he had once told Mr. Crow that he never wanted to hear the sound of a hand-organ again , the music that his master ground out while he himself capered about seemed to him the sweetest he had ever heard . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat , unnoticed , in a tree in the dooryard and listened and looked on as if he could scarcely believe his eyes . This one was Jolly Robin . And when , at length , the organ-grinder looped the long chain over his arm , slung the organ over his back , and went toiling up the road , with Major Monkey perched on top of the hand-organ , Jolly Robin had a very queer feeling . He flew down and alighted upon Farmer Greene 's fence and trilled a quavering good-by . Major Monkey stood up and made a low bow to him . " He 's going South , after all ! " Jolly Robin said to himself . If that was so , old dog Spot must have been glad of it . Anyhow , he dashed out of the dooryard and ran a little way up the road , growling and barking , and telling Major Monkey exactly what he thought of him . The Major seemed to enjoy old Spot 's farewell . He danced up and down , and pulled back his arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his mind . He had a red apple , which Johnnie Green had given him . And instead of wasting it on old dog Spot , the Major took a bite out of it then and there . Old Spot had trotted back to the farmhouse , looking very brave , in spite of the scolding Johnnie Green gave him . And Major Monkey was busily engaged with his apple , when he heard a sound that made him look up . " Caw ! Caw ! " It was old Mr. Crow , whose keen eyes had caught sight of the hand-organ man plodding along with his precious load . Major Monkey whistled . And just for a moment , as he watched Mr. Crow sailing lazily overhead , he almost wished that he had n't been quite so fond of sugar . For he knew that he could no longer wander through Pleasant Valley wherever his fancy led him . But the hand-organ man began singing a merry song . And Major Monkey liked it so well that before he had gone a mile he would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to an end , he was eager to journey on , wherever his master might take him . For Major Monkey -- as he had told Mr. Crow in the beginning -- was a great traveller . THE END
