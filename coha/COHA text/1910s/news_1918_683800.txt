txt The Supreme War Council of the Allies issued tonight a statement condemning German political crimes against the Russian and Rumanian peoples , refusing to acknowledge Germany 's peace treaties with them , and de- ' daring : " We are fighting and mean to continue fighting in order to finish once for all with this policy of plunder and establish in its place the peaceful reign of organized justice . " The council 's statement , which is issued through the . Foreign Office , says : " The Prime Ministers . and Foreign Ministers of the Entente , assembled in London , feel it to be their bounden duty to take note of the political crimes which , under the name of a German peace , have been committed against the Russian people . " Russia was upnarmed . Forgetting that for four years Germany had been fighting against the independence of nations and the rights of mankind , the Russian Government in a mood of singular credulity expected to obtain by persuasion that democratic peace ' which it had failed to obtain by war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expired before the German command , though pledges not to alter the disposition of its troops , transferred them en masse to the western front , and so weak did Russia find herself that she dared to raise no protest against this flagrant violation of Germany 's plighted word . * . Peace " That Was " Invasion . " " What followed was of like character , when the German peace ' was translated into action . It was found to involve the invasion of Russian territory , the destruction or capture of all Russia 's means of defense , and the organization of Russian lands for Germany 's prof it  --  a proceeding which did not differ from annexation ! because the word itself was carefully avoided . " Meanwhile , those very Riussians , who had made military ; op : , erations impossible , found digTicmacy impotent . Their representatives were compelled to proclaim that while they refused to read the treaty presented to them , they had no choice but to sign it ; they signed it , not knowink- ' whether in its true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree to which Russian national life was reduced by it to a shadow . " For us of the Entente Governments the judgment which the free peoples of the world will pass on these transactions would never be in doubt . Why waste time over Germany 's pledges when we see that at no period in her history of conquest  --  not when she overran Silesia nor when she partitioned Poland-has she exhibited herself so cynically as a destroyer of national independence , the implacable enemy of the rights of man , and the dignity of civilized nations . " Poland , whose heroic spirit has survived the most cruel of nation ? al tragedies , is ' threat ed - with a fourth - partition , and taggravate her wrongs devices by which the last trace of her independence is to be crushed are based on fraudulent promises . of freedom . " What is true of Russia and Poland is no less true of Rumania , overwhelmed like them in a flood of merciless passion for domination . " Peace is loudly advertised , but under the disguise of verbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the untempered rule of a lawless force . " Peace treaties such as these we do not and , can not acknowledge . Our own ends are very different . We are fighting , and mean to continue fighting , in order to finish once for all with this policy of plunder and to establish in ' its place the peaceful reign of organized justice . " As incidents of this long war unroll themselves before our eyes , more and more clearly do we perceive that the battles for freedom are everywhere interdependent ; that no separate enumeration of them is needed , and that in every case the single , but all-sufficient , appeal is to justice and right . " Are justice and right going to win ? In so far as the issue depends on battled yet to come the nations whose fate is in the balance may surely put their trust in the armies , which , even under conditions more difficult than the present , have shown themselves more than equal to the great cause intrusted to their valor . " Meetings of the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier David Lloyd George were held in Downing Street Thursday , Friday , and Saturday . They were attended by the Premiers of France and Italy and other Ministers , with their military and expert advisers .
