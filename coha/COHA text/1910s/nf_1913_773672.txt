txt // rich in both nitrogen and mineral plant food . The maintenance of fertility may almost be said to consist in keeping the soil well supplied with humus . The cultivation of leguminous crops is one of the most important and economical means of maintaining a supply of nitrogenous plant food in the soil . Nitrates may , of course , be supplied in commercial fertilizers ; but fertilizers containing nitrogen are very expensive , and it usually pays better to supply nitrogen by growing legumes or by the application of stable manure , which is rich in nitrogen when properly handled . In good farm practice both stable manure and leguminous crops are used as sources of nitrogen . Improper methods of tillage add very greatly to the evil effects that result from lack of humus . In many parts of the country the land is plowed only 3 or 4 inches deep . Below the plowed stratum the soil becomes sour , densely packed , and unfit for plant roots . When such soils are plowed deep and this sour packed subsoil is mixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly retarded . This has led many farmers to believe that deep plowing is ruinous . Some farmers have tried to remedy the difficulty by subsoiling . The subsoil plow breaks up the packed layer but does not throw it out on top . But while subsoiling does break up the hard layer into chunks it does not pulverize it or put humus into it . In most cases work done in subsoiling is practically wasted , and it is doubtful if it ever pays . A much better method is to plow a little deeper each year until a depth of 8 or ro inches is reached . This gives a deep layer of good soil , particularly if the supply of humus is kept up . When new soil , or that which has lain undisturbed for several years , is broken up , it is always best to plow deep from the beginning , for the deeper layers will be about as fertile as any , except the top inch or two . It is wise , // too , never to plow the same depth twice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 to 9 or 10 inches and spring plowing from 5 to 7 inches deep . There are special cases in which these rules do not apply , but their discussion would take us too far from the purpose of this chapter . We plow the soil in order to loosen up its texture and get air into it ; also to turn under stubble , manure , etc. , to make humus . Killing weeds is another object accomplished by plowing . After a soil has been thoroughly pulverized to great depths , so that there is no danger of turning up packed clay , the deeper the plowing the better the crops . But the cost also increases with depth , so that ordinarily it does not pay to plow more than about lo inches deep . Some crops prefer rather a loose seed bed . Millet is such a crop . Farmers sometimes plow a second time in order to sow millet on freshly plowed land . Other crops , such as wheat and alfalfa , prefer a fairly compact seed bed ; hence , frequent harrowing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops . Nevertheless , it pays to plow the land for them , even if we have to compact it again before seeding . The plowing aerates the soil and helps to set plant food free . Large Profits in Potatoes ALL progressive farmers who can bring their plans into the right shape are going ahead with potatoes . Prices continue on a high level and the market demand is so keen that foreign producers are making large shipments to this country . If American farmers are wise they will control this market and reap the big profits which are to be gained from potato culture . The fact should be kept in mind that the proper kind of cultivation will give a yield of about 200 bushels per acre , whereas the average in this country is under Too bushels . The yield in parts of Maine as well as in the northwest often runs upwards of 200 bushels , while in Germany it is close to 200 . England and Ireland fall a little behind Germany . For nearly two years now the price per bushel to American farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to private customers , and 75 cents to $1.25 when shipping to commission men . It is well to compare this price and yield to wheat figures . In raising the grain farmers are in great luck if they secure twenty bushels per acre and receive $T a bushel . Potatoes do not require the richest of soils . They will thrive in a sandy loam . Soggy land is bad for the crop and if any such has to be used it ought to be drained . Regular moisture in light quantities on any ordinary farm will insure a good crop of potatoes . An irrigated farm has advantages over any other , but where the rainfall is insufficient a dust mulch should be 102 // kept around the growing crop for the purpose of conserving such moisture as there is . It is unwise to let potato ground harden and bake in the sun . By giving reasonable attention to the product along the lines indicated success will be attained in almost any section of the United States . Potatoes do well in rotation with clover , millet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is feasible to dig a crop of early potatoes in June or July and then immediately sow millet , rye or fodder corn on the same ground . It is also a good plan to plant late potatoes on land from which clover , cowpeas , rye or any other early crop has been taken . There are sixteen states in which the cultivation of sugar beets is already well established in this country . Practically all of these states are large producers of potatoes . More significant still is the fact , recently brought out by an exhaustive inquiry , that the use of sugar beets in rotation with potatoes , corn , wheat and other crops increases the yield of every one of these crops from 25 to 50 per cent . In the case of potatoes the increase was 46.2 per cent . Early Rose , Triumph , Early Michigan and Early Ohio remain standard early varieties , while some of the best late ones are Burbank , Peerless , Peachblow and Green Mountain . There are many variations in these types , but for all practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is necessary to be on guard against disease and insect pests . A healthy growth of potatoes can hardly be expected on soggy land or where spraying is neglected . Good seed is of the highest importance , and with this point settled thorough cultivation will insure a crop five years out of six . The potato scab is a disease that remains in the soil from one year to the next as a fungus and if potatoes i // are grown in consecutive years on the same soil the disease must necessarily increase . The potato bug or beetle is destroyed with paris green at the rate of one pound to the acre in twenty-five gallons of water . Arsenate of lead applied at the rate of six pounds to the acre in fifty gallons of water will prove equally efficacious . Scab and blight are controlled by the bordeaux mixture , which is best applied a week or two after the bugs have been disposed of . Potatoes are so hardy that they are raised to advantage in the most northerly states , and even in Siberia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show good results in southern states , but this is a rule that will not work both ways . Tubers originating in a semi-tropical climate have to be acclimated in the north before returning satisfactory crops . On any farm in the country some parts are much better adapted to potatoes than others . Sandy soil is not a moisture-retaining soil , and in wet weather there is little danger of tubers rotting in the soil . In dry seasons mulching is highly beneficial , as it tends to hold and conserve the little moisture available . Seeds grown under mulch and those grown with the best cultivation have been compared and the former found to produce 50 per cent better yields . If clover is raised after potatoes grown with a mulch a surprisingly good stand is obtained . The time to mulch is just as soon as the first crop of weeds has been destroyed by cultivation . A thick layer of leaves or straw is required . This will save the soil from surface washing and will keep down the weeds . It conserves moisture and adds humus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the weather becomes favorable in the spring use a disk unless the ground happens to be dry , in which case harrowing is better , as it will tend to conserve the moisture . If the land is not perfectly level the rows should conLARGE // form to the slope , so that in case of heavy rains the water will run off without washing out the crop . If mulching is thought to be unnecessary the tract must be cultivated two or three times . The studious farmer tills the soil in an intelligent manner , knowing the reason for and the effect of every operation . He aims to get water into the soil and hold it there for future use . Certainty of crops depends almost absolutely on proper handling of the soil . Without it the soil moisture is not stored in proper quantities and is allowed to escape , and drought gets the crop that otherwise could be saved and made profitable . A study of the potato question will be a good thing for American farmers , especially those who are just engaging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production and selling , is opened by the existing potato problem . Here are a couple of good axioms which apply to the situation : Never trust to one crop for success , even when prices are high ; do not devote all your land and effort to a single interest , no matter what the rate of profit was in a previous season . One reason is that you may fail to produce a satisfactory crop , and another is that thousands rush to raise a product for which there seems to be an unusual demand . This breaks the market . It would be easy for American farmers to raise so many potatoes that they could not get fifty cents a bushel for them . However , when the market gets too low to afford a profit , this product is excellent food , when boiled , for poultry and hogs . Growing Sweet Potatoes in the North WHILE the sweet potato is generally regarded as a southern crop , it is grown with great success in many places in the north . The Island of Muscatine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and melons . The former do well in any light , sandy soil , where the season is not too short . Miss Gertrude Coburn , teacher of domestic science in the University of Iowa , has collected some valuable data regarding the table merit of the different kinds of sweet potatoes grown in the north . Mr. Theodore Williams , of Benson , Neb. , and F. D. Wells , a Michigan grower , have been successful in the cultivation of the potato ; and the results of the work of these investigators are briefly summarized here . In Miss Coburn 's investigations the soil on which the crop was grown was not rich , having previously grown nursery stock . It was not manured , but thoroughly prepared . Mr. Wells says that the soil best suited to sweet potatoes is a warm , moderately rich sand . If it is too rich there will be excessive growth of top at the expense of the root . Before planting , the surface of the ground should be ridged , and the plants set in the usual way about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow the plants is in a hotbed . After the first heated period is over , the tubers are placed quite closely together , but not touching , and covered with manure ; they are then covered with three inches of soil , the bed covered with glass and watered as often as necessary . 106 // The buds or shoots which develop should be transplanted to the field only when the ground is quite warm . Although plants are generally set in ridges , some growers prefer to set on a level . The ridge system is probably most desirable in the north . The center of the ridges should be about 3/ feet apart , and the plants set i8 inches in the row . Good cultivation is necessary . This should be frequent and shallow to save moisture , and it will also add to the yield . Southern growers have changed their method somewhat , and now do not believe it is necessary to move the vines to prevent rooting , except under unusual circumstances . Northern experiments show that there is not so much difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the vines were moved twice . Potash is one of the most important fertilizers for sweet potatoes , although in New Jersey , horse manure at the rate of to to 20 tons per acre is used . It should be well rotted . Attention to the vines , says Mr. Wells , does not stop with the end of cultivation . They should be lifted occasionally to prevent their taking root , and this work can be quickly done by the use of a pitchfork . Once a week is often enough . I n the north the black-rot affects sweet potatoes , and this is soon seen on the sprouts . Whenever a plant shows a leaf that is black , it should be dug up and destroyed . Potatoes from affected plants will rot quickly after being dug . As the germs of the disease remain in the soil over winter , the ground should not be used , again for this crop . Money Making From Pork FARMERS who do not raise a lot of nice pork every year are not living up to their opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last five years this product pays well . The present is a good time either for making a start or enlarging operations . Even a very small farm should have a few pigs , as they work nicely in any scheme of diversification . The sow 's rations should be reduced about one-half shortly before farrowing , and it should consist of sloppy feed that will tend to loosen the bowels . An abundant supply of water should be before her . She ought to be separated from other animals a week before farrowing . In extremely cold weather the young pigs are likely to become chilled and may die if they do not receive extra attention . A little care at this time will save the lives of many pigs and pay excellent returns for the slight effort involved . A few bricks should be heated , wrapped in a sack and placed in a basket . Any pigs which appear chilled or are too weak to nurse should be placed in the basket . An hour or so of this treatment should serve to revive the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching maturity are increased fourfold . If sucking pigs are seen to be scouring , give the sow fifteen to twenty drops of laudanum in her feed for a few days . If her feed is reduced this usually checks the scours . If there is no laudanum at hand use powdered charcoal . As soon as the pigs are old enough to eat I give them a IO // separate trough where they can eat without being disturbed by the mother . They are given a mixed feed of middlings , corn meal or . other ground feed softened with water . They thrive all summer on forage crops and need little grain until a month before marketing time . Mineral matter such as phosphorus , calcium , sulphur and iron is very necessary to the best development of a pig . It is needed in the body to carry gaseous products , such as oxygen , from the lungs to the tissues of the body ; to maintain acidity in the blood and tissues ; to aid in the movement of liquids through the body ; to aid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to several minor functions to aid in the formation of muscular and bony tissues . A pig fed on ground corn and water , and provided with plenty of mineral matter will gain twice as much in weight as one fed on ground corn and water alone . Rape , artichokes , red clover and alfalfa make good forage for hogs . Carrots are excellent food also , either in summer or winter . It is not best to let hogs have the entire run of a large pasture . Confine them within movable fences , giving them access to a part of the field at a time . Such fences are not expensive . They save much waste of grass , secure a large growth of feed from the land and cause the hogs to make rapid gains . Vermin are a pest and cause heavy losses . Nothing holds back growing pigs more than lice . It is necessary to fight them as long as one remains on the premises . Coal tar dips are a great help in keeping hogs healthy , and where a sprayer is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hogs sleep in , and kill the lice there also . Lime is a help if sprinkled over the litter . Black oil poured over the pigs will kill lice effectively . A mixture of lard and kerosene when rubbed in , answers the purpose . Do not use kerosene alone , as it blisters . Good // insect powders can be bought , but they are hardly necessary if the other remedies are used . Hogs require attention regardless of conditions , age or sex , but the brood sows require particular attention , and to the feeder 's skill in feeding and managing his brood sows , provided they have been properly selected , will be due in large measure his success . Pasture and forage crops should be provided for the pregnant sows , because of the cheapness of this method of feeding and the desirability of keeping the sows in good form by exercise , fresh air and sunshine . Along with the pasture and forage crops some grain should be fed especially as pregnancy advances , for best results , since the pasture and forage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops that are especially suited to pregnant brood sows are the clovers , alfalfa , peas , beans , vetches , rape , etc . The ordinary pasture grasses also provide a suitable pasture for brood sows . Keep the sow in fair condition but not excessively fat . She should receive a nutritious ration at all times , but care should be taken not to feed a too concentrated ration close to farrowing time , as the sow is likely to become constipated . This is a disorder that should be carefully avoided during pregnancy and especially at the time of farrowing . To overcome this disorder the greater part of the grain ration should be given in the form of a slop all during pregnancy , and toward the close of the gestation period some laxative feed such as bran , oil meal , roots , or a small amount of flaxseed meal should be introduced into the ration . It should be remembered that the digestive tract of the hog is small and that a very bulky ration can not be used to best advantage . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sow are those for building up new tissue , and that the kind of feed is important . To build up new tissue the sow must have protein in her ration . This // may be supplied by feeding any one of a number of nitrogenous feeds . The young sow requires more of this kind of feed in her ration than the old one because she is still growing when her first litter is born . A variety in the feeds is necessary to good results with swine . With brood sows it is particularly true that several feeds combined give better results than any single one . For a few days previous to farrowing the feed should be limited in quantity and of a sloppy nature , and , as has been previously stated , the tendency to become constipated at this time must be overcome . A box of charcoal , salt and ashes should be kept where the sow can get at it at all times , summer or winter . These materials tend to satisfy the hog 's craving for mineral matter and act as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given free access to the above mixture and are fed a varied ration which contains a sufficient amount of protein , the breeder will not be likely to be troubled with sows eating their pigs at farrowing time . The quantity of feed for several days after farrowing should be small . The sow should not be offered any feed of any kind until she gets up of her own accord after farrowing and for the first day or two a thin slop will be sufficient to quench her thirst and provide all the nutrition required . Within a week or ten days after farrowing the sow should be getting a good ration of nutritious milk producing food . If skim milk can be had at this time and fed with a ration of equal parts corn meal and shorts , good results should be obtained . About three weeks after farrowing the sow should be getting a full ration and during the whole remaining period during which the sow is giving suck to her pigs she should be fed heavily , for the gain thus produced in the suckling pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed . Generally a sow with a large litter will lose in weight and condition even when given the best // of care and feed . These essentials should receive the greatest of attention at all times . Farmers need to learn the merits of rape , carrots , Canada peas and alfalfa or clover . Hogs can be brought along nicely for the first six months without much corn if they can have a nice patch of forage such as alfalfa or rape . Skimmed milk is a wholesome and cheap addition . They can be finished on peas or corn , as circumstances dictate , and will show a large profit at 8 to ro months . Animals fed in this way produce extra fine pork and it is possible to have private customers who will take the dressed carcasses , wholly or in part , at fancy prices . While hogs grow into money fast , the question of economical feeding must not be overlooked . If the feeder does what he should for his hogs on grass he will feed some corn or other grain along each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure in his grass diet and also to help concentrate his ration . If this is kept up to the time in the pig 's life when he is 6 , 7 or 8 months of age he is then a large pig , growthy and strong , but not in any condition to market . He has built up his frame and muscle work large enough so that by feeding six weeks or two months longer he can be finished off on corn into the prime pork the market pays the long price for . This last period is called the finishing or fattening period , but this does not mean that the pig , which has been allowed to roam over a grass pasture ( or , better still , a clover pasture ) and been fed perhaps a pound or two pounds of corn or other grain in the evening just to keep him growing fine , should be kept in an 8xro foot pen and stuffed on corn . He will not do best under these conditions . He wants some good clean soil to eat every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wants a fiftyyard straightaway where he can scamper and shake up // his intestines , which are as full as a city boy at grandmother 's on Thanksgiving day . Now corn alone and a place to scamper in will not be all that is necessary for finishing these hogs . They are still to grow some , their growth requires protein material , and this protein material must be in excess of that found in the corn . Nothing could be better than the clover field or the alfalfa field , but when these are frosted or covered with snow , the Canadian field peas can be used that should have been thrashed out some weeks before . These should be ground for best results and fed in slop . If this slop could be made of the fresh separated milk , so much the better . The ration of corn , should you have it ground , and the field peas , which ought to be ground , is very well mixed and makes a good ration when about five parts of corn are fed with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slop . Should the feeder not have the pea meal and has only the skim milk , it is well to purchase shorts and make a good slop of the shorts and milk and feed all the pigs will clean up without leaving the trough . Rape is one of the most satisfactory crops for early hog pasture when clover is not available . It closely resembles cabbage in appearance and manner of growth , except that it does not produce a head . It has large , coarse , succulent leaves , and ordinarily grows from 20 to 3o inches tall . It is a cool weather plant and can be sown early in the spring ? as soon as there is no further danger of severe frost . It will endure a pretty severe frost in the fall without injury and may be used for pasture late in the fall , provided the hogs are kept off when it is frozen . Making a Dairy Farm Pay THERE is much to be said in favor of dairy farming , no matter what the size of the place may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash income , and may be managed so as to yield a high rate of profit , particularly if there are good transportation facilities or the farm is located near a large town . Soil fertility is best maintained on a place that has considerable live stock . A dairy is a good basis for operations in a case where a city family takes land , for it affords an immediate income with which to meet the expense of hired help and the cost of getting started . On any place beyond the dimensions of a garden or orchard it is best to start with an experienced man . Possibly after one season the family may manage the work . Fifteen to twenty cows are not too many for fifty acres . Ten cows may be kept on thirty to forty acres . The modern plan is to restrict the pasture to a few acres and feed with silage or soiling crops . Summer feeding is necessary to keep up a regular output of milk , and it is best to begin with this fact settled , so time and effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of land given up to pasturage . A fact in favor of the dairy is that the owner can estimate both income and expense with reasonable certainty . Prices on milk and butter change little , especially where there are private customers . Any one who has a suitable location can command top-notch prices for dairy products which are handled with taste and skill . The demand is continual , is never exceeded by supply , and high prices 114 // are willingly paid for choice goods by a large class of customers who place quality above cost . To get the advantages of dealing with this class of trade , one should be located convenient to transportation . After securing a good equipment , and learning how to produce and sell , it will be easy to find private customers who will pay 25 to 50 per cent more than market quotations for products that they know to be right . If located near a provincial city , the marketing may be done by team . Good marketing means the difference between success and failure . In Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and the farmer and consumer get together . There is no reason why that plan may not succeed in this country . Selection is more important than breed in starting a dairy . See that the cows come up to requirements in milk production , and are healthy . Then guard against dirt and disease , and feed systematically . Alfalfa , alsike , millet , shredded cornstalks , ground oats or corn , beets , bran and shorts are the best articles of fodder . Corn silage is excellent , winter or summer , and oilcake may be needed for its digestive qualities when stock is not on grass . No dairy is on the right basis if not earning at the rate of $loo a year for each animal . Considerably more than this will be earned if good selling connections are established . I have personal knowledge of a ten-cow dairy that has advanced steadily from $6o to $125 a month . observant farmers know that while the income from milk is large , it does not represent the entire value of a dairy . Hogs fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with corn alone , and skimmed milk is also an aid in poultry raising . Thus the dairy stimulates two other important branches of farming , and many a worn-out and almost worthless farm has been restored to // a highly profitable state by the fertilizer returned by the cattle . The selection of feeds is of prime importance in the profitable management of a herd of dairy cows , and , next to the selection of cows of the proper type and breeding , is the factor of greatest importance in profitable dairying . Feed cows daily one pound of grain for every three pounds of milk produced ; from 25 to 40 pounds of corn silage , and what clover or alfalfa hay they will eat . Do not turn cows out to remain and suffer in cold , stormy weather . Allow them to have water which is not colder than that from a deep well twice or three times daily . It is a good plan to heat their drinking water in the tanks or troughs . Brush cows daily if you can possibly find the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keep cows in clean , well lighted , properly ventilated stables . Do not try to save feed by turning to pasture too early . Provide plenty of pure , fresh water , shade and protection against flies during the heat of summer . Supplement poor pastures with corn silage or green soiling crops like rye , peas and oats , green corn fodder , cabbage and other available feed . Treat cows gently and avoid excitement . Be regular in time of feeding and milking . Weigh the milk of each cow at milking time . Get your neighbors to share with you in owning a Babcock milk tester , and test the milk of each individual cow . Discard the cow which has failed at the end of the year to pay market price for all the feed she has consumed . Breed your cows to a pure-bred registered dairy bull , and raise well the heifer calves from the best cows . Breed heifers to drop their first calves at 24 to 30 months of age . Give cows six to eight weeks ' rest between lactation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dollars should settle the question of summer forage at once and for good . With the increased value of land , larger pastures can not be maintained without loss . Frequent droughts also help to make them unprofitable . It has come to a point where owners of dairies , beef cattle , horses , or any kind of live stock , frequently lose as much money as a result of light pastures during three months of dry summer weather as they can make in the rest of the year . A total abandonment of pasturage is not recommended , but the grazing fields should be improved and silage and soiling crops made an auxiliary for summer feeding . One reason why so many pastures become short or fail altogether in summer is that they do not contain enough variety of grasses for forage plants . The ordinary pasture is a timothy meadow which has been run as a meadow for several years . This one grass plant is soon killed out , and nothing remains but chance grasses and weeds , all of doubtful forage value . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must contain a variety of grasses and good forage plants . Some of these will come in early in the spring , then become dormant , to again revive and grow for fall and early winter use . While these early grasses are dormant in midsummer , other grasses will be at their best . The following makes a good mixture on ordinary soils : Orchard grass , redtop , timothy , English and Italian rye . grass , red clover and alsike . It is important to seed or reseed the pasture every 117 // second year , and this may be done at almost any time , preferably in late summer , so that the young plants will have cool weather for starting growth . It is a good plan to harrow the pasture once each year to break up large manure masses and to scratch the surface soil . By all means , have two or more pastures , so that they can be used in rotation , allowing one to rest and renew growth while the other is in use . Continuous eating and tramping will kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods of rest during the growing season , and where the area is limited , grow soiling plants for green feeding when the pasture is short and needs rest . Whether for keeping up the milk supply or pushing the growth of meat animals , it pays to raise cowpeas and oats together , cutting them for use as a green fodder before the oats have ripened . Other crops having special value are millet , vetch and rape . The latter is particularly good for hogs and sheep . A patch of artichokes will also bring these animals along nicely . Live stock is good property . Every farm should raise and mature for the market all that it can safely handle and maintain in thrifty condition . Cows , sheep and hogs are of special advantage on the small farm . The market value of good breeding animals may be made two or three times that of common , ordinary grade . All kinds of farm stock is in good demand . High prices prevail and an oversupply can not be anticipated for years to come . The average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something for the market all through the year . The dairy and poultry features should be pushed to the limit . The Siberian alfalfas are found growing in abundance in dry regions , where the mercury freezes in the thermometer , often with no snow on the ground . The summers are so dry and hot that camels find a congenial home . If we could clothe our hillsides and plains with // these wild Siberian alfalfas , we would increase their present feeding capacity for stock from four to eight times . Seeds and plants for these hardy varieties are obtainable in a limited way , and if they prove as vigorous here as they are in their native home under trying conditions , they will soon become a leading feature of our flora , and add immensely to our agricultural wealth . The transplanting of alfalfa plants , although new to us , is something that has been practiced for centuries in parts of India and South America . The modern idea of a hardy alfalfa is one that will take its place as a wild plant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one that will cover our steep bluffs and hillsides , now barren ; one that will flourish in our gumbo soils in western localities ; one that will make our rough land and " sheep quarters " immensely more valuable than at present . Where the common blue-flowered alfalfa does not suffer from the winter at any time , it is wise to " let well enough alone . " But north of this line is a vast region , stretching clear to the Arctic circle , where these Siberian alfalfas will reign supreme in the near future , and they may find a congenial home in the high mountain regions in the Rockies far to the south . Some people are inclined to shut their eyes and ears to the fact that the common alfalfa is sometimes winterkilled , and blame the farmer for all the failures ; such people like to tell only about its successes and to disregard the failures . This is not the best way . The other extreme would be to wait until the seed of perfectly hardy plants is obtained in commercial quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant the best seed obtainable , taking care that it is as free as possible from weed seed . Turkestan alfalfa , which was brought over for the first time in 1898 , has made good over a wide area . // Alfalfa is so valuable that even one good crop is a paying investment . But we must not place all our hopes upon it as absolutely safe , since even our most enthusiastic growers admit that the plant winter-kills on certain soils and under certain conditions . Some think that a perfectly hardy alfalfa is not to be expected . But why not ? Does buffalo grass ever winter-kill ? American experimenters have brought alfalfa from Sweden and Russia and are greatly pleased with the extremely vigorous , upright habits of growth , quick recovery after cutting , many stems and large leaves , the abundant seed production , and the fact that the seeds are tightly retained in the pods instead of shelling prematurely . The flowers vary greatly in color from blue to yellow , ranging into green , dark violet and purple . This hybrid condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest amount of forage per acre . From many successful experiments has come the belief that the complete solution of the hardy alfalfa question is in sight . No movement for the betterment of agriculture is more general or extensive than that to provide silage for cattle . The system has been slow in gaining a hold , but it is coming with a rush now . For a time some of the large milk dealers objected to silage as feed , but this opposition was not justified , and has been withdrawn . Beef cattle are brought along faster and better with silage for fodder than by any other method . Of course , in all cases a light percentage of dry feed or roughage is needed . The silo has its use on a farm of any size . It brings system and certainty into the farmer 's affairs , and is profitable from any point of view . A field of corn goes about twice as far in silage as in the old method of feeding . It is generally conceded that silage which is several // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer silage that is six months to a year old . Silage is strong in carbohydrates , the principal food requirement for all animals , but needs protein to balance it . Alfalfa hay is perhaps the cheapest and best for this purpose . Throughout the dairy sections it should form a part of the ration where silage is used . This makes it possible for the feeder to gain a greater economy in his operations , and at the same time give the animal a wholesome , balanced ration . Corn silage may be fed out of doors , in bunks , in the stall , or in any place where animals can eat it without waste . In severe weather it is best to feed silage inside , as some will freeze , and this will be hard for the stock to masticate , although the feeder need not be alarmed over feeding freezing ensilage . It will not injure the animals , but frozen food is not easy for them to consume . In feeding milch cows , it is a good plan to give the hay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and feed the ensilage in the barn after milking . It may be given twice a day in rations from ten to fifteen pounds at a feeding , or twenty to forty pounds per day . Some large animals will take as high as fifty pounds of silage per day and make good use of it . Feed the ensilage so that the animals will eat it up clean , as it spoils when exposed to the air for several days . In some of the most carefully managed experiments ever made , silage has surpassed the usual grain feeding in bringing on beef cattle . The ease and rapidity with which gains are made , the greater efficiency of the feed when given to young animals , the larger number that can be handled , and the splendid quality of the finished product , are points which strongly appeal to feeders in favor of silage for making beef . Even when it comes to the finishing process in the last month of feeding , it is found that silage is suitable for // the morning and evening rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stock will require a certain amount of hay , and should have access to this as desired . Nothing else is needed except the usual allowance of cottonseed or linseed meal . Sand vetch is also known as hairy vetch . The plant produces many slender branches , 6 feet long , and the leaves and branches are covered with a coat of fine hairs . The seeds are small and black . If the field is not pastured too closely , the seed pods burst open when ripe and reseed the field . Spring seed should be sown the last of April to the middle of May . If grown for forage , it is well to seed vetch with oats and wheat . The reason for this is that the grain keeps the vetch off the ground . If the seed is drilled , sow one bushel per acre . If broadcasted , 1 1/2 bushels per acre . Seed also one bushel of oats as a nurse crop . The name implies that it is best grown on a sandy loam soil ; however , it grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clover . All stock relish the green forage and cured hay . Experiments show that it yields between two and three tons of hay per acre . Soy beans make a rich late summer pasturage , a good soiling crop , a splendid ensilage crop , and a cured hay equal in palatability and feeding value to alfalfa hay . They yield twenty to thirty bushels of seed per acre , worth $2 to $3 per bushel , and can be ground into meal that will take the place of cottonseed meal , oil meal , tankage , gluten or other high-class concentrates , at much less cost . Owing to their rapid growth , soy beans are an admirable catch crop to follow wheat , oats , crimson clover , potatoes or other early crops . They greatly improve the condition of the soil upon which they grow and enrich its store of nitrogen and humus . As compared with the valuable and widely popular // cowpeas , soy beans have a wider range of usefulness , are more easily cured for hay , much more easily harvested and thrashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are more nutritious , command a better price , are less sensitive to frost , lose less in handling of the hay , crack less in thrashing , are less likely to be attacked by weevil , and the roots and stubble leave more nitrogen and humus in the soil . Cowpeas have the one superior virtue of making a heavier yield on a poor , sandy soil . As a main crop , sow soy beans ten days after corn planting time , as a catch crop , as soon as the prior crop is off the land . If drilled in rows to be cultivated , onethird of a bushel will seed an acre ; if drilled solid , like wheat , use six pecks . For hay , cut when the pods are fully formed ; for seed , cut when the plants begin to turn yellow , cure as for hay , and thrash . The thrashed forage will be eaten greedily by horses and cattle and they will thrive on it . At present prices soy beans are one of the most profitable crops that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good system of crop rotation . A still newer crop of great value to live stock owners is called guar . If this fodder crop proves to be all that is claimed for it , some of the others will be relegated to the background . Guar is described as an erect annual reaching a height of three to four feet in an arid country and five to seven feet in the rain belt . As a land improver it ranks with the cowpea , and as a forage plant it is said to equal alfalfa . Just imagine the amount of forage in a crop of alfalfa six feet high ! Guar is said to produce enormous quantities of seed ? twenty to thirty bushels per acre , even in a dry country , and proportionately larger yields in humid countries . In the cultivation of any of these legumes there is something to be made in producing seed , as well as hay . Cows Kept at a Loss E. V. ELLINGTON , in charge of dairy production , Idaho experiment station , discusses herd testing and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many high producing cows in the Northwest , the average production of cows being milked is low . Figures from the last census show that there are in the state of Idaho approximately 8o,000 cows being milked that are classed as dairy cattle . The value of dairy products produced in the state of Idaho is only $2,000,000 . These figures indicate that many cows are being kept at an actual loss to the farmer . Records that the writer has kept on different herds over the state during the past year show that 20 per cent of the cows were not paying for the feed they consumed . For every dollar expended for feedstuffs some animals were only giving returns of 75 and 8o cents . The dairy cow may be compared to a machine . Raw material is furnished her in the form of alfalfa , oats and barley , and milk is the finished product . Milk production is a question of dollars and cents and if the machine for the manufacture of milk can not be operated on an economical basis then it should be disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow may be detected with certainty from the unprofitable one , and this method consists in weighing and testing the milk and keeping a record of the feed consumed for the entire lactation period . Keeping daily records of milk is a very simple and inexpensive task . All that is necessary is to have some form 124 // of scales and a ruled sheet whereby the milk weights may be recorded daily . It is well to use spring balance scales that will weigh from one-tenth to thirty pounds . The fat test should be made at least once a month , the testing to be done at regular intervals . Samples from both morning and evening milking should be used . For the small herd a four-bottle Babcock tester is of sufficient size and may be secured at small cost from any creamery supply company and includes full directions for conducting the test . The manipulation of the fat test is very simple , but the directions should be carefully followed . Guesswork is expensive to the dairyman . No person is able to go into a good sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The highest degree of success can not be attained unless the dairyman knows accurately the record of each cow . Success in dairying will depend upon the farmer 's ability to lower the cost of producing a pound of butter-fat . With increased cost of every item which goes into the maintenance of a dairy herd , from wrapping paper to hay , and from the fencing around the farm to the labor required in every operation , has come the absolute necessity of getting every part of the dairy on a paying basis or else facing a deficit either in money , which is likely , or in depreciation of the farm land , or in underpaid labor . All of which is primary and fundamental experience with the eastern cow-man . For this fact remains : Well-tilled land will produce crops sufficient to pay a fair return on labor and investment even if sold in the open market . The feeding of the farm crop to a dairy cow , and the production by that cow of milk , and its further handling on the farm into butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory dairy animal ? is proven to be the most profitable way of disposing of products of the farm , under existing conditions of demand and cost of transportation , // and at the same time returns the largest possible conservation of fertility to the land itself . What , then , is the answer ? First , the cow must be a satisfactory dairy animal . Second , the manner of the farm management must be such as to get a maximum of the best food possible out of the soil to use as raw material for the cow machine to produce milk from . Here hinges the question of dairy pre-eminence . The state whose farmers learn best to produce the most valuable and effective feeding materials from their land , and who learn how to build their dairies up with the best possible dairy cows , will lead the world in the excellence , the volume , and the value of its dairy products . Denmark is the shining example of the entire world , and in Denmark the key to the result is the cow-testing associations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate profit depends upon the profit of each individual , cow , or tree , or vine . The value of a dairy herd is measured not by its best member in her best month , but by the average of all its members for twelve months , and this average is pulled down by its poorest member , as much as it is raised by its best , and there is no way known to know just what each cow is doing but by actual test . Without fear of successful contradiction it can be asserted that the dairy expert does not exist who can tell the best cow in a herd except by the scales and the Babcock tester , nor the value of a cow without an experience covering months . This is a plea for the organization of cow-testing associations based upon actual experience which has come under the observation of the writer . First of all , why an association ? why not individual testing ? The only reason is because the average individual will not start and continue the test , and it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testing Associations THE difference in dairy profits is not so much a difference in market advantages as in the handling and management of the cows . One farmer keeps cows that turn out a quantity of milk that puts the gross returns well above the cost of keeping the cows , while the other 's milking herd is giving a supply the value of which is just running along on or near the same line as the cost of production . In the one herd quite frequently are found some cows that are turning in large profits and cows that are barely paying for their keep . The average profit from such a herd will depend entirely on the proportion of cows in each class . The University of Nebraska , in a bulletin issued recently , shows clearly through the results of a cow-testing association in a county of Nebraska , that it is the amount of milk produced by the cow that determines her value and the value of dairying as a business . In part , this bulletin reads : The good cow judge can generally tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but very few judges , if any , can always tell by type or conformation the cow producing 300 pounds of butter-fat from the one producing only 20o pounds . As a matter of fact , the only accurate way of discovering the unprofitable cow is with the scale and Babcock test . The truthfulness of this statement has been brought out in many instances . The former owner of Jacoba Irene , keeping no records of her production , considered her only an ordinary cow and sold her for an ordinary price . 127 // Her worth was only determined after her owner took steps to have her tested . These figures revealed the remarkable fact that in less than a year she produced 1,111 pounds of butter , or more butter than is being produced by seven average Nebraska cows . Dairymen need a variety of fodder crops . With summer drouths always possible , it is a good plan to have a field of rye and clover sown in the fall . This , like the first cutting of alfalfa , will be ready quite early . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowpeas , millet or alfalfa . Cowpeas and oats may be sown together for a late hay crop . Just west of Omaha , in Douglas County , is located a very prosperous , progressive farming community . Here the price of farm land is already in the neighborhood of $200 per acre . In this locality and in this connection it is of interest to note that the farmer who years ago could not be forced into dairying , has now turned to it and is getting satisfactory results . These farmers fully realize the importance of keeping accurate records of the amount of milk and fat produced by each cow in the herd . They also realized that through a co-operative cow-testing association the expense of obtaining these records would be very materially reduced and the Douglas County CowTesting Association was organized . The members of this association entered 21 herds , comprising some 435 cows . The work of the tester consisted in keeping accurate records of the amount of milk and butter-fat produced by every cow in the various herds and also in making careful estimates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to spend one day each month with every herd belonging to the association . In addition to this work this man was ever ready with suggestions as to how the rations could be improved for economical milk and butter-fat production . The following table shows the difference between ten // good cows and ten bad ones . An accurate account of feed and milk production was kept : From this table the reader will notice that a herd composed of io of the best cows would yield a profit of over $1,032 . Compare with this the meagre profit of only $85 that would come to the dairyman as a result of a year 's work with a herd composed of 10 of the poorest cows , and there is at least one evident reason why the farmer who keeps no record of the amount of milk produced and who thinks it of no importance to test the milk for butter-fat fails to make dairying profitable . Dairy By-Products Are Important THE value of the dairy by-products of the country for one year amounts to more than fifty million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Agriculture ; and this is a conservative estimate . The item of dairy products is one of vast importance , and is well worthy of careful attention and study . Skim-milk is by far the most important by-product from the dairy , and the best adapted to varied and profitable uses . Skim-milk , as a human food , is unappreciated by most farmers ; but it has been tested under various conditions , by food experts , and has proven a useful portion of an everyday diet for many people . The use of skim-milk ought to be encouraged , and would result in finding city markets for a large amount of this valuable by-product . A report from one of our leading colleges contains the following : " Skim-milk has all the protein and half of the full value of the whole milk and is in most localities the most economical source of animal protein . The food element in skim-milk are equal in physiological value to those of meats and are far less expensive . " As an article to substitute for water , in the preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made mainly of milk , there is no waste , but a decided gain in food-value . In making bread , skim-milk will add to the weight and nutritive value of the loaf . Used in place of water , sufficient flour may be saved to pay for the milk , and yet produce a loaf of equal weight , and of more actual food value . 130 // Milk bread is richer in fatty matter , and superior in flesh forming elements , which is scientifically explained as being due to the casein of milk being incorporated with the fibrin of the flour . The sale of skim-milk to bakers and confectioners should be encouraged , and is capable of being largely increased . Used in this manner , it may be made to net the consumer one dollar a cwt. , or more than a large per cent of the farmers and dairymen realize for their whole milk . As a food for domestic animals skim-milk occupies the most conspicuous position of any food-stuff , especially as a feed for young and growing animals . The facts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : " Skim-milk gives the best returns when fed to very young animals , constituting the larger part of their rations . " It is next best for animals making rapid growth , but which need other feed than milk , mainly of a carbonaceous nature . " Except for very young animals skim-milk gives the best returns when used in combination with other foods generally grains . " No class of live stock will give larger returns for skim-milk than poultry of various kinds . " At the New York Experiment Station chickens were grown successfully on a diet composed mainly of skimmilk , although they were allowed a run of the fields during the time when they were being fed this ration . It was estimated that at the test , after allowing from 25 cents to 50 cents per hundred for the skim-milk , and some other feed in proportion , the cost of producing one pound of live weight was less than six cents at the time when the birds weighed three pounds . During this time the milk was fed sweet ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loppered , and the waste is less in the latter form . If a premium were offered for the most rapid gains in pig feeding , my opinion would be that some man skilled in feeding skim-milk with other foods would carry off the prize . Professor Henry , of Wisconsin , a high authority on feeding domestic animals , says regarding the value of skim-milk as a food for swine : " Skim-milk has a value as a feed for stockmen that is higher than merely serving as a substitute for grain . All of the constituents of milk are digestible and this valuable by-product of the creamery is rich in bone and blood building constituents . " When we consider the use of this food for bone and muscle building , and also remember its easy digestibility , and that by adding a variety it makes other food articles more palatable , and probably assists in their digestion , we must hold skim-milk as occupying a high place in the list of feedstuffs available on most farms . Authorities seem to differ as to the merits of sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinces me that either is desirable ; but the sudden change from sweet to sour , and from sour to sweet , must be avoided in feeding any kind of domestic animals . Calves appear to be the next in favor , as profitable consumers of skim-milk , and some feeders appear to think that they can feed their skim-milk to calves , and derive more profits from it than by feeding it to swine ; but this depends , to a large extent , upon the good qualities of the animals that are being fed . In feeding skim-milk to calves one cent 's worth of oilmeal will take the place of a pound of butter fat that has been removed from the milk , besides , when the milk is fed warm from the separator , it is better for the calves than milk that is cold and sour . A young animal that is fed on skim-milk , with mill // feed or grains , may be made to weigh almost as much as one of similar breeding and fed on whole milk with the same kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for veal , may be started on whole milk , and then gradually changed to skim-milk , and fed for awhile , and then made ready for market by feeding for a week or two on whole milk to put on a smooth finish and improve their sale . In feeding skim-milk to calves , overfeeding is dangerous , and must be avoided . Calves are more easily made sick by being fed poor milk than pigs . Skim-milk has also been fed to lambs , horses and colts with success . Cheese may be made from skim-milk , and could be made a profitable outlet for large quantities of the byproduct . A product called Dutch cheese , or pot cheese , is also made from skim-milk , and finds a ready sale in many cities or villages . With this , there seems to be no established price ; but some claim to be able to make a dollar 's worth of this cheese from roo pounds of skimmilk . Buttermilk ranks close to skim-milk in feeding value ; but its physical condition requires that more care be exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a human food it is excellent , and for cooking it is in demand ; but it has been the common practice for many city dealers to sell poor skim-milk for buttermilk , after it has become soured and unfit for use ; this has had the effect of decreasing the demand for buttermilk . Good buttermilk , fresh from the churn , is more valuable for cooking purposes than whole milk . How to Obtain a Good Stand of Corn A PERFECT stand of corn is that which produces the greatest possible yield . This is affected by the number of stalks and their arrangement on the surface of the soil . Of course , a perfect stand for one soil might be only half a stand for another , while a perfect stand for a wet season might be too thick a stand for the same soil in a dry season . However , no absolute rules can be laid down which will enable the corn grower to decide how far apart he shall make his rows , or how thick the stalks or hills shall stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be . The number of square feet of soil required to support a hill or stalk of corn varies with the soil fertility , cultivation , rainfall , and other seasonal or climatic conditions , the variety of corn , and many other factors . While it is probably impossible to secure a perfectly even distribution of stalks or hills , recent experiments and experience combine to indicate that each stalk or hill should stand as nearly as possible in the center of a square of soil from which it draws its food . The size of this square will , of course , be determined by the distance between stalks in the row and between rows . What this distance should be under the conditions existing in the different corn-growing States may be suggested , if not finally determined , by the tests carried on in the different States . At the Nebraska Station , corn grown in hills 44 inches 134 // apart , each way , produced the highest yield of grain when planted at the rate of four kernels per hill , but five kernels produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater yield of stover . Two kernels per hill produced the largest ears , and one kernel per hill the greatest number of two-eared plants , tillers , and ears per hundred plants . The percentage of barren plants increased with the number of plants per hill . These facts sometimes lead seed growers to plant very thinly in the hope of producing very large ears for seed , but the opposite practice is found to result in seed having the greatest producing power , as it may result in the elimination of barren plants , and those that do not produce well under adverse conditions . Corn grown at three rates , namely , at 1 , 3 and 5 plants per hill , for three years , showed an average producing power of 3.6 bushels more for the thickest planting than for the thinnest . At the Kansas Station , corn was grown in rows , 2 , 272 , 3 , 372 and 4 feet apart , and from 4 to 20 inches apart in the row ; both listed and surface-planted corn were tested in rows 372 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface planted . Both listed and surface-planted corn gave the best results when the rows were 4 feet apart , and the stalks 16 inches apart , while in 1891 the best results were obtained when rows were 3/ feet apart , stalks 16 inches apart . The average results for three years ' work at the Missouri Station indicate that the maximum yields from corn planted in hills 45 inches apart each way , was obtained from planting 3 or 4 grains per hill , 4.3 bushels per acre less being secured from planting 2 grains per hill . Lower yields were secured in hills 45 by 2272 , or 45 by 15 ? // On good land the largest yield of 70.4 bushels per acre was secured by leaving 4 stalks per hill , in hills 45 inches apart each way , while on poor land the largest yield of 36 bushels per acre resulted from thinning to 2 stalks per hill . Four stalks per hill gave a yield of 6.6 bushels less per acre , more than half of which was unmerchantable . One stalk per hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did 4 , and almost every ear was merchantable . In all cases the thicker the planting the larger the yield of stover and the greater the proportion of nubbins . Eighty-five per cent of a stand produced 2/ bushels per acre more grain than did 85 per cent of a stand in which the missing hills were replanted , and 12 bushels more than when the entire plat was planted over . Ninetyfour per cent of a perfect stand produced 2.2 bushels per acre more than 85 per cent of a perfect stand . At the Ohio Station , one grain every 12 inches , or 2 grains every 24 inches , produced better results than three grains every 36 inches , or four grains every 48 inches . One grain every 18 inches proved insufficient to secure a maximum crop , but produced the largest percentage of ears . Four grains every 42 inches proved entirely too thick for best results . The work was continued for three years . Ten years ' test at the Indiana Station showed that in seasonable years the yields of both corn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very dry year of 1894 the yield of corn was less and of stover greater from thick planting . At the Maine Station , one acre of land fertilized with 10 two-horse loads of stable manure and 750 pounds of commercial fertilizer produced , respectively , 5,246 , 5,390 , and 4,448 pounds per acre of dry matter when kernels were planted 6 , 9 , and 12 inches apart , but the ears were // larger when the planting was at a distance of 9 and 12 inches . At the Louisiana Station , stalks i8 inches apart in fivefoot rows , produced the largest results , although a closer planting might have proved more profitable during a more favorable season , but is not recommended as a general practice . At the Alabama Station , on poor and sandy land , to which complete fertilizer was added at the rate of 320 pounds per acre , the yield was largest when the constant area devoted to each plant produced , was a perfect square in shape ; that is , when 15 square feet was so planted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance between rows . The highest average yield for two years resulted from single plants three feet , nine inches apart , in rows four feet apart , but plants three feet apart in rows five feet wide , were more cheaply cultivated . A row of cow-peas should be planted between corn rows on very poor land , in which case the corn rows should be at least five feet apart . At the Georgia Station , ten years ' experiments indicated that land capable of producing 25 to 40 bushels of shelled corn per acre should be so planted as to grow 3,630 plants per acre . This number may be secured by planting 32 inches apart in 4%-foot rows , 36 inches apart in 4-foot rows , or 42 inches apart in 3%-foot rows . Soil capable of producing 15 to 25 bushels per acre produces its maximum yield when i6 square feet are allowed per plant , or 2,722 plants per acre . This number should be secured by planting 38% inches apart in 5-foot rows , 32 inches apart in 4%-foot rows , or 48 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 15 bushels per acre , give their maximum // yield when 18 to 24 square feet per stalk is allowed , or from 2,420 to 1,850 hills to the acre . Eighteen square feet per stalk may be secured by planting 36 inches apart in 6-foot rows , or 43 inches apart in 5-foot rows , or 4 feet , 3 inches apart each way . At the Texas Station the highest average yield for five varieties tested , resulted from planting 4 feet by 2% feet apart , while the planting 3 feet by 2% feet apart stood second , 5 by 3 third , and 4% by 3 gave the lowest yields . Golden Beauty and Learning produced the best yields from close planting , while Thomas , loo-day Bristol and Forsyth Favorite , did best in 4-foot rows , planted 2/ feet apart in the drill . The increase of 2.2 bushels per acre which the work at the Missouri Station indicated would result from improving the stand from 85 to 94 per cent . A perfect stand would , if secured for each of the 108,771,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase of $142,620,535.20 , at the farm value of 59.6 cents per bushel . As a matter of fact , however , comparatively few fields have even 85 per cent of a perfect stand . In view of the opinion of prominent authorities on this subject , that the average corn field has not over 66 per cent of a perfect stand , while in many cases the percentage is less than 40 , it is difficult to compute the loss resulting to the corn-growers of the United States from this cause . The Culture of Broomcorn THE principal crops of broomcorn are raised in Kansas , Oklahoma and southern Illinois , although this crop will grow in other sections of the country where soil and climatic conditions are favorable . It is a profitable crop , as the price per ton for the brush usually ranges from $50 for the lower grades that are damaged by the weather up to $200 and over for the very best . The prices for 1910 ranged from $140 to $190 per ton . In the Southwest it is becoming more important as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable extent after the brush has been removed . The seed has but small feeding value . The two best types of broomcorn grown in the Southwest particularly are the Dwarf and the Standard . The Dwarf is much liked because it grows only from four to six inches high , with a brush of from 12 to 20 inches , however . This type is better suited to the semi-arid regions and to the uplands of the broomcorn section in the Southwest . The soil should be plowed in the fall or early in the spring , so that it will retain as much moisture as possible . About two weeks before planting , the land should j be disked and harrowed , and , if necessary , harrowed a Second time before planting . Broomcorn is a good sod- Broomcorn plants are very tender , and make the most rapid growth in warm weather . They will not stand the cold of early spring like corn . The seed will rot before 139 // germinating , or if the plant germinates the growth will be retarded by continued cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way is to divide the field into sections of about ten acres each , and plant at intervals of about a week . The crop demands prompt attention , and if this system of planting is followed , there is not so much danger of damage to the brush from rain , or becoming too ripe . In case farm hands are scarce , the scarcity is not so keenly felt , for there is not a very large crop that demands attention within a period of a few days . A few hands can take care of comparatively large fields , and it is much more convenient than to plant the whole field on a single day . The method of planting is about the same as for Kaffir corn . Plant in rows about three feet apart , and four to five inches apart in the row . The Standard , due to its large growth , is planted in rows about three and a half feet apart . Selecting good seed is very important . Good seed should give a germination of 90 to 95 per cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this standard . By using seed that gives a germination test above 90 per cent , one bushel is sufficient quantity to plant twenty acres ; or two quarts of seed will plant an acre . The soil should be in good condition when seeded ; then the cultivation should begin early and be repeated frequently to prevent the weeds from getting a start of the slow-growing plants . A sharp-tooth harrow is sometimes used just as the plants are coming up . After one good harrowing , the field should receive about two cultivations of medium depth , then the rest of the cultivation should be shallow , so as not to injure the root system . In this way the soil is finely pulverized , forming a dust blanket which aids in the conservation of moisture . // Broomcorn is a crop that will not stand in the field without great damage after it is ready to harvest . It should be harvested just as the plants are coming into full bloom , or when the anthers are falling from the head . The head of the Dwarf is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more convenient to pull the head than to cut it , after which the boot is removed . The heads are usually pulled and piled in bunches along the row . The brush from three or four rows is piled together , and after drying for two or three days , is gathered and stacked in small ricks . Because of the greater height of the Standard broomcorn , it is necessary to bend the heads over to make them easy to cut . The stalks are bent at a height of about three feet . Two adjacent rows are bent diagonally across the intervening space so that the portion of the stalks above the sharp bend is supported in a horizontal position , with the seed-heads of one row extending about two feet beyond the opposite row . This method is called " tabling . " One man can table as fast as two can cut . In cutting , the operator walks along the spaces between the tables , and cuts the heads six or eight inches below the attachment of the straws . The brush as cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it very convenient for loading on a wagon . After drying , the brush should still retain the green color . To accomplish this , do not dry it in the sun , as it will be bleached to a light-brown color . By curing in sheds the original green color can be retained to a large extent , and as a result the brush will command a much better price . The average time of drying is about thirty days . It is then threshed and baled . The Sugar Beet Industry IN the general scheme of diversified farming the sugar beet may become one of the most profitable features . Sugar is an article of such general consumption that for economic reasons it ought to be produced in this country . While politicians may wrangle over the economic problems of a tariff , it might be well if we would bear in mind that homely , but wise , answer given by the immortal Lincoln when asked his opinion on the tariff . He said : " If we buy from Europe a ton of rails , we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we produce the rails , we have both the rails and the money . " At the present time we have about seventy factories in the United States , of which ten are in California . In 1897 there was produced in the United States 45,000 tons of beet sugar , while there was produced in 1911 560,000 tons . If it were not for the unfortunate agitations that come up over the sugar question , the sugar beet industry would by this time have become much larger than it is . There is land suitable for beet culture that could be used to produce all the sugar we need in America . The present consumption of sugar amounts to about four million tons , about one-sixth of which is produced in the United States , the balance being imported raw from foreign countries where cheap labor is available , and the cost of refining the sugar in the United States is only about onehalf cent per pound . If we imported all the sugar we used , and merely refined it in this country at that re-142 // fining cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American industry only about twenty-three million dollars , whereas to produce the same amount of sugar from American grown beets would contribute close to three hundred million dollars to the American industry . But there are other and more important reasons why the beet sugar industry should be fostered in the United States , and one of these is on account of the beet 's value in crop rotation . In European countries where beetgrowing is practiced it is found that they get much larger yields of crops per acre than we do in this country . Take for example barley . Our greatest barley states are California , Minnesota and South Dakota ; and from the four million acres of barley we harvest about ninety-two million bushels , while Germany harvests from about the same acreage one hundred and sixty million bushels , or seventy per cent more than we do . The same is true of other crops . Our average yield of wheat per acre is about fourteen bushels against Germany 's twenty-eight bushels ; our average yield of oats is about twenty-four bushels against Germany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Germany 's two hundred and five . Moreover , European economists say that if cane and beet sugar could be produced side by side , the cane sugar at a cost of two cents per pound and the beet sugar at a cost of four cents per pound , it would be cheaper for the nation to raise the beet sugar on account of the indirect agricultural advantages to be obtained through rotating the land with sugar beets . Good drainage and deep plowing are necessary in the cultivation of sugar beets . Instead of the ordinary furrow four or five inches deep , it is best to make it ten to fourteen inches . The reason is that the root of the plant is fed from the nitrogen of the air and the water from the soil . Very little nutriment is secured from the soil , // i the larger part of the beet being water and the nitrogen which is caught by the leaves and absorbed by the root . But in the plowing , several methods are employed by industrious raisers . Some use an ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furrow , thus necessitating covering the ground twice . Others use a subsoiler . This is an attachment which is built into an ordinary breaking plow and its function is to break up the subsoil . This leaves the ground loose for the required distance . The more progressive farmers are now adopting the deep tillage plow . This is a late invention that can be be adjusted to plow from 16 to 24 inches in depth . It takes from a 12 to i6-inch furrow in width and accomplishes its work as fast as the regular plow . By using the subsoiling method of farming the use of about three times as much land is possible and the value of the productive possibilities is enhanced considerably . The plowing should be done as late in the fall as possible and the land allowed to lie thus all winter . As soon as you can get into the fields in the spring give the land an extra good harrowing , and then cross-harrow it . In fact , put a garden finish on the field and the work of seeding will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation will be well repaid in the reduced cost of cultivation later in the season . The man who plows deep and gives the field a thorough dressing is sure to get a good crop . The seeding is done with a special beet drill and the average distance between the rows is 20 inches . This is often varied , however , and some fields have given good yields with the rows only 16 inches apart . Others plant 2 feet apart . It is merely a matter of the productive capacity of the land and the degree of wealth the farmer wants from the crop . The drill seeds the land in much // the same manner that oats or other small grain is drilled and the rows show up in the same manner as they do . The small plants are allowed to grow thus for a period of lo days or two weeks and then the farm help go into the field and commence thinning . This is a double operation . The first is done with a wide hoe , the workmen going along a row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus leaving a small bunch of plants at regular intervals along the row . This work is accomplished as soon as possible so that the small plants will have plenty of room to grow . The second operation is the thinning of the bunches down to one plant . The workmen go along to each bunch and pick out all the plants but the most lively one , and then the most careful attention is given this plant , for if it dies there will not be time to grow another to maturity in its place . The beets require as early planting as possible and are seldom harvested before the first frosts . The cultivation of the beet crop should be given great care and the attention it needs at the time it needs it . Beets are cultivated at least once each week by a special cultivator which handles two rows at each trip across the field . Shallow cultivation will prove to be the best if the work is done frequently . It is impossible to crosswork the field , so it will be necessary to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lint and cut out all weeds . The elimination of weeds is necessary to give a proper beet growth . The beets are harvested as soon as they are ripe by the use of a lifter . The size of the beets precludes the responsibility of pulling them by hand successfully . It will found advisable to clean off the soil to a certain extent , o that no losses may be had through inaccurate tare weight at the factory . The beets may be left in the field where thrown out by the lifter until the topping process can be reached as frost will not have any injurious effect // on the sugar values if not repeated too often . Repeated freezing will ruin the beet as the thawing of the beet releases a part of the sap and sugar that it carries . The topping is done with an ordinary knife , the operation being to cut off the top of the beet so that all the green sprout is removed . If the topping is not done close enough the weigher will deduct a percentage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not contain any sugar values . The beet need not be cut square across but just close enough to remove the green sprouts . After the beets are topped they are thrown into convenient piles where they await loading for transportation to the factory . Generally the order is sent to the grower just when the factory desires him to start getting in his beets . In reference to the yields that may be expected it may be said that the yield will fluctuate in proportion to the care given the crop . One farmer having just as good land as the man across the road may only get a third of the yield owing to his slipshod methods of cultivation . In figures the minimum is close to six tons to the acre and the maximum is about 40 tons . The average may be close to i8 or 20 tons to the acre and at the contract price of say $5 per ton for i6 per cent beets you can figure the profits for yourself . This is not taking into consideration any of the indirect profits which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that time and again it has been shown that when beets re-rotated once each four years with oats , corn and wheat , it increased the yields of the other crops a considerable per cent . Just why , is a story in itself . Probably the cheapest fertilizer that you can get for beet land is the tops after they have been cut off the beets . Leaving the tops on the ground to rot through the winter and then plowing them under in the spring will be found to give a good coat of fertilizer and one that will be strong enough to nurture the crop . Stable manure // is excellent if you have it , but it should be well rotted and evenly spread over the field . The purchase of commercial fertilizers is made to some extent but the cost of the product has led to its being slowly adopted . It will hardly get any lower in price and if you have no fertilizer of any kind it will probably be best if a small amount is used . If any other method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation of the crops will be advantageous for it will give the land a rest each season . The necessities of the various plants are different . By rotating corn , wheat and oats after a crop of beets an increase in all the crops will be found . Some farmers find it profitable to rotate a crop of potatoes with the small grains . For the past 100 years the farmers of France have raised sugar beets and rotated their crops in the above manner and they have succeeded in building up the once barren wastes of France into the most productive areas in the world . The reason given for this is the thorough cultivation demanded by beets . And then almost unconsciously the same methods are adopted in the farming of other crops , to the added profit and advantage of the grower . The pulp resulting from the extraction of the beet sugar possesses great feeding values for stock and in almost all cases it is hauled off by the farmers as soon as it is thrown out at the factory . Irrigation by Wells Profitable No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had as hard a struggle for recognition and commercial standing as that of irrigation from wells . Ten years ago it was hooted at as a chimera and a plaything . Even today , scores of successful agriculturists in the west contend that it is utterly impracticable and unprofitable except in a few favored instances . Well irrigation has more enthusiastic advocates and more bitter critics than almost any measure affecting the prosperity of the west . About 15 years ago , J. L. Bristow , now a United States senator from Kansas , sought to interest the farmers of the central west in a movement for well irrigation . Starting in the midst of a cycle of dry years , the movement sprang into immediate favor and assumed considerable proportions . " Pump the underflow ! " was Mr. Bristow 's slogan . Subsequent wet years rather checked the movement as a country-wide proposition , yet much of the well irrigation in western Kansas and Nebraska and in Colorado of today may be traced back to Bristow 's plan to redeem the entire west from the drought tyrant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , began experiments which resulted in the institution of a reclamation project at Garden City , Kan. , the source of water supply being the underflow of the Arkansas River . This is now the most extensive well irrigation district in the United States . More than 250 wells are drained by electric power generated at a central power plant . The wells are in 28 groups , a pumping 148 // station being maintained at each group . The series of stations cover a distance of five miles , the water flowing into a huge concrete conduit , which carries it to the laterals radiating into the fields . About 10,000 acres of land are watered from this plant , mostly devoted to sugar beets and alfalfa . The cost of the water to the farmers is $3 an acre yearly , with some small fees additional , and after a series of years , following the plan of all government projects , the great system will become the property of the landowners . At the time of the Bristow movement , not 500 acres in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including rice irrigation in Louisiana and Texas , is 750,000 acres . In California alone 200,000 are under water from wells , the lift in many places being as much as 200 feet . Critics of the new departure contend that water can not possibly be lifted more than 20 or 30 feet at any profit . California agriculturists , however , lift water up to 200 feet , carry it for miles in cement ditches , and find the growing of alfalfa , which sells for $15 a ton , profitable . Barley , wheat and all manner of crops are grown with this same expensive water ? water which costs from $5 to $1o , and even as high as $i5 an acre for the year . In portions of the rice-growing sections of the South , water from wells is now used for flooding , in places , in preference to bayou or creek water . In the rice counties of Arkansas wells furnish the water exclusively for a profitable industry . Rice culture requires many times the amount of water necessary for ordinary irrigation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy cost of pumping . It is manifest that large works , like the Garden City project , would only be feasible where large bodies of subterranean water exist . Such underflows , however , are not unusual , and in practically every region the ordinary // well is available . True , the depth to the water varies and is often great and the supply may not be inexhaustible , but each in its degree will aid in the growth of crops , and is a valuable acquisition to any farm where the supply of moisture is inadequate . Well irrigation is especially adapted to small tracts of from 20 to 40 acres , but like all enterprises , large operations can usually be conducted more economically than small ones . Given the possibility of securing a good well , it costs approximately $25 an acre to place small tracts under such irrigation . In a section in New Mexico where a strong underflow is encountered at depths varying from 15 to loo feet , it is calculated that a plant can be installed for $2,000 which will be capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will average smaller as the scale of operations increases . There are , however , many advantages for the small farmer , and in the end his profits will doubtless be large . Power is the most important and the most expensive item to take account of . Where electricity is unavailable , gasoline engines must be resorted to and the high cost of fuel , especially in the remote localities , is a serious obstacle . In this New Mexico locality it costs from $3 to $4 an acre foot to produce water , and under present conditions 2 feet or more are necessary to produce a crop . The endeavor now is to combine the irrigation and dry farming methods , thus reducing the quantity of water necessary . Wind power is used to some extent and is less expensive than any other , but it can only be utilized in connection with large storage tanks or reservoirs . It often happens that the wind ceases to blow just the time when water is most needed . Advantages of Concrete on Farms FARMERS of all classes will find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks on their premises . Persons starting in agriculture should not neglect the opportunity to have substantial and fireproof structures . It is easy to go ahead on this line from the beginning , though hard to change after a start has been made with frame buildings . Concrete is as cheap as lumber for building purposes , and even cheaper , if sand , gravel and labor are largely furnished on the place . An ordinary farm hand will become expert in the use of concrete with a few days ' experience . Silos , barns and other buildings made of this material are much safer than wood against fire and storm . There is satisfaction in knowing that live stock , machinery and crops are not in danger of being destroyed by the flames . It is a pleasure also to have the snug shelter and tasty appearance that may be obtained from cement construction . The largest part of concrete is the gravel or crushed stone . This should be clean ; that is , free from loam , clay or vegetable matter . The best results are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is retained on a one-fourth inch screen , to the larger ones that will pass a one and one-half inch ring . For heavy foundation and abutment work , larger sized pebbles and stones might be used , while for reinforced concrete work 151 // pebbles larger than those passing a one inch ring should not be used . In the selection of sand the greatest care should be used , and critical attention should be given to its quality , for sand contributes from one-third to one-half of the amount of the materials used in making concrete . Sand may be considered as including all grains and small pebbles that will pass through a wire screen with one-fourth inch meshes , while gravel in general is the pebbles and stones retained upon such a screen . The sand should be clean , coarse , and , if possible , free from loam , clay and vegetable matter . In mixing materials for concrete use two and a half times as much sand as Portland cement , and twice as much gravel or stone as sand ? that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand and five parts gravel or crushed stone . Use just enough water to get the consistency desired . If the sand is very fine the cement should be increased from Jo to 15 per cent . When the mixture does not have a uniform color , but looks streaky , it has not been fully mixed . If the mixture does not work well and the sand and cement do not fill the voids in the stone , the percentage of stone should be reduced slightly , but the concrete should first be properly mixed . Concrete that is poorly mixed may present features that are entirely eliminated by turning it over once or twice more . Concrete wet enough to be mushy and run off a shovel when being handled is used for reinforced work , thin walls , or other thin sections . Concrete just wet enough to make it jellylike is used for some reinforced work and also for foundations , floors , etc . It requires ramming with a tamper to remove air bubbles and to fill voids . This concrete is of a medium consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of sand and gravel combined , can be obADVANTAGES // tained , and it is frequently used on the farm and in small jobs of concrete work just as it comes from the pit or creek . Occasionally this gravel contains nearly the right proportions of sand and gravel , but in the majority of sand pits and gravel banks there is a great variation in the sizes of the grains and pebbles or gravel and in the quantities of each . This is due to the fact that all the deposits are formed in seams or pockets that make it impossible to secure anything like uniformity . Therefore , to get the best and cheapest concrete , it is advisable to screen the sand and gravel and to remix them in the correct proportions . Dirty sand makes a weak concrete . Crushed rock is much better than screened gravel because of the rougher edges . As a test of sand , rub it in the hand and if there is much dirt left on the hand discard that sand . If , when a large handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it leaves the water muddy , discard it . Following are the four recognized mixtures for concrete : Rich mixture ? One part Portland cement , two parts of clean , coarse sand , four parts of crushed rock . This is used for floors , fence posts , and the like . Medium mixture ? One-half and one and two-fifths parts respectively of cement , sand and crushed rock . This mixture is used for walks and thin walls . Ordinary mixture-I-3-6 for heavy walls , piers , abutments , etc . Lean mixture-I-4-8 for footings and in places where volume and not great strength is needed . When gravel is used , the proportions are one part of cement and from six to nine parts of gravel , according to the amount of sand in the gravel . To make one cubic yard of concrete the following respective amounts of cement are required : Rich mix154 ADVANTAGES OF CONCRETE ON FARMS ture one and one-half barrels ; medium mixture one and one-fourth barrels ; ordinary mixture one and one-eighth barrels ; lean mixture seven-eighths of a barrel . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bridges , reinforcements of iron are absolutely necessary . The beginner will need the supervision of an expert in using reinforcements . Measure exact amounts for each part . Mix thoroughly and not too long before applying the water . Cement will set in 20 or 30 minutes and if disturbed after that loses its strength . Spread the sand and cement on a mixing board and mix thoroughly , adding enough water when mixed to bring the mixture to the consistency of mortar . Add the proper quantity of crushed rock and mix all together , after which it is ready for use . In this manner the sand grains are all covered with the finer particles of cement and the crushed rock when added has all the voids filled with temperate mixture . This undoubtedly gives the greatest strength for materials used . A very common method , however , is to mix all three parts at once while yet dry and then to mix with water until the mixture will pack well , and handle with a shovel . Get the form walls rigid and do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up moisture and changes its shape so as to injure the concrete in setting . Do not allow concrete work to dry out fast , as cracks will appear . It should be protected from the sun for three or five days and sprinkled with water to insure even setting throughout the concrete . In two weeks concrete gains strength sufficient for ordinary use , but 6o days should elapse before it is given a full load . Important Points in Building Silos IT is a common mistake in building silos to construct them without sufficient depth of foundation . In northern states the frost line may be five feet from the surface , and unless the wall is put down to this depth , the structure is apt to be thrown out of plumb and possibly ruined at the breaking up of winter . The weight of the silo walls makes little difference , but the damage is most serious where cement or brick has been used . Even with wooden frames there is no reason why the foundation should not be five feet or more in depth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , so far as preservation of fodder is concerned . There is no material damage from water settling at the bottom , most of the liquid being held in the silage . This is merely a question of convenience , and it would seem wise to make the cavity as low as it is necessary to put the walls ? that is , three to five feet . Farmers are turning from wooden silos to those of cement and brick , in order to gain security , many of the lighter structures having been destroyed by wind . They do not gain security , however , unless the foundation is right , and as the average cost is higher with cement or brick , it seems like a foolish risk to have any but the most durable work . In nearly every case where silo walls are seen to be cracked or out of plumb , it will be found the trouble started with a poor foundation . The necessity of making repairs in a new silo is not only aggravating but it is expensive , if thoroughly done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which deserve consideration in order to prevent early damage . In brick construction there is danger of rushing the work too fast to allow for settling . A small affair like a silo goes up quickly with two or three skillful men on the job , and the walls will settle perceptibly for days after the job is completed . This rapid construction should not be allowed . There is little of this kind of danger in building walls for a large house or store . The quality of the brick is worth mentioning also . A number of cases are known where brick plants were started up in a convenient place to supply the commodity in a hurry to a few transient customers . When it was too late , it was found that there was considerable lime in the clay , as a result of which the wall cracked in a short time , and much loss followed . It is economy to use brick of a high grade . Those building wooden silos need to look well to the foundations also . Where it can be done without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the barn , to lessen the danger from wind . It is possible to anchor one of these lighter structures with three or four iron rods . Such an addition to the expense of construction is not more than $10 or $15 , and it may save the silo from destruction in case of a heavy storm . No investment on the farm makes bigger returns than that em-ployed in providing a good silo , but without proper construction money is wasted instead of being gained . For the past fifteen years , practically all silos built have been round in shape , and this is the only style to be recommended at present . The essential things in silo construction are to have an air-tight wall , smooth on the inside so the silage can settle properly , and a structure sufficiently strong to hold the enormous pressure of the silage , and durable enough so that it will not be necessary to replace it for some time . Successful silos have been // built in a variety of ways and of a variety of materials , including wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wood , brick , iron and tile . It is not the purpose in this article to give details for construction of silos , but rather to give information regarding the subject in general and the advantages of the first three types mentioned . The most common silo found in America is that known as the stave silo . This is built on the plan of a stave water tank . It is purchased ready to put together , requiring only that the foundation be made . A foundation is built of concrete . The walls should be about eight inches thick . A stave silo 16x32 feet will cost about $300 . The foundation is not included in this estimate . The cost of a concrete block or solid wall silo of the size given is from $300 to $500 . The concrete silo may be built of blocks or with solid walls . The latter is sometimes called monolithic . The kind most to be recommended is the solid wall structure . The advantages of a concrete silo are that when once properly built it is a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or from drying out . It does not preserve the silage any better than does one with a wall of wood . On the other hand , if the concrete wall is properly constructed , so that the air is kept out , the silage will be preserved in perfect condition . The objections that are often raised to the concrete silo , especially by those interested in the sale of the stave silo , are that it will crack and fall down , and , furthermore , that it will not preserve the silage . It is quite true that both these conditions have been met with in many cases . If the structure is properly reinforced , there is not the least danger of it cracking or falling down . If the walls are made of a mixture containing sufficient cement , so that the wall is not too porous , the silage does not spoil . It requires some skill to properly build a concrete silo . A // farmer who has had no experience in concrete work should secure the assistance of some one who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cement blocks may be bought in all parts of the country , and they enable a farmer to put up a silo in a few days , at moderate cost . The two things to be especially regarded in building the concrete silo are to have an abundance of iron for reinforcement and sufficient cement in the mixture to make the walls impervious to air . It is a good plan to go over the inside wall of a concrete silo each year , or at least every second year , before filling with a mixture of cement and water . The mixture should be about the consistency of whitewash . This helps to close up the pores of the wall and to exclude the air . If a concrete silo stands empty during the summer , the walls become very dry . When the moist silage is put in , the walls absorb the moisture from the silage . This may result in white mould forming near the outer edge . This condition , when present , indicates that the concrete has been made too porous . The trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made too porous , by applying the cement and water mixture as described . It is also well , where the concrete has been made too porous , to wet the walls with water as the silage is put in , to prevent the absorption of water from the silage . The forms for building a concrete silo cost about $50 . It is desirable for a number of farmers to club together and build the forms . One set of forms may be used for several silos , and in this way the cost of construction can be reduced . Chance for Big Profits in Novelties WITH a keen market demand for vegetables and fruit , farmers have a chance to secure far larger profits than they can gain from grain growing or dairying . Mixed agriculture is the need of the times , with smaller farms and better cultivation . There should be the greatest possible range of production when markets are easily reached . Farmers and their sons and daughters should aim to produce novelties , or at least articles which are not commonly understood by landowners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardeners make a large profit from salsify , sometimes called vegetable oyster . This is one of the neglected products for which there is a quick sale . Many prefer it to the oyster , whose flavor it has a hint of , with all the disagreeable features of the bivalve flavor left out . It can be cooked in many ways . As a soup , served with bread or crackers , it is delicious . Fried , either by itself or in a batter , it is quite as appetizing as the real oyster when cooked in that way . Boiled , sliced lengthwise when tender , and fried in butter , like the parsnip , it soon becomes a favorite . Especially is salsify a valuable addition to our somewhat limited list of winter vegetables , because it can be dug in the fall and stored in the cellar , or it can be left in the ground over winter and dug in the spring , when it will be found deliciously fresh and of fine flavor . The culture of this plant is of the simplest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depth of a foot and a half . Sow it in rows for convenience in cultivating , 159 s // and keep down the weeds .

Watch the catalogues of reliable seed houses for novelties . The Trophy marked a new era in tomatoes , and was really the first with smooth exterior and solid inside . We had had smooth tomatoes before , but they had big seed hollows inside , and all that we had with solid meat were very rough , like the mammoth Chihuahua . But the production of the Trophy was a success , because it put this solid tomato inside a smooth skin , and ever since it has been the effort of breeders to keep it there . The best efforts of the breeders should now be devoted to the maintenance of the earliness of the extra early sorts , with increased smoothness . This has been attained in the Earliana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cucumbers , of which every seedsman has his special strain . Of these I have found that there is nothing better than the combination of the White Spine and Long Green , known as the Davis Perfect . It is longer and slimmer than the White Spine , and earlier than the Long Green , and in my opinion deserves its name . Never follow the fall crop of lettuce with lettuce , for it is sure to be attacked by the wilt . This crop needs a change of soil as often as possible . It is easy to raise lettuce in the winter in a room that has an even and moderate temperature . This is better than midsummer lettuce and sells at fancy figures . Lettuce is raised with least trouble in spring and fall . When soil can be worked in the spring , lettuce , radishes , onions and peas should be planted in the open garden . All of these can stand considerable frost . It is well to put in some early potatoes . The early vegetables bring big profits . The Logan berry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is getting a start . This fruit is originated by Judge Logan , of Santa Cruz , Cal . It is proving to be the easiest and best producing berry that can be grown on the Pacific coast . It is especially free from disease , is a rank grower , and yields enormously . It is steadily gaining in favor with the lady experts of cooking . It is especially adapted for pie cooking and jam . It is one of the many twentieth-century agricultural achievements . Many products now generally overlooked can be turned into cash . Seven children in one family in Arcola , Ill. , made $300 one winter peeling broomcorn stalks and selling the pith to warehouses , there to be shipped to jewelers and watch factories . It is used by them for cleaning their wares . It contains no grit nor hard fiber , and will absorb oil or dirt without danger of scratching .

Then , during the evenings or on rainy clays , they peel one joint at a time and take out the clean , white pith . This is made up into round bundles , holding two or three pounds each , but nearly as large as a washtub . The price received is 25 cents a pound . There is not a large or unlimited demand for this material , but it pays quite a few dollars each winter into the pockets of the Arcola people . The dasheen , like the potato , is a native of South America , but is not a member of the botanical group of plants to which the potato , tomato , eggplant and pepper belong . It is closely related to the tanier of the southern United States and the taro of Hawaii . It is said that dasheens are even more nourishing than the potato . In flavor they suggest boiled chestnuts . At the recent annual banquet of the National Geographical Society , their edible qualities were thoroughly tested . // They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a well-known New York club .

The woman who does not raise her own strawberries is losing a lot of pleasure , for they grow so rapidly and so luxuriantly , as if they thought to be allowed to live were a grand privilege , and it is rare sport to watch them . Sauerkraut is easily made on the farm , and pays well . There are two essentials which must be observed in making sauerkraut : First , it must be remembered that if too much salt is used , the kraut will not sour as it should , and the quality will be impaired . Again , some salt must be used in order to preserve the cabbage till it sours sufficiently to preserve itself . When kraut gets sour , it is like pickles , and there will be no further decay . To make the best kraut , a slicer should be used , though it may be sliced with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste . Use a clean barrel or jar , put in a layer of cabbage , cut fine , then a little salt , using not more than a quart of salt to a 4o-gallon barrel of kraut . If you like the flavor , add a little dill seed or caraway . When the vessel is full , fit a clean board inside , and weight with a clean stone , never a piece of iron . If your cabbage is early , and going to waste while it is yet warm , make the kraut and keep in a cool cellar . This early kraut will rot a little on top . Remove this every few days , and wash off the inside of the barrel and weight with warm water , to remove the germs of decay .

Pin Money in Pickles PICKLES come only partly by nature ? they are born of work and worry . But they fetch in money ? if the work and worry are properly expended . Notwithstanding the efforts of the professional pickle growers , there is every season more and more room for the non-professional . If the non-professional is a woman with a knack of seasoning and a dozen or so time-honored and individual family recipes , she may treble her profits by herself putting up the yield of the pickle garden . If she lacks time or strength or skill or facilities for that , she can at least put the pickles in brine or sell them fresh-cut to her neighbors , the handy huckster or her nearest grocer . In planning a pickle garden , first look over your ground ? this literally and metaphorically . The literal side has to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for the supply to be created or the possibilities of creating a new demand for something different . Pickles worth eating are worth also a fair price . Resolve to be satisfied with nothing less . Take account here of individual taste . Hearty laborers relish big salt green cucumbers , but sniff disdain of fancy relishes and unwonted tangs or mixed flavors , such as the mangoes and picalilli , whose appeal to educated palates is irresistible . If the soil of the pickle garden is thin , it had better be devoted to cucumbers . The long green variety is best ; it can be cut at little-finger length , or left until almost full grown , and still be marketable . Have the ground made light and fine . 164 // Keep the hills light and clean , also the whole space between them . Plows can run between the hills until the vines begin to spread . Once they fairly cover the earth , what grass comes up will not hurt them . Rooted in the rich hills , they can easily give odds to anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , a little hoe work and hand-weeding may be in order , but take care neither to bruise the vines nor to throw loose dirt upon the leaves , especially while the dew is on . Unless there is a ready market close at hand , get the brine barrel ready as soon as the first flowers appear . It must be clean and sweet before the brine goes in ? old pork and fish barrels always taint their later contents . Empty whisky barrels or molasses barrels do excellently , but should be well painted outside with red lead , to prevent the ravages of wood worms . Make the brine of soft water and clean salt , strong enough to float an egg . A little brown sugar or molasses improves the keeping quality . Bring it to a boil , and skim clean after everything is dissolved . Pour it into the barrel boiling hot , let stand a day , and skim again before putting in pickles . The net result is very nearly the same whether the pickles are cut small or at full growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stick to the decision . Cut the pickles every morning , while the dew is on ? thus they are plump and cool , in the best condition for keeping . Use very sharp shears for clipping , and take care to leave the least bit of stalk to each pickle , but never to wound , bruise or break the vine . If by accident a vine is bruised or torn , cut it off remorselessly , so it shall not decay and set up disease in the whole plant . Be careful of bruising the pickles . In washing , use plenty of water , and drain them well before putting them into the brine . Keep a weighted wooden cover floating on top of the brine , thus insuring that the pickles shall stay covered . Put only one sort and size of pickle into a
