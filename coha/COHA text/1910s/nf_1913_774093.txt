txt // the eutectic . All mixtures having compositions intermediate between E and D consist , when solid , of crystals of B surrounded by a greater or less quantity of eutectic . For a mixture y , which has the same composition as E. the metal remains a homogeneous liquid until the temperature reaches that of the horizontal F G ; the whole mass then solidifies while the temperature remains constant . Typical cooling curves for three such alloys are shown in Fig. 16. and , after paragraphs 10 to 13 , should need no further explanation . The time for each mixture , during which the temperature remains constant while the eutectic solidifies , may be plotted on a diagram as explained on pp. 29 and 30 ; in Fig. 17 the ordinates of the black triangle at the top of the figure are proportional to these times . Under the microscope , the mixture x shows primary crystallites of A surrounded by eutectic , while in z the primary crystallites are of B ; y consists entirely of eutectic . The size of the crystalline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cooled , and also upon the nature of the alloy . The structure is sometimes coarse enough to be distinguished by the naked eye , but more often a magnification of at least 10 to 20 diameters is required to make the details easily visible . Each of the various areas of the equilibrium diagram represents a different state of the metallic mixture , which may be indicated as in Fig. 17 . Above the boundary C E D the alloy is entirely liquid . 9 point within the triangular area C E F represents a mixture of .1-crystals with liquid , while a point within D E G corresponds with a mixture of B-crystals and liquid . Below the temperature of the line F G the alloy is an entirely solid mixture of A and B ; to the left of E the solid mixture is one of primary A-crystals and eutectic , and to the right of E one of primary B-crystals and eutectic , the eutectic itself being a mixture of A-crystals and B-crystals . The relative proportion of each structural constituent for any mixture can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 15 ) contains 80 per cent . of A and 20 per cent . of B , while the eutectic contains 40 per cent . of A and 60 per cent . of B , all proportions being by weight . Hence , 33.3 per cent . by weight of the solid alloy x consists of eutectic , and the remainder , or 66-7 per cent. , is formed of separate crystals of pure A. If the densities of the two metals are known , the relative volumes of each constituent can be calculated , and the ratio of these volumes is very nearly the same as the ratio of the areas of the constituents shown by a microsection , the approximation being closer the larger the area of section taken . By calculating relative volumes of the constituents for a number of mixtures a diagram could be prepared , similar to Fig. 18 , which would give the structural composition of any alloy of the series at a glance ; for drawing this diagram the density of A has been taken as twice that of B. With the given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alloy x , containing 80 per cent . of A , would be shown by a microsection as 55-6 per cent . of A-crystals and 44-4 per cent . of eutectic . Fig. 18 might be used to take the place of chemical analysis , for if the areas of the two constituents were measured on a micrograph of an alloy by means of a planimeter , and found to be 40 per cent . of A and 60 per cent . of eutectic , the diagram shows that the alloy contains 71 per cent . of A and 29 per cent . of B by weight . Some caution must be observed in using such diagrams on account of the difficulty of obtaining the alloys in a state of perfect equilibrium , and there are other sources of error to be avoided . For if one pure metal is in excess the comparatively large primary masses of this , if the cooling is moderately prolonged , will attract small crystals of the same substance from the eutectic . The effect is quite noticeable on a section , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eutectic is entirely absent for a considerable space all round the large white areas ; in some sections the primary areas show small protrusions where the process of absorption has been arrested while in active operation . This action must diminish appreciably the volume , and , therefore , the area on the micro-section occupied by eutectic , while it increases that of the white constituent . When the proportion of eutectic is relatively small the one constituent may be entirely absorbed by the large crystal lites , and the substance which surrounds these is then the second-pure metal . A somewhat similar process is observed when the solid metal consists only of eutectic , as this , if kept for a long time at a temperature slightly below its freezing point . shows its components to have segregated into separate , relatively large masses , and the characteristic banded or dotted structure is lost . Another effect which should not be overlooked is that due to the difference between the densities of the two component metals . If the lighter metal is the first to solidify , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid , and a vertical section through a solid ingot shows a much larger proportion of primary crystals at the top than at , the bottom ; if the heavier metal separates first the conditions are reversed , and the bottom of the ingot is richer in the primary crystals . The effect is more noticeable the greater the difference bet ween the densities of the metals , the slower the cooling , and the less the viscosity of the liquid mixture . In spite of such causes of inaccuracy a structural diagram like Fig. 18 has been found , in certain cases , to give very fair results . Examples of the above class are found in the alloys of gold with t halliumi. " ' silver with lead ? " ' . L01 and antimony with lead . 16 . The Lead-Antimony Alloys. ? The equilibrium diagram for this series is drawn in Fig. 19 , from data which are somewhat lacking in accuracy . ' ' " Solid lead and solid antimony are nearly , if not quite , insoluble in each other . The two branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a composi t ion of about 87.5 per cent . of lead , and a temperature of 248 ? C. ( 178 ? F. ) . The ordinates of the black triangle in the upper part of the diagram show , for the various experimental mixtures , the t ime during which the temperature remained constant at 248 ? C. ; Ilse sides of this triangle intersect also at 87.5 per cent . of lead . All alloys containing between 0 and 12-5 per cent . of antimony // // consist of primary crystallites of lead , surrounded by more or less eutectic ; Fig. 20 shows the structure of an alloy containing 10 per cent . of antimony . Alloys with 0 to 87.5 per cent . of lead consist of primary crystals of antimony surrounded by eutectic , as illustrated by Fig. 22 , containing 40 per cent . of lead ; the structure of the eutectic in this micrograph is not very distinct . A section of the nearly pure eutectic is given in Fig. 21 . Sections of alloys rich in lead require careful treatment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etching , repeated several times . gives good results . In sections of the antimony-rich alloys , after polishing , the relatively hard antimony crystals are left in relief above the softer eutectic , and the edges of the crystals are somewhat rounded , as can be seen in Fig. 22 . This series gives an interesting illustration of the effect of gravity , mentioned on pp. 42 and 43 , which is best seen in alloys containing a little more than the eutectic proportion of antimony . The primary urvstals of this metal are much lighter than the lead-rich liquid , and tend to rise . If cooling has been slow , a vertical section of an ingot shows , even on a roughly sawn surface , a bright upper layer // of antimony . Fig. 23 is from the upper part of an ingot containing 16.5 per cent . of antimony , and shows the primary crystals of antimony clustered towards the top , while the bottom consists of eutectic , in which very few primary crystals remain . Fig. 24 is a section of the same alloy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the antimony . Analysis of the bright crystals shows that they are nearly pure antimony.i221 Lead-antimony alloys are of considerable industrial importance . They are used in the manufacture of types , bearings , bullets , accumulator plates , and certain chemical apparatus . For a type-metal the alloy must be easily fusible , homogeneous when cast , hard enough to resist the pressure of printing , but soft enough to be easily cut with a graver , and it should expand on solidifying so as to take the finest designs on the mould . These conditions are best fulfilled by the alloy containing 15 per cent . of antimony , but the proportions actually used vary between 10 and 25 per cent . With modern print ing machines a harder alloy is found to be necessary ; the proportion of antimony is somewhat increased , and tin is added to the mixture . The usual composition lies between lead 50 to 60 , antimony 25 to 30 , tin 25 to 10 per cent . Plates for engraving are made from similar // mixtures . The addition of tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copper is sometimes added also . I4'or the construction of bearings the most desirable kind of alloy is one which consists of hard grains embedded in a relatively soft matrix . Such a structure is found in lead-antimony alloys containing more than 12.5 per cent . of antimony , but a proportion of 20 per cent . should not be exceeded for this purpose , or the hard grains become too abundant . A well-known brand of anti-friction metal formerly contained 16.5 per cent of antimony . Fig. 24 is a section of this alloy , and shows the hard grains of antimony embedded in a comparatively soft matrix of imperfectly developed eutectic ; it is important for this purpose that the metal be cooled rapidly enough to prevent flotation of the antimony . Pure lead-antimony bearing metals are not suitable for heavy loads , but their rigidity is increased by the addition of tin or of copper . Further information on the subject will be found in paragraph 106 . Antimony in small quantities is sometimes added to lead used for making bullets , in order to increase their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . in the lead plates of accumulators , and up to 10 or 15 per cent . in the lead apparatus of chemical works // has the same purpose of increasing the hardness , while not greatly decreasing the acid-resisting properties of the lead . 1 . Class I. ( a ) ? ( 2 ) The liquidus is a continuous curve joining the freezing points of the two pure nnetals. ? In this case the typical equili brium diagram has the form shown in Fig. 25 . Addition of B to A causes lowering of the freezing point in a manner indicated by the line C D ; addition of A to B causes the freezing point of the mixture to rise above that of the metal B , so that A and not B crystallises first from the liquid , however great a proportion of B is present . Any mixture , x , begins to solidify by liberating , at the tempera ture x ' . crystals of pure A , the metal of higher freezing point , and this process continues as the temperature falls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of pure B. which then solidifies while the temperature remains stationary , and // the alloy becomes completely solid at x " ' . The process of solidi fication is similar for all mixtures of the series , and each alloy consists , when solid , of a greater or less proportion of primary crystals of pure A , the less fusible metal , surrounded by a secondary crystal lisation of pure B , the more fusible metal . A typical cooling curve for an alloy of this class is similar to that for x or z , Fig. 16 . If the times during which the temperature remains stationary at that of the line F D are plotted for the corresponding compositions , the triangular diagram at the top of Fig. 25 is obtained . This figure shows also the constitution of the alloys at various temperatures ; a point in the space above the line C D represents a mixture which is entirely liquid , one in the space between C D and F D represents a mixture of A-crystals and liquid , and a point below F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no perfect example of this class . 18 . The Copper-Bismuth Alloys. ? Fig. 26 is the equilibrium diagram for the alloys of copper with bismuth. ( : , . 21 , 2 ) In this case there is an eutectic containing 99.8 per cent . of bismuth , and having its freezing point about 0.7 ? C. below that of pure bismuth ; t- ' ' ll t he scale of the diagram is too small to show this eutectic point separately . The degree of solubility of each solid metal in the other is less than 0.1 per cent . All the alloys containing more than 0.2 per cent . of copper consist of primary crystals of sensibly pure copper 4 // // in a matrix of sensibly pure bismuth , as , for example , in Fig. 27 , containing 25 per cent of copper . The particular interest of the diagram lies in the explanation which it affords of the well-known weakening and embrittling effect produced on copper by the presence of a minute proportion of bismuth ; for each ductile crystal of copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when only 0.5 per cent of the latter element is present. ( " t Fig. 28 is a section of an alloy containing 1 per cent . of bismuth , and shows the light network of this metal enveloping the copper grains , and some small globules of bismuth entangled within the grains during solidification . When such a metal is broken , the line of fracture passes completely through the bismuth ; the mass may be pounded to a coarse powder , but each grain of the powder , being a crystal of nearly pure copper with a mere surface coating of bismuth , retains most of its original malleability. 19 . Class I. ( b ) . ? The two metals are completely soluble in each other when just liquid , but are only partially soluble in each other when just solid . There are two branches of the liquidus curve , and these may intersect each other in a point which lies ( 1 ) Below the freezing points of both pure metals ; ( 2 ) Above the freezing point of one of the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidus intersect in a point which lies below the freezing points of both pure metals. ? Such conditions are of frequent occurrence among metals which form no chemical compounds . Fig. 29 is a typical equilibrium diagram for this class of alloys , C E D being the liquidus , and C H K D the solidus , while I ' II , R K are the branches of the curve of solubility for the solid metals . The lines of the diagram have been drawn straight , but t hey are slightly curved for actual alloys . It was seen , in paragraphs 12 and 13 , that H corresponds with the composition of the saturated solid solution of B in A , and K with that of the saturated solid solution of A in B at the eutectic temperature . The dotted line p q r is the curve of solubility for the liquid metals ; since the metals are supposed completely soluble in each other when just liquid , the curve p q r must be entirely below the temperature at which the alloys become wholly solid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium diagram , except as indicating a possible breaking up of the liquid into two conjugate solutions , if it could be supercooled sufficiently . The process of solidification of alloys of this class is , in many respects , similar to that of the alloys of Class I. ( a ) , but now , instead of either of the pure metals separating from the liquid , a solid solution of one of the metals in the other is obtained . Similarly , the utectic is not a mixture of the pure metals A and B , but of the // solid solutions H and K. The process of solidification of a number of alloys of the series , represented by the points t , u , r , w , x , y. and z , will now be considered ; these compositions have been chosen as representative of the different kinds of mixtures obtainable . The alloy t commences to freeze at the temperature t ' , where tiny crystals which have the composition t " , found by drawing the horizontal through t ' to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crystals contain a greater proportion of A than the liquid , which , therefore , becomes richer in B , and the freezing point is accordingly lowered . When the temperature has dropped slightly other crystals are formed , or the first ones grow in size by fresh deposits from without . But the new solid differs in composition from the old , for the liquid is now richer in B than previously , and the second crop of crystals is likewise richer in B than the first ; and since the composition of the new crystals is // that which corresponds with equilibrium between the solid and the liquid parts of the mixture , it follows that the crystals first deposited must change until their composition is the same as that of the later ones , if perfect equilibrium is to be established . The process of solidification is conveniently regarded as consisting , after each small decrease of temperature , first of a change in the composition of the solid already formed to that required for equilibrium , followed by the deposition of a small quantity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature . The change in the composition of the pre-existing crystals is the result of diffusion of the necessary quantity of the metal B from the liquid into the crystals , an action which is considerably hindered by the almost simultaneous formation of the deposit of new crystals . The relative a mounts of solid and liquid in the mixture at any temperature are easily calculated for any definite alloy , if the diagram is known . In Fig. 29 the alloy t contains 122 per cent . of B , and at the temperature u " u ' the composition of the crystals is a " ? 62 per cent . of B ? while the composition of the liquid is u ' ? 20 per cent . of B ; hence the mixture consists of 55.6 per cent . of crystals and 44.4 per cent . of liquid . Solidification thus continues , and the crystals change gradually in composition , in a manner shown by the solidus line C H , until at t " ' , on the vertical through t , they have the same composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute the whole mass . Meanwhile the liquid has changed in composition in a manner shown by the liquidus line l % E , but as solidification proceeds the amount of liquid diminishes , and it vanishes finally at the temperature and composition shown by t " " . on the same horizontal as C. The cooling curve for such , i , mixture is similar to those numbered 2 , 3 , 10 , and 11 in Fig. 11 . The just solid alloy , when in a state of perfect equilibrium , consists of a mass of homogeneous crystals of a solid solution of B in A , all of which are identical in composition . Such a mass shows , on a microscopic section , a number of irregular polygonal areas limited by fine boundary lines , which may be curved or straight . Rig . 54 is an illustration of this type of structure its development is discussed more fully in paragraphs 64 and 67 , and is due to the fact that crystallisation begins from a number of centres , from which it spreads outwards until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its neighbours . The solid solution of B in A , of which the alloy t is composed , is an unsaturated solution , and remains unsaturated over a considerable range of temperature . At the eutectic temperature the composition of the saturated solid solution of B in A is represented by the point H , which corresponds with a larger proportion of B than that present in the mixture t . As the temperature falls , however , the proportion of B sufficient to cause saturation of A diminishes , // and a temperature may be reached at which it is the same as that present in t . Such a condition is represented on the diagram by the point T , the intersection of the vertical through t with the solid solubility curve H P. At T the previously homogeneous solid begins to break up into two conjugate solutions , in the manner explained in paragraph 13 , and the amount of the second solid solution increases usually with fall of temperature . The mixture u solidifies in much the same manner as t . The crystals which separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change according to the line C H as the temperature falls , until at H , which is vertically beneath u , solidification is complete . Meanwhile the liquid changes in composition along the line C P , but , at the moment of complete solidification , there is present only a vanishingly small quantity which has the composition F. In this case the just solid alloy consists entirely of the saturated solution of B in A , represented by H , and its structure is similar to that of t . Any fall in temperature below that of the line H F causes the appearance of a second solid solution , if the slope of the solubility curve is as shown in Fig. 29 . All alloys which have compositions between those represented by C and H consist , when just solid , of a mass of homogeneous crystals . The alloy v deposits , at v ' , crystals which at first have the composition v " , and , on cooling , change gradually to the composition , H , of the saturated solution of B in A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E , but in this case , since the proportion of B present in v is greater than that needed for saturation at H , an appreciable amount of the mixture remains liquid at F , at which temperature it solidifies as the eutectic alloy . The eutectic is formed by the alternate or simultaneous deposition of crystals of the saturated solid solution , H , of B in A , and of the saturated solid solution , K , of A in B. The completely solid alloy consists of primary crystals of the solution H , surrounded by a ground mass of the eutectic E , and its microscopic structure is similar to that of x , Fig. 15 , though the solid constituents are no longer pure A and pure B , but the solid solutions H and K. A typical cooling curve for such a mixture is similar to those numbered 4 , 5 , and 6 in Fig. 11 . The liquid w cools down to E without depositing any crystals whatever . At E the whole mass solidifies at constant temperature , and is formed entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the saturated solid solution of B in A , closely intermingled with those of the saturated solid solution of A in B. The cooling curve for this mixture is similar to No. 7 , Fig. 11 , and the micro-structure of the alloy is like that of y , Fig. 15 . The compositions of the two solid solutions which form the eutectic gradually change , as the temperature falls , in a manner indicated by the solubility curves H P , K R , and the mixture may suffer some alteration of structure . // The alloy x passes through stages similar to those for v , but the primary crystals consist of a solution of A in B , which finally reaches IIt composition K. The just solid metal shows crystals of the saturated solid solution K , in a ground mass of the eutectic . The mixture y , when solid , is formed entirely of crystals of the saturated solution , K , of A in B ; while z consists wholly of crystals of an unsaturated solution of A in B , represented in composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lower temperature , Z , into two constituents . The cooling curves of alloys like x , y , and z are similar in form to those for v. u , and t respectively . The various areas of the equilibrium diagram correspond with different conditions of the metallic mixture , which are indicated in Fig. 30 . Above C E D the alloys are entirely liquid . A point within the area C H P represents completely solid metal , a solid solution of B in A , which , though it may vary continuously in composition between pure A and H , retains the same general charac teristics throughout , and is recognised as a single constituent on // the microscopic sections ; this constituent is designated a . Similarly the solid solution of A in B , represented by points within the area D K R , is called 3 . A point within the area C H E represents a mixture of a-crystals and liquid , while one within D K E represents a mixture of 3-crystals and liquid . Below the line H K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to the left of E , primary a-crystals mixed with eutectic , and to the right of E , primary ( 3-crystals mixed with eutectic . The time during which the temperature remains constant while the eutectic solidifies may be plotted as explained on p. 29 ; the black triangle shown at the top of Fig. 30 is obtained in this manner . In an actual alloy the structure differs somewhat from that of the ideal metal , because the cooling is seldom sufficiently slow to allow perfect equilibrium to be reached in the solid state . As has been seen already , the composition of the primary crystals varies continuously during the time of their formation . Unless this part of the cooling period takes place with extreme slowness , the crystals which first separate retain their composition practically unchanged , more especially as they are surrounded by an envelope of newly deposited solid , and , therefore , have much greater difficulty in attaining equilibrium than if open to the more powerful effect of the liquid metal . Thus the crystal aggregates may not be homogeneous and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the centre to the outside of each . For instance , in an alloy like t ( Fig. 29 ) , cooled comparatively rapidly , a certain number of small crystals of the solid solution t " are formed in the liquid mixture , and these crystals continue to grow in size by the successive deposition on their surfaces of solid solutions , which get continuously richer in B , while the inner parts of the crystal aggregates have no time to alter appreciably from their original composition ; and , since this change in composition of the solid proceeds continuously , there is no sharp boundary between adjacent parts of each mass , but a gradual variation in composition from the centre to the external layer of each . The result of this is that the solid part of the mixture always contains less of the metal B than it would in a condition of perfect equilibrium , and that the liquid part is correspondingly richer in B ; the alloy , therefore , is partly liquid at the temperature t ' , instead of being just completely solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxidised or attacked by reagents than the other , the gradual change in the composition of the crystals may be made evident on the polished specimen . Fig. 36 ( p. 61 ) shows a section of an alloy of copper with 4 per cent . of silver , in which the structure has been developed by etching the specimen with an alkaline solution of copper-ammonium chloride . In this case the parts which contain more copper are attacked with greater rapidity than those which contain more silver . The light boundaries of // the large crystalline grains are rich in silver . On the grains them-selves the attack has commenced at the inside and has spread outwards . The primary crystals consist of a solution of silver in copper , which becomes gradually richer in silver as solidification progresses , and each crystal aggregate becomes richer in silver from the centre to the outside . Each aggregate contains a larger percentage of copper and a smaller percentage of silver than if equi librium had been established . The small bright areas at the granular boundaries consist of silver-copper eutectic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed into the larger masses , leaving nearly pure silver . The period of solidification has been , therefore , prolonged to the eutectic temperature , instead of being completed at a temperature about 100 ? C. higher . In an alloy containing some eutectic when in equilibrium , the proportion of this would be increased by rapid cooling . With a constant rate // of cooling , the primary crystals are more homogeneous as the composition of the alloy approaches that of the eutectic , because of the smaller range of solidification , the greater proportion of liquid to solid , and the smaller size of the crystal units . For alloys of this class the proportion of A to B in the eutectic alloy does not correspond , usually , with the proportion of the struc tural constituents H and K in the same mixture . The calculation of this latter proportion is of interest , since it gives , in many cases , a better idea of the structure of the eutectic . According to Fig. 29 , the solid solution H contains ' 20 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . of A ; the eutectic consists of 40 per cent . of A , and 60 per cent . of B. A simple calculation shows that or 38.5 per cent. , by weight of the eutectic is formed of the solid solution H , while the remaining or 61.5 per cent. , consists of K. It is also of some interest to draw a structural diagram , similar to that of Fig. 18 , for alloys of this kind , though , as in the previous case , some caution must be observed in using it , and there is now a new source of trouble in the commonly imperfect homogeneity // of the solid solutions just described . Investigation has shown 1 hat the volume of a solid solution is equal to the sum of the volumes of its constituents , within the limits of experimental error . I n the diagram , Fig. 31 , the ratio of the densities of the two pure metals is taken as 2 to 1 , as was done for Fig. 18 . Up to 20 per cent . by weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this proportion the eutectic is found in increasing amounts until , at 60 per cent . of B , it forms the whole mass ; it then decreases , and p-crystals appear in greater and greater quantities until , beyond // 20 and 85 per cent . of B the lengths of the intercepts , into which a vertical line of composition is divided by one or other of the curves H E and K E , give the percentages of primary crystals and eutectic , respectively , in the corresponding alloy . Examples of this class are common , and include the silver-copper alloys , the tin - aluminium , the tin - bism.uth , ( 2s , 2 ? , 30 , 37 ) and the Liu-cadmium alloys , the lead - bismuth and lead - cadmium alloys , ( 23 ' 29 , 30 ) the zinc-cadmium ( 34 , 32 , 33 ) and the bismuth-cadmium alloys , ( 30 ' 34 ) and some others . 20 . The Silver-Copper Alloys. ? The equilibrium diagram for the alloys of silver with copper is given in Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // of the liquidus , which have been determined with great care , meet at the eutectic point , which corresponds with 71.9 per cent . of silver , and a temperature of 778 ? C. ( 1,433 ? F. ) . That solid silver and solid copper are mutually soluble has been long known ( 3 ' 9 ; the limits of solubility at the eutectic temperature are at about 6 per cent . of each metal. ( 3 " ) The sloping solidus lines have not been . determined with accuracy , and there are no data for the dotted solubility lines . Alloys containing less than 6 per cent . of copper become homogeneous after long annealing at about 750 ? C. , but if slowly cooled from this temperature they show specks of separated copper , and if cooled at ordinary rates from the liquid condition those with more than about 1 per cent . of copper show some eutectic . Alloys containing from 6 to 28.1 per cent . of copper consist of primary silver-rich crystallites surrounded by eutectic . Fig. 33 is a section from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher magnification is required to show clearly the structure of the eutectic , and the mottling of the silver crystals with the particles of copper rejected from solution . Alloys containing from 6 to 71.9 per cent . of silver consist of primary copper-rich crystal skeletons in a // // ground mass of eutectic , as in Fig. 35 , containing 40 per cent . of silver . The nearly pure eutectic is shown in Fig. 34 . When less than about 6 per cent . of silver is present this metal is retained in solution at the eutectic temperature in the annealed alloys ; the heterogeneous structure of the more quickly cooled alloys is illustrated by Fig. 36 , and has been described already . The chief alloys of this series are those used for coinage . The Standard Silver of this country consists of 92.5 per cent . of silver and 7.5 per cent . of copper , but an inferior alloy , containing only 90 per cent . of silver , is usual in European countries . The appearance of a section of a silver coin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same composition , on account of the very severe mechanical treatment to which the coin has been submitted . The distortion of the metal is revealed by the intricate system of flow lines which appear upon the surface of a carefully prepared specimen ; an example is shown in Fig. 37 . When the coin is heated to incipient melting , cooled , repolished , and etched , a structure differing little from that of the cast metal is found , as in Fig. 38. // 21 . The Aluminium-Tin Alloys. ? The liquidus curve is of a form similar to that for the copper-bismuth alloys , in that the eutectic contains very little of the metal of higher melting point ; but in this case there is a certain range of solid solubility . The diagram , Fig. 39 , shows the eutectic point at 0.48 per cent . of aluminium , and a temperature of 229 ? C. ( 444 ? F. ) . ) 28 ) The presence of the eutectic can be detected both thermally and microscopically in alloys containing 5 per cent . of tin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more tin being dissolved in the solid aluminium , the limiting concentration of this solution approximating to 20 per cent . of tin.l89 The dotted part of the solidus , and the dotted solubility line have not been determined . Fig. 40 is a section from an alloy containing 10 per cent . of tin , not very slowly cooled . The metal has been somewhat deeply etched in order to show that the primary crystals have not attained a uniform composition . The parts richer ni aluminium have been attacked more than those richer in tin , so that the primary crystals show dark cores as in the similar case described on pp. 56 and 57 . Fig. 41 shows the same alloy after annealing at 400 ? C. ( 750 ? F. ) for 20 hours ; the tin-rich network has nearly disappeared , and no // // cores are to be seen . Fig. 42 , containing 33 per cent . of tin , is similar in appearance to Fig. 40 , but the eutectic network occupies a much larger area ; etching has been insufficiently prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 , with 70 per cent . of tin , the primary crystals of the aluminium-rich solution occupy only about one-half of the field . Aluminium-tin alloys , containing not more than 20 per cent . of tin , have been used for making light castings for various purposes . They have a fine white colour , but are attacked by water , and are oxidised in the atmosphere . 22 . Class I. ( b ) ? ( 2 ) The two branches of the liquidus intersect in a point which lies above the freezing point of one of the pure metals. ? Fig. 44 shows the form of equilibrium diagram for this class of alloys , C E D being the liquidus and C H K D the solidus , while H P , K R are the branches of the curve of solid solubility . The lines are shown as curves in Fig. 44 , but are drawn straight in Fig. 45 ; they are more or less curved for actual alloys . In this case the solidus line D K lies to the left of the liquidus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to B raises the freezing point , the temperature of the mixture can fall only if the crystals which separate from the liquid contain a greater proportion of A , and , // therefore , less of B than the liquid itself . The two branches of the liquidus intersect at E , which is no longer an eutectic point . At the temperature of the point E , two solids ? namely , the solutions H uul K ? are in equilibrium with the liquid , just as in paragraph 19 ; but for certain compositions of the mixture the crystals of H first deposited are now transformed , partially or wholly , into crystals of K. and there is an abrupt change in the character of the metal as it Lasses through this temperature ; E , therefore , is called a transition point . The process of solidification of a number of alloys , represented by the points t , u , v , w , x , y , and z , will be now followed . The mixture t commences to solidify at t ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The composition of the deposited solid varies , with fall of temperature , along the solidus , in the manner described on pp. 52 and 53 , and that of the liquid // along the liquidus , until the whole mass of the slowly cooled alloy consists of crystals of composition t " ' , while the quantity of liquid becomes vanishingly small at the composition t " " . Similarly , u begins to solidify at u ' by liberating crystals of a " . The composition of the crystals varies along the solidus to H , where solidification is just completed , and the alloy consists entirely of homogeneous crystals of the saturated solid solution H. The mixture v deposits primary crystals of v " , of which , as the liquid cools , the composition changes gradually to H , while that of the liquid alters from v ' to E. At this latter temperature a considerable quantity of liquid remains , since the proportion of B in the mixture is greater than that which corresponds with H. But now the second solution , K , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid , and begins to crystallise out . The liquid E , however , contains a greater proportion of B than the solid K , so that the separation of a small crystal of K would leave the liquid with an exce=s of B. But since P H and R K are the branches of the curve of solid solubility , H and K represent two conjugate solid solutions ? in other words , an alloy having a total composition lying between H and K consists , when just solid , of a mixture of these solutions . The metal , therefore , solidifies completely at the temperature of the horizontal line H E , the composition of the liquid remaining constant , but its amount gradually diminishing . Any slight excess of B produced temporarily in the liquid by the separation of a K-crystal diffuses into the previously deposited H-crystals , which are richer in A than the K-crystals , and is dissolved by them in quantity sufficient to allow the whole of the fluid portion of the mixture to solidify eventually as K-crystals . The action , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at E , and the crystals of the saturated solution , K , of A in B growing , while the amount of the primary solid , H , diminishes . Finally , the completely solid metal consists of crystals of the solution H , intermingled with crystals of the solution K , some of which have been formed by the transition of previously existing H-crystals , while the remainder were deposited as such from the liquid solution E , the amount of which , in the end , has become infinitesimal . The change of the solid solution H into the solid solution K is strictly analogous to the change which takes place in the composition of the primary crystals during the period of solidification represented by the solidus line C H , although the alteration instead of being gradual as before is now sudden ? sudden , that is , in respect of temperature , though not in point of time , as the process is completed only when the metal is retained at the transition temperature for a long period . A typical cooling curve for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 16 ) , and the structure of the solid metal is similar to that of x , Fig. 25 , but the // constituents are now H and K , instead of being A and B. With further fall of temperature some change in composition of the two solid solutions would occur , in accordance with the slope of the solubility lines H P and K R. The alloy w commences , at w ' , to deposit crystals of composition l " , which , on further cooling , gradually change to composition II . But since the proportions of the two metals in the original mixture , w , are the same as in the solid solution K , the whole of the alloy , when just solid , must consist of K-crystals , and , therefore , the whole of the primary crystallisation , H , is transformed In K. If any mixture like v or zv is cooled too quickly through the transition temperature , the change is not completed , and a section of the metal shows crystallites which have primary cores of Il @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B forms the ground mass . Such a structure is illustrated by Fig. 185 . The sheath of K-crystals enveloping each core of H very effectively protects this against the active attack of the liquid . // From the mixture x separate , at x ' , crystals of x " , which change in composition to H , while the liquid reaches the composition E. At the temperature of the horizontal H E the solid H entirely vanishes and is replaced by K , but the whole mass does not solidify at this point , since the proportion of B in the original liquid is greater than that which corresponds with the point K. The composition of the liquid continues to alter as the temperature falls , but now along the curve E D , while the solid varies according to K D. Solidi fication is completed when the whole mass has the uniform composition and the temperature represented by x " ' , the liquid vanishing at x " " . The alloy y remains perfectly liquid until its temperature has fallen to E. At this point crystals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature decreases , the composition of the solid changes from K to y " ' , where solidification is complete , while the // liquid ceases to exist at y ' . In this alloy there is no transition , anal therefore no period of constant temperature , since no H-crystals are formed . The mixture z solidifies in a manner exactly similar 1 r , , except that the primary solid is represented by z " , and the final product by z " ' , while the liquid varies simultaneously from z ' to z " " . I n all these alloys changes may occur after complete solidilic , Ition , on account of the change in mutual solubility of the component metals at lower temperatures , as indicated by the branches , P H and R K , of the solid solubility curve . Thus in the alloy x , which crystallises as a uniform solid solution , a second constituent will begin to grow at the temperature X ; in this alloy z-crystals grow from x " to H , then change to ( 3-crystals by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the solid i3-solution below X. In Fig. 45 the state of the mixture represented by a point in any of the various areas of the equilibrium diagram is shown ; this diagram should be sufficiently clear after the explanation given of rigs. 17 , 25 , and 30 . The lettered points in Fig. 45 have the same positions as the corresponding ones in Fig. 44 , but the lines have been drawn straight instead of curved . The horizontal halt found on some of the cooling curves occurs at the temperature of the line I I. E ; the black diagram in the upper part of Fig. 45 shows how the I:irne during which the temperature remains stationary varies with the composition of the alloy . Mixtures with compositions outside the limits H and E have no horizontal break in their cooling curves . The copper-iron , ( 214 ) copper-cobalt , t40 ) and cadmium-mercury alloys show the characteristics of this class . 23 . The Cadmium-Mercury Alloys. ? The only simple example of t he foregoing class is the cadmium-mercury series , the equilibrium diagram for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined very accurately by two independent sets of thermal observaI , ions. ( 44,42 ) In order to locate the solidus the changes of volume of the alloys during cooling were observed by means of the dilatometer , while the somewhat scanty data for the solubility lines were obtained from measurements of electromotive force . The transition temperature is at about 188 ? C. ( 370 ? F. ) ; and the limiting concentrations of the two solid solutions at this temperature are shown on the diagram as 62 and 67 per cent . of cadmium , respectively . These points can not be regarded as very accurately determined . Cadmium-amalgam has been used for stopping teeth , the usual mixture containing about 20 per cent . of cadmium . This can be melted in boiling water , and since it remains pasty over an interval of about 50 ? C. , it can be kneaded in the fingers , and pressed into u hollow tooth . It hardens slowly during a day or two , presumably orr. account of the diffusion of the mercury and the formation of // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this process the stopping remains tightly fixed in the cavity . 24 . Class I. ( c ) ? The two metals are completely soluble in each other in all proportions when just liquid , and also when just solid. ? This class may be divided into three , according as the liquidus shows ( 1 ) A minimum . ( 2 ) A maximum . ( 3 ) Neither minimum nor maximum . ( 1 ) The Liquidus shows a Minimum. ? Alloys which come under this heading may be regarded as continuous with those of Class I. ( b ) ( 1 ) , discussed in pp. 51 to 59 . If the points H and K ( Fig. 29 ) be supposed to move closer together until they coincide , the eutectic line vanishes , and the present case is obtained , in which the minimum freezing point of the series lies above the summit of the solubility curve for the solid metals . Fig. 47 shows the corresponding form of the equilibrium diagram . The upper line , C x ' E z ' D , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x " E z " D , is the solidus , while P Q R , // o Bich lies completely below the melting-point curve , is the curve of solubility for the solid metals . The addition of either metal to the other causes the freezing point to fall , but the liquidus is now a continuous curve , and has no sharp angle at the minimum freezing point the solidus also is a continuous curve , which touches the ligIndus at the point of minimum freezing temperature . No eutectic alloy is formed , but each slowly-cooled mixture of the two metals consists , when solid , of crystals of a single homogeneous solution , t lie composition of which is the same as that of the original liquid metal . The properties of the mixtures change gradually throughout the series , from those of one pure metal to those of the other . I or alloys of this type a cooling curve shows only one halt , which exhibits a more or less well-rounded lower corner ? like the curves 2 , : I , 10 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mixture E , for which solidification occurs at constant temperature , the ideal cooling curve showing a horizontal branch with an abrupt ending similar to No. 7 ( Fig. 11 ) . Consider the process of solidification of the liquid mixtures represented by the points x , y , and z . The alloy x commences to solidify at the temperature x ' , where crystals , which have the composition r " , begin to separate from the liquid . While the metal cools the composition of the crystals varies , as shown by the solidus , and the composition of the molten part of the mixture changes according to the form of the liquidus , until at x " ' , vertically below x on the diagram , the mass becomes a solid of homogeneous composition throughout , and the last trace of liquid has the composition The mixture y is the alloy of greatest fusibility , and freezes at constant temperature , E , to a chemically homogeneous solid ; z freezes in a manner similar to x , depositing crystals of z " , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete . The structure of all alloys of this class is similar to that shown in Fig. 54 , though at lower temperatures , like those represented by the points X , Y , and Z on the solubility curve , the homogeneous crystals begin to break up into two solid solutions . ( 2 ) The Liquidus shows a Maximum , . ? Fig. 48 gives the form of equilibrium diagram obtained in this case , in which the addition of either metal to the other causes a rise , instead of a fall in the freezing point . Both the liquidus and the solidus are continuous curves which touch each other at the point of maximum freezing temperature , E. The curve of solubility for the solid metals , P Q R. again lies entirely below the solidus . Solid alloys of this class are exactly similar to those just described under Leading ( 1 ) , but the process of solidification is different , since the crystals which first separate are richer solutions than the final product , instead of being poorer solutions , as in the preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and z. // The alloy x commences to solidify at x ' , at which point crystals of composition x " separate from the liquid . These crystals are richer in B than the liquid , for the temperature of the liquid falls only as its degree of purity increases ; but as solidification proceeds the crystals become gradually poorer in B , until at x " ' their composition coincides with that of the original molten mixture , and the metal is completely solid . The composition of the liquid when it just vanishes is x " " . The mixture y is the alloy of highest freezing point , and solidifies at constant temperature , E , to a homogeneous solid solution . No other alloy of the series freezes at constant temperature . The mixture z begins to freeze at z ' with the separa tion of crystals of composition z " . The composition of the melted metal varies , as shown by the liquidus , and that of the crystals as shown by the solidus , until , finally , a mass of chemically homo geneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The structure of such alloys would be again similar to that shown in Fig. 54 , though breaking up may occur at temperatures below Q. // ( 3 ) The Liquidus shows no Intermediate Minimum or Maximum . A t vpical equilibrium diagram is given in Fig. 49 . The liquidus is Hlightly convex upwards , and the solidus convex downwards , and cacti is a continuous curve . The two curves may nearly coincide nit It each other , as in the case of the iron-nickel alloys ( Fig. 255 ) . The curve of solid solubility is indicated by P Q R. Alloys of this class are remarkable in that no mixture of the series solidifies completely at constant temperature . Any molten mixture , such as x , on commencing to solidify at x ' , liberates crystals of x " , which are always richer than the original liquid in the metal which has the higher freezing point ; for instance , in the case illus trated , x " is richer than x ' in the metal A , which has a freezing point higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of partial solidification the solid is always richer , and the liquid is // always poorer than the original mixture in the metal of higher freezing point . The final solid consists of crystals of a chemically homogeneous solution x " ' , while the last drop of liquid has the composition x " " . The shape of the cooling curve , and the structure of the solid metal , are similar , respectively , to those for cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , just considered . Alloys of metals which are perfectly soluble in each other when solid have no range of composition over which the solidification temperature remains constant , and therefore no triangular diagrams like those given in previous cases can be obtained . When quickly cooled the alloys do not become homogeneous , so that prepared specimens show shadowy cores and skeleton markings . The copper-manganese , nickel-manganese , o ' ) and iron-vanadium alloys ' " " ) are examples of the first sub-division of this class , while // the copper-nickel , iron-nickel , ' ? " " ? 20 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 ) and others belong to the third ; no example of the second sub-division is known at present . 25 . The Copper-Manganese Alloys. ? Fig. 50 is the equilibrium diagram for the alloys of copper with manganese. ( ' ' ' ) 46 ) The liquidus shows a minimum at about 70 per cent . of copper and 870 ? C. ( 1,598 F. ) , at which point it is touched by the solidus . The solidus was determined only approximately by noting , from the cooling curves , the end of the period of crystallisation . Each alloy of the series . when in a condition of equilibrium , is a homogeneous solid solution . but this condition is only secured by annealing . Ordinarily , a section shows primary skeletons of a copper-rich constituent gradually changing to a ground mass of a manganese-rich constituent , or vice versa , without any distinct demarcation ; in Fig. 51 , with 11 per cent . of manganese , there is such a composite structure . In the neighbourhood of the lowest point of the liquidus , the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an alloy in this region is sensibly uniform whatever the rate of cooling ( Fig. 52 ) . The addition of manganese to copper somewhat increases the strength of the latter metal , and gives alloys which conserve a large proportion of their strength at high temperatures . On this account alloys containing 4 to 6 per cent . of manganese have been used for // the stay bolts of locomotive fireboxes , but they require to be out of reach of the flames . Copper-manganese alloys are used also for electrical resistances . One containing 82 per cent . of copper , 15 per cent . of manganese , and about 3 per cent . of nickel and iron has a high resistance , and an almost zero temperature coefficient ; it is known as Manganin. // The copper-manganese alloys must not be confounded with the manganese bronzes of commerce , which are copper-zinc alloys containing small proportions of manganese ( see p. 278 ) . 26 . The Copper-Nickel Alloys. ? The equilibrium diagram for this series is given in Fig. 53.07 , 181 Both liquidus and solidus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two pure metals . The exact temperatures are still a matter of some doubt , but the general shape of the curves is probably correct . In all the alloys the parts which crystallise first are richer in nickel than those which crystallise later , so that if cooling is moderately rapid there is a gradual decrease in the proportion of nickel from the centre of each tlliihidd d ifd on etched or heat-tinted sections . Equilibrium conditions are attained only after a period of annealing ; the composition then becomes uniform , and a section shows a simple polygonal structure like that of Fig. 54 , which is from an annealed alloy containing 30 per cent . of nickel . The copper-nickel alloys , or nickel-bronzes , are used for a variety of purposes . Those containing 2 to 3 per cent . of nickel have been substituted for pure copper in locomotive fireboxes . Alloys containing 12 and 25 per cent . of nickel are employed for coinage , the former in the United States , and the latter in Germany ; but German silver ( copper-nickel-zinc ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper-nickel alloy containing 20 per cent . of nickel is much used for capping rifle bullets . The nickel // bronzes have a high tensile strength combined with considerable ductility . A recent alloy , known as Monel metal , has very remarkable mechanical properties ; it contains about 28 per cent . of copper , 67 per cent . of nickel , and about 5 per cent . of iron and manganese . ' " ) Like manganese , nickel greatly increases the electrical resistance of copper , the maximum resistance being obtained with about 40 per cent . of nickel . This alloy , on account of its low temperature coefficient , has been called Constantan. 27 . Class II. ? The two metals are not completely soluble in all proportions when just liquid , but form two conjugate liquid solutions between certain limits of temperature and composition . In this case the solubility curve for the liquid metals lies partly above the freezing point curve . Class II . may be divided similarly to class I. , according as the two metals when just solid are ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partially soluble in each other . But now there is no subdivision corresponding with ( c ) of Class 1. , in which the two solid metals are completely soluble in all proportions , for if this were the case the liquid metals would be , in all probability , entirely soluble in each other also . Class II . ( a ) ? The two metals are partially soluble in each other when just liquid , but are quite insoluble in each other when just solid. ? As previously pointed out , this complete insolubility of the solid metals probably does not exist , but it is useful to consider as a possible case . The curve of solubility for the liquid metals lies partly above the liquidus , cutting it in two points , both of which lie on the same branch of the liquidus , and on the same horizontal line of temperature . This class presents points of similarity with Class I. b ( 2 ) , ( p. 66 ) , in which one liquid and two solid constituents may exist together at the transition temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one is solid ; the previous transformation of one solid solution to another by interaction with the liquid is replaced by the transformation of one liquid solution to another through the separation of a solid constituent . In Fig. 55 the curve of solubility , p q r , for the liquid metals intersects the branch , C N , of the liquidus in the points M and L ; this branch is no longer a continuous line , but exhibits a horizontal step , M L. NI and L are not eutectic points , but are transition points at which a sudden change takes place in the composition of the liquid part of the alloy , at M when cooling , and at L when heating the mixture ; N , however , does represent the composition and temperature of solidification of an eutectic . The complete liquidus is C M L N D , and the solidus is C F ' N G D. The effect of // fall in temperature on various liquid mixtures t , u , v , w , x , y , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t begins to liberate crystals of pure A at the temperature t ' . The separation of pure A continues with falling temperature , until at the temperature of the point F the liquid has the composition M. The mixture continues to lose heat , and more of the pure metal A separates , but the process causes the liquid portion to have a total composition represented by a point between M. and L ? that is , within the solubility curve and therefore some of the second liquid solution , which has the composition L , is formed at this temperature . Crystallisation of the pure metal A continues , while the composition of each part of the liquid is transformed from M to L , with a corresponding decrease in quantity , the temperature of the mixture remaining constant while the two liquid solutions are present together . When the whole of the liquid portion of the mixture has the composition represented by the point L , the 6 // temperature again commences to fall , the separating solid being still the pure metal A. This proceeds until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached , when solidification is completed at constant temperature by the crystallisation of the eutectic of this composition . Thus all alloys between the compositions C and M consist of crystallites of pure A , surrounded by the eutectic N. The cooling curve for such a mixture is shown at t , Fig. 56 . The first break in the curve corresponds with the point of commencing solidification ; the second , which is horizontal , represents the period of constant temperature during which the liquid changes in composition from M to L ; and the third , again horizontal , shows the halt due to crystallisation of the eutectic . The structure of such alloys calls for no particular comment ; the metals consist of crystals of A , surrounded by more or less eutectic N. The mixture u deposits crystals of pure A at constant temperature F. until the liquid has changed in composition from M to L. The remainder of the process of solidification takes place similarly to // that for t , but a greater proportion of eutectic is present in the final solid . The cooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it shows only two breaks , corresponding with the period of transition , and that of solidification of the eutectic . The liquid v begins to separate at v ' into two conjugate solutions , and , as the temperature falls , the composition of one solution changes gradually from v " to M , while that of the other passes from v ' to L , the whole alloy remaining liquid meanwhile . At the temperature of the horizontal line M L , the layer which has the composition M deposits pure solid A , until the liquid is of uniform coin position , L , throughout . Solidification then proceeds exactly as with the mixtures t and u , but a still greater proportion of eutectic is present in the solid metal . The cooling curve ( Fig. 56 ) for a mixture like i , is similar to that for u , but the transition period is relatively shorter. , and the eutectic halt is longer . The solid metal , unless it has been cooled very slowly , shows two layers separated by a more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal A is lighter than B , then the liquid solution M will float upon L. The solution M commences to solidify by liberating A-crystals , which tend to rise in the liquid , while the fluid portion , which changes to the composition L , sinks to and joins the lower layer of the same composition ; but some of this liquid becomes mechanically entangled with the A-crystals , and can not escape to the lower layer . When all the M-solution is transformed , the remaining liquid , of composition L , begins to liberate more A-crystals at falling temperature ; in the lower layer these crystals again tend to rise , and the heavier liquid gradually sinks to the bottom of the ingot , where it finally solidifies as the eutectic . Thus the solid alloy shows an upper layer , consisting of numerous A-crystals , among which a relatively small . proportion of eutectic is entangled , and this layer is separated by a more or less well-marked boundary from the lower layer , which in its upper part shows numerous A-crystals , though these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proportion of A-crystals gradually decreases towards the bottom of the ingot ; the ground mass of both layers consist of eutectic . For equilibrium conditions it is necessary to stir the mixture during the transition of the liquid ; two layers are not then to he seen in the solid alloy , and the constituents are distributed uniformly . The mixture w does not separate into two conjugate liquid solutions , and the crystallisation of the pure metal A takes place entirely while the temperature falls from F to F ' , at which latter temperature the eutectic solidifies . Neither cooling curve nor structure require special consideration after previous remarks . The alloy x , similarly to w , does not break up in the liquid state , and deposits pure A while the temperature falls from x " to the // freezing point of the eutectic . All mixtures which have a composi tion between C and N consist , when solid , of crystals of pure A in the eutectic N. The alloy y solidifies at constant temperature , and consists entirely of the eutectic mixture ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D are composed , when solid , of crystals of pure B surrounded by the eutectic N. Typical cooling curves for For these alloys there are two periods of constant temperature during cooling . Alloys containing between zero per cent . of B and . the proportion represented by the point L show both of these halts , the first of which occurs at the temperature of the horizontal F L and all the alloys show the second break at the eutectic temperature N. In Fig. 57 is plotted , at the top , the variation of the time of halt at the transition temperature F L , and , below this , the time of halt at the eutectic temperature F ' G. The areas of the equilibrium diagram , Fig. 57 , are labelled to show the condition of the mixture for any // l ? nul osition and temperature . The copper-lead and the lead-zinc alloys 01,33 ) are examples of class II . ( a ) . 28 . The Copper-Lead Alloys. ? Fig. 58 is the equilibrium diagram for this series. ( 18 , 25.35 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundary , the eutectic containing only 0.06 per cent . of copper , . end having a freezing point about 1 ? C. lower than that of lead . t 953 ? C. ( 1,747 ? F. ) , the temperature of the horizontal portion of the liquidus , the two conjugate liquid solutions contain about 15 and 60 per cent . of copper respectively ; the dotted lines through these points indicate the curve of liquid solubility , but this curve has not been determined . The two solid metals are sensibly Insoluble one in the other . // Alloys which contain between 15 and 60 per cent . of copper separate into two liquid layers . Fig. 59 shows the two layers in an alloy with 40 per cent . of copper . The upper layer , at the moment when freezing commences , contains 60 per cent . of copper ; skeleton crystals of copper are formed in this layer at the constant temperature of 953 ? C. The portion of the upper layer which remains liquid at 953 ? C. reaches the same composition as the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being much heavier than the copper crystals , tends to fall ; but a large proportion of it , represented by the dark areas in the upper part of Fig. 59 , is entangled amongst the crystals , and solidifies there . As soon as the temperature falls below 953 ? C. , the lower layer begins to solidify , together with the liquid left in the upper layer , by the separation of more copper crystals . In the lower layer these crystals tend to float , and many of them join the upper layer . The liquid finally reaches the eutectic composition , and solidification is completed at the constant temperature of 327 ? C. ( 621 ? F. ) . In the upper layer the copper which separates below 953 ? C. is deposited on the crystals already existing , so that the dark substance is in the end nearly pure lead . // In alloys containing more than 60 per cent . of copper the part which remains liquid at 953 ? C. is also resolved into two solutions , but on account of the formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid alloys show no very distinct separation into two layers . With moderate rates of cooling the lead is distributed fairly uniformly throughout the alloy so long as its proportion does not exceed about 15 per cent . With a higher percentage the lead begins to collect at the bottom of the ingot , and at 30 per cent . there is an ill-defined layer of appreciable thickness . Chill cast alloys containing as much as 30 per cent . of lead are fairly uniform ( Fig. 60 ) , but those within the two-solution region show great irregularity , even when stirred and very rapidly cooled . Alloys containing more than 85 per cent . of lead , when cooled slowly , show the flotation of the copper skeletons . Although the binary series copper-lead has in itself little practical importance , certain alloys of the ternary series copper-lead-tin are of considerable use as bearing metals ( par . 106 ) . A mixture of equal parts of copper and lead , with the addition of 1 per cent . of nickel , has been used for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanical properties of copper , the effects being similar to , though less pronounced than , // those produced by bismuth . Fig. 61 shows a section of copper containing 2 per cent . of lead ; the lead forms a nearly continuous network around the grains of copper . In brass and bronze for ordinary use a small proportion of lead is permissible , and is generally added in order to facilitate machining operations . 29 . Class II . ( b ) ? The metals are partially soluble in each other , both when just liquid , and when just solid. ? Fig. 62 is a typical equilibrium diagram for this case . C M L N D is the liquidus , and C H H ' K D is the solidus ; the curve of solubility for the liquid metals is p q r , while H ' P and K R are the branches of the curve of solubility for the solid metals . Alloys of compositions between C and H ' solidify as homogeneous solutions of B in A. The mixture t begins to liberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solidification continues , with falling temperature , while the crystals change in composition from t " to H , and the liquid from t ' to M. At the constant temperature of the line M L the liquid deposits other crystals , which have the constant composition H , and this proceeds while the composition of the liquid is transformed to L , in the manner described on p. 81 . When the whole of the liquid has attained the composition L the temperature again begins to fall , and the composition of the separating solid varies from H // to II ' , while that of the liquid changes from L to N. At N the 11 id which remains solidifies at constant temperature as an eutectic , consisting of a mixture of crystals of the solid solutions H ' and K. ' I'hc cooling curve for such an alloy is similar to t , Fig. 56 . The alloy u commences to solidify by the separation of crystals oI constant composition H , at constant temperature , until the composition of the whole of the liquid portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this point the solidification proceeds as for the mixture t , but a greater proportion of the eutectic N is present in the solid metal . The cooling curve for this alloy is similar to u , Fig. 56 . The alloy v breaks up at v ' into two conjugate liquid solutions , and , as the temperature falls , the compositions of these change from v " to M , and from v ' to L , respectively . At the constant tempera ture of the horizontal line 1W L , the liquid M deposits crystals of constant composition H , until the fluid part of the mixture is homo geneous , and of composition L. The temperature then commences // to fall again , and solidification continues as in the previous examples , t and u , but with a further increase in the proportion of eutectic in the final solid . The structure of these alloys is similar to that described at length on p. 83 , the only difference being that the crystals formed are solid solutions , instead of pure metals .

The mixture y consists of the two metals in the proportion of the eutectic alloy , and therefore solidi fies entirely at constant temperature N ; while z , when solid , is composed of crystals of the solution K , surrounded by more or less of the eutectic . Every alloy intermediate in composition between // R and D , when just solid , consists wholly of crystals of a homo-geneous solution of A in B.

The alloys of lead with nickel , ( u ) and of bismuth with zinc , ( 18 ' ' ' s ) belong to this class , but the degree of solid solubility is small . 30 . Class III. ? The two metals are entirely insoluble in each other , both when just liquid , and when just solid. ?

Metallic Compounds ? Classification of Binary Alloys containing Compounds ? The Magnesium-Tin Alloys ? The Aluminium-Magnesium Alloys ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alloys. 33 . Metallic Compounds . When two metals are capable of forming one or several definite chemical combinations , more complex series of alloys than those already studied are obtained . The metallic compounds usually have a limited range of stability , and at certain temperatures are resolved into other bodies , sometimes with partial or with total liquefaction . Great difficulty is experienced in isolating most of these compounds , and the chemical constitution of comparatively few of them has been determined with certainty . It is not known whether the compounds found in solid alloys exist as such in the liquid mixtures ; in many cases , no doubt , they are dissociated on melting , but this would not seem to be invariably so . In the following pages , it is supposed that a liquid mixture is formed of one or of two solutions , without particular regard to the instability or otherwise of the melted compound . The evidence for considering that a structural constituent is a definite combination of the two metals , instead of a solid solution , is not always so conclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compound is often indicated by a sudden change of curvature , and the whole range of composition throughout which the compound separates from the liquid mixture corresponds with a distinctly separate branch of the liquidus . At other times the change of curvature is almost or quite indistinguishable , but in this case the compound usually forms solid solutions with the component metals themselves , or with other compounds of the series , and can not be isolated ; in fact , it is only presumed to exist . When the occurrence of a compound is shown by a distinct branch of the liquidus this branch frequently exhibits a point of maximum temperature , // which is the freezing point of the pure compound . The composition of the mixture which shows this maximum freezing point is difficult to determine with great exactitude ? since the curve is somewhat flat in the region of the maximum ? but it is found to agree closely with a simple atomic proportion of the two metals . Under the microscope the compound is distinguished as a new structural constituent , which differs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attack by reagents , from the component metals . At a certain composition the whole of the section appears to consist of this new constituent , and , if analysed , the alloy is found to contain the metals in proportions corresponding very nearly with those represented by the peak of the liquidus curve ; although , owing to the uncertainty in determining the exact point at which the alloy becomes homogeneous , to the difficulties of chemical analysis , and also in some degree to imperfect information as to the atomic weights of the metals , the result does not usually agree exactly with a simple atomic proportion . Still , if in a series of alloys of two metals a structural constituent is obtained , which ( 1 ) At a certain composition constitutes the whole of the dust solid metal ; ( 2 ) On chemical analysis is found to contain the metals in approximately simple atomic proportions ; ( 3 ) Gives rise to a separate branch of the liquidus curve , showing a temperature maximum at a composition very close to that given by analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour , hardness , density , electric conductivity , etc. , which differ sharply from those of the component metals then the presumption is reasonable that the substance is a definite chemical combination of the two metals . Frequently some of the indications set out above are found without others ; a separate constituent is visible on mixtures of the two metals , between certain limits of composition , and this body exhibits properties which differ considerably from those of any other structural component found throughout the series . Its occurrence may correspond with a separate branch of the liquidus , but this branch shows no maximum point ; moreover , the substance , even if it can be isolated in an apparently pure state , does not show , when analysed , a simple atomic proportion of the two metals . In such a case the compound is supposed to be in solution in one or other of the pure solid metals ? or in another compound if such is formed ? and it can not be obtained in a pure state . The alloys of copper with zinc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such bodies ; every one of these has distinctive characteristics , and , except for the // compound Cu3Sn , they are all solid solutions which vary in composition between certain limits . It is difficult to explain the existence of so many different solutions of the two metals , except on the supposition that some of the molecules are bound in a manner corresponding , in a greater or less degree , with their arrangement in definite chemical compounds . The formation of the compound Cu3Sn gives rise to no separate branch of the liquidus , and this body is not a stable constituent of any of the alloys in which it is found , until temperatures below those at which they become completely solid . In Fig. 116 , the solubility lines czd and ccd show the separation of Cu3Sn ; these two lines meet at the point d , for which the composition corresponds with that of the compound . The solidus for the alloys in this region is the curved line through ci passing above d . It is not unlikely that compounds of other metals may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of metallic mixtures which are considered to show evidence of the formation of compounds it is supposed , for simplicity , that only one such combination of the two metals is formed ; many examples are known in which more than one compound occurs . As in the case of mixtures in which there is no chemical combination , the character of the alloys varies with the degree of solubility of the metals in each other , both when liquid and when solid ; but there is now the further complication that the definite compound may be wholly , partially , or not at all soluble , in either or both of the pure metals , in the liquid or in the solid state . The types of alloys considered are first classified according to the mutual solubility of the compound and the two component metals when the mixture is just liquid ; three main classes of alloys n rc thus obtained , according as the compound is 1 . Completely soluble in all proportions in each of the metals , or the just liquid alloy is a single homogeneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the metals , or the just liquid alloy , between certain limiting compositions , consists of two conjugate solutions . II.I . Completely insoluble in both of the metals , or the just liquid alloy consists , for all compositions , of two solutions . A series of alloys of two metals may belong partly to one of the above classes , and partly to another ? for instance , the compound may be completely soluble in one liquid metal , and only partially soluble in the other ? but typical diagrams for such cases are easily dhaduced from those about to be given , and will not be considered here . 7 // Class I. may be subdivided by considering the mutual solubility of the compound and the solid metals , according as the compound in the just solid mixture is ( a ) Completely insoluble in all proportions in each of the metals . ( b ) Partially soluble in each of the metals . ( c ) Completely soluble in each of the metals . Class II . has only the subdivisions ( a ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ( a ) , for the reason given on p. 37 . Intermediate classes are again possible here , together with other subdivisions corresponding with those considered in the discussion of alloys in which no compounds are formed , but a number of these are omitted . It will be possible for the reader to deduce for himself , after studying the present chapter , the figures representing such cases . For a series in which a compound is formed , another new cause of complication of the equilibrium diagram is found , and it is necessary to distinguish between the cases in which ( 1 ) The compound has a definite melting point , which is practically identical with the freezing point of the mixture of the same composition , and , therefore , liquefaction and solidification are completed at constant temperature . ( 2 ) The compound is a transition product , which is not formed in many alloys of the series until the latter part of the period of crystallisation , or even considerably below the temperature of complete solidification ? in other words , the solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissociated , or transformed into two substances , one of which may be liquid . In this case the melting point and the freezing point of the alloy are different temperatures , and there is a more or less extended range of solidification. 34 . Class I. ( a ) ? The compound and each of the metals are completely soluble , one in another , in all proportions when just liquid , but are completely insoluble when just solid ? ( 1 ) The compound has a definite melting point. ? Fig. 67 shows a typical equilibrium diagram for such a series . As in previous figures , C and D represent the freezing points of the two pure metals A and B. When B is added to A the freezing point of the mixture is lowered , exactly as in former cases , until a minimum freezing temperature or eutectic point , El , is reached . Further addition of B now causes a rise in the freezing point curve up to a maximum , J , after which the curve descends to a second eutectic point , E2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch El J E2 is a continuous curve , and its point of maximum temperature , J , occurs at a composition corresponding with the chemical formula of the compound of A and B , say Ax B ! , // The diagram is understood more easily if it be supposed divided by a vertical line through J , and each half of the figure is then regarded as an equilibrium diagram similar to Fig. 15 . The left-hand portion represents the equilibrium conditions for mixtures of the metal A with the compound Ax By , and the process of solidi fication is similar to that for the case just referred to , the only 41iflerence being that one of the solid constituents of any alloy of I.he series , instead of being a single metal , is a compound of two metals . In the same way , the right-hand part of Fig. 67 represents the equilibrium conditions for the mixtures voti the pu ? re ? metal B with the compound Ax By . J is the freezing  |p6int  of tins ebmpound . E , represents the composition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal A with the . cotnir cxgi and E2 fur the eutectic of the metal B with the same ' compound . The // solidus curve for mixtures of A and Ax By , is C Fi Gi J , and for mixtures of Az By and B is J F2 G2 D. To illustrate the meaning of the diagram the same method as that previously employed will be followed , and the process of cooling of a number of alloys , represented by t , u , v , x , y , and z , will be considered at length . The liquid t commences to liberate crystals of pure A at the temperature t ' , and the crystallisation of A continues , with decreasing temperature , until the fluid part of the mixture reaches the composition of the point El , when solidification is completed , at constant temperature , by the freezing of the eutectic . Any slowly cooled alloy with a composition between C and En consists of crystals of pure A , surrounded by more or less of the eutectic El , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compound Az By . The cooling ; curve for such an alloy is similar to that for x or z ( Fig. 16 ) . The alloy u is the eutectic Ei , and freezes at constant temperature . The alloy v begins to solidify by the formation of crystals of the compound A , B , , at the temperature v ' . This is shown on the diagram by drawing a horizontal through v ' to meet the vertical through J in v " . Further crystallisation of the compound Ax By occurs , with falling temperature , until the liquid reaches the composition En , when it freezes as the eutectic . Solid metals which have a composition between E , and J are composed of crystals of the compound , set in a matrix of the eutectic E , . The cooling curves for such mixtures are similar to that for t , considered above . The mixture w solidifies entirely at constant temperature to a mass of homogeneous crystals of the pure compound Az By . A mixture like x behaves in a manner similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crystals of the compound J , surrounded by more or less of the second eutectic E2 , which consists of alternate crystals of J and of the pure metal B ; y solidifies entirely at constant temperature as the eutectic E2 , and z freezes like t , but consists of primary crystals of B in a ground mass of the eutectic E2 . The structure of all alloys of such a series : ; similar to that for corresponding compositions in cases where compounds are not formed ? that is. all the solid alloys are mixtures , either of the pure metal A or the pure compound J with the eutectic E1 , or of the pure metal B or the pure compound J with the eutectic E , ; The compound is often more strongly crystalline than the metals of which it is composed . In the case of a solid alloy consisting of primary , crystal skeletons surrounded by eutectic , the skeletons , when formed of , a page or nearly pure metal , have usually somewhat rounded oatlinus , . ( ng. 70 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , more often show sharply defined , angular contours ( Figs. 71 ' and 7 : . ' acme'compounds occur in the shape of bars or of thin crystalline paces , both of which forms appear on a microBINARY // sect ion as narrow bars ( Figs. 90 and 145 ) . In a few cases , like dint of antimony , the pure metal is more strongly crystalline tIetn many of its compounds . The cooling curve of each of the alloys of a series of the kind just considered shows one constant temperature halt , either at the temperature Er , or at the temperature E2 . The upper part of Fig. 1 ; 8 shows the time of duration of the halt plotted for the various mixtures , while the lower part of the same diagram gives , for the various temperatures , the state of any mixture of the two metals . It is of interest to consider the composition of the eutectics , not merely , as indicated on the diagram , according to the relative amounts of the pure metals A and B , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ax By , present with either A or B. Thus , in Fig. 67 , Er corresponds with 70 per cent. , and E2 with 15 per cent . of A by weight , while the compound J contains 45 per cent . of A. In the eutectic E , all of the metal B is present in a state of combination , and simple arithmetic shows that this eutectic 1 ( 12 METALLIC ALLOYS. consists of 45.5 per cent . of pure A , mixed with 54.5 per cent . by weight of the compound Ay By . Similarly , in the eutectic E2 , the whole of the metal A which is present is found in the compound , and the eutectic is a mixture of 33.3 per cent . of A ; l , B ? with 66.7 per cent . of B. These figures give a much better idea of the structural composition of the eutectic than a mere statement of the relative proportions of the pure metals . When the density of the compound is known , a diagram may be constructed , similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , which will show the relation between the composition of any alloy of the series and the areas of the various structural constituents shown on a microsection . The precautions to be observed in employing such diagrams have been mentioned already . // 35 . The Magnesium-Tin Alloys.1 ' ' , " ' ) ? Magnesium and tin unite to form the single compound SnMg2 , which contains 70.95 per cent . of tin by weight , and melts at about 783 ? C. ( 1,441 ? F. ) . The two eutectics of the series contain 39 per cent . and 97.5 per cent . of tin . and melt at 565 ? and 209 ? C. , respectively ( 1,049 ? and 408 ? F. ) the composition of the eutectics is better expressed by saying that the first contains 45 per cent . of magnesium and 55 per cent . of SnMg2 , while the second consists of 8.6 per cent . of SnMg22 mixed with 91.4 per cent . of tin by weight . Magnesium , tin , and the compound are almost completely insoluble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable structures of the various alloys from the equilibrium diagram ( Fig. 69 ) , but a few micrographs are given herewith . Fig. 70 is taken from the alloy containing 24 per cent . of tin by weight ; the section shows rounded crystal skeletons of magnesium  --  which appear black because they are the parts attacked by the etching reagent ? and these are surrounded by the first eutectic , B , which has a well-defined , laminated structure . In this eutectic the proportions of the two constituents , magnesium and SnMg2 , are nearly equal , and such a banded structure is to be expected . The metal is shown magnified 100 diameters . In Fig. 71 the mixture contains 55 per cent . of tin , and the magnification is 60 diameters . The primary crystals are those of the compound // SnMg2 ; the difference between the rounded crystallites of magnesium in Fi70and the anular ones of the comound in Fig. 71 , is very marked . The eutectic is the same as that of the previous figure , but its laminated structure has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small particles of SnMg2 by the primary crystal skeletons . Fig. 72 is from an alloy containing 91 per cent . of tin , magnified 45 diameters , and shows crystals of the compound in the second eutectic , D. This eutectic contains a large proportion of tin and a relatively small proportion of SnMg2i and the latter is distributed through the mass of tin as small round or elongated lobuleswhich aear on the section as dots and bars 36 . Class I. ( a ) ? ( 2 ) The compound is a transition product. ? Fig. 73 shows a typical form of equilibrium diagram obtained in this case . The branch , C I , of the liquidus intersects the branch E J at a point I , representing a temperature lower than that of J , the point at which the prolongation of the curve E 1 meets the vertical line of composition of the compound Az B. I is a transition point , and there is only one eutectic point , E , for the series . A molten alloy in which the component metals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , B , does not become , when cooled to the temperature J , a chemically homogeneous , solid mass of the compound Ax By ? though it may be so at lower temperatures but consists here of two constituents , one solid and one liquid . Any mixture which has a composition between C and J , such as w , commences to solidify by the formation of crystals of the pure metal A , as indicated by the horizontal line w ' w " . The process continues down to the temperature of the horizontal line F , I , where the alloy is a mixture of A-crystals with a liquid of composition I. At this temperature a second solid ? namely , the definite compound A , By , represented by J ' ? is in equilibrium with the liquid . The compound now begins to separate also from the liquid , which conse quently becomes richer in the metal B ; part of the A-crystals previously formed are therefore redissolved , so that the composition and temperature of the liquid remain constant at I. The process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described on p. 68 . The metal becomes entirely solid at the temperature of the line F1I , and then consists partly of crystals of the pure metal A , and partly of crystals of the compound Ax By , some of which have been formed at the expense of the original A-crystals . I is thus a transition point . A typical cooling curve for such a mixture is shown at w ( Fig. 74 ) . As the percentage of B in the mixture is increased , the amount of the compoundAa , By in the solidified metal becomes pro-portionately larger , until , when the composition is that of J , the whole of the A-crystals disappear at the transition point , and the alloy becomes a chemically homogeneous mass of the compound . With a mixture of composition intermediate between 3 and I , such as x , the whole of the pure metal A which crystallises between x " and F1 is transformed , at the constant temperature J ' , into the definite compound Aa , By , while more of this compound crystallises from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains , // however , since the alloy x contains more of B than is required to form the compound , and this liquid continues to deposit A , By , I hough now at a falling temperature , while its composition changes . from I to E in the manner indicated by the liquidus . At E , the small quantity of liquid remaining solidifies as the eutectic , and . the now solid alloy consists of crystals of the compound A , , ; By , surrounded by a certain quantity of the eutectic E , which is itself mixture of small crystals of A ? By and of B. The shape of the cooling curve for such a mixture is shown at x ( Fig. 74 ) , but the microstructure calls for no comment . In mixtures of which the compositions are represented by points to the right of I , the liquid no longer liberates the pure metal A ; there is , therefore , no transition period , and none of the definite compound separates at constant temperature . Thus , for the composition y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature falls from y " to F2 , the liquid meanwhile varying in composition from to E. The amount of eutectic which solidifies at E is greater than for the alloy x . A mixture which has the composition represented by the point E solidifies , at constant temperature , as the eutectic alloy of the series ? a mass of intermixed crystals of the pure metal B and the compound A ; z . With compositions to the right of E , like z , the solid metals are composed of crystals of the pure metal B in a matrix of the eutectic . The cooling curves for the alloys y and z are shown in Fig. 74 . For alloys of this type there are two periods during which the temperature remains constant . With mixtures intermediate in composition between C and J , only one of these halts , at the temperature I , is found ; but all other alloys show the eutectic halt . and those which are represented by points lying between J and I show two breaks in their cooling curves . The relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fig. 75 , and the constitution of any mixture of the two metals , at various temperatures , is indicated on the lower part of the same diagram . In this figure , I E , which was curved in Fig. 73 , has been drawn straight ; in actual cases it would show some curvature . The structural composition of the eutectic , for the conditions given in Fig. 73 , is easily calculated as 36 per cent . of Ax B , , , mixed with 64 per cent . of B by weight . The effects of incomplete transformation , at the temperature I , on the structure of the alloys are similar to those already described on p. 69 , and are well illustrated by Figs. 96 and 185 , in which the cores of the crystallites may be considered as consisting of the metal A , and their envelopes as the compound J. The copper-antimony alloys , described in paragraph 39 , afford an example of this class , though the conditions are more complex than those considered above . // 37 . Class I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals are completely soluble one in another when just liquid , but are only partially soluble when just solid . ( 1 ) The compound has a definite melting point. ? The equilibrium diagram is of the form shown in Fig. 76 . C and 1 ) are the freezing points of the pure metals , and J is the freezing point of the compound A , By . while E1 and E2 are the freezing points of the two eutectics ; the liquidus curve is C E1J E2D , and the solidus is C H1K1J H2K2D . Hl represents the composition of the saturated solid solution of J in A at the temperature El , while K1 shows the composition of the saturated solid solution of A in J at this temperature ; similarly , H2 and K2 represent , respectively , the compositions of the saturated solid solution of B in J , and of J in B at the temperature E2 . The branch K1J H2 of the solidus is a continuous curve , and touches the branch E1J E2 of the liquidus at the maximum point J @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , , By . The lines H1 and K1R1 are the branches of the // curve of solubility for solid mixtures of A with A ; By , while H2P , , and . K2R2 are similar curves for solid mixtures of A , ; B , 1 with B. The process of solidification of the various mixtures of the series is similar to that of corresponding mixtures of the type for which Fig. 29 represents the equilibrium conditions ; if Fig. 76 be supposed divided vertically through , 1 , it is converted into two diagrams of the same form as Fig. 29 . There is no need , therefore , to consider the solidification of typical mixtures at great length , but their constitution when just solid is indicated briefly below . Mixtures , such as s , which contain between zero per cent . of B and the proportion represented by Hl , solidify as homogeneous solutions ; the homogeneous metal may begin to break up at a lower temperature , S , into two solid solutions . A mixture , t , which has a composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HI in a matrix of the eutectic lE i ; for u , which lies between // E1 and K1 , the primary crystals are those of the solution K1 . Between K1 and H2 the just solid alloys are single homogeneous solutions , though they may break up at lower temperatures , as at V ; to the left of J the compound A. By holds the metal A in solution , while to the right of J the dissolved metal is B. There may be considerable difference in properties between the solutions K1 and H2 , but the change from one to the other is gradual , and the solution 1 formed between these limiting compositions is to be regarded as a single structural constituent . An alloy like x solidifies as primary crystals of H2 in a ground mass of eutectic E2 , while for one like y the primary solid is formed of crystals of K2 . A mixture z , which has a composition represented by a point lying to the right of K2 , solidifies as a single homogeneous solution . The diagram ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two metals at various temperatures ; the ordinates of the dark triangular areas in the upper part of this figure indicate the // time during which the temperature remains constant while either of the eutectics is solidifying . The structural composition of each eutectic may be calculated for the conditions of Fig. 76 ; thus , El consists of 40 per cent . of Hl , and 60 per cent , of Kl by weight , while E2 is a mixture of 50 per cent . of H2 and 50 per cent , of K2 . 38 . The Aluminium-Magnesium Alloys. ? In this series it is impossible at present to state the chemical composition of the compound , owing to the flatness of the corresponding branch of the liquidus ; the formula may be AlMg , Al3Mg4 , or Al2Mg3 . The summit of the middle branch of the liquidus agrees most nearly with A13Mg4 , t " " 1 though this would seem to be the least likely of the possible compounds . The limits of solubility of the solid constituents have not been determined accurately , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the data indicate that a can contain as much as 8 per cent . of magnesium in solution , and that Q can contain 6 per cent . of aluminium . The two eutectic points are at 65 per cent , of aluminium and 452 ? C. ( 846 ? F. ) , and at 31 ' 5 per cent . of aluminium and 440 ? C. ( 824 ? F. ) respectively . The composition of the 7-solution varies from nearly 65 per cent . to about 41 ' 5 per cent . of aluminium . The first eutectic , there-fore , is almost pure 7 , while the second consists of about 72 per cent . of 7 mixed with 28 per cent . of fl , by weight . // Assuming the diagram to be substantially correct , a slowly cooled alloy containing less than 8 per cent . of magnesium solidifies to a homogeneous solid solution . One containing between 6 and 35 per cent . of magnesium shows primary crystals of the aluminium-rich constituent asudd bthttif lree in Fi79 // the proportion of magnesium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 5 per cent . of magnesium solidify as homogeneous ; Fig. 80 , containing 55 per cent . of magnesium , corresponds nearly with the hypothetical compound A13Mg5 , and is almost uniform . Between 58 ' 5 and 68 ' 5 per cent , of magnesium the alloys consist of primary 7-crystals in a matrix of the 13-7 eutectic , as in Fig. 81 , // containing 60 per cent . From 68 ' 5 to 94 per cent . of magnesium primary p-crystals are surrounded by the same eutectic , as in Fig. 82 , containing 80 per cent . Above 94 per cent . of magnesium the alloys are homogeneous . Alloys of aluminium with varying quantities of magnesium have been employed under the name of Magnalium . Those manufactured at present , however , contain only 1 to 2 per cent . of magnesium as a rule , together with similar small quantities of one or more of the metals , copper , nickel , and tun , according to whether the alloy is to be cast or drawn . ( ' ' ) The alloys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminium , to which they are superior in strength and ease of working . They have been used for parts of scientific instruments in place of brass . 39 . The Copper-Antimony Alloys. ? The alloys of copper with antimony give an example of Class I. ( a ) ( 2 ) , and also of I. ( b ) ( 1 ) . There are two compounds formed in this series . The first , for which there is a corresponding peak on the liquidus , probably has the formula SbCu3 , containing 61 ' 3 per cent . by weight of copper . This compound forms the basis of a solid solution a , of which the limiting concentrations are about 69 and 54 per cent . of copper . The second // nmpound is a strongly crystalline purple substance , having the formula SbCu0 , and containing 51 ' 4 per cent . by weight of copper ; 0 forms no solid solutions , and is unstable above 587 ? C. ( 1,089 ? F. ) . Fig. 83 is the equilibrium diagram , ( s D ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further observations between 100 and Ill per cent . of copper , and more particularly between 70 and 60 per vent . of copper ; between 60 and 0 per cent . it is probably sufficiently accurate . The solidus between 50 and 0 per cent . of copper may lie regarded as correct , but between 50 and 100 per cent . more data are needed . Solid alloys containing more than 51 ' 4 per cent , of copper experience some change in the neighbourhood of 400 ? C. ( 750 ? F. ) , the nature of which has not been sufficiently studied and will not be considered here . There are two minimum points on the liquidus , one at about 69 ' 5 per cent . of copper and 625 ? C. ( 1,157 ? F. ) , and the other at 23 per cent . of copper and 524 ? C. ( 975 ? F. ) . The corresponding eutectics differ very considerably from each other in character . The first apparently consists entirely of the cc-solution , any free copper being in very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SbCu2 in nearly equal parts , and has a // // strongly defined structure . Alloys containing between about 54 and 39 per cent . of copper show a transition point at 587 ? C. ( 1,089 ? F. ) , where the liquid reacts with primary a to form SbCu2 . When a small quantity of antimony is added to copper some is certainly dissolved , but the amount is small , possibly 0 ' 2 per cent. ( 2 ' ' 10 ) Between this percentage and about 29 ' 5 of antimony the primary crystallisation consists of copper-rich skeletons , which are surrounded by the first eutectic . The position of the eutectic point is not known with great accuracy , but it lies between 29 and 30 per cent . of antimony ; the solidus for the a-solution ends either at the eutectic point or very slightly to the antimony side of it . The eutectic line has been traced thermally to about 90 per cent . of copper . ( ' ? ) Fig. 84 shows the alloy containing 30 per cent , of antimony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The metal was chilled just below the eutectic temperature , in order to prevent the subsequent transition of the a-solution ; the somewhat coarse boundaries of the a grains , and the fine markings within them , indicate that this transition has not been entirely suppressed . Between about 31 and 38 ' 7 per cent , of antimony the just solid alloys consist of the homogeneous a-solution , when in equilibrium . Fig. 85 , containing 31 per cent . of antimony , shows only a single // constituent , though the skeleton forms exhibit some slight gradation of tone . In Fig. 86 , taken from an alloy containing 34 per cent . of antimony , annealed at 560 ? C. ( 1,040 ? F. ) for six hours , the polygonal structure characteristic of a uniform solution is seen . The a-solution is very brittle , as may be inferred from the cracks shown at the right and left of this section . Between 38.7 and about 46 per cent . of antimony the just solid alloys still consist of pure a , but even when rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purple compound SbCu2 . Slower cooling allows the compound to develop considerably . Fig. 87 shows a fine purple network of SbCu2 surrounding the primary grains of a in a chill-cast alloy containing 43 per cent . of antimony . Fig. 88 is the same alloy slowly cooled . The proportion of the purple substance has increased enormously by growing from the fine boundaries into the dark a grains ; the grains have begun to break up internally also , as is shown by the fine parallel striations on them . The growth of SbCu2 is only completed after a period of annealing . Beyond about 46 per cent . of antimony the formation of SbCu2 begins at the constant temperature of 587 ? C. ( 1,089 ? F. ) . Some or all of the primary a-crystals react with the liquid part of // t P alloy , which at this temperature contains about 61 per cent . of antimony , and secondary crystals of SbCu2 are the result . Under conditions of equilibrium an alloy containing 48.6 per cent . of antimony becomes uniform SbCu2 . Fig. 89 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly cooled ; the reaction is not quite complete , a few dark inclusions of a being left . A casual inspection of some portions of the specimen might lead to the belief that the light parts are primary crystals , but this is not so . When much more than 48.6 per cent . of antimony is present the transition is not prevented by rapid chilling , and no trace of a is found in the alloys . From this point onwards the series is of a simple type . Both antimony and SbCu2 are sensibly insoluble one in the other , and both are strongly crystalline bodies . They furnish beautiful sections in which the purple compound can be clearly distinguished from the white antimony without the employment of any etching reagent . For photographic purposes light etching is desirable . In Fig. 90 , containing 67 per cent . of antimony , there are two intersecting plates of SbCu2 in a mass of eutectic the black patches are holes in the surface , occasioned by the brittleness of the compound . In // // Fig. 92 , containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary constituent . Fig. 91 is the nearly pure eutectic ; a striking peculiarity is that while some grains of the eutectic show the ordinary laminated structure , there are others in which each small particle has a regular geometric form. ( n ) This is found to be the case whether antimony or SbCuz is in excess , suggesting that the two substances have certain similarities of crystal form . A good example of the geometrical arrangement of structure is given in Fig. 137 less distinct indications are visible in Figs. 90 , 91 , and 92 . This interesting series of alloys has no practical value in itself , but both the ternary series copper-antimony-tin and copper antimony-lead are of importance as bearing metals . The tin or the lead is then the predominating material , and the copper is present in relatively small quantity . These alloys are discussed at greater length in a later chapter . Copper-antimony-lead alloys are employed also as type metals . In the quaternary series copper-antimony tin-lead the lead is present as a substitute for part of the more expensive tin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The compound is a transition product. ? The diagram ( Fig. 93 ) is similar to Fig. 73 , except for the fact that the // crystals which separate from the liquid mixture are no longer pure metals , but solid solutions . The liquidus is C I E D , and the solidus is C H1K1H2K , D. Only one eutectic , E , is obtained . The saturated solid solution of the compound A , B0 , in the metal A has , at the temperature of transformation , the composition H1 , and the corresponding curve of solubility is H1 . K1 , on the other hand . obviously can not represent a saturated solid solution of the metal A in the compoundsince the composition of such a solid solution would be indicated by a point to the left of J ; but it gives the composition of the solid solution of the metal B in the compound A , B , , which can exist , at the transition temperature , in equilibrium with the solid Hl and the liquid I. No solid solutions containing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained , and the corresponding branch of the curve of solubility is not found . // It should be clear from the diagram that , unless one of the solubility curves , H1 or KYR1 , touches or cuts the vertical through I , the compound Ax B , , has no separate existence , and can not be isolated . The point J , which is the summit of the curve B I when prolonged as shown by the dotted line , represents the composition and temperature of a mixture which is partly solid and partly liquid , and this mixture remains partly liquid at temperatures represented by any other points above the line HiI and on the vertical through J. Any point lying on the same vertical line , but below Rif , represents an alloy which , with the exception noted above , is a mixture of two solid solutions , and the compositions of these are found by drawing 41 horizontal through the point to intersect the curves Hip , and K1Ri . The dotted curves 1 J and K1J have no real significance , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; neither can the point J be determined with any degree of certainty , and the composition of the hypothetical compound remains a matter of conjecture . The determination of this composition , though of some interest , has no particular practical importance , since the compound at no time exists separately as such , unless , as stated above , one of the lines HY or KYR1 slopes towards the vertical through J. The points H2 and K25 correspond , respectively , with the compositions of the saturated solid solutions of B in Ak , B , , , and of A , By in B at the temperature B , and H2 , K91t are the branches of the solubility curve for these two solids . Any mixture which has a composition intermediate between C and H ? such as s , is , when just completely solid at s " ' , a chemically homogeneous solution which may , however , break up at a lower temperature , indicated by S , into two constituents . A liquid like t , having a composition between Hi and Ki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid solution t " . As the mixture cools these crystals change in composition from t " to HI , while the continually diminishing liquid attains the composition I. At this temperature a second solid , K1 , begins to appear . But since the whole of the liquid I freezes without further fall of temperature , and without change of composition , and since the liquid is richer in B than is the solid K1 , it follows that there must be a transformation of a portion of the H , - crystals ; and this proceeds , through the medium of the liquid , in the usual manner of such transformations , as described already for similar cases . The entirely solid metal is a mixture of Hi crystals with K1 crystals . The cooling curve and the structure of such an alloy are similar to those of w ( Fig. 74 ) . When the composition of the mixture is that of the point K1 , the Hi crystals formed during the early part of the period of solidification are transformed entirely into K , - crystals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uniform composition . 124 METALLIC ALLOYS . Under unfavourable conditions the transformation may remain incomplete , but a section of the metal then shows a structure of the type of Fig. 185 , which is a clear indication of imperfect equilibrium . With a proportion of B in the mixture greater than that represented by K1 , but less than I ? for instance , v ? the primary H1-crystals are again completely transformed into Ki-crystals , and more K1-crystals are deposited during the period of stationary temperature . But some liquid now remains , since the mixture contains a greater proportion of B than is necessary for the formation of K1 , and the temperature must fall before the mass can solidify entirely . The composition of the crystals , during this fall of temperature changes according to the solidus curve K1H2 , and the mixture becomes completely solid at the temperature and composi tion v " ' , while the last drop of liquid has the composition v " " The cooling curve in this case is like x ( Fig. 74 ) , except that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mass of homogeneous crystals at v " ' . // Alloys which have a composition lying to the right of I no longer deposit any Hi crystals , and , therefore , show no transformation period of constant temperature . A mixture like y , when just solid . consists of H2-crystals in a ground mass of eutectic E , and one like z shows primary crystals of K , , again surrounded by more or less of the eutectic . For compositions represented by points to the right of K ? the just solid alloys are homogeneous solutions . The cooling curves and the structures of such mixtures need no special remarks . The diagrams representing the length of time during which the temperature of each cooling alloy remains constant are similar to those of Fig. 75 , and are given in Fig. 94 . The lower part of this figure shows also the state of any mixture at the various temperatures . The line I E has been drawn straight , instead of curved as in Fig. 93 . A special case of equilibrium diagram is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is the true summit , J , of the curve E I , and , therefore , just coincides with the composition of the compound ; Ki is then also coincident with I and J , and it may be possible to isolate the pure compound . In other cases the points K , and Hz // nearly coincide , as , for example , at certain transformations of the copper-tin , copper-zinc , and copper-aluminium alloys. 41 . ' The Antimony-Tin Alloys. ? In this series four different substances are found , all of which are solid solutions . Of these , one , a , consists chiefly of antimony , and may contain as much as 8 per cent . of tin ; another , a , consists chiefly of tin , and may contain as much as 8 per cent . of antimony . A third substance , p , varies in composition from about 36 to 51 per cent . of tin ; it suffers a transformation into y , without abrupt change of composition , and with only a small evolution of heat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main constituent of ( 3 is doubtless a compound of tin and antimony , but its formula is unknown ; whether v is the result of a polymorphic change of the compound present in p , or whether it is due to the formation of a new compound is an open question . Fig. 95 is the equilibrium diagram. ( " ' 63 , 64 ) The liquidus has been carefully determined by thermal means , and the solidus chiefly by micrographic methods . The addition of antimony to tin causes an immediate rise in the freezing point . ( ' ' ) The liquidus consists of four branches , all rising towards the antimony end of the series , // There is no eutectic point . Along the highest branch primary antimony-rich a-crystals separate from the liquid at temperatures above 430 ? C. ( 806 ? F. ) . Alloys containing less than 8 per cent . of tin , under conditions of equilibrium , solidify as homogeneous a , but reject some , 3 at lower temperatures . Alloys containing more tin are still partly liquid at 430 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing 8 per cent . of tin , mixed with liquid containing about 50 per cent . of tin . A reaction occurs here , resulting in the formation of 3-crystals containing about 36 per cent . of tin ? in other words , 430 ? C. is a transition temperature . Alloys with 8 to 36 per cent . of tin solidify as mixtures of a and 3 ' , but the transition , as in so many similar cases , is only completed with difficulty. ( " . cod When more than 36 per cent . of tin is present , all the primary a-crystals should disappear at the transition point , leaving 33 and liquid , but some a is found even in slowly cooled alloys . Fig. 96 , from a chill-cast alloy containing 45 per cent . of tin , shows bright primary a-crystals , each surrounded by an envelope of imperfectly developed 3 , which is itself surrounded by a network of dark-etching tin-rich material . The same alloy slowly cooled ( Fig. 97 ) shows a // // much greater development of f , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q ? still remain , and there are small dark inclusions of a tin-rich substance . Beyond 50 per cent . of tin the primary crystallisation consists of 9 , but this substance , in the presence of liquid , is transformed to v at 319 ? C. ( 606 ? F. ) the transition gives only small indications on the thermal records , and the two substances are indistinguishable from each other microscopically . In solid " alloys consisting of a mixture of a and p , the ! 3-v transition takes place at 313 ? C. ( 595 ? F. ) ; in pure p the temperature of the change varies from 313 ? to 319 ? C. , according to the composition of the solution . Fig. 98 shows primary p-crystals ( which may have changed to v ) surrounded by a tin-rich matrix , in a slowly cooled alloy containing 55 per cent . of tin ; Fig. 99 is the same alloy annealed at 250 ? C. ( 480 ? F. ) . and consists of approximately uniform v , with a few tin-rich inclusions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about 79 per cent . of tin , but there is no apparent change of curvature here ; beyond this point the primary solid is v. Both p and v are much lighter than the tin-rich liquid from which they separate . and if cooling is sufficiently prolonged they float to the top of the 9 // ingot. ( 22 ' 60 ) Fig. 100 is taken from near the top of a slowly cooled ingot containing 80 per cent . of tin , and shows the flotation of the bright v , which is evidently a strongly crystalline substance ; rapid cooling prevents this separation , as in Fig. 101 . At 243 ? C. ( 469 ? F. ) another transition takes place , but as the composition of the new solid , S , is sensibly the same as that of the liquid at this temperature , the amount of primary v remains practically unchanged . Alloys containing between about 57 and 92 per cent . of tin are mixtures of y and 6 . The boundaries of the v-field , as drawn , would meet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin , but the conditions which prevail below 200 ? C. have not yet been studied , since , even at this temperature , eight weeks are required to establish equi.li brium. ( 63 ) Alloys containing more than 92 per cent , of tin become homogeneous solutions . The composite ingot ( Fig. 146 ) gives a good general idea of the constituents of this series . The most important commercial alloy of tin and antimony is that known as Britannia metal , once largely used for domestic utensils . It consists chiefly of tin , usually containing 5 to 10 per cent . of antimony ; a small proportion of copper , 1 to 3 per cent. , is generally added , and similar small quantities of lead and zinc // are present in the cheaper qualities of the material . The present high price of tin has caused Britannia metal to be greatly superseded by German silver , an alloy of copper , zinc , and nickel . Antimony-tin alloys containing about 20 per cent . of antimony give satisfactory bearing metals for light loads , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the temperature of casting in order that the hard 7-crystals shall neither float ( Fig. 100 ) nor be of an unsuitable size . Better alloys for this purpose contain copper , and sometimes lead , in addition to tin and antimony , as has been mentioned already ( p. 121 ) . 42 . Class I. ( c ) . ? The compound is completely soluble in both pure metals when just liquid , and also when just solid . ( 1 ) The compound has a definite melting point. ? The freezing point of the compound , which is at the same temperature as its melting // point , may be either below or above the freezing points of both pure metals , or it may lie between these temperatures . The corresponding diagrams are given in Fig. 102 ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , and resemble those of the similar cases in which no compounds are formed ( Figs. 47. 48 , and 49 ) ; but the apex of the liquidus is now an intersection of two curves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the solid alloys of the series are composed of homogeneous crystals . The process of solidification is similar to that described on pp. 72 to 76 , and though the two parts of each diagram in the above figures are drawn similar to Fig. 49 , there is no reason why each , or either part should not take the form of Fig. 47 or of Fig. 48 ; but no such case is actually known . In practice it might be difficult to determine whether the liquidus and solidus in Figs. 102 ( a ) and ( b ) were or were not continuous through ; but the intermediate critical point of the curve corresponds here // with a simple atomic proportion between the two metals , while in Figs. 47 and 48 this was not so . 43 . The Magnesium-Cadmium Alloys . ' " ? The diagram for these alloys is shown in Fig. 103 . The two branches of the liquidus meet at a point which corresponds with a temperature of 427 ? C. ( 801 ? F. ) , and a proportion of 82 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the chemical formula CdMg . A transformation occurs in some of the alloys at a lower temperature , and this is indicated by the dotted lines below 250 ? C. The intersection of the transition curves lies vertically below the point of intersection of the two branches of the liquidus , and corresponds with a temperature of 245 ? C. ( 473 ? F. ) Every alloy of the series , when in a condition of equilibrium , is a homogeneous solid at temperatures between the solidus and transition curves . // Class I. ( c ) ( 2 ) The compound is a transition product. ? With this condition the equilibrium diagram is indistinguishable from those obtained when no compound is formed , and the compound itself , if obtained at all as such , is a transformation product due to the breaking up of a previously uniform alloy at lower tempera tures . Such an action occurs in the case of copper-tin alloys con taining from about 58 to 68 per cent . of copper by weight , in which the compound Cu3Sn is formed only at temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid ( see p. 152 ) . Class IL ? The compound is only partially soluble in each of the metals when liquid , and the just liquid alloy consists of two conjugate solutions between certain limits of composition. ? This class is divided into two , according as the just solid compound is Entirely insoluble in each of the just solid metals ; Partially soluble in each of the just solid metals . An intermediate class is possible in which the compound is partially soluble in one metal and insoluble in the other , but this need not be considered here . Class II . ( a ) ? The compound is partially soluble in each of the metals when just liquid , but is completely insoluble in both metals when just solid ? ( l ) The melted compound forms a single liquid. ? In this case the portion of the diagram corresponding with the equilibrium // conditions for mixtures of the compound with each metal resembles Fig. 55 . The whole equilibrium diagram is equivalent to two such figures side by side , to which the discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The melted compound forms two conjugate liquids . ( ' ' ) ? Fig. 104 shows the corresponding typical form of equilibrium diagram . The liquidus is C E1M N E2D , and the solidus is C F1G1F2 , G2D . On melting , the compound A , By is dissociated , partially or wholly , and forms two liquid solutions ; M q N is the corresponding curve of liquid solubility . There are two eutectics , E1 and E2 , in the series , and these are mixtures of crystals of the compound with crystals of A , and of B , respectively . The process of solidification of alloys which have compositions between C and M , and between D and N requires no detailed consideration ; the state of such // mixtures at various temperatures is sufficiently indicated in Fig. 105 . A liquid , x , which has a composition intermediate between those represented by the points M and N , though homogeneous above the temperature q , breaks up at a lower temperature , x ' , into two solutions ; and , on further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponds with M , and with N , respectively . At the temperature of the line M N solidification begins , but the conditions are quite different from those found in the former cases of two liquid solutions ; for the composition of the separating solid no longer lies outside M N as at F ( Fig. 55 ) , or at H ( Fig. 62 ) , but inside these limits at J. Hence there is no change , due to the separa tion of solid , of the liquid Al to the liquid N in the manner described on p. 83 , but the compositions of the two liquids tend to become more and more widely separated . If the layers were kept entirely // apart from each other , Al would liberate crystals of J , with falling temperature , until the composition of the liquid reached El , when this would freeze at constant temperature as the first eutectic ; while N , when solid , would consist of J-crystals in a ground mass of the second eutectic , E2 . The existence of two such different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the solid mixture . To obtain true equilibrium constant stirring is absolutely necessary . Consider first the mixture x , of which the composition lies between M and J. When solidification is just about to commence there are two liquid layers M and N , but the amount of M is greater than that of N , since / " is nearer to Al than to N. Suppose that from each solution a tiny crystal of J separates ; then the average composition of the one liquid will be represented by a point slightly to the left of M , and that of the other by a point slightly to the right of N. But if the two liquids are mixed , by thoroughly stirring them together , the average composition of the fluid part of the mixture is represented by a point slightly to the left of x ' , since the solid , . J , has a composition to the right of x " ' . The liquid mixture , therefore , if allowed to stand without loss or gain of heat , would separate again into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a less proportion of N than before , since the average composition of the liquid is nearer to M. If , while heat is being lost , the mixture is constantly stirred , the whole of the N-liquid disappears as the J-crystals separate , and the temperature is kept stationary by the evolution of latent heat during the solidification of the compound . The final condition of the alloy at this temperature is that of a mixture of crystals of the compound with a homogeneous liquid of composition M. The temperature now falls , while the compound continues to separate until the composition of the liquid reaches Ei , when it solidifies at constant temperature . The completely solid alloy consists of crystals of the compound set in a ground mass of the eutectic En . The cooling curve for such a mixture is similar to u and v ( Fig. 56 ) . For a liquid which has a composition y , intermediate between J and N , the process of solidification is similar to the above , but now it is the M-liquid which disappears , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alloy is a mixture of J-crystals and N-liquid ; at the end of the second period of constant temperature , when the alloy is entirely solid , it consists of J-crystals in a matrix of eutectic E2 . A molten mixture of composition J , if it could be well stirred throughout the period of crystallisation , would solidify wholly as the pure compound , at the constant temperature of the line M N. For alloys of this type there are three periods of constant temperature during cooling , but any mixture of the series can pass // through only two such periods , while others show only one ; the upper part of Fig. 105 represents diagrammatically the relative duration of such periods . The lower part of the same figure indicates the constitution of any mixture in equilibrium at the various temperatures . 46 . Class H. ( b ) . The compound is partially soluble in each of the metals when just liquid . and also when just solid . The melted compound forms a single liquid. ? Remarks similar to those made under heading ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case it is necessary only to refer back to Fig. 62 , and to the discussion thereon . The melted compound forms two liquids. ? The equilibrium diagram ( Fig. 106 ) is similar to Fig. 104. but the constituents of // the solid alloys are now solutions . The solidus is C H , K1J H2K21 ) . It would appear that the solid which is in equilibrium with the two liquids M and N can be only the pure compound A , . By , represented by J ; for if J corresponded with a different composition ? for instance . one to the right of A , B , , ? it would represent a solid solution of B in Ax By , and such a solid would separate from at least some of the liquids represented by points in M Er , which are liquid solutions in which A , not B , is the excess metal , a proceeding which seems unlikely . It will become evident , after the perusal of Chapter VI .. that there can not be two different solids formed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line M N the separating solid is a solution of A in A , or of B in A , B , , , according as the liquid has a composition represented by a point on the line Al Er , // or on N and the variation in composition of these solid solutions with fall of temperature is indicated by j Kl and J H2 . It is not necessary to follow the process of solidification for any particular mixtures . The condition of anv member of the series at various temperatures , and its structure when completely solid , are sufficiently indicated in Fig. 106 , and the shape of the cooling curves may be deduced easily from the diagrams of the duration of the periods of constant temperature , shown in the upper part of this figure . 47 . Class III. ? The compound is completely insoluble in both of the metals when just liquid , and also when just solid . If the compound remains insoluble when liquid , it must have a definite melting point . This case is not of practical importance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is illustrated by Fig. 107 . The two curves of liquid solubility , prgnr and  |p2g2r  , meet at the point r , which lies on the vertical line representing the composition of the compound A , . B , , . In the figure the freezing point of this compound , at the temperature of the horizontal M N , is supposed to be intermediate between the freezing points of the pure metals . which correspond with the temperatures of C J ' and J " D respec tively . The diagram is similar to two like Fig. 64 placed side by side . The just solid alloys , except that which has the composition Ax B , , , are formed of two separate layers , one of the compound J. and the other of A or of B , according to the composition of the mixture . The duration of the periods of constant temperature is shown diagrammatically in the upper part of Fig. 107 , the constant temperatures being those of the freezing points of the three substances . No examples of Classes IL and III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TAKE PLACE IN COMPLETELY SOLID METALS AND ALLOYS . Allotropic and Polymorphic Changes ? The Lead-Tin Alloys ? Recrystallisation of Solid Solutions ? Recrystallisation of certain Iron-Carbon , CopperAluminium , Copper-Nickel , Cobalt-Nickel , and Copper-Tin Alloys. 48 . Allotropic Change of a Pure Metal . It has been mentioned already , in several places , that the condition of an alloy when just solidified is not final and unalterable . The size and arrangement of the crystalline aggregates are always susceptible to change by thermal and mechanical operations ; and in many cases great alterations in the chemical nature of the constituents of an alloy are found to take place between its melting point and the ordinary atmospheric temperature , and at temperatures below atmospheric . Certain changes of structure do not involve a change of chemical constitution , but a change of constitution is usually accompanied by a change of structure , though this is not always visible . Purely structural changes are not considered in this chapter . The changes which take place in solid alloys are , as a rule , much more sluggish than when some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity of the mass . In order to determine the true conditions of equilibrium , the alloy must be annealed at a suitable temperature for a considerable period of time , and chilled rapidly from this temperature , so as to prevent as far as possible any subsequent change during cooling . Especial care must be taken in grinding and polishing a chilled alloy , since any appreciable heating or distortion tends to establish the conditions which should prevail at atmospheric temperature . The constituents of solid alloys are of three kinds ? pure metals . metallic compounds , and solid solutions . Each of these may suffer certain changes . A change in a metal or a compound present in a solid solution necessarily causes a change in the nature of that solution . It is a well-known fact that certain elementary substances , notably carbon , phosphorus , and sulphur , exist in different forms . Each of these allotropic varieties of an element differs widely from any other in chemical and physical properties ? density , crystal form , colour , chemical activity , etc. ? and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressure . Many metals exhibit the same phenomenon of allotropy , the most important examples being iron and tin . There are at least three allotropic forms of iron ? v.-iron , stable below about 785 ? C. , fl-iron , stable // between 785 ? and 915 ? C. , and 7-iron , stable above 915 ? , all these temperatures being measured at atmospheric pressure ; the effect of change of pressure upon the temperature limits is not accurately known . The a form of iron is strongly magnetic , p-iron less so , and 7-iron is almost non-magnetic . The researches of Osmond and others have shown that all three varieties crystallise in the regular system , a-iron as cubes , p-iron as octahedra , and r-iron in more complex forms . In the case of tin there is an amorphous form , known as grey tin , having a specific gravity of 5.8 , stable below 18 ? C. There is also a rhombic form , of specific gravity 6 ' 5 , stable above 161 ? C. , and a tetragonal form , of specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 ? C. In some alloys another form has been found which has a specific gravity of 7.8 , but its range of stability is not known . Among other metals which exhibit allotropy are antimony , arsenic , cobalt , nickel , and silver . Allotropic changes are frequently accompanied by a marked evolution or absorption of heat ? according as the temperature is being lowered or raised and are then to be observed on cooling and heating curves . Sometimes no measurable heat change can be detected , and the transition . must be studied by the change of volume or density of the material . An allotropic change of a metal persists in alloys of this metal so long as the proportion of added material does not exceed a certain limit . The temperature of transition , if the pure metal forms a separate structural constituent of the alloy , is sensibly unaltered by the presence of the new material , as in the rhombic-tetragonal change of tin in the lead-tin alloys below ; but if a solid solution is formed the transition temperature may vary with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alloys of tin afford many examples . 49 . The Lead-Tin Alloys. ? The alloys of lead with tin form a simple series , for which Fig. 108 is the equilibrium diagram . The two branches of the liquidus meet at the eutectic point , which corresponds with a concentration of 37 ' 07 per cent . of lead and a temperature of 183 ? C. ( 361 ? F. ) . The composition of this eutectic has been determined with great care . ( " ) Lead dissolves about 16 per cent . of tin at the eutectic temperature , but tin separates in a nearly pure state from the liquid alloys . The change from rhombic to tetragonal tin has been observed at the constant temperature of 161 ? C. ( 322 ? F. ) , by means of the dilatometer , in the alloys which contain structurally free tin , but not in the lead-rich solution ; it could not be detected by thermal methods . ( " ) Another change , accompanied by thermal effects , takes place at the constant temperature of 149 ? C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . of tin , but is not noticeable on cooling curves of alloys containing more than the eutectic proportion of tin . When less than 18 per cent . of tin is present the transition temperature falls // rapidly , as shown to the left of the diagram . The evolution of heat is accompanied by the rejection of tin from the solid solution . the maximum evolution being at the limiting composition of the solution ? namely , at 18 per cent . of tin. ( 66 ) On either side of this point the heat effect falls off , because in alloys containing less than 18 per cent . of tin the solubility curve shows that at any tempera ture below 149 ? C. less tin has been rejected than in the 18 per cent . alloy , and in those containing more than 18 per cent . of tin only a part of the mass consists of the saturated solid solution , so that less tin is rejected per unit weight of alloy . The abrupt change in the solubilitconditions at 149 ? Cwould aear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for the intensity of the thermal effects observed . Tin-lead alloys are greatly used as solders . Tinman 's solder is about the most easily fusible mixture of the two metals , that is. it approximates in composition to the eutectic . Plumber 's solder contains about 67 per cent . of lead ; it has a range of solidification or pasty stage of nearly 70 ? C. , which allows the plumber to make his well-known wiped joint . Solders having compositions inter144 METALLIC ALLOYS. mediate between these two are used also . Pewter usually contains 85 to 90 per cent . of tin ; a proportion of lead greater than 18 per cent . in pewter vessels is liable to give rise to lead poisoning . The range of freezing temperatures of the lead-rich alloys makes them very suitable for tempering baths for steel tools . 50 . Polymorphic Change of a Compound . Closely allied to the phenomenon of allotropy is the crystalline change experienced by certain compounds , known as polymorphism . Like an allotropic change , a polymorphic transition may be accompanied by thermal evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is no well authenticated case at present ; many of the so-called polymorphic changes involve a chemical as well as a physical alteration of the substance . The limits of temperature within which some metallic compounds can exist are relatively narrow , and lie between the ordinary atmospheric temperature and the freezing point of the alloy having the composition of the compound . On reaching its transition temperature the compound changes into a mixture of pure metals , solutions , or other compounds . For example , the compound Al2Zn3 is stable only between 254 ? C. and 443 ? C. Below 254 ? it is resolved into a solid mixture of a zinc-rich and an aluminium-rich solution ; above 443 ? it becomes a mixture of a zinc-rich liquid with an aluminium-rich solid. ( n ) 51 . Recrystallisation of Solid Solutions. ? In Chapter II . it was seen that the general conditions of solubility are much the same whether the participating substances are wholly liquid or wholly solid . This similarity extends much further . Any of the various types of change which take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the equilibrium diagrams of Chapters III . and IV. , is equally possible when a completely solid alloy suffers recrystallisation . In other words , if a series of mixtures of two metals , when in a condition of equilibrium between certain limits of temperature , exists as a single solid solution over a certain range of composition , the equilibrium conditions of the same series between other and lower limits of temperature are represented by a diagram which may have any one of the forms illustrated in the previous two chapters . Thus there may be secondary crystallisations in completely solid alloys which are the exact analogues of primary skeletons . eutectics , etc . It will be convenient to consider a few of the more important cases in the same order as that adopted in Chapters III . and IV . ( 1 ) The solid solution is resolved into secondary crystal skeletons and eutectoid. ? The upper part of Fig. 109 illustrates the case of a series of alloys like that of Fig. 49 , in which the two components ? not necessarily the pure metals now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At some temperature below that of complete solidification the uniform solid solution rejects , in the // case illustrated , either pure A or pure B , according to the composition of the alloy . The transition temperature is lowered continuously as the separation of the new material proceeds , until a minimum point E ' is reached , which has a significance similar to that of the point E of Fig. 15 . Just as , at the minimum freezing point of a liquid solution , the two separating solids are deposited simultaneously as the eutectic , so in the completely solid system , at the minimum transition temperature , the remaining solid solution changes to a complex mixture of the two new constituents , in this case A and B , to which the name of eutectoid has been applied ! " Studying the process in greater detail , the liquid solution x begins to solidify at the temperature x ' , and becomes completely solid at x " , in the manner described already in connection with Fig. 49 . When the temperature has fallen to x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate from the previously uniform solid solution , the heat evolved being indicated , as in former cases , by a discontinuity in the cooling curve . The separation of A continues as the temperature falls , while the composition of the solid solution a changes gradually from x " ' to E ' . At the temperature x ' " " the remainder of the solid solution , which now has the composition E ' , changes into a complex mixture of A and B ? the eutectoid ? often indistinguishable in appearance from an eutectic . There is a corresponding evolution of heat at this point . The upper part of the cooling curve of such an alloy would be similar to No. 2 , and the lower part to No. 4 , Fig. 11 . The final structure , under corresponding conditions , would differ but little from that of the alloy x of Fig. 15 . The liquid y becomes a uniform solid solution at y " , and experiences no further alteration until the temperature E ' is reached . It then changes to the eutectoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution of heat . The cooling curve would be similar to No. 2 followed by No. 7 , Fig. 11 , and the final structure like that of the alloy y , Fig. 15 . The transition of the alloy z is similar to that of x , except that the first component to separate from the solution is B instead of A. The cooling curve is of a form similar to that for x , and the final structure is comparable with that of z , Fig. 15 . If the time during which the temperature remains constant at the eutectoid point is plotted for the various members of the series , a triangular diagram is obtained , which is shown at the top of Fig. 109 , and is similar to that of Fig. 17 . In Fig. 109 the components into which the solid solution is resolved have been supposed to be the pure metals , but each of the new constituents may be a compound , or a solid solution with a composition which varies continuously with the temperature . Owing to the rigidity of the solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separating component to assume the familiar shapes of primary crystals formed from a liquid solution , a circumstance which often enables secondary crystallisation to be distinguished with ease . On the other hand , slow cooling often permits secondary crystallisations to assume primary forms . 52 . Reerystallisation in the Iron-Carbon Alloys , and in the CopperAluminium Alloys. ? The most familiar eutectoid is that found in steel , the essential conditions for which are represented in Fig. 110 , enlarged from the more complete diagram , Fig. 226 . In this case the products of transformation are a pure metal and a pure compound . The uniform solid solution of carbon in r-iron , when it contains between about 0 ' 6 and 0 ' 95 per cent . of carbon , liberates pure a-iron at temperatures between 810 ? and 700 ? C. ; when the solution contains more than about 0.95 per cent . of carbon it liberates the compound Fe3C at temperatures above 700 ? . The // solution containing about 0.95 per cent . of carbon is resolved at 700 ? C. into the eutectoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 ' 95 per cent . of carbon , at temperatures below 700 ? C. , consist of a-iron crystals and eutectoid ; those with more than 0 ' 95 per cent . of carbon consist of crystals of Fe3C and eutectoid ; a steel of the composition S , 0.95 per cent . of carbon , consists wholly of the eutectoid . In Figs. 229 and 230 the light areas are those of a-iron and the dark areas of the eutectoid ; in Fig. 234 the light network consists of the compound Fe3C , the dark parts being again eutectoid . The magnification of these sections is insufficient to show the laminated structure of the eutectoid , but this is apparent in Figs. 231 and 243 . All of these alloys consist of the homogeneous v-solution at temperatures above the transition . In the trans-formed alloys the separation of the excess component begins at the boundaries of the crystalline grains of the solution , giving rise to the network appearance seen on some of the photographs ; the new component may also grow along the cleavage directions of the grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated a-iron is enabled to assume the form of irregular polyhedra , and structurally free Fe3C occurs as thin tabular crystals , which appear as narrow bars upon a section . The products of a somewhat similar transformation of certain copper-aluminium alloys are both solid solutions . The conditions are shown in Fig. 111 , taken from Fig. 210 . The homogeneous solid solution , 3 may contain from 10 to 16 per cent . of aluminium , hut it is unstable below 566 ? C. The pure eutectoid contains 12'per cent . of aluminium . In alloys containing 10 to 14 per // cent . of aluminium , which solidify as homogeneous p-solutions , the a-solution , of which the maximum concentration is 9 per cent , of aluminium , begins to separate at temperatures between 1,000 ? and 566 ? C. In alloys with 121 to 16 per cent . the solution , of which the minimum concentration is 16 per cent . of aluminium , is the first transition product . At 566 ? any p-solution remaining in the alloy contains 121 per cent . of aluminium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 112 shows the secondary a-crystals growing within the primary R rn a slowly cooled alloy containing 10 per cent . of aluminium , and Fig. 114 the r-crystals when 14.8 per cent . of aluminium is present . In Fig. 113 , containing 122 per cent . of aluminium , both a and r-crystals are to be seen , a being more abundant at the granular boundaries , and v more abundant within the grain . The disintegration of the p-solution is very difficult to suppress entirely , and specimens rapidly chilled from above 566 ? C. have a striated appearance , which indicates incipient transition ( Fig. 162 ) . The chilled 7-solution of the iron-carbon alloys is simi larly striated for the same reason . Other transformations , of the same nature as the above , are found in the copper-tin and the copper-zinc alloys , and are described in Chapter VIII . // // 53 . Recrystallisation of Solid Solutions ? ( 2 ) The solution changes to a second uniform solid. ? If one of the constituents of a uniform solid solution experiences an allotropic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily changed also , while the limits of solubility may or may not be changed . In the case of the iron-carbon alloys considered in the last paragraph the change of non-magnetic v-iron to magnetic a-iron does involve a change of solubility , since carbon , which is soluble to a limited extent in v , is sensibly insoluble in a-iron. ' i On the other hand , the allotropic transformation of the nickel in copper-nickel alloys , so far as has been ascertained at present , causes no alteration in the homogeneity of the solid solution . The magnetic change in nickel occurs at about 360 ? C. , and the temperature of the change is lowered continuously by the addition of copper . The curve of transformation has been traced only so far as 40 per cent . of copper , beyond which it falls below atmospheric temperature ; it is not shown in Fig. 53 . A more completely investigated example is afforded by the alloys of nickel with cobal.t , ( 0 for which the equilibrium diagram is given in Fig. 115 . These solidify as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly straight line joining the freezing points of the two pure metals . The solidus has not been determined accurately , but it lies very close to the liquidus . The magnetic // transformation of cobalt occurs at about 1,150 ? C. , and the transition curve of the alloys is continuous from 1,150 ? to 360 ? C. , the temperature of the magnetic transformation of nickel . Each alloy is homogeneous and non-magnetic above its transition temperature , and consists of a solution of fl-nickel and p-cobalt ; below this temperature it remains homogeneous , but has become magnetic . now consisting of a solution of a-nickel and a-cobalt . There is a range of temperature over which the change progresses , and there are consequently two curves , similar to a liquidus and solidus , upon the equilibrium diagram , the space between the curves being a two-phase field . The curves may be called respectively the curve of incipient transition and the curve of complete transition ; the curve of complete transition for cooling is , of course , the curve of incipient transition for heated alloys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of a compound without sensible alteration of the solubility conditions might indicate either a polymorphic change ( physical ) , or a change in the state of combination ( chemical ) . 54 . Recrystallisation of Solid Solutions ? ( 3 ) The single solution changes to a mixture of two solutions , without formation of an eutectoid. ? Reverting to Fig. 49 , a change takes place in the originally uniform solid when the temperature falls below its saturation point . Thus the alloy x , when the temperature has fallen to X , begins to show signs of a second constituent , the quantity of which increases as the temperature falls , in a manner similar to that described for liquid solutions in paragraph 8 . The process is analogous to the formation of two liquid solutions in alloys of the type of Figs. 55 and 62 , but in the solid alloy there is , of course , no separation into two layers within any reasonable period of time . A block of lead-tin alloy , annealed in a steam boiler for a number of years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , an upper layer of nearly pure tin , and a lower layer of lead-rich solid solution . The most common case is that in which the critical solution temperature ( p. 19 ) lies above the melting point curve , so that only the lower portions of the curve of solid solubility are obtained ( Fig. 8 ) . The composition of both saturated solid solutions changes gradually as the temperature falls , and the relative quantities of the solutions in any alloy generally change also . Such gradual changes have been mentioned in connection with Figs. 29 and 44 , and elsewhere ; they are of frequent occurrence in actual alloys , as , for instance , in the antimony-tin ( Fig. 95 ) , and lead-tin ( Fig. 108 ) alloys . The nature of this type of change differs from that described in paragraph 51 , as no eutectoid is formed . An eutectoid would be obtained in this case if conditions similar to those of Figs. 55 and 62 prevailed in the completely solid alloy . // 55 . Reerystallisation of Solid Solutions ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution. ? It has been seen in Chapter IV . that many metallic compounds are formed directly from a homogeneous liquid solution . In a similar way certain compounds are rejected from a completely solid solution . In some instances there can be little doubt that the rejected compound exists as such when in a state of solution , and its separation is due merely to a gradual change in the limit of saturation of the solution ; such would appear to be the case for the compound Fe3C , already mentioned . In other instances the conditions are nearly like those represented in Figs. 67 and 76 , in which the compound is at least partially dissociated when it enters into solution . The formation of the compound Cu3Sn is an excellent example . Fig. 116 shows the necessary part of the copper-tin diagram , enlarged from Fig. 180 . The compound Cu3Sn contains 61.6 per cent . by weight of copper , but an alloy of this composition does not solidify at constant temperature ; instead there is a range of solidification extending over about 35 ? C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lettered v on the diagram . Only after a further drop of about 25 ? C. is the compound formed , at d , with the evolution of much heat . The compound is a strongly crystalline body , and its presence gives rise to a considerable change in the structure and in the physical properties of the alloys . As the composition of the v-solution recedes in either direction from 61.6 per cent . of copper , the temperature of the transition falls , as // shown by the lines del , and der . These lines correspond with J Er and J E2 of Fig. 67 . The compound is rejected continuously throughout a range of temperature , with gradual change in the composition of the solution towards c2 or cr , some of this solution always being present while the temperature is above 580 ? C. Fig. 117 shows the // beginning of the growth of Cu3Sn , in the form of long narrow bars or plates , within the previously uniform grains of i-solution . Fig. 119 shows the pure compound Cu3Sn obtained by slowly cooling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp angular forms are in striking contrast with the irregular polygonal grains of a homogeneous solution . Conditions similar to those of Figs. 73 and 93 have also their counterparts where solid solutions are concerned . Thus in the copper-tin series ( Fig 116 ) , at the temperature of 580 ? , crystals of Cu. ; Sn , which have already separated from the i-solution , react with the remainder of this solution ? now of the composition c2 , about 32 per cent . of tin ? to form a substance 1 , which at this temperature contains about 33 per cent . of tin . The transition is exactly analogous to that described in paragraph 40 , in which primary crystals Hl react with the liquid I to form the crystals Kr ( Fig. 93 ) . The 6-solution , at lower temperatures , has a range of composition from about 25 to 33 per cent . of tin ; the compound to be regarded as its chief component is probably Cu4Sn . In Fig. 118 , containing 34.5 per cent . of tin , the dark bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above 580 ? C. the constitution of this alloy is roughly one-third of Cu3Sn and two-thirds of i having the composition c2 . Below 580 ? C. the constitution should be roughly one-quarter of Cu3Sn and three-quarters of S with composition k , but the alloy only reaches equilibrium after a period of annealing . The structure of Fig. 118 is // probably developed as follows : ? The bars or plates of Cu3Sn , after they have originated along the cleavage directions of the 7-grains , continue their growth by increasing in thickness . But , on account of the difficulty of diffusion , the solid solution becomes impoverished in Cu3Sn in the immediate neighbourhood of the separated crystals , so that their growth is impeded . The portions of the solution most remote from the separated crystals , however , are still rich in Cu3Sn. and liberate this substance as the temperature falls , again in the form of thin bars or plates , along the same or different cleavage directions . The new crystals are much shorter in length than the original ones . since they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large crystals of Cu3Sn . Moreover , these new crystals attain only a small width , since there is naturally but little more Cu3Sn remaining to be liberated . At 580 ? , on account of the difficulty of diffusion again , the reaction between the solution and the separated Cu3Sn , with formation of I , takes place to only a small extent . The r-regions behave as though almost independent of the presence of Cu3Sn , and as they cool below 580 ? liberate I in accordance with that part of the diagram below c , dz . At 495 ? C. , the temperature at which this specimen was chilled , the conversion of r to I should be complete , in accordance with the lower part of the diagram ( see Fig. 180 ) . There remains in the solid alloy , therefore , somewhat more Cu3Sn than is consistent with true equilibrium . and the I-solution accordingly must be in an unsaturated condition ? that is , it contains less than 33 per cent , of tin . Another transition , of a type similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the same series of alloys . In transformations of the kind represented in Figs. 44 , 73 , and 93 , the second solid has been always supposed to have a composition lying between that of the primary solid and that of the liquid part of the alloy . But , if the composition of the primary solid were to lie between that of the second solid and that of the liquid , the transition . instead of causing a decrease in the liquid part of the mixture , would cause an increase in its amount . The occurrence of such a change is exhibited by Fig. 116 . The particular series of alloys concerned is that lying between d and D , 384 to 58 per cent . of tin , and the temperature of transition is that of the horizontal line drer D , 635 ? C. The primary solid is the solution , of which the ultimate composition is ci , about 59 per cent . of copper . From this solution , as has been seen already , the compound Cu3Sn separates ; and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the only other constituent which can be present under conditions of equilibrium at 635 ? C. is the liquid D , it follows that the solid v-solution is transformed at this temperature into a mixture of Cu3Sn and liquid . Alloys containing between 61.6 and 59 per cent . of copper solidify as homogeneous y-solution , which rejects crystals of Cu3Sn along dc , . Just above // 635 ? the alloys consist of 7-solution , now of composition c1 , containing secondary crystals of Cu3Sn , and they are completely solid . Just below 635 ? all of the solid part of the mixture consists of crystals of Cu3Sn , containing 61.6 per cent . of copper , while the remainder is liquid and has the composition D , 42 per cent . of copper ; the solid r-solution has entirely disappeared . Alloys containing between 59 and 42 per cent . of copper are partly liquid just above 635 ? , and consist of r-crystals of composition c1 , together with liquid D ; at 635 ? the change of Y to Cu3Sn increases the proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a metallic mixture is partly liquefied by a /all of temperature . The solidification of the liquid part of the alloy proceeds afterwards in a normal manner , by the deposition of more Cu3Sn . Fig. 190 is a section of an alloy , containing 40.8 per cent . of tin , corresponding almost exactly with the point cr . Just above 635 ? this was nearly uniform i-solution , but it has been transformed into a mixture of long plates of Cu3Sn and dark liquid . The liquid formed at 635 ? is seen as a dark net-work surrounding the long crystals , and also as rows of small globules within the crystals . By referring again to the copper-tin diagram , Fig. 116 , or to the more complete one , Fig. 180 , it will be seen that alloys containing somewhat less than 33 per cent . of tin solidify as homogeneous 7 , experience some intermediate changes , and then again become homy geneous , no longer as 7 but as 6 . The physical properties of the 7-solution differ from those of the s-solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is some difference in the nature of the immediate components of the solution ? that is , a change in the state of aggregation of the ultimate components , copper and tin . In other words , if the main constituent of the 6-solution is the compound Cu , Sn , that of the r-solution is not the same compound . There are at present no means of determining the exact nature of such solutions . It will be clear from the foregoing paragraphs that the complete equilibrium diagram for any series of alloys may be exceedingly complex . For this reason very few of the diagrams yet published can be regarded as complete . The reader will find it instructive to follow the history of the investigation of any of the more important series of alloys , noticing the gradual way in which the equilibrium diagram has been developed , and the many points which still remain obscure . 157 CHAPTER VI . EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS IN METALLIC MIXTURES . The Phase Rule ? suspended Transformation ; Metastable and Labile Conditions ? The Zinc-Antimony Alloys ? Imperfect Equilibrium ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 56 . The Phase Rule. ? The reader may have noticed that in all the various types of binary alloys which have been considered in previous pages , there are never more than three constituents present in equilibrium together , whether the alloy is completely liquid , completely solid , or partly liquid and partly solid . The number of constituents which can exist in equilibrium with each other is dependent upon the conditions of temperature and pressure , and upon the number and relative proportions of the pure metals which are present in the mixture . The case of an alloy is a particular example of the general problem of physico-chemical equilibrium , a. problem on which much information has been obtained by the aid of a principle known as the Phase Rule . The phase rule is a deduction from an elaborate investigation of the thermodynamic equilibrium of hetereogeneous substances. ( 71 ) The equilibrium of a system is stable when any change of state , which causes no alteration of its entropy , does not diminish its energy . The energy of a system is a function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system as a whole , and of the amounts and intrinsic energies of the various components . By supposing the system enclosed in a rigid , non-conducting envelope , the volume of the system is rendered invariable , and no energy is lost to external systems . The intrinsic energy contributed by each component is constant ; so that , applying the condition of constant entropy , any change in the energy of the system is a function only of the temperature , pressure , and the quantities of the various components , and for equilibrium this change of energy must be positive or zero . The above statements are true so long as only thermodynamic effects are possible , and they require modifying when it is necessary to allow for the effects of gravity , electricity , distortion , surface tension , and crystallising force . The theoretical part of the subject is beyond // the scope of this book . The phase rule itself , and its practical use in the study of the equilibrium conditions of alloys is sufficient for the present purpose ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions in which the rule is strictly applicable , and to emphasise that in any actual system there may be states of equilibrium in apparent contradiction to the phase rule , because the actual conditions differ from the ideal ones . For further information , the reader is referred to the special treatises on the subject. ? h 73 , 73 , 74 ) Dealing now with the rule itself , it is necessary first to define the terms employed . A mass of material , whether solid , liquid , or gaseous , or a mixture of these states , is called a System . A system consists of one or more constituents , each of which is a definite , homogeneous , physically distinct substance ; each such constituent is called a Phase . A phase need not be a chemical element , but may be any other homogeneous substance , such as a definite compound or a solution , and every state of a single substance ? solid , liquid , or gaseous ? constitutes a separate phase . Thus , water is a phase , while ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a separate phase , and water-vapour is the same body in a third phase . A mixture of ice and water , placed in a closed vessel from which the air has been exhausted , constitutes a system of three phases ? ice , water , and the water-vapour or steam which exists in that part of the vessel unoccupied by water or ice . The most important characteristic of the phases of a system in equilibrium is their mutual non-miscibility , or insolubility . The phases which constitute a system are formed of substances , generally less complex , known as Components ; a component is frequently a chemical element , though not necessarily so , but in the case of an alloy the pure metals are to be considered as the components of the system . Any system may be subjected to variations of temperature and pressure , and to changes in the relative proportions of the components present ? generally called a change in concentration of the components . These variable factors are known as the Degrees of Freedom of the system . The Phase Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of a system is equal to the number of components , plus 2 , minus the number of phases present ; or , in symbols , F=C -- 2-P , where F is the number of degrees of freedom , C is the number of components , and P is the number of phases of the system . The great advantage of the rule is that " it defines the state of a system in equilibrium , entirely by the relation existing between the number of components and the number of phases present , quite independently of the amount of each phase , and of the molecular constitution of the participating substances. " // A simple example is the case of the ice-water-steam system already mentioned . Here the number of phases is three , and the number of components is one ; therefore , the number of degrees of freedom is 1 + 2 ? 3 = 0 , or the system is invariant . In other words , ice and water can exist together in presence of water-vapour only at a certain definite temperature and pressure , known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? C. , and 4.579 mm. of mercury . Any variation in temperature or in pressure causes the disappearance of one of the phases ; a rise of temperature or of pressure causes the ice to change to water , a fall of temperature or pressure the reverse . Suppose , now , that the ice phase is absent , and that the water and steam are contained in a closed vessel . There are only two phases present , and , therefore , according to the rule , one degree of freedom is possible , or the system is univariant . The temperature can be varied , within certain limits , while water and vapour still remain in equilibrium . A change in the pressure of the system is a necessary accompaniment of the change in temperature , and the relative amounts of the two phases change also ; but , if the ice phase is absent , water and water-vapour can exist together at a whole series of temperatures . This is the condition which prevails in an ordinary steam boiler , in which , as is well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the limits of safety of the boiler ; but for each value of the pressure there is a corresponding definite temperature , so long as any water remains in the boiler . Thus , for a steam pressure of 50 lbs . per square inch , the corresponding temperature of the steam and water is 138.9 ? C. ( 280.9 ? F. ) , while for a steam pressure of 200 lbs . per square inch the temperature is 194.2 ? C. ( 381.6 ? F. ) . If only steam be present , the number of degrees of freedom , found from the rule as before , is two , or the system is bivariant ; both the temperature and the pressure may be varied at the same time , quite independently of each other . Thus the ordinary saturated steam from a boiler may be heated to any degree in a superheater ? in which no water is present ? with or without an alteration in pressure whereas , if the temperature of the boiler ? which contains water ? were raised , the pressure would be necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase is nearly absent , and the vapour pressure is exceedingly small . Moreover , large changes of pressure in a metallic system are correlative with only slight changes of temperature , in cases where pressure and temperature are dependent variables ; and as most alloys are manufactured at atmospheric pressure , the effects of change of pressure are generally neglected . The pressure may be varied arbitrarily without causing any appreciable change in the system , and this allows of a certain simplification in applying the Phase Rule , since the only degrees // of freedom necessary to consider are temperature , and concentration or composition . The Phase Rule in the case of alloys , therefore , might be written , F=C -- 1-P , in which the pressure is always considered as variable independently , without affecting the system , and may be left out of account if unity is subtracted from the right-hand side of the former equation . The values of the temperature and of the concentration , the remaining degrees of freedom , are taken as co-ordinates in constructing a diagram ? the equilibrium diagram of former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the various conditions of the mixture . In a binary alloy the number of components is two ? the two pure metals . For such a system , therefore , the Phase Rule can be reduced to the expression , F = 3 ? P. The minimum number of phases is one , since the alloy must be composed of at least one substance ; and the corresponding number of degrees of freedom , which is a maximum when the number of phases is a minimum , is found , from the equation , to be two . In other words , both temperature and concentration may be varied independently while the alloy contains only one phase . The binary system exists as a single phase when in the form of ( 1 ) A homogeneous liquid ; ( 2 ) A homogeneous solid . Referring to any of the equilibrium diagrams in the previous pages , say Fig. 29 , a point taken within the area above C E D represents a homogeneous liquid solution ; the point may be moved about anywhere within this area , equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the corresponding alloys is composed of only one liquid phase . Similarly any point in the area to the left of C P , or to the right of D K R. represents a homogeneous solid solution ? one solid phase . Suppose , now , that two phases are present ; the number of degrees of freedom is 3 ? 2 ? that is , 1 . In this case either the temperature , or the concentration may be changed arbitrarily , but an alteration in the one is accompanied necessarily by an alteration in the other ? that is , one is an independent , and the other is a dependent variable . Two phases are present in a binary alloy when this is in the condition of ( 1 ) Two conjugate liquid layers ; ( 2 ) Solid crystals in a liquid solution ; ( 3 ) Two mixed solids . // The first condition is represented by points within the curve of liquid solubility ( Fig. 6 ) . If the temperature is fixed as that of the line T T ' , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na and n . Any change in the position of the horizontal line T T ' is accompanied by a corresponding change in the compositions of the two solutions ; at the temperature of t t ' the compositions of the two solutions are p and r . Similarly , by fixing the concen tration of one phase as that of the vertical line x y , the temperature is determined as that of the horizontal through m . The two compositions m and n are not independent variables , since m is the composition of the only phase which can be iii equilibrium with that of the composition n . Any point outside the curve P Q R represents a single phase , for which both temperature and concentration are independently variable within certain limits . Any point inside P Q R represents two phases ; at each temperature the composition of the two phases is fixed and definite . In other words , a point taken anywhere on a horizontal line , m n , represents a mixture of the same two phases ; the relative amounts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizontal line , but the equilibrium conditions of the system are independent of the relative amounts of the phases . The second case is represented by points within the areas C II E and D K E of Fig. 29 . Here , again , by fixing the temperature of the alloy as that of the horizontal v " v ' , the concentration of the liquid phase is found to be v ' , and that of the solid phase to be v " ; or , by fixing the concentration , say of the liquid phase as v ' , the temperature of the system is determined . The concentrations a ' and v " depend one on the other . Any point within the areas C H E and D K E represents a mixture of two phases , and a hori zontal through this point determines both the temperature of the system and the concentration of the phases , the position of the point along the horizontal serving to fix the relative amounts of the two phases , and not affecting the equilibrium concentrations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area P H E K R ( Fig. 29 ) represents two solid phases . This case is similar to the first , P H and R K being the curves of solid solubility , instead of liquid solubility . Suppose , next , that three phases are present in the mixture ; the number of degrees of freedom is 3 ? 3 ? that is , zero . In other words , three phases can exist together in equilibrium in a binary alloy only at a fixed temperature and with definite concentrations of all the phases . Such a condition is represented by the line H E K ( Fig. 29 ) ; the three phases which exist together at this temperature are the solid solutions H and K , and the liquid E. Neither the ttf thmixturer the sitin f the // can change until one of the three phases has disappeared . The temperature can not fall until all the liquid E has solidified ; a rise of temperature follows only on the disappearance of one or other of the solid solutions . Any change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes no corresponding change in the concentration of the phases , but only in their relative amounts . It should be noticed that an eutectic alloy , though considered structurally as a single constituent , is not a single phase , but a heterogeneous mixture of two phases namely , for the case of Fig. 29 , the solid solutions H and K. In a solid alloy which has a composition intermediate between H and K , primary crystals either of H or of K are found , in a ground mass of eutectic ; hence there are only two phases in the completely solid system ? namely , H and K ? both existing in the eutectic , and one of them separately from the eutectic . The eutectic , when melted , becomes a single liquid solution ? that is , one phase ; the formation of an eutectic of two substances necessitates their mutual solubility when just molten . In Figs. 55 and 62 , a point lying anywhere on the line M L represents a mixture of three phases , two of which are liquids and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature remains constant until one of the three phases disappears , and the concentrations of all the phases are unchanged while the total composition of the mixture remains between M and L. In alloys which suffer transformation after becoming completely solid , three solid phases are present together at the transition temperature . In Fig. 109 , a point on the line F ' G ' represents a mixture of three solid phases , a , A , and B. Since a mixture can not have less than zero degrees of freedom , it follows that no binary alloy can consist of more than three phases at one time , though a large number of different phases may be formed , in succession , throughout the whole range of existence of the system , each phase being stable only within certain limits of temperature and composition . In general , a binary alloy must exist as a single phase if it is to be perfectly stable under variations of temperature . If it consists of two phases , the compositions of these will tend to change with alteration of temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures . The foregoing remarks presuppose that a state of perfect equilibrium is always attained . Owing to the slowness with which such a state is reached in solids , it is possible to have binary alloys consisting of two phases , and yet remaining practically stable under ordinary variations of temperature ; in fact , this represents the condition of most commercially useful alloys of two metals . It is possible , in some cases , to obtain three phases in the solid metal , though with a corresponding increase in the instability of the system . The reader should study again the equilibrium diagrams of Chapters // 11 E. , IV. , and V. , in the light of the new information afforded by the Phase Rule , and should check the number of constituents present under all conditions of temperature and concentration . In the case of ternary alloys ? that is , mixtures of three metals ? the application of the rule shows that the maximum number of degrees of freedom , found when only one phase is present , is three , if the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three phases are now required in order to specify the composition of the mixture ; these two concentrations are two of the degrees of freedom , the third , of course , being the temperature . The maximum number of phases which may be present together in equilibrium in the system is four . For more complex alloys , the maximum number of degrees of freedom is the same as the number of components , while the maximum number of phases which can exist in equilibrium together is one more than the number of components . A brief discussion of alloys of three metals is given in Chapter VIII . It has been stated that the effect of pressure upon alloys is negligible , but there is some effect . Measurements of freezing and transition temperatures of certain alloys under high pressures have shown distinct differences from the corresponding temperatures obtained under atmospheric pressure ; in other words , the limits of existence of a phase of an alloy are dependent to some extent upon the pressure. ( " . ' 0 Transformations which are accompanied by considerable change of volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great pressure at ordinary atmospheric temperature to a mixture of metals in a fine state of division results in the production of a coherent mass , but the metals remain sensibly in their original state , and a true alloy is only produced by annealing the mass at a suitable temperature , so that through the agency of diffusion the normal constituents may be formed . ( ' " ' ' " . Another point , purposely omitted till now , is the consideration of the vapour phase for metallic systems . In general , this is quite unimportant ; but , if pressure is included in the number of degrees of freedom , the vapour can be neglected no longer , since it is upon this phase that the effect of pressure is greatest . Alloys containing a large proportion of a volatile element like arsenic or phosphorus can be prepared only in a closed vessel , and the vapour pressure is one of the essential degrees of freedom concerned in the equilibrium of the system . Some natural alloys are found , which almost certainly have been formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid state , and the same may be said of some furnace products . An alloy of iron and nickel can be prepared by direct deposition from a mixture of iron-carbonyl and nickel-carbonyl . Lastly , it must be remembered that there are certain internal molecular forces , which tend to modify the conditions of equili164 METALLIC ALLOYS. brium , and that the Phase Rule is accurate only when the effects of such forces are negligible . The effects of gravity , electromotive force , distortion , and surface tension have been worked out theoretically , ( ' ' ) but the influence of these factors in any particular case remains almost unknown , or only known in a rough qualitative manner . Thus , gravity tends to cause the separation of phases of different density , and thus to alter the distribution of energy of the system . Any such separation is also a mechanical hindrance to the attainment of true equilibrium ; it effects a considerable alteration in the structure of an alloy ( see Figs. 23 , 59 , 66 , and 100 ) , and is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equilibrium . Surface tension also implies a non-uniform distribution of energy throughout a homogeneous phase , but the most important effects again are probably those noticeable on the structure . The distortion caused by the application of load to an alloy is not infrequently accompanied by change of phase ; in the majority of cases , however , it is a change from an unstable to a stable condition , due to the increased molecular freedom during the distortion of the mass , the effect being comparable with that produced by stirring a crystallising liquid . 57 . Suspended Transformation ; Metastable and Labile Equilibrium . ? Some remarks have been made elsewhere , in suitable places , on cases of unstable equilibrium found in alloys , and on the conditions which are favourable or unfavourable to the existence of such a state . It is necessary to consider now , somewhat more fully , the circumstances which prevail during periods of transition of liquid and solid phases . Consider first the phenomenon of solidification . That this may be delayed- has been shown already in Chapter II . under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less simple than were indicated there . It has been found that , if a liquid is cooled without the introduction of nuclei at the freezing point , surfusion always occurs to some extent ? that is , no solid separates until the temperature has fallen somewhat below the true temperature of freezing . the magnitude of the interval varying with the substance . Only by introducing nuclei of the phase about to solidify is the true freezing temperature obtained . If the liquid is kept well agitated the freezing point is quite a definite temperature , though lower than when nuclei are present ; but if movement is prevented the cooling may be carried far below this second freezing point , as in the case illustrated in Fig. 14 . There is , therefore , an interval of temperature between the melting point of a pure substance and its freezing point as ordinarily determined , within which interval solidification occurs only in the presence of nuclei of the solid phase ; if the substance is liquid in this interval it is said to be in a metastable condition . Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid is thoroughly stirred , but may be much delayed when the liquid is not kept in motion , and when the temperature is lowered rapidly ; if the substance remains liquid below the metastable limit , it is said to be in a labile condition . " ) In Fig. 120 ( a ) are shown diagrammatic cooling curves for a pure metal . The uppermost curve , 0 C P Q , represents the ideal conditions of freezing obtained when the liquid is stirred continually and is sown with nuclei of the solid phase . The middle curve , 0 C ' P ' Q , indicates the form of cooling curve obtained when the liquid is stirred , but no nuclei are added ; there is surfusion , followed by rise of temperature to somewhat below the true freezing point . The lowest curve , 0 C " P " Q , obtained when the metal is allowed to cool without disturbance , is of a form similar to the previous one , but the temperatures are lower throughout . Liquid existing between ( ' and C ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similar phenomena are observed in mixtures . For instance , in the simple case of two substances which form an eutectic , as in Fig. 15 , the lower boundary of the metastable region is a curve lying below the liquidus , and roughly parallel to it . The liquidus curve obtained when the liquid is sown with nuclei is C E D , Fig. 121 ; t hat obtained without nuclei , but with constant stirring is C ' E ' D ' ; // while if stirring is omitted no definite curve is obtained at all , as the degree of surfusion is considerably affected by small variations in the conditions of cooling . The width of the metastable interval has not been determined for any metals and alloys ; for the liquidsolid change it is probably narrow . But one point of some importance must be noted , namely , that E ' may differ from E not only in temperature but in composition ? in other words , the composition of the metastable eutectic is not necessarily the same as that of the true eutectic . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that described formerly , unless careful precaution is taken to secure equilibrium throughout the whole period . In a liquid of composition X ( Fig. 121 ) , stirred but not sown with nuclei , solidification begins abruptly at x ' , and a crop of crystals is - formed . The temperature rises somewhat , but not so high as x , the true freezing point for , since some solid has separated , the composition of the liquid can not be x , but must be represented by some point like x " , which is nearer to the eutectic composition , and corresponds . therefore , with a lower temperature of equilibrium between solid and liquid . During the next stage solidification takes place according to the stable curve x " E , since nuclei of the crystallising phase A are now present . But when the point E is reached there are no nuclei of B , and A continues to separate until et , the intersection of C E with D ' E ' , is reached , when B crystal lises spontaneously ; c , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alloys in which B is the excess metal the corresponding eutectic point is e2 , the intersection of D E with C ' E ' . But an alloy of composition el , cooled without stirring , would show primary crystals of B , and one of the composition e2 would show primary crystals of A. In the alloy corresponding with E ' , the intersection of the two metastable freezing point curves , both metals would crystallise spontaneously together if the mixture were stirred , giving a third apparent eutectic point . If even the precaution of stirring is omitted , surfusion of the alloy X may be prolonged to a temperature x " ' considerably below x ' . The rise of temperature will now be more marked , but x " " , the actual maximum temperature attained , will be lower than x " . The cooling curves corresponding with these conditions are shown in Fig. 120 ( b ) . The determination of the true melting point in the reverse change of solid to liquid is not quite simple either , though superheating takes place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region above the curve of true equilibrium is very narrow , probably beyond detection in most cases . Conditions of metastable and labile equilibrium similar to the above doubtless prevail during the period of transition of a completely solid metal or alloy , but the metastable interval may be expected to be wider . Transition points , even when obtained with great care , are often at sensibly higher temperatures during heating than during cooling . In such cases effective inoculation is impossible , but close contact with the stable phase would no doubt accelerate the transformation of the unstable material . Though not effective substitutes for stirring , vibration , and distortion , especially the latter , have an appreciable influence on a transition . In general , on account of the ease with which a completely solid substance is undercooled , the temperature of transition registered must be regarded as lying somewhat outside the metastable region . The upper metastable interval may possibly have some sensible width in cases of solid transition . The two intervals taken together form a field within which either phase may be found according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transformation of a series of solid solutions it is necessary that the stable and metastable curves should not be confused with the curves of incipient and of complete transition ; for , on cooling an alloy of the series , transition does not begin until the metastable limit of incipient transition is reached , but since the stable phase is now present the transition should become complete at the true temperature of complete transition , unless the metastable interval is so wide that it extends to a lower temperature than the true temperature of complete transition . On heating the alloy the temperature at which the change commences will be that of a metastable boundary above the curve of complete transition ( for // cooling ) , and the change will be completed at the true curve of incipient transition ( for cooling ) . Thus the registered curve of incipient transition ( obtained from cooling experiments ) will be lower , and that of complete transition ( obtained from heating experiments ) will be higher than the corresponding true curves . These remarks suppose that cooling and heating are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the metastable into the labile region . A good idea of the possible interval between the transition temperature obtained by cooling and that obtained by heating may be gathered from an inspection of the curves of the iron-nickel alloys ( Fig. 255 ) . Most alterations in the nature of the structural constituents of solid alloys take place with difficulty , unless the mixture is cooled with extreme slowness , and they may be prevented , almost entirely , by rapid cooling through the transition temperature . Nearly all commercial alloys exist in a state of unstable equilibrium , due to such suspended transformation . The velocity with which an unstable phase is transformed , and converted into the stable phase or phases , varies with the material ; it is often susceptible of acceleration in a number of ways , most of which have no special interest in the case of alloys , but the effect of temperature is important . The velocity of transformation is greater the higher the temperature , and is also the greater the further that the temperature of the system is removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the transition point both of these operators act in the same direction , and the velocity of transformation increases indefinitely as the temperature is raised . Below the transition point the two operators act in opposite directions , since the velocity of transformation is decreased by lowering the temperature , but is increased by withdrawing further from the transition point ; hence there is a temperature , or a small range of temperature , at which the transformation proceeds with a maximum velocity . Below this temperature the velocity of transformation decreases with comparative rapidity , and may become zero . It is easy , therefore , to maintain unstable conditions below a transition point , but comparatively difficult to do so above the point ; hence a closer approximation to the true value of a critical temperature is more likely to be found from observations taken during the heating , than during the cooling of a substance . It follows from the remarks of the previous paragraph that both the observed temperatures differ from the true temperature of transition , and the taking of both measurements is , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded by the two methods for a transition of a partially liquid mixture is usually small . A transformation , especially of solid phases , is seldom completed // in a slowly cooled mixture . By slow cooling during solidification large crystals of the primary solid are obtained , and the transformation of these large crystals into the phase which is stable at a lower temperature takes place with extreme slowness , on account of the mechanical hindrance to diffusion . The process of transformation would be accelerated greatly if the crystals of the original phase were small . Hence , in cases where a transformation is known or suspected to take place in the alloy , at a temperature lower than that of complete solidification , the best way to promote the formation of the stable solid phase is to chill the alloy at or near its freezing point in order to ensure small crystals and then to anneal the solid ingot at the temperature of maximum velocity of transformation ? probably some few degrees below the transition point ? and chill it rapidly from this temperature . ( ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid cooling is likely to grow at ordinary temperatures in the solid alloy , especially when this is subject to knocks and vibrations ; if some of the stable phase has been formed during cooling its further growth is still more certain . It follows that the properties of the alloy will change with age . This is of great importance when the mechanical properties deteriorate owing to the slow formation of a brittle phase , a characteristic of certain steels , brasses , and aluminium-zinc alloys . The causes of brittleness in mild steel are still obscure ; in some brasses the brittle v-solution is probably formed 1 ' ; in the aluminium-zinc alloys the compound Al2Zn3 , which is harder and more brittle than aluminium , is the cause of the trouble . ' ( ' ' The brittleness of coldworked alloys is sometimes due to the formation of a new phase , and sometimes to the growth of the distorted crystals of the original phase . In addition to the effect of the rate of cooling upon the speed of transition , the amount of the transforming phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been initiated , the velocity of change at any particular temperature depends directly upon the proportional quantity of the unstable phase remaining at that moment ; in other words , the rate of transition decreases as the transition proceeds , becoming very slow when the change is nearly complete . It follows that the smaller the proportion of the material about to change , the greater is the probability of suspension . In different alloys of the same series , when the rate of cooling is not very slow , the temperature of an eutectic point or of a transition point is observed to be lower as the proportion of the material involved in the change is less ; this effect can be noticed on a few of the equilibrium diagrams given herein . Some consideration must be given also to the quality of a transformation . The smaller the heat evolution the more likely is the transition to be retarded or suppressed , and vice versa . Some of // the most energetic transformations , for instance , that of v- to a-iron , can not be more than partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zinc-Antimony Alloys. ? An interesting example of the difficulties of determining the true conditions of equilibrium for a series of alloys is offered by the zinc-antimony series . The liquidus ( Fig. 122 ) consists of five branches , and exhibits one maximum and two eutectic points.I81 ' s " I The corresponding solid phases are zinc , antimony , and the compound ZnSb , all of which separate in a sensibly pure condition , and two solutions , a and ( 3 , of variable composition . The first eutectic point is at about 97.5 per cent . of zinc and 411 ? C. ( 772 ? F. ) . Between 0 and about 2.5 per cent . of antimony the alloys consist of primary crystals of zinc together with an eutectic mixture of zinc and the solid solution R. From about 2.5 to 5 per cent . of antimony primary a-crystals separate from the liquid , but between 5 and 55 per cent . the primary crystals consist of the a-solution . The transition from a to ( 3 , in presence of liquid , takes place at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) without any appreciable change in the composition of the solid phase . This transition is not observed during cooling unless nuclei of are added to the liquid ; the altered form of the liquidus whet ' fi is suppressed is shown by the sloping dotted line from the eutectic // point to about 20 per cent . of antimony ; the eutectic , in these circumstances , is presumably a mixture of zinc and a , instead of zinc and 9 . A transformation occurs also in the completely solid alloys containing from 0 to about 55 per cent . of antimony , the , 3-solution changing to a new substance , v , again with no appreciable change of composition . The temperature of this change , as determined from heating curves , is constant at 405 ? C. ( 761 ? F. ) ; it is much depressed when the melted alloys are cooled , even very slowly , as shown on the lower left-hand portion of the diagram by the row of hollow circles at temperatures ranging from 330 ? to 360 ? C. The maximum point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,049 ? F. ) and 55 per cent . of antimony , and it indicates the compound Zn3Sb2 , which contains 55.1 per cent . of antimony . The second compound of the series is ZnSb , which contains 64.8 per cent . of antimony ; it is soluble to some extent in Zn3Sbz , the limiting composition of the resulting solution , a , being about 59 per cent . of antimony . The compound ZnSb is found sensibly pure in the solid alloys . The transition from a to ZnSb takes place at 546 ? C. ( 1,015 ? F. ) in heated alloys ; but since the intersection at this temperature of the two branches of the liquidus is very nearly at 64.8 per cent . of antimony , the transition does not cause any appreciable change in the quantity of primary solid . In slowly cooled alloys inoculated with ZnSb the evolution of heat , which marks this transition , was found to occur at 538 ? C. ( 1,000 ? F. ) ; when nuclei of ZnSb are not added the transition is suspended until 450 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalescence . The pure a-solution changes first to p and then to i , these changes being indicated , in the reverse order , by small breaks in the heating curves ; no corresponding breaks have been detected on cooling curves . The three solutions , a , ( 3 , and 7 , can not be distinguished from each other microscopically . The sloping boundaries dividing the /3-field from those for a and for i are not complete , but should be double ( see p. 151 ) . The second eutectic point is at about 80 per cent . of antimony and 505 ? C. ( 941 ? F. ) . Alloys containing from 64.8 to 80 per cent . of antimony , when in equilibrium , consist of primary crystals of ZnSb , surrounded by an eutectic mixture of ZnSb and antimony ; in those containing from 80 to 100 per cent . of antimony the primary skeletons are of nearly pure antimony . But the formation of ZnSb is ensured only when germs of this phase are present in the crystallising liquid ; slow cooling accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stable phase are not added , the liquidus takes the form of the dotted curve , where the branches corresponding with the separation of a and antimony , respectively , are prolonged and meet at a new eutectic point , which lies at about 75 per cent . of antimony and 482 ? C. ( 900 ? F. ) . In these circumstances , alloys containing from 55.1 // to 75 per cent . of antimony , when just solid , consist of primary crystals of nearly pure Zn3Sb2 , surrounded by an eutectic mixture of this compound and antimony ; in alloys containing more than 75 per cent . of antimony this metal is the primary solid . The absence of nuclei of the stable phase , therefore , allows of conditions which differ very considerably from those of true equilibrium ; these differences are clearly evident upon sections of the alloys . Fig. 123 is taken from an alloy containing 78 ' 5 per cent . of antimony , slowly cooled without nuclei of ZnSb ; the white primary crystals are of antimony , and the eutectic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 124 shows the change caused in the structure of the same alloy when germs of ZnSb are added to the crystallising liquid : the dark primary crystals are now of ZnSb , and the eutectic is a mixture of this compound with antimony . The white sheath of antimony around each primary crystal in the latter figure is the result of the local absorption of the small eutectic particles of ZnSb by the primary crystals ( see p. 41 ) . The unstable alloys , like Fig. 123 , when slowly cooled after solidification , exhibit a recalescence , or evolution of heat with rise of temperature , which is the indication that equilibrium conditions are becoming more or less completely established ; the temperature of the commencement of recalescence varies considerably with small changes in the rate of cooling , but lies usually between // 400 ? and 480 ? C. No evidence of the unstable conditions represented by the dotted lines in the right-hand portion of Fig. 122 is found upon heating curves , of course . A similar example of the suppression of a compound has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which . unless the liquid is inoculated with the stable phase CdSb , the unstable phase Cd3Sb2 is formed . " In alloys of antimony with aluminium the formation of the compound AlSb takes place very slowly , " and the shape of the equilibrium diagram is altered greatly by changes in the rate of cooling . 59 . Imperfect Equilibrium. ? When the rate of cooling of an alloy during the period of solidification is not sufficiently rapid to cause the suspension or the suppression of a phase , it may be still great enough to prevent the attainment of true equilibrium by retarding the process of diffusion . This is especially the case when solid solutions are formed . The simpler conditions of imperfect equili brium are of very frequent occurrence , and are of considerable practical importance , though difficult to investigate with any degree of exactness , because the constitution of the mixture must be always somewhat indeterminate . Consider a series of alloys of two metals which form solid solutions and an eutectic ( Fig. 125 ) . A mixture like X , when in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform solution ; but even with the slowest possible cooling , there is insufficient opportunity for // the crystals of the solid solution to become perfectly homogeneous by diffusion . Hence at any temperature during solidification the proportion of solid is less and the proportion of liquid is more than should be there , and the temperature of complete solidification ( melting point ) of the alloy is lowered from x " to , say , x ' " . The apparent solidus is thus C x " ' instead of C x " . In an alloy like Y , containing a larger proportion of B than that in X , the melting point may be so much lowered that some liquid remains at the eutectic temperature , and the alloy only becomes solid at y " ' , instead of at y " . A measurement of the quantity of eutectic present in the alloy would give a point like Hi for the limiting composition of the solid solution , instead of the true point H actually Hl repre sents the mean composition of the primary crystals , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each , is H. In an alloy like Z , which normally contains some eutectic , the proportion of this is increased , so that H is apparently displaced to , say , H2 . The positions of the points Hl and H2 depend upon the rate of cooling , and vary also with the composition of the alloy ; they approach more nearly to the vertical boundaries of the diagram as cooling is more rapid , and also as the alloy contains less eutectic . For as the composition of the alloy approaches that of the eutectic // the range of composition of the primary crystals is diminished , the size of the crystals is diminished , and the proportion of liquid is increased , and all of these circumstances tend to promote diffusion . The increased proportion of eutectic due to rapid cooling , of course , gives rise to an increased time of arrest at the eutectic temperature , the mean curve through the observed points taking the form E H ' instead of E H ( Fig. 125 ) . Such an effect can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is impossible to determine the limiting solubility , H , with great accuracy from a series of slowly cooled alloys ; this limit can be found only by carefully annealing the alloys after solidification . Effects similar to the above occur in other types of alloys . Thus a bronze containing , say , 10 per cent . of tin , consists , when in a condition of equilibrium , of homogeneous crystals of a solid solution . But the cast alloy , when just solid , contains a considerable proportion of a second solution , which undergoes a transition at a lower temperature , exactly as if the primary solution were absent ( see Fig. 304 ) . Since the physical and mechanical properties of the unstable phase differ from those of the stable phase , the properties of the alloy when cast differ from those obtained when equilibrium has been established approximately by annealing . In this particular case both the strength and the ductility of the bronze are increased by annealing . Further , the time diagram for the halt at the transition temperature is extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the eutectic temperature ; Fig. 95 gives an example . Although moderately rapid cooling of an alloy results in the production of a heterogeneous mass , which with very slow cooling would be nearly homogeneous , yet very rapid cooling may give an apparently homogeneous substance . The time is insufficient for the segregation of the tiny particles as they solidify , and the resulting structure is too fine to be resolved by the microscope or to be revealed by any etching process , and approximates to an amorphous condition . Such a result is not attainable with all alloys , and in any case necessitates extreme rapidity of cooling . 60 . Cooling Curves and Heating Curves. ? In previous chapters a simple method of plotting cooling curves has been employed for convenience of illustration . For this method the observations required are those of time and temperature , and in many cases these are the most suitable measurements to make . Fig. 126 ( I ) shows a cooling curve , 0 a b c , of this simple type , exhibiting a reaction which is completed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been mentioned already ( Chapter II. ) that in an actual cooling curve the sharp angles shown at a and b are somewhat rounded , as in the lower part of Fig. 126 , and the horizontal line a b becomes a sloping line a b ' , showing that the reaction is // actually in progress over a certain interval of temperature , or that the temperature varies throughout the mass so that the reaction does not occur simultaneously at all points . By slow cooling , and by other precautions mentioned already , this interval may be reduced , but never quite eliminated ; the slope of a b ' is accentuated by any lag in the measuring apparatus . The rate of transformation is slow at the true transition point a , but increases rapidly to a maximum at a temperature d , somewhat below a , and again diminishes as the reaction becomes nearly complete . These characteristics are rendered manner ; the ordinate at any point of the new curve represents , as before , the temperature of the body , but the abscissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the time necessary for the temperature to fall through a definite small interval . This inverse rate of cooling may be measured approximately by noting the time required for the temperature to fall through an interval of , say , 5 ? or 10 ? , and the curve is obtained by plotting this time against the mean temperature during the interval . Or the inverse-rate curve may be drawn by differentiating , mathematically or geometrically , the previous direct one , as has been done in the diagram , where the inverse-rate curve corresponding with the direct curve // I. is shown in II. , the upper curve representing theoretically perfect conditions , and the lower having the modifications found in practice . Another type of curve may be drawn , in which the abscissa is the velocity of cooling ? that is , the fall of temperature which takes place during a small definite interval of time ? and the forms shown in Fig. 126 ( III. ) are obtained . At the transition point the cooling velocity is zero if the temperature is stationary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cooling velocity does not quite reach zero , and the length of the peak of the inverse-rate curve remains within reasonable limits ; in the diagram this peak should be over 3 inches long , and is shown broken . The curves II . and III . are lettered in accordance with I , so that a is the true transition point , while d is merely the temperature of maximum velocity of trans-formation , and is always lower than a . The change of curvature at a in II . is much more abrupt than in Ill. , so that a transition temperature can be more accurately located in the former . Another method , due originally to Roberts-Austen , has a great advantage in sensitiveness , an important point when the amount of heat evolved during a reaction is small . The method consists in measuring the difference between the temperature of the metal under investigation and the temperature of another piece of metal cooling under similar conditions . The second metal , of course , must experience no transition within the range of temperature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a perfectly smooth cooling curve below its freezing point down to atmospheric temperature . The actual temperature of the specimen is measured as in previous cases , and with the same possible accuracy . The advantage of the method lies in the fact that an abscissa of the curve is given by the measurement of a temperature difference which never exceeds a few tens of degrees , so that the intensity of the transition is measured with an instrument which has a much more open scale than the one required to measure the actual temperature . In Fig. 126 ( I. ) , 0 x represents the cooling curve of the platinum block , from which the difference of temperature is to be measured . The speciman and the platinum are initially at the same temperature 0 , and if cooled slowly in a furnace having a uniform temperature throughout there would be no measurable difference of temperature between the two bodies so long as no transformation of either took place . In an actual case there is some difference in the rate of cooling of the two bodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature of the specimen at any instant , and , as abscissa , the dffierence between this temperature and the temperature of the platinum block at the same instant , a point upon curve IV . is obtained ; in other words , the vertical scale of IV . is the same as in I. , while the vertical distance between the curve 0 a b c and 0 x of I. is plotted horizontally in IV . The difference curves IV . // are similar in general character to the direct curves I. , but the change of curvature at a is more abrupt in IV . than in I. A more usual way of employing the difference method is to make the abscissa of the curve equal to the rate of change of the temperature difference instead of the difference itself ; a peaked curve V. is then obtained similar in appearance to II . ; it has been called the derived difference curve.05 ) The curve V. bears the same relation to IV . as 1I. bears to I. , and V. has the same advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that IV . possesses over I. It is worth noticing that the peak e of V. is at a slightly higher temperature than the peak d of II . ; but the true transition point a , at which the first great change of curvature occurs , is the same for all the curves , though it can be more accurately located in some than in others . An improved arrangement for taking cooling curves consists in providing means for reducing the temperature of the furnace at a slow uniform rate. ( 1 ) The cooling curve is then a straight sloping line in which any irregularity is easily detected , and an accurate quantitative examination of a transformation is possible . The apparatus is most easily arranged when an electric furnace of the resistance type is employed . All of the methods for drawing cooling curves are equally applicable to heating curves . The advantages of heating curves , and the greater advantages of taking both heating and cooling curves of the same alloy have been discussed already from the thermal point of view . From a merely geometrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse of that of the corresponding cooling curve , the heating curve is better suited to determine the lower limit , and the cooling curve the upper limit of a transformation which continues over an interval of temperature ; thus , a liquidus is best determined from observations made during cooling and a solidus during heating . In order to obtain the most satisfactory results from heating curves , however , it is essential that the solid alloy shall be , as nearly as possible , in a condition of equilibrium at the temperature from which the measurements are to start , and this may necessitate a long initial period of annealing . During this period there is an approach not only towards chemical equilibrium , by change in the composition of the phases , but also towards a physical equilibrium , by alteration in the size and arrangement of the crystal aggregates . Prolonged annealing , in general , results in larger crystals , so that any subsequent transition will be impeded by the increased difficulty of diffusion ; the altered value of the surface tension of each crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heating , therefore , is very slow , the upper limit of the transition will be registered at too high a temperature . // 61 . The Complete Equilibrium Diagram. ? From what has gone before it will have been gathered that the construction of a complete equilibrium diagram for any but the simplest kinds of alloys is both a tedious and a difficult matter . Very few of the published diagrams are quite satisfactory , and most of them are known to be incomplete . They are to be regarded as useful first approximations , which require correction and amplification by means of further experiments . Thermal observations are usually made with considerable accuracy , but few , if ally , equilibrium diagrams can be completed from thermal observations alone . Structural observations must be made , and if the results are not in accordance with the temperature curves the work requires revision . The miner details of the structure of metals and alloys , and their connection with physical and mechanical properties offer a wide field of study . The determination of the variation in properties with variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest importance , but presents considerable difficulties . The admirable series of reports presented to the Alloys Research Committee of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers , though not claiming completeness in this respect , forms a good example of the methods to be followed . From the Phase Rule it follows that a binary alloy in a condition of equilibrium shows not more than two constituents , exception being made to conditions such as those which prevail at an eutectic point or a transition point . The equilibrium diagram consists of a number of lines , many somewhat curved , which may be classified as horizontal , vertical , and oblique . These divide the whole diagram into a number of areas or fields . Each field represents the conditions of stability either of a single phase or of a mixture of two phases . A single phase is free to vary both in temperature and in composition within its limits of existence , and the boundary of a single-phase field , therefore , may have any direction . When the constitution of an alloy alters , the change consists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of one phase into two , of two phases into one , or of two phases into two phases , one of which is the same as before this will be clear if it is remembered that no more than three phases can be present together while the change is in progress . A single phase which changes into another single phase may be a pure metal , a compound , or a solution ; to such changes belong changes of state , allotropic transformations of pure metals , polymorphic transformations of compounds , and transitions of a few solid solutions . Metals and compounds are represented on the equilibrium diagram by vertical lines of constant composition , and not by areas . The change of one solution , liquid or solid , into another of the same composition , but of different physical properties , does not take place at constant temperature , except for certain critical compositions , but proceeds over a certain interval of temperature , during which                    @
