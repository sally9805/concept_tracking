A BOOK which has made a very vivid impression in France within a few months past asks of its readers that vexed and vexing question of simplicity in the art of fiction which from time to time troubles criticism . It first asked this question of French readers , and then it began to ask it of English readers , and now it asks it of American readers . In a former day its appeal to Anglo-Saxon interest would have been by a different course . It would have been known here first , and would have sought the approval of the mother-country after it had become rather an old story to the daughter . Formerly nearly all the work of the Continental fictionists was translated into English after much earlier versions in our kindred dialect had appeared . But now the English have formed the taste for true work in that sort from the extremely good performance of half a dozen of their younger writers , while we have lost our taste for it through our preference for the inferior fiction which our popular authors have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of a French book , quite as if it were a new La in republic , and our literary commonwealth , like our political state , were governed by the imperial example . It is a phase which may or may not pass ; but in the meanwhile there is another aspect of the affair which is tempting the comment of the Easy Chair . This new French novel , whose striking character is " teasing out of thought " several contemporary civilizations , is that Marie-Claire , by Marguerite Audoux , which Mr. Arnold Bennett , in his preface to the London translation , so justly says " is not fiction , " but " is the exquisite expression of a temperament . " When he adds that " it is a divine accident , " we wish he would explain , for we do not follow him so rapidly to his climax as we might like . What appears from all the rest that he says is that Marie-Claireis the achievement of a Parisian seamstress , no longer very young , whose eyes have failed her from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes to writing , and she writes the story of her own life as the ward of a religious sisterhood , and then ( when she is old enough to leave the convent ) as a shepherdess , and afterward as a farm-servant , with a return to the convent as the cook 's assistant . It ends with her going up to Paris to earn her living there . " It is not a fiction , " certainly , as Mr. Bennett says , whether " a divine accident " or not . It is self-evidently the history of the author 's own life for the period given , and it is very , very interesting and very touching , as the story of any life , any unworldly life , faithfully told , must be . The child adores a Sister , Marie-Aimee , with whom she is passionately in love , as a pupil in a convent school always is with some nun . Sister Marie-Aimee is angelically good to her , and the Mother Superior , because she hates Sister Marie-Aimee , and is jealous of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her protegee , and sends the child off to be a shepherdess . But the farmer and his wife who receive her are kind people , and the wife 's brother ( whom it is dimly adumbrated that the girl , as she grows older , begins to love ) is kind , too , and no one means her harm . Their successors , when she falls to them , prove merely dull , sordid folk , but not wicked ( as they must once have proved in fiction ) , and when the brother of the new farm-wife offers his love to Marie-Claire it is his old mother who forbids the marriage , with no more harshness than suffices to crush her son 's hopes . He is very like the first young man , in his mild , gentle type ; and perhaps one real person stood for both . Within these narrow hounds there is beautiful and pathetic study of the different nuns and children in the convent , whether they are good or bad ; and espedeleted material Simplicity is such a very easy thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say it of any book that seems honest , without reflecting that simplicity is really not desirable , if it were ever really possible in any passable piece of work . Simplicity is of the children and of the most artless of our few remaining savages , though children are now born so cultured , and savages are so much written up that it is doubtful whether even these have any simplicity left in them . Simplicity , in the large , loose sense of the admiring critics of a sophistically flotated fiction , is an unconsciousness really quite beyond the reach of art . For in all save the most primary art the most elementary thingcannot be set down without the connivance of the author 's consciousness that he is doing it with the hope of its effect on the reader , whoever the reader shall be . This in itself is an end of all simplicity of motive . A tale is not told for its own sake ; it is not told for the sake of him who tells the tale ; it is told for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will leave out the savage ) , as soon as it has " made up " something , comes to try it upon its father or mother or doting grandparent . Like everything else of the literary kind , it is created to be published ; and the conditions of its existence are three : the fable-stuff filling all space like an intellectual ether , the author who gives specific form to a portion of this ether , and the public which appreciates it . The very most primordial beginning of it is consciousness in the author , and consciousness is the end of that sort of simplicity which is supposed of Marie-Claire and other books praised for their supposed unconsciousness . Consciousness , originative and imperative in literary art , is of course to be controlled and disciplined to an effect of unconsciousness . Every one of us admirable and contemptible human beings is as absolutely conditioned in egoistic consciousness as in nakedness . But as the usages of polite society oblige us to refrain from talking about ourselves and to wear clothes , so in literary art we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to hide it even from itself , lest it degenerate into that really deplorable and all but impossible thing , simplicity . Without egoism , taken by the throat and pushed well into the background , or thrown off the stage and out of the action altogether , but really at the same time animating it all , there can not be any effect of simplicity in literary art save from consciousness . The author of Marie-Claire seems to have known this as perfectly before the flotation of her book as if it were her twentieth instead of her first fiction or " divine accident . " She is said to have written it four or five times over , and we may be sure that at each of these times she took something of her crude self out and put something of her refined self in . Yet it was always herself ; it was the material which the literary consciousness appropriates from the personality of the author , or from some neighboring personality ; for under our unlikeness we mortals are of the same mind and make as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depicting himself when he is not stealthily snap-shotting his nearest friend or the perfectest stranger , It was this self-consciousness , becoming more proof after each successive distillation , that made Mlle. Audoux recognizable in that sympathetic circle of brilliant young literary men in Paris as an artist of genuine and , in her new sort , unique quality , and determined them to &tate; her book on the crest of the most towering deem-Inn which their joint breath could upheave for it . In. spite of all this , it is a beautiful book , full of real feeling and the insight that comes of experience in the things treated of . One learns from it ( what one , to be sure , instinctively knew already ) that French nature is not that inhuman nature which French fiction has so much delighted to show it ; that men are not always looking on women to lust after them ; that the peasants are not always like the obscene peasants in La Terre , but are often as good and kind as the farmer and his wife who bring their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to her convent . They are not greedy and sordid , and most of the country folks are not shown so . With her admirable fourth-proof consciousness the author portrays each of her characters more and more simply , so that the love of Sister Marie-Aimee is not more overdone than the bate of the Mother Superior . All those nuns and their little wards are studied with tireless patience and fidelity . There seems scarcely any one out of drawing in the book . The book , therefore , is a masterpiece of consciousness working to an effect of simplicity . The simplicity is in the method ; it is the skilled simplicity of the artist who has learned to make every touch tell , and it is by no means unexampled in the work of the most famous masters . We recall at random the beautiful early work of Bjornson in Arne , and SynnOve Solbakken , and especially such a perfect little intaglio as The Father . We think of Tolstoy 's Polikoushka , and his Scenes of the Siege of Sebastopol . Then there are Turguenief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his Dmitri Boudine . Such a book as Verga 's House by the Medlar Tree is of an unsurpassed consciousness working to a perfect simplicity . If we come nearer , or quite home , there is almost all the work of Sarah Orne Jewett ( whose gentle hand shall work no more ! ) , and the Jane Field of Mrs. Wilkins Freeman , and many a true and lovely story and study which we have our own life to test by ; and the sweet and genuine tale of True Love by Miss Edith Wyatt , and all her exquisitely " simple " sketches of Chicago life in Every One His Own Way . Going afar again , there is Auerbach 's Edelweiss ( we speak from early recollection ) , with most of his tales , and his Black Forest Tales . There is not so much of this refined consciousness working to the effect of simplicity in English fiction ; but we have it in a great deal that Mr. Bennett has written , and we have it in The House with the Green Shutters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English fiction is so ingrain literary , so deeply dyed-in-the-wool literary , that there is very little effect of the refined consciousness in it , very little of the complexion of life ; and the English like it so best , and not in the best Continental or American manner . Its triumphs are achieved conventionally , according to the customs of a cruder artistic consciousness ; it is not taken seriously , and seems hardly self-respectful . The pity of the flotated acceptance of Marie-Claire is that it invites the reader to the contemplation and enjoyment of a phenomenon , while this story is not phenomenal but quite noumenal in its claim . upon his sympathy . In her successive revisions the author has removed from it all miracle . She has told straightforwardly the story of her own life , say , without ostentation and without ornament . But this has not happened without the greatest pains in revision after revision ; it is the final effect of conscious art that is given us , and not the effortless achievement of genius , a thing that really does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most unaffected that taste can employ ; the style is clear and frank , and wisely fearless of tautology . The story is told as children like a story told , with the repetition of nouns , and not the substitution of pronouns , or any poor tricks of pseudo-elegance . Nothing could be less involved than the method . It is said that the author is writing another book , and it may imaginably be the life of some such country girl as Marie-Claire when she comes to be a seamstress in Paris . But quite possibly , and altogether preferably , it may not be , and will be a truer test of the author 's powers than Marie-Claire . A surprise is something that can not be enjoyed for long . It can not be denied that the pleasure of it is very great ; one feels as if in owning it delightful one were sharing in the merit of it . Mlle. Audoux 's next book will not be flotated , and yet perhaps it will sorely need flotation , for it will not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have liked Marie-Claire so much will grudge her younger sister a place in their hearts ; all will scrutinize her character and manner , and be readier to condemn her for coming short than to applaud her for surpassing . That is a pity , but it is inevitable ; it almost makes one wish that Andoux would not write another book . Yet would not this relegate Marie-Claire to the realm of the miraculous , exile her from the realm of the artistic ; and would not that be a still greater pity
