 | MR . HENRY B. RANKIN , of Springfield , Illinois , at eighty years of age , has written ; : Personal Recollections of Abraham Lincoln " ( G. P. Putnam 's Sons ) . The title correctly describes the book , which is composed of scenes and incidents illustrative of Mr. Lincoln 's character based on either the author 's personal knowledge or on information derived from those who were personally familiar with Mr. Lincoln during the earlier years of his life . It deals , therefore , with Mr. Lincoln as a man rather than as a politician , and throws light on his public career chiefly because of the light which it throws on his personal character . It is personal , familiar , intimate , and to lovers of Lincoln is a valuable addition to the volumes which have been written about him . The chapter entitled " What Religion Meant to Abraham Lincoln " has a peculiar value , because it corrects a widely spread misapprehension respecting Mr. Lincoln 's early religious views . Mr. W. H. Herndon , Mr. Lincoln 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " Life of Lincoln , " has given currency to a story in confirmation of the statement that prior to Mr. Lincoln 's election to the Presidency he was an avowed disbeliever in Christianity . Mr. Rankin 's account of the origin of this story not only banishes it to the limbo to which such legends as Washington 's " little hatchet " have been deported , but also furnishes apparently trustworthy information respecting Mr. Lincoln 's early religious education , imbibed from his mother before her death , and his spiritual faith as well as his ethical standards . What we may call the Herndon story was that Mr. Lincoln as a young man wrote an article against Christianity , that he read it to a friend , who took it from him and threw it into the fire . This story was used against him in a political campaign in 1846 , in which Peter Cartwright , a famous Methodist minister , was his competitor for Congress , and was overwhelmingly defeated . The political canard which Cartwright accepted without investigation was so far discredited at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He subsequently denied its truth and affirmed Mr. Lincoln 's Christian character . The origin of this story affords a curious illustration of how political canards sometimes grow . A certain Mr. Hill wrote to his former partner , Mr. McNeil , a long letter , giving the reasons for Mr. Hill 's abrupt termination of the partnership , in which letter he made a violent personal attack upon his former partner for becoming a successful rival in a suit for the hand of a certain young lady . This letter , accompanied with some invoices of goods , was dropped on the road , picked up by a boy , and given to Abraham Lincoln , who was a special favorite with the boys and was their confidant . Mr. Lincoln took it to Mr. Hill , who flew into a towering rage over the disclosure of his private business affairs , " snatched the package from Mr. Lincoln 's hands , and threw it into the fire . By what unfortunate or malicious mischance this incident became connected with a religious manuscript , which Mr. Lincoln had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain . This manuscript is described by a friend of Mr. Lincoln 's , to whom he read it , as an argument in defense of universal salvation . Says the writer of this letter , Mr. Menter Graham : " I remember well his argument . He took the passage , As in Adam all die , even so in Christ shall all be made alive , ' and followed up with the proposition that whatever the breach or injury of Adam 's transgression to the human race  | was , which no doubt was very great , it was made just and right by the atonement of Christ . " The Herndon story and its refutation would hardly be worth recording here were it not for the fact that it has furnished Mr. Rankin with the occasion for a description of a conversation between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Rankin 's mother , which furnishes the clearest exposition of Mr. Lincoln 's religious views we have ever seen . Mrs. Rankin was a friend both of Peter Cartwright and of Abraham Lincoln . As the result of the charges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Lincoln as to his religious views . After a few moments of hesitation , he replied by saying that he would make no public denial of the charge preferred against him . " I will not , " he said , " discuss the character and religion of . Jesus Christ on the stump ! That is no place for it , though my opponent , a minister of his Gospel , thinks it is . " But he was willing to give his answer to Mrs. Rankin , with the understanding that his reply was not to be quoted nor the subject introduced by his friends in the pending Congressional campaign . Mr. Rankin then gives the entire statement of Mr. Lincoln as reported to him by his mother . Mr. Lincoln said : " At the time you refer to I was having serious questionings about some portions of my former implicit faith in the Bible . The influence that drew me into such doubts were strong ones ? men having the widest culture and strongest minds of any I had known up to that time . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see my way clear to decide on them , there came into my life sad events and a loos that you were close to and you knew a prat deli about bow hard they were for me , for you were , at the time , a mutual friend . Those days of trouble found me tossed amidst a sea of questionings . They piled big upon me , experiences that brought with them great strains upon my emotional and mental life . Through all I groped my way until I found a stronger and higher grasp - of thought , one that reached beyond this life with a clearness and satisfaction I had never known before . The Scriptures unfolded before me with a deeper and more logical appeal , through these new experiences , than anything else I could find to turn to , or ever before had found in them . " I do not claim that all my doubts were removed then , or since that time have been swept away . They are not . Probably it is to be my lot to go on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as questioning , doubting Thomas did . But in my poor maimed , withered way , I bear with me as I go on a seeking spirit of desire for a faith that was with him of the olden time , who , in his need , as I in mine , exclaimed : Help thou my unbelief . ' . . . I doubt the possibility or propriety of settling the religion of Jesus Christ in the models of man-made creeds and dogmas . It was a spirit in the life that he laid stress on and taught , if I read aright . I know I see it to be so with me . " The fundamental truths reported in the four Gospels as from the lips of Jesus Christ , and that I first heard from the lips of my mother , are settled and fixed moral precepts with me . I have concluded to dismiss from my mind the debatable wrangles that once perplexed me with distractions that stirred up , but never absolutely settled anything . I have tossed them aside with the doubtful differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind among the non-essentials . I have ceased to follow such discussions or be interested in them . " I can not without mental reservations assent to long and complicated creeds and catechisms . If the Church would ask simply for assent to the Saviour 's statement of the substance of the law : Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and thy neighbor as thyself ' ? that Church would I gladly unite with . " If Mr. Rankin had rendered no other service by his book , we should be grateful to him for giving us this information at almost first hand respecting the character and experience of Abraham Lincoln , an experience in which a spiritual faith was combined with an intellectual honesty and a spirit of reverential reticence , a combination which furnished one of the secrets of his power as a leader of men in a great National crisis .                    @
