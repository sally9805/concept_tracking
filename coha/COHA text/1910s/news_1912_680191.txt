txt Cot . Theodore Roosevelt was shot and wounded in the right breast in front of the Hotel Gilpatrick shortly before S o'clock to-night . Col. Roosevelt was about to enter his automobile to go to the Auditorium for his evening address , when a man rushed up and fired at close range . The bullet entered the flesh under the right nipple , but its force was broken by the manuscript of the speech which Col. Roosevelt had prepared for this evening . He at first declared he had not been wounded , but on the way to the hall a hole was noticed in his overcoat and it was found that his shirt was covered with blood . Nevertheless he insisted on delivering his speech , and went on , for fifty minutes , even though his weakness became so apparent , that physicians insisted that he should stop . Talked Politics at Hospital . After his speech he was taken ; to the Emergency Hospital to have his wound examined . At 10:30 o'clock Col. Roosevelt was sitting on the operating ' table talking politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an X-ray machine . Col. Roosevelt left the hospital at it : 25 P. M. He was able to walk unassisted . " I am feeling fine , " he said . Surgeons Say Wound Is Slight . Col. Roosevelt left at 12:50 A. M. for Chicago . Before he left surgeons who had attended him gave out the following statement : " Col. Roosevelt is suffering from a superficial flesh wound in the right breast . There is no evidence of injury to the lungs . The ' bullet is probably somewhere in the chest wall . There is only one wound and no sign of injury to the lung . The bleeding is insignificant . The wound has been sterilized externally with gauze by Dr. R. T. Fayle , the consulting surgeon . of the Emergency Hospital . The bullet passed through Col. - Rooseveles army overcoat and other clothing and through a manuscript and spectacle case in his breast pocket , and its force was nearly spent before it penetrated the chest . The appearance of the wound also showed evidence of a much-spent bullet . " Col. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pain . His condition is so good that . surgeons did not object to his continuing his journey to Chicago in his private car . In .. Chicago he will be placed under surgical care .

Dr. R. G. FAYLE , " Dr. JOSEPH COLT BLOODGOOD of Johns Hopkins . " Dr. F. A. STRATTON . " The X-ray of Cot Roosevelt 's I wound shows that the bullet lodged in the abdominal wall and did not penetrate the lung . Just as the Roosevelt special train was leaving here a sudden change in plans was made and the engineer was ordered to hold the train . It was stated that the bullet penetrated three inches of the abdominal wall , and the wound is more serious that at first thought . This was shown by the X-ray photograph which has just been developed . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are Drs . John B. Murphy , Arthur Bevan , A. R. Ochsner and L. L. . It was finally decided at 1 2:45 that Col. Roosevelt should go on to Chicago , and the train started . The positive statement that Col. Roosevelt was not injured seriously was made by Dr. Stratton , who said that there was no cause for alarm as to the Colonel 's condition . ' The wound was a superficial one , " said Dr. Stratton . " The bullet is imbedded in the muscular tissue . All that we did at the hospital was to put on an antiseptic dressing . You may say Col. Roosevelt is not in a dangerous condition . There is no truth in the report that the bullet penetrated the abdominal wall . If the bullet had reached his lungs it would have been evident and he would have had coughing spells . " How the . Shooting Occurred . The man who did the shooting said he was John Schrank of 370 East Tenth Street , New York City . Papers found on him showed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was a crank on the subject of the third term . As no secret had been made of the plans of Col. Roosevelt , a crowd was in front of the hotel to see him leave for the Auditorium . When he came out a cheer was set up and to it he responded smilingly , raising his hat and bowing . Several persons pushed to the front to see him better or to try to shake his hand , as is usual . There were cries of encouragement from all sides . No special pains had- been taken to protect the Colonel under the circumstances , and the members of his party Philip Roosevelt , a cousin ; Henry F. Cochems , the Bull Moose leader here ; Albert H. Martin , one of his secretaries , and Capt . A. 0 . Girard of this city  --  were not on guard . When the party had crossed the sidewalk to the automobile Col. ' Roosevelt 's . companions stood aside and let him step . in . Mr. Martin entered immediately after him . There was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat , smiling . A stocky man had been standing at the rige of , the sidewalk only a few feet from the Colonel . When he pushed his way forward little attention was paid to him because many admirers of the Colonel have done such things . Col. Roosevelt , in fact , looked benevolently upon him and smiled . The man suddenly produced a pistol and fired pointblank . Football Player Fells . Man . The fellow still had his pistol raised and seemed about to fire again , but here Mr. Martin saved his chief . He had seen the pistol and had leaped forward to shield the Colonel . Too late for that , he jumped just as the shot was fired and landed on the assailant . Martin , who is six feet tall and a former football player struck squarely on the man 's shouders and bore him to the ground . He threw his right arm about the man 's neck with a deathlike grip and with his left arm . seized the hand that held the pistol . In another second he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the shot was fired , and stood calmly looking on , as though nothing had happened . Martin picked the man up as though he were a child , and carried him the few feet which separated them from the car , almost to the side of the Colonel . Roosevelt Averts Lynching . " Here he is , " said Martin , " look at him Colonel . " All this happened within a few seconds and Col. Roosevelt stood gazing rather ctiriously at the man who attempted his life before the stunned crowd realized what was going on . Then a howl of rage went up . " Lynch him ! Kill him ! " cried a hundred men . The crowd pressed in on the man and Mr. Martin and Capt . Girard , who had followed Mr. Martin over the sides  --  of the automobile , were ? caught ' with their prisoner in the midst of a struggling throng , of maddened men . It seemedzforr the moment that he would be torn to pieces , and it was Col. Roosevelt himself who intervened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall back . " Stop , stop ! ' " he cried . " Stand back ! Do n't hurt him ! " The crowd at first was not disposed to heed , his words , but at length fell back and permitted Mr. Martin and Capt . Girard to carry , the man into the hotel . After a short struggle he gave up and was taken without resistance out of the reach of the crowd . " Are you hurt , Colonel ? " a /hundred voices called out . " Oh , no ! " he responded , ? with , a smile . " Missed me that time ; I 'm not hurt a bit . " " 1 think we 'd better , be going on , " he said to the other members of , his party , " or we will be late . " Colonel Learns He Is Wounded . No one in the party , including Col. Roosevelt himself , entertained the slightest notion that he had been shot . He felt no shock Or pain at the time , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Col. Roosevelt had assured himself that the assassin was safe in the hands of the police he gave orders to drive on to the Auditorium . The party had driven hardly one of the four blocks from the hotel to the Auditorium when John , another of Col. Roosevelt 's secretaries , uttered a sharp exclamation and pointed to the Colonel 's breast . " Look , Colonel , " he said . " There is a hole in your overcoat . " Col. Roosevelt looked down , saw the hole , then unbuttoned the big brown army coat which he was wearing and thrust his hand beneath it . When he withdrew it , his fingers were stained with blood . He was not at all dismayed . " It looks as though I had been hit , " he said , " but 1 do n't think it is anything serious . " Dr. Scurry Terrell of'Dallas , Tex. , Col. Roosevelt 's physician , who had entered We automobile just before it started , insisted that the . Colonel return to the hotel . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was driven on to the Auditorium . Speaks Despite Doctors ' Protest . As soon as they reached the building , Col. Roosevelt wa 's taken into a ' dressing room and his outer garments were removed . Dr. Terrell , with the help of Dr. John Stratton of Milwaukee and Dr. S. S. Soren zon of Racine , Wis. , who had been in the audience and came to the dressing room on a call from the platform , made a superficial examination of the wound . They agreed that it was impossible to hazard a guess as to the extent of the Colonel 's injuries and that he should by all means go at once to a hospital . " I will deliver this speech or die , one or the other , " was Col. Roosevelt 's reply . Despite the protests of his physicians , he strode out of the dressing room and onto the stage . Audience Shocked by the News . A large crowd packed into the big building , cheered loudly as he entered , and without a word to indicate what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no man of whom suspected that the Colonel bore a bullet in his body , kept up its cheering . Then Mr. Cochems stepped to the front of the platform and held up his hand . There was something in his manner which had its effect upon the crowd and the cheering died suddenly away . " I have something to tell you , " said Mr. Cochems , . ! Sand .1 hope you will receive the news with calmness . " His . voice shook as he spoke and a deathlike stillness settled over the throng . " Col. Roosevelt has been shot . He is wounded . " Shows His Blood-stained Shirt . He spoke in a low tone , but such was the stillness that every one heard him . A cry of astonishment and horror went up from the crowd , which was thrown into confusion in an instant . Mr. Cochems turned and looked inquiringly at Cot Roosevelt . " Tell us , are you hurt ? " Men and women shouted wildly . Some of them rose from their seats and rushed forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose and walked to the edge of the platform to quiet the crowd . He raised his hand and instantly there was silence . " It 's true , " he said . Then slowly he unbuttoned his coat and placed his hand on his breast . Those in the front of the crowd could catch a sight of the bloodstained garment . " I 'm going to ask you to be very quiet , " said Col. Roosevelt , " and please ex cure me from making you a very , long speech . " I 'll do the best I can , but you see there is a bullet in my body . But it 's nothing . I 'm not hurt badly , " he went on . , A sigh of relief went up from the crowd , and then an outburst of tumultuous cheering . Thoroughly reassured by the Colonel 's action that he was in no serious danger , the people settled back in their seats to hear his speech . Col. Roosevelt began to speak in a firm voice , somewhat lower than its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatic than usual there was nothing about the man to indicate his condition . After he had been speaking a few minutes , however , his voice sank somewhat and ' he seemed to stand rather unsteadily . Dr. Terrell and Col. Cecil Lyon stepped up to him and the doctor insisted that he stop . " I 'm going to finish this speech , " laid the Colonel , ? energetically . " I 'm all right ; let me alone . " Dr. Terrell and Col. Lyon sat down again . The Colonel con-1 tinned his speech , evidently with II increasing effort , but he succeeded in making himself heard and talked for nearly an hour . Then he was rushed through the streets to the Emergency Hospital . Could Not Locate the Bullet . The operating room had been placed in readiness to receive him and six of the leading surgeons of Milwaukee were awaiting his arLol . Roosevelt was undressed and placed upon the operating table , although he insisted he was not badly hurt and that the doctors were taking it too seriously . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a bullet of large size . It entered the fleshy part of the right breast , half way between the collarbone and- lower rib . The physicians I found that they knew no more after their examination than before . . as to the location of the bullet : . and it , was decided to send for an X-ray machine to determine to what ' depth the missile had penetrated . While he was waiting for the- X-ray machine Col. Roosevelt sat up on the operating table and talked politics and joked with the physicians . Another Crank Near Colonel . It was said at the Gilpatrick Hotel that while Col. Roosevelt was -- at dinner a short dark man , about 40 years old , made four attempts - to gain admission to the dining room , being turned away each time . Those who. saw him said he bore no resemblance to Schrank . Front this circumstance the re/ port gained currency that two men were engaged in the attempt ' to take Col. poosevelt 's life .
