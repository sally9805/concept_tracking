txt ' The objection most commonly urged against the establishment of a , Central Bank as a solution of our currency problems is that such a bank would surely fall into the control of " Wall Street , " which in many parts of this country is the name used to describe a real or imaginary money power . One answer to that objection is that it is quite unthinkable that the country will ever consent to organize a Central Bank which could by any possibility i fall under the domination of a " money power . " That answer , however , would hardly be satisfying to the advocates of a Central Bank , since it meets the objection in a way that destroys the thing objected to . A second and much better answer is that it is entirely possible to organize , establish , and put in operation a Central Bank that would be wholly free from the control of selfish banking or money interests .

In other words , it would be a federated bank . The banks throughout the country would be constituent parts of the organism . It would be representative of them because they would be a part of it . Such an organization , which in its structural outlines is that presented in Congressman FowLEtt 's bill introduced last Winter , has merits - which have commanded much attention and approval . The European central banks are , Like European Governments , strongly.:centralized . A bank might be established here which would faithfully represent the interests of every part of the Union , and readily respond to local demands .
