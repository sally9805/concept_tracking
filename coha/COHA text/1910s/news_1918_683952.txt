txt The new tractor plant of Chandler Motor Co. will he completed by July , and production will be well under way by mid-Summer . The plant is 400 feet in length , and , including machinery , ' will cost the Chandler concern something in excess of $600,000 . This plant will work on a Government , order for approximately $10,000,000 worth of tractors . These machines are of the caterpillar type , and each will weigh in excess of 19,000 pounds . They will be used for haulinet , heavy guns . Chandler 's output for passenger cars in the current quarter will run ahead of the first three months of .1918 , when approximately 2,000 cars were built , as compared with slightly under 4,400 cars in the first quarter of 1917 . The company 's production schedule for the year calls for between 9,000 and 10,000 cars . In 1917 the output approxid 15,000 . War taxes will cost Chandler something over $600.000 a year . This is equal to $9 a share on the 70,000 shares of Chandler stock outstanding . Inasmuch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for war taxes , the company actually earned in that year $25 a share , after all allowances . The recently issued report showed $34 a share before these reservations . The company recently put its stock on a regular $12 dividend basis . With earnings after all war taxes running at the rate of twice the dividend . the disbursement appears to he conservative . Those directing Chandler affairs have no doubt of the ability of the company to n  --  aintain this dividend rate . The expense of the new tractor plant is borne entirely by the Chandler concern . During the latter half of the current . year , the company will secure some earnings from this large tractor order .

When Government business is finished . the now plant will be used for passenger car production . Earnings of chamller for the first quarter were at the annual rate of about $27 a share on the stock before war taxes . The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its Government business nor will it receive any earnings in the second quarter from that source . But in the closing half of the year the company should find its tractor order a real money maker . In other words , on the basis of net without the assistance of war business . the Chandler company should earn , on the present output , as much in 1918 as it did in 1917.
