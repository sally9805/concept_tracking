 | WITH each advance in biology it has become increasingly difficult to frame a definition of an animal hat would not also be a definition of a slant . The least organized plant is indistinguishable from an animal . Even in the higher forms , the resemblance between the two is close . Where there is a purposive structure or a perceptive organ in an animal , you will find something to correspond with it in a plant . If it is not actually an eye , it is foliage sensitive to light ; if it is not a skin with a sense of touch , it is a vegetal tissue that performs similar functions . Whatever difference there may be seems not so much physiological as psychological . A series of investigations made by Professor Jagadis Chunder Bose , of Calcutta , has resulted in revelations of such farreaching scientific importance that it may be doubted whether even this distinction now holds good . The barrier between the llife-phenomena of plants and animals is thrown down . Even the commonest vegetable proves to be sensitive . Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a nervous system ? of a simple type , to be sure , but still a nervous system . The discovery is of momentous interest . Psychology deals with consciousness ; but without nerves , without some means of receiving impressions of storms and sunshine , heat and cold , there can be no consciousness . Grant that vegetation has nerves , and psychology must explore a region where only the botanist and the plant physiologist have entered . Professor Bose by no means holds that plants have anything like the intelligence of animals , but he has certainly demonstrated that they respond to external forces , not as so many living machines , but as sentient organisms . By his extraordinary methods of inquiry he proves that they are affected in a very human way when stimulated from without . They are benumbed by cold , intoxicated by alcohol , suffocated by foul air , wearied by excessive work , stupefied by anesthetics , excited by electric currents , stung by physical blows , exhilarated in sunshine , depressed in the rain , and killed by poisons or violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the same conditions and in the same manner as a human being , sometimes to a greater and sometimes to a lesser degree . Flowers and plants cease to be merely a few clustered petals , a few green leaves growing from a woody stem , and perhaps a thorn or two . We must form a new conception of them ? a conception that will relate them more closely to ourselves , far removed from humanity though they may seem . An Eastern Scientist with a Western Reputation How these startling discoveries came to be made is a story as interesting as any in the annals of modern science , and one , moreover , that involves a very remarkable personality . This scientist from the East  | combines the inventiveness of a resourceful mechanical and electrical engineer with the penetration and imagination that a great scientist must possess . He had to design instruments of unprecedented delicacy and exquisite accuracy , and often to build them with his own hands . With none of those - mechanical facilities at his disposal which every prominent European and American experimental scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he labored under discouraging difficulties before he could begin his investigations . A burning desire to know the truth accomplished miracles in mechanics and in pure research ; for he belongs to the dynasty of scientists who have discovered great natural laws with simple means . His achievements prove once more that inspiration and tenacity of purpose count for more than a splendid laboratory lavishly endowed . Although he is a native of India , there is not a trace of Oriental mysticism in Dr. Bose , nor of that curious mixture of occultism and metaphysics which we associate with the East . Yet he has the synthetic mind of an ancient Hindu philosopher ? svnthetic because his investigation of plant life was conducted primarily for the purpose of scientifically proving that unity of all matter , living or non-living , which thin old metaphysicians of his country had lone preached . It was soon after his graduation from Cambridge that Dr. Bose began the researches which have resulted in giving an entirely new aspect to various phenomena associated with life . At first he was concerned , not with living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brute matter , as it used to be called . That was in the days when wireless telegraphy was still a dream , when Marconi was just beginning to experiment . The Englishman Clerk Maxwell had theoretically demonstrated that light waves were merely visible electric waves . Then came the German Hertz and showed how it was possible to generate electric waves .  | which were invisible light waves , and to send them rippling out into space . To make these " Hertzian waves " visible an artificial eye had to be invented . That was achieved by the Englishman Lodge and the Frenchman Branly , quite independently . Lodge called this artificial eye a " coherer . " It was nothing but a glass tube filled with iron particles . When the electric waves struck the tube the particles were influenced in some mysterious way , so that their power of conducting an electric current was changed . They had also been inexplicably strained , so that they would not recover until the glass tube in which they were contained had been tapped . If wireless telegraphy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherer was needed ? something that was self-recovering , like a human eve . To discover that something involved a study of the whole theory of coherer action . Why was it necessary to tap the glass tube containing the iron particles ? To answer that question Dr. Bose began a painstaking investigation . He found that the iron particles of the coherer grew weary ; they were actually fatigued because of overstrain ; they had to be revived , and a tap ( a stimulus , in other words ) revived them . That discovery prompted him to study other substances . Matter proved to be strangely capricious . He examined it as a biologist examines a muscle or a nerve ? electrically . A piece of animal tissue that is dead reacts differently from a piece that is alive . There is an electric twitch when the living muscle or nerve is excited , a twitch that can be seen with the aid of a galvanometer ? a delicate detector of electric currents . A dead tissue , on the other hand , gives no response . Tested  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real and not in a figurative sense . He froze metals , and they became torpid like an icy muscle ; he poisoned them and then cured them ; he narcotized them and afterward revived them ; he pinched them , and they responded electrically like living flesh ; he subjected them to ceaseless blows , and they grew tired and irresponsive ; he allowed them to rest , and the ability to respond revived . He performed hundreds of experiments which proved that inorganic matter is not dead . So an inquiry instituted for the purpose of ascertaining why the particles in a coherer had to be tapped in order to respond again to electric waves ended by breaking down the barrier between organic and inorganic matter . What Relation Are Metals to Plants ? Ended ? This Eastern scientist is imbued with an enthusiasm that is boundless , with a curiosity that is insatiable , and with perseverance that is tireless . He had performed a life-work . He had addressed the Royal Institution and the Royal Society , and his discoveries had been acclaimed by the great physicists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important and revolutionary that had been made in many a day . But , to his mind , his inquiry was anything but ended . If supposedly dead inorganic matter is so dramatically responsive to external stimulus , what may not be expected of organic matter ? Why not enter the field of plant life and discover what is the relation of metal to plant , and of plant to animal ? Perhaps a synthetic theory could be evolved which would link man , vegetation , the earth in one living whole . Remember that this man is a physicist , not a physiologist . A mechanical engineer who decides to practise surgery on engineering principles is scientifically no bolder . To be sure , instruments have been used to fathom some of the mysteries of plant existence ; but they are instruments that have been invented , for the most part , by plant physiologists , and which have shown only in a coarse way how stem , leaf , and tendril respond to their environment . Into this field entered Dr. Bose , in the spirit not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result is a view of plant life from a totally new angle . Pens with Which Lilies and Cabbages Can Write First of all , Dr. Bose set about the invention of new instruments ? devices of unprecedented sensitiveness . If plants are to lay bare their secrets , they must be given the means of expressing themselves . In a broad sense , that is what Dr. Bose has done . His ingenious recorders are pens of incredible lightness with which lilies or cabbages may write down their impressions of the outer world in a script that we can understand . Use these instruments intelligently , and vegetation , hitherto mute , will whisper its story . If the scientist has failed to credit plants with the possession of tissues and nerves similar to those of animals , it is because the physiologically significant movements of leaves and fibers are often imperceptible . The feeble movements must be enlarged thousands of times to be seen and measured . The invisible movements are in turn detected electrically . That is how Dr. Bose deals with infinitesimal twitches , starts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient 's trembling hand to a physician . Enabled to express itself , a plant is found responsive to all the stimuli that cause an animal muscle to contract . A blow will make a muscle twitch ; a plant will also twitch when struck . A prick or a cut will cause both vegetal and animal tissue to give either a mechanical or an electrical twitch . Pinch a cauliflower stalk with tweezers , and a reflecting galvanometer ? a detector of currents which , in this instance , may be considered an electrical substitute for a brain ? can be made to move a beam of light many feet on a screen and thus to visualize the stalk 's wincing and recovery . Whatever may be the nature of the violence to which animal or plant may be experimentally subjected , ? a drop of acid , the fumes of ammonia , the touch of a hot wire , the shock of an electrical current , ? there is no difference in the character of the response . Recording the Sensations of Mimosa The instruments used in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical , optical , or electrical . Take the " resonant recorder , " perhaps the most important , as a type . A  | fine silk thread runs from one of the plant 's leaves to a small lever supported in jeweled bearings . From the middle of the lever a thin wire extends vertically downward . The wire is bent at right angles , so that its sharpened tip just touches a smoked-glass plate , which can be lowered at a uniform rate by means of clockwork . That tip is a writer or pencil . By means of an electro-magnet the writer can be made to vibrate a given number of times a second , so that it taps dots on the glass plate . Each dot marks a certain interval of time ? one hundredth of a second , one fiftieth of a second , one tenth of a second , whatever time interval you please . I n one experiment Dr. Bose shocks the leaf of a mimosa electrically , and simultaneously starts the apparatus . The smoked-glass plate falls ; the bent tip of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line is traced on the glass as the plant 's leaf , suddenly excited , gives an answering twitch and pulls the lever by means of the attached silken thread . Not more than five seconds have elapsed . The dots that compose the line show that in one tenth of a second the plant began to respond to the electrical shock . Count the number of dots , and at once it is evident that the leaf 's convulsive fall was completed in three seconds . The general character of the curve indicates how profound was the effect leaflet of a telegraph-plant . Dr. Bose has leaflets may be truthfully likened , in their and gases , to the tissue of the human heart of the sudden excitement . Mimosa has written down its perception of shock with a recorder not only of minute time intervals but also of minute leaf movements . All Plants Are " Sensitive " With his resonant recorder and with other equally delicate instruments of his own invention , Professor Bose has shown that the popular classification of plants into " sensitive " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the plebeian turnip and stolid radish to the aristocratic fern and the voracious pitcher-plant.  | If a plant rests , it is reasonable to suppose that it must be weary . You can not lift a weight or flex your arm more than a limited number of times . The muscles are easily fatigued . But after you have rested you can resume your exercise , as fresh as when you began . A plant , too , is fatigued after using its tissues ; it , too , must have rest . The more excitable it is , the more it needs repose . In Dr. Bose 's hands , a high-strung mimosa conducts itself like a restive thoroughbred horse that has been frightened . Its excitement is apparent enough in the record traced by tremulous leaflets ; and , like an alarmed thoroughbred , it quiets down only after more than a quarter of an hour . When you are struck , a measurable time elapses before you feel the blow . Biologists call that exceedingly short period between shock and response the " latent period . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tenth of a second , on an average , for the mimosa to feel a shock ; but sometimes the plant reacts as quickly as six one hundredths of a second . Like an animal , it responds better when it is in good than when it is in bad condition , and it is more active when it is warm than when , it is cold . Experiment after experiment is performed to note the response of a plant to gases , liquids , and drugs . Ozone excites ; coal-gas depresses ; ether and chloroform stupefy ; sulphureted hydrogen , nitrogen dioxide , and sulphur dioxide kill . Now we know why it is impossible to raise many plants in cities . The sulphureted hydrogen poisons them . How Plants Behave when Intoxicated A plant responds to intoxicants in the same human fashion . When Dr. Bose subjects a mimosa to the influence of alcohol , he does not administer the liquid , but the vapor . Confined in its little chamber , mimosa drinks in the fumes . The effect is almost ludicrous . The plant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it can and does indicate its intoxication by means of the resonant recorder in an inebriate script . In behavior , a drunken mimosa differs in no essential from a drunken man . Its script shows exaltation alternating with maudlin depression which seems almost repentant . A whiff of fresh air , and mimosa is once more restored to sobriety . The practical significance of such experiments with drugs and gases can hardly be overestimated . Modern doctors have all but discarded the phial and the pill-box , not only because they find that nature should be given a chance , but also because they realize that they have been prescribing drugs by rule of thumb rather than scientifically . Research on drug action is vastly simplified if we can begin with vegetation . When the study is complete we will know when and how medicines ought to be administered . Proofs that Plants Have a Nervous System For the same reason , researches that Dr. Bose conducted on nervous impulse are of immense importance to humanity . Professor Wilhelm Pfeffer , of the University of Leipzig , the Nestor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mimosa was nerveless . He chloroformed mimosa stalks without arresting the impulse in the plant . Had there been nerves , he argued , all transmission of excitation would have ceased . Pfeffer 's dictum in these matters is almost final . Dr. Gottlieb Haberlandt , a distinguished professor of botany in the University of Berlin and director of the Berlin Botanical Gardens , a scientist of commanding position , came to the same conclusion . He scalded mimosa stems , but still they transmitted excitation . Haberlandt attributed the propagation of stimulus to water pressure in the little stalk tubes . Squeeze one end of a rubber tube filled with water , and the pressure will be transmitted to the other end in a wave . Thus Haberlandt explained the strange action of mimosa 's leaves . If this rubber-tube theory is correct , a plant ought to transmit stimulus whether it is warm or cold , sick or healthy . A mechanical explanation can not consider physiological action . To ascertain whether or not plants have nerves , Dr. Bose deliberately coddled and pampered a mimosa . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside could not reach it . Tie your arm to your side , and it will soon lose its strength from lack of exercise . The biceps will become weak and flabby . Such was the condition of the coddled mimosa . It looked sleek and flourishing . If Pfeffer and Haberlandt were right and the rubber-tube theory held good , the  | plant 's leaves would respond although they had no exercise . Dr. Bose carried the plant to his recording apparatus ? gave it a pen with which to express itself . The instrument recorded nothing ; there was no response . The plant was paralyzed . It could not write . There it was , bloated and effete , stupidly tion : " Do you feel that ? And that ? And that ? " Very slowly the plant recovered its lost activity , and at last it wrote down its response in a feeble but intelligible script . To avoid the possibility of error , Dr. Bose tried the effect of temperature . He warmed the plant , and found that it transmitted a shock more quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves , but they were numb from sheer laziness . Clearly , the rubbertube theory was wrong . Pfeffer 's chloroform , applied only to the outer stem , had not reached the nerves . Haberlandt 's experiment in scalding was misleading , for the same reason . Next Dr. Bose stimulated the plant . The effect was the same as exercise to an arm that has not been used . He rained blows upon the plant . Each shock was a quesHe chilled it , and it became so numb that it could write nothing . He dropped potassium cyanide upon it , ? one of the deadliest poisons , ? and abolished all nervous impulse in as short a time as five minutes . Pfeffer and Haberlandt are wrong . Plants have nerves . And they vary in their nervousness , too . The unexpected slamming of a door , the mere scratch of a pencil on a slate , is enough to set the nerves of  | many a man tingling , while another will placidly read a newspaper amid the din of a boiler factory . Similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervousness , are found in vegetation . There are placid plants that can not be easily excited ; there are others that literally start at the slightest disturbance . Since a plant has nerves , it must take an appreciable time for it to respond to a shock . In a human being a nervous impulse travels at the rate of one hundred and ten feet a second . In lower animals it travels as slowly as two inches a second . How long does it take an impulse to speed along a plant nerve ? Another inquiry was begun . Dr. Bose found that when a mimosa was the best condition an excitation was transmitted tation in the annals of science . We know very little about paralysis in the human body , and practically nothing about its cause . The nervous system of the higher animals is so complicated , so intricate , that it is hard to understand its derangement . The human nerve dies when isolated . It is killed by the shock of removal , and responds for the moment abnormally and therefore deceptively . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? and the simplest is with a velocity of thirty millimeters ( 1.18 feet ) a second . Fatigue depressed the rate of transmission ; warmth increased it . What is more , he discovered that the impulse is transmitted in both directions along the nerve , and not always at the same rate . If he had made no other discovery , Dr. Bose would have earned an enduring repu-  | that of a plant , ? we may hope to understand what occurs when a hand or a foot can not be made to move . To find out that plants have nerves , to induce paralysis in such nerves and then to cure them ? such experiments will lead to discoveries that may ultimately enable physicians to treat more rationally than they do the various forms of paralysis now regarded as incurable . It is just as hard to study the heart in action as it is to study nervous impulses in the human body . The heart beats " spontaneously , " as it is expressed . As long as life is to last , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more magical , nothing more mysterious , than this steady beat , beat , beat of the human heart . No machine has ever been built that is so certain , so trustworthy , so generally unfailing . For decades it pumps blood through the system . It may waver , but it may never stop entirely if there is to be life . Something much simpler in structure must be found , something much more easily watched than this marvelous complex of tissue , if we would fully understand the theory of its action . The Telegraph-Plant and Its Automatic Pulsations The phenomenon of automatic pulsation is not unknown in the world of vegetation . There is the telegraph-plant , for example ? common enough in East India . Its leaflets move up and down rhythmically , like a throbbing heart . Biologists were unable to understand the significance of these plant pulsations because there were no suitable recording instruments at hand . Each leaflet is very small , and the pull that it exerts is so feeble that it can not move an ordinarily light stylus against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to his aid . He built a wonderful recorder , with lever and writing point so delicate that the slightest pull would move them . Connected by a cocoon thread with this instrument , the telegraph-plant makes some amazing revelations . Its pulsating tissue exhibits all the characteristics of an animal heart 's rhythmic tissue . In order to show that there is a perfect analogy between beating animal and beating plant tissues , Dr. Bose subjects his plants to all the tests that biologists apply to animals , and a few more that he himself conceives . A heart is slowed down by ether , the biologists say ? " I , too , must experiment with ether , " decides the Doctor . He places his plant in a chamber , and blows in some ether vapor mixed with air . The plant records its exaltation . It has been affected just as if it were human . Stronger ether vapor is admitted . The leaflets slow down just as does a heart under - the influence of an anesthetic . Will the leaflets stop altogether if too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , we know . The Doctor tests the plant . For a minute or two the leaflets waver uncertainly ; then they stop ? the plant is quite still . Fresh air is blown into the chamber , and the effect is magical . Very slowly the leaflet begins to move , and once more the record is traced on the glass plate , weakly and uncertainly at first , but gathering strength as the plant drinks in each new whiff of atmospheric oxygen . Chloroform has an even more pronounced effect than ether . If a slight excess is administered , the leaflets stop altogether . The leaflet may even be killed . Sometimes it takes as long as half an hour to revive a telegraph-plant that has been thoroughly chloroformed . Think , for a moment , of the significance of these experiments . We have been taught to believe that automatically pulsating tissues draw their energy from within , and to call this energy " vital force . " If a beating leaf can be arrested and started again simply by controlling external forces , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an internal vital force . Dr. Bose offers a new and more plausible theory , one that accounts for all spontaneous movements by the action of external forces only . A plant is the plaything of light , electricity , wind , and rain ? of all nature 's forces . Like the currents , drugs , and gases employed in Dr. Bose 's experiments , these natural forces act as stimuli . We must imagine the little molecules of which plants are constructed , not only storing up all this energy as if it were water received by a vessel , but as receiving much more than they can store . Like water , the excess energy bubbles over , as it were , and produces the pulsations that have seemed so inexplicable . Thus is " vital force " stricken from the vocabulary of biology .  | The phenomenon of growth is another example of automatic activity . To study it in detail has never been possible , because the changes that occur are so slow that sometimes whole days must elapse before they can be noted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverbial snail travels two thousand times more quickly than the average plant grows . Yet , with a most marvelous instrument ? the " crescograph , " he calls it ? Dr. Bose succeeds in measuring the growth that takes place during a few beats of a pendulum . Growth is magnified a thousand , ten thousand , even a million times for some demonstrations . Although it would take an average plant two hundred years to cover a mile , yet by means of the crescograph the growth of a minute appears as a swift forward rush . What is the tale of Aladdin and his wonderful lamp compared with the true story told by the crescograph ? In less than a quarter of an hour the action of fertilizers , foods , electrical currents , and various stimulants can be determined . Think what that means ! Instead of waiting a whole season , perhaps years , to discover whether or not it is wise to mix this or that fertilizer with the soil , one can now find out in a few minutes ! An experiment in farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemistry . When growth stops , a decay sets in which ultimately terminates in death . But when does a plant die ? Death , in an animal , is easily detected . The passage of life is marked by an unmistakable spasm , followed by a stillness that can not be broken . But a plant seems to yield up its life so gradually that it is impossible to say at any particular moment , " Now it is dead . " So far as mere appearance goes , stems and leaves that have been dead for hours , perhaps days , are deceptively alive . Dr. Bose is the first man that ever saw the death-throe of a plant , the first man who ever succeeded in fixing the precise moment when the spark of life that animates a blossom has been quenched . The experiments on death are the most fascinating , the most dramatic perhaps , that Dr. Bose performs . He attaches a leaf to the registering lever of his instrument , this time an oscillating recorder , in which the smoked-glass plate is swung by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant in an inner vessel of water , which is in turn received by an outer vessel of water ; the principle is the same as the double boiler in which housewives cook breakfast cereals . There must be no mechanical disturbances , nothing to shock the plant . He heats the outer vessel very , very carefully ? so carefully that the plant suspects nothing of its impending fate and is not in the least alarmed . The plate of the recorder oscillates rhythmically to and from the recording lever attached to the leaf . A dot is made whenever the smoked-glass plate touches the lever , and that happens automatically as the temperature rises by single degrees . The Doctor has only to count the dots in order to ascertain the temperature . The Death-Spasm of Plants As the temperature goes up , the leaf ? mimosa is again the plant experimented with ? rises and stands erect . It pulls on the recording lever ; the dotted line on the plate assumes a downward direction , an upward movement of the leaf being translated into a downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner vessel is becoming hotter and hotter . Thirty degrees , forty degrees , fifty-five degrees Centigrade , the temperature is tapped off on the plate . Down and down travels the dotted line on the oscillating plate . Then something remarkable happens . Abruptly the line shoots up . It is the death-spasm ? the last response of which the plant is capable . Sixty degrees Centigrade ( one , hundred and forty degrees Fahrenheit ) , the record reads . The Doctor tries to resuscitate the plant . He must be sure that what he has witnessed was indeed the quiver of death . He applies all the tests that his ingenuity can devise . He puts the plant in cold water and again couples the leaf with the instrument . There is no response ? nothing but a record of the water 's temperature . He heats the water just as carefully as he did before . This time there is no downwardly traveling line , not a sign of that  | sudden upward movement which spells extinction . The plant is absolutely dead . That sharp inversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing . All Plants Die at the Same Temperature IT always occurs at sixty degrees Centigrade ? this death-spasm . Dr. Bose has experimented with dozens of different species . They twitch and die at the same temperature ? all of them . Now we understand what the curious movements of leaves and flowers mean when they are scorched or scalded . It is not simply the mechanical curling and twisting that heat produces in all things . It is a genuine death-throe . The sudden paling of the passion-flower may now be interpreted as the end of life , and the quick opening and closing of a French marigold in hot water as the writhing of death . A new meaning is imparted to the variegated hues of flowers growing on the same stem ; for the stripes that crawl up on the petals of old blossoms , the colored spots that grow larger and larger on leaves and flowers , and that are so highly prized by breeders of plants , prove to be dead areas when tested . What we have admired in many a curiously tinted petal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious purple and red glow of autumn is but the hectic flush of death . But Dr. Bose has not stopped here . Your vitality and mine is a variable factor . In youth we are more resistant . As we age we succumb to killing forces more easily . When we are weary to utter exhaustion , death comes more quickly than if we are fresh . Our resisting powers are broken down . Is it thus with a plant ? It is astonishing to find how close , even here , is the resemblance between plant and animal . A young , tender sprig gives up its life like a baby . A mature specimen fights hard . Tire out a strong , healthy bean plant , ? Dr. Bose does it by electric shocks , ? and its death-spasm occurs , not at the usual sixty degrees Centigrade , but at thirty-seven degrees . What is more , the lowering of the death-point is determined by the extent of the fatigue . Poison the plant with copper sulphate , so that its vitality is lowered , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen degrees below the normal . But One Kind of Matter in the Universe ALL this work on the effect of gases , poisons , drugs , and currents on plants was inspired , be it remembered , by the belief that life is everywhere , and that there is but one kind of matter in the universe , whether it be a complex man or a simple iron ore . In these boundless regions , beginning with the inorganic , proceeding to organic life and its sentient manifestations , this Indian scientist had been seeking an underlying unity amid chaotic and bewildering diversity . He subjected all matter to questioning shocks , and discovered that there is no difference in the reply . Patiently he added fact to fact in his explorations in the realms of living and non-living , and was amazed to find dividing frontiers vanishing . At last he reached a new conception , which includes in one magnificent sweep the dust beneath our feet , the protoplasmic ooze floating on a stagnant pool , and man himself . We can understand what passed through his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was when I came upon the mute witness of these self-made records , and perceived in them one phase of a pervading unity that bears within it all things : the mote that quivers in ripples of light , the teeming life upon our earth , and the radiant suns that shine above us ? it was then that I understood for the first time a little of that message proclaimed by my ancestors on the banks of the Ganges thirty centuries ago : " They who see but one in all the changing manifestations of this universe , unto them belongs Eternal Truth ? unto none else , unto none else . ' "
