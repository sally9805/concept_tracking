txt The boss . His career . TWELFTH CHAPTER THE POLITICIANS AND THE MACHINE ( conclusion ) 112 . THE extraordinary powers , unparalleled under the regime of free institutions , which the Machine exercises , centre eventually in a single man ? the boss . What sort of man , then , is this , who is able to wield such an authority ? Let us look more closely at the personage who is the embodiment of the politicians and their works . Two principal species may be pointed out in the genus boss : the city boss and the State boss . The type is exactly the same , only the features differ : coarser in the one , they are often more refined in the other . The origin of the boss is always very humble , especially that of the city boss . This latter is a " self-made " man in the strict sense of the word . In the majority of cases , of foreign , very likely Irish , extraction , the child of parents who have recently immigrated , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , he has begun his public career in the streets of a large city as newspaper seller , street-car conductor , actor in a travelling circus , or , better still , waiter to a saloonkeeper , Irish like himself . There he was initiated into the mysteries of " paltics " by the conversations of the heelers and the ward politicians ; he learnt to fathom the recesses of the human heart , disclosed by the gen-25o // erous properties of drink ; and , having felt his vocation , he enlisted in the army of heelers , with the baton of boss in his knapsack . From a " repeater " ( a man who votes several times over under feigned names ) he quickly became head of a gang of repeaters , and then precinct leader . In the meanwhile he has , perhaps , mounted still higher on the politico-social ladder by becoming himself a saloon keeper . Or , less fortunate , he has found his means of subsistence and his social position in a sinecure which the Machine has procured for him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he constructed a small local machine ; with its aid he became a member of the city council , that promised land flowing with milk and honey in the form of contracts for public works or even of " franchises , " of the monopolies coveted by wealthy corporations . As district leader , he swallowed up the other less able district leaders and was left without a rival . A vulgar demagogue , he got the mob on his side , and , by dealing in its votes , he became the Ceasar of the Machine and of the city . This stirring and laborious career has sometimes been within an ace of being stopped by still more dramatic incidents , such as a criminal prosecution for homicide or less serious encounters with the law . However , he will perhaps have lost nothing by waiting ; as it were by chance , justice may suddenly wake up , and , like his illustrious ancestor , Tweed , he may some day forget the cares of power in the peaceful retirement of a prison . The State boss is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable career , although in certain cases his past would not bear closely looking into . // Having entered " politics " young , the future State boss has built up his fortune slowly , by the same methods as the lower boss . Working as underling for a big boss , doing his jobs in every part of the State , he has made friends with the local politicians , he has found out their strong and their weak points , and has discerned the use which he can make of each man . With the most powerful of them he has concluded offensive and defensive alliances . Strengthened by these friendships and these supports , extending over the whole State , some wholly interested , others not unmixed with personal affection , he has got himself accepted as dispenser of Federal patronage , and , after a series of lucky operations with this capital , has ended by sweeping the whole State into the sphere of his influence . This brilliant career of a man who from such a . humble start has risen to be master of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? without , as a rule , filling any official position ,  --  is , from one end to the other , the triumph of one supreme quality : skill in the management of men . With an inevitably limited stock of good things to be provided for an unlimited number of appetites , he performs the miracle of the loaves and fishes , discerning exactly the right slice and cutting off just the proper quantity to be given to each man . To some he offers the solid food of places , of money , and of pulls ; to others the unsubstantial diet of promises . He plays with wants and appetites , with credulity and vanity , as with so many counters . He is admirably equipped for this game by his mind , which is profoundly calculating , cool , incapable of yielding to the impulse of the moment , but very capable of taking sudden and bold resoluTHE // tions to meet the situation . With this uniform type of mind , which is the distinctive mark of the species , the particular temperaments vary ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amiable and even seductive , or " magnetic " boss . But the affability never goes so far as expansiveness : the boss is naturally reserved , coiled up . This Moltke of the Machine has all the less difficulty in being taciturn that he does not know the six languages in which the great German chief of the staff was silent ; the boss often does not even know his own , he can not speak or write English correctly . In fact , the education which the boss has received is generally of the poorest ; he has hardly attended the primary school . Yet owing to the resourceful intelligence and the dogged energy which distinguish the American , many a boss , and especially those who have risen to the position of State boss , ends by acquiring a certain polish which shows itself not only in his dress and his manners , but appears to fill the gaps of his early very defective education . Cultivated or without culture , the boss is , in any event , a man of superior intelligence , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very delicate appreciation of particular situations . He is incapable of grasping principles ; his ideas in politics are hard to discover : he has none , and does not need them . That is not the compass he uses ; it is the wind of circumstance and of personal issues which steers the course of the boss . He is incapable of stating his views on the problems of the day . He is neither a writer , nor a speaker , nor even a good talker ; on the stump he would cut a poor figure . The few orators // who have been discernible among the higher bosses , the senatorial bosses , even the most brilliant of these orators , such as Roscoe Conkling , were simply rhetoricians and fighters , who looked at the great questions of the day in their personal aspect , with reference to the persons who were involved in the various controversies ; they never connected their names with a legislative measure or left any other lasting trace of their activity . The opportunism of which the boss is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative ; he prefers to walk in the shadow of public opinion . Incapable of contributing to the movement of ideas , he finds it difficult to understand them , he grasps public opinion only in its crystallized state , so to speak ; its aspirations and its impulses escape him , and its revolts take him by surprise . Observing and appraising mankind in detail , by their pettinesses , the boss is not qualified to appreciate the moral forces of human nature ; a profound judge of men , he does not understand man . Ile never credits the citizen in general with virtue and intelligence , he is not aware that these qualities exist ; his skill lies in seizing on the weaknesses of men . The few moral virtues of the politician which he possesses are narrowed in their exercise in the same way ; he is devoted , up to the point of self-sacrifice , to his friends ; a man of his word , he is so as long as particular persons are concerned ; if he has promised places or favours he looks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms on the eve of the elections he snaps his fingers at them the day after . The courage and the confidence in himself which distinguish him in his acts fail him in the domain of ideas ; growing timorous all of a sudden , // he stealthily watches public opinion to see if he can venture to go ahead without suffering for it . 114 . The methods of the boss are exactly adapted to ways of his mind : he does not like discussion , the clash of ideas ; he is a man of underhand action . lie shuns the light of day ; his element is intrigue , and lie revels in it . Ile arranges everything secretly and keeps silence and makes his lieutenants keep silence until the moment comes for facing the public . But , while working in the dark , the boss does not hide himself , he wields his power quite openly . The Press is not sparing of publicity for his person , his sayings and doings ; his supposed plans are constantly commented upon . This publicity is by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were a great statesman . It must be added that the public Popularity also takes pleasure , a melodramatic pleasure , in follow ing the sayings and doings of the boss . He appears to them , according to the description of newspapers which are not in the habit of laying on the colours too thinly , as a sort of Mephistopheles and Cagliostro rolled into one , who has endless tricks up his sleeve . What is he going to bring out of it now , what is he going to do , what has he just clone ? are so many questions and hypotheses which help to break the monotony of American life . It should be admitted that this curiosity is not the only feeling which gains the boss his undeniable popularity . This man who , sprung from nothing , has reached the very top of the tree , strikes the imagination of the Americans and flatters it . They recognize in him a master spirit . He excites admiration like those conquistadores who conquered and plundered empires . Even cultivated men of high integrity can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourites of fortune , honest folk or rascals , which pervades the air of the New World . One would almost think that they are proud of the bosses . The hostile cries and the objurgations which accompany the name of the boss die away as they descend further and further into the lower strata of the community , and the name alone reaches these strata encircled with a halo of notoriety . Yet , as a general rule , the boss does not much care to put his popularity to the test of a popular vote ; he does . not often stand for elective office himself . Sometimes it is the flagrant inadequacy of his education which prevents him from filling a leading position ; but more often he would run the risk of defeat owing to his reputation of wire miller and election jobber , whereas , it he keeps behind the scenes , he can quietly pull the strings and secure the return of the men who suit him . The State boss likes to run for the Senate of the United States , for the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigue and corruption , the Senators being elected , not by universal suffrage , but by the State Legislatures , where the boss is often supreme . In any event , it is not in the public position which the boss sometimes fills that his power resides . That power is by its nature occult and irresponsible . 115 . The boss none the less derives from it con-siderable personal profit , both of a material and moral . kind . The first is the most important ; he makes money , often he makes a large fortune . For the city boss this is the main , the sole object . Cases are quoted , it is true , of bosses who have died poor ; but there are many // bosses alive and well who are very rich , who are " worth " at least $500,000 , while having no avowable source of income . Where does the money come front ? In the first place , the boss has absolute control of the party funds . Again , he receives commissions given by the great contractors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other favours . Lastly , the boss makes money out of the pulls which he has on the representatives of authority , by ensuring , in return for a share in the profits , a lucrative connect ion to business men , to lawyers . It is only fair to add that if the income of the bosses is considerable , their general expenses are so as well ; the boss has to spend a great deal to maintain his political position , to keep up the Machine . Sometimes the boss devotes his whole income to this , he does not grow rich by " politics . " The " disinterested " boss takes to " politics " from inclination ; " politics " is his passion , that is to say , not the problems of politics in the ordinary sense of the word , but the intrigues , the combinations , and the gossip of personal politics . It is this kind of politics that he indulges in . The love of power , the satisfaction felt by the autocrat who exalts and humbles men at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss . He enjoys this power behind the scenes and on the stage . The tribe of politicians worship him as a king . He holds his court even in his country residences ; crowds of office-seekers hang upon his nod there . The principal lieutenants of the boss are on intimate Relations terms with him , but in their relations there is always the more or less p erceptible tone which characterizes those between sovereign and vassal . Yet , among these vas-s // sals there are powerful ones , with whom the master has to reckon , as the King of France had to reckon with the Duke of Burgundy , the Duke of Normandy , the Count of Flanders . From this obligation not even a boss as absolute as the Tammany chief escapes ; among his district leaders are men who do not depend on the boss either for their livelihood or for their position , who engage in " politics " from taste and ambition , and who wield an indisputable personal ascendency in their districts , ? they have a crowd of vassals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he as powerful as the Republican boss of Pennsylvania , is exposed to the schemes of some of his lieutenants , haunted by the wish to " set up for themselves . " Sometimes there are open fights ; the big boss has a bout with his unruly vassals , like Louis XI . with Charles the Bold , but in the end he comes to terms with them . When he can , he quells revolts I , y the exercise of authority or by sheer corruption ; he deposes the district leader who is guilty or suspected of disloyalty ; or he ruins him in his fief , he drenches the primaries with money to prevent the rebel from " getting the delegates , " without whom the latter is powerless . To meet extraordinary expenditure , the boss blackmails the corporations , the financial companies , exactly like ? and this again is a point of resemblance with feudal manners ? the medieval king , . who extorted money from the burgesses , the traders of his good cities , to get the wherewithal for making war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public capacity . In his private circle he is often perfectly honourable ; his family life is irreproachable , he can be depended on , he is exact in // the observances of religion , he has his seat in church . This holds good , also , of the subordinate politicians . The politician , great or small , . simply puts in practice , without being aware of it perhaps , the doctrine of two moralities , the one for private , the other for public life . Within these last years there have come forward prominent politicians who employed the methods of the bosses for establishing and maintaining their ascendency , but used their power , more or less disinterestedly , for the public good . Men of character and of ideas , with wide and even lofty conceptions of public policies , they seemed to point to a new type of boss which might drive back the classic type . However , the specimens of that new type , of those white crows , are not yet numerous enough to vouchsafe a new genus . The politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be premature even to speak of a " new game " inaugurated by them in " practical politics . " The change which should be already noticed is this : the well stamped features of the boss presented to the reader are becoming in reality less striking , as if the pattern has become somewhat flattened . 116 . The use which the boss makes of his extensive and penetrating power by no means , however , affects the whole of political life . He does not try , like the . tyrants of the Greek cities or of the Italian republics , to assert his power over the polis in general . All his designs on the commonwealth amount , in fact , to running the elections as he likes , putting his followers in all the places , keeping out his opponents , protecting the first , making the second harmless , and realizing the // material profits attaching to these places and to the influence which they procure . Public policies themselves are a matter of indifference to the boss . If he " punishes his enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely in self-defence ; he never meddles with citizens who do not go out of their way to oppose him . If he is often a despot , he is so rather from necessity , as a matter of business , than from inclination . His wish is , on the contrary , to make as many friends as possible , to please everybody ; for whatever the source of his power , the material substance of it is composed of the votes of the multitude given to the candidates of the boss . A really intelligent boss is never gratuitously arrogant and despotic ; he wields his power of tyrant with moderation and kindliness . No great merit , however , attaches to this . Even if lie tried to go farther he would fall foul of the rights of the citizen , reserved by the ( ' oast lint ion . I t is of no avail for the boss to be master of the executive and the legislature , for they are not omnipotent . The American Constitution has made the fundamental rights of the man and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign protection of the courts , which can annul as unconstitional not only administrative acts , but laws themselves ; and the judiciary , taken as a whole , is not yet under the thumb of the bosses . 117 . The point which is most exposed to the designs of theMachine is the municipal administration , owing to its ample resources offering abundance of loot and being , so to speak , within arm 's reach . The finances of a city ruled by the Machine are always heavily burdened with useless and bloated expenditure . The // departments are invariably encumbered with a very considerable number of sinecures , the sole object of which is to enable the " workers " of the Machine to draw their salaries ; useful public works arc contracted for at extravagant rates ; the exploitation of the monopolies in the gift of the city is granted for nothing , or for an absurdly small consideration . After all , it often turns out that the resources of the cities which are not afflicted with a Machine are not administered much more economically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a certain extent , by a better , more responsible administration of the municipal departments , which is due to the members of the councils of these cities and their employees being more disciplined . The Machine which selects all the candidates for public office , while making them docile instruments , takes care to choose them as well as possible ; and once they are installed in their posts , it sees that they do not compromise it . Instead of being responsible to the public , they must answer to the Machine ; the responsibility is deflected , but it is genuine , and all the more so that the power of the Machine is more centralized , more personal , and more immediate . Besides this , the great mass of small employees are not dishonest ; they accept their places from the Machine to earn a humble livelihood . And when they have discharged the first duty of their office , which is to serve the Machine , when this tribute on their time , their exertions , and their conscience has been taken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal administration run by the most corrupt ? Machine ? I mean Tammany Hall ? affords striking proof of this state of things . // Of all the public departments in the large cities the most contaminated by the Machine is that of the police , whose co-operation is particularly valuable to it . The police in these cities is " full of politics . " It shields from the public the frauds committed , at the primaries and at the elections , by the followers of the Machine ; it molests the Machine 's opponents when they want to exercise their electoral rights ; it winks at the law-breaking drinking-saloons , at the gamblinghells and houses of ill fame , which pay blackmail to the Machine . But in other respects the police really does its duty , and does it , on the whole , fairly well . The other municipal departments are also infected with " politics , " but in a lesser degree . The Machine treats them as a preserve for " spoils " ? places , contracts , etc . It exploits , with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another the hospitals , sometimes even the school hoards , by putting on them , as a reward , political " workers " for whom nothing better can be found . But , however satisfactory the administration of the cities governed by a Machine may be as a whole , and however properly and conscientiously the employees may discharge the routine of their duties , the spirit which presides over the administration is always an unenlightened one , with no breadth or vitality . Nor is legislation wholly contaminated by the Machine . The State legislatures , which vote laws , at the bidding of the boss , to swell the resources of patronage or to bestow privileges or monopolies on companies 1 allied with the boss , also vote good laws ? laws of public utility . It is even easier to obtain such a law with the help of the boss . Instead of agitating and // bringing on the legislature the pressure of enlightened opinion which is often difficult to arouse , it is better to apply to the boss ; the latter will give the order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post . In these cases boss rule offers the advantages of an " enlightened despotism . " The boss exerts the same power to stop obnoxious attempts at legislation coming from individual members of the legislature , who wnrit to blackmail wealthy companies by bringing in bills directed against them . If these companies enjoy the protection , duly paid for , of the boss , he holds up his hand , and the " striker " vanishes like a schoolboy caught in the act . The boss is equally successful in blocking a good measure brought in by an independent member , that is to say , a recalcitrant one in the eyes of the boss . Thus , in the State as well as in the city , the boss acts as a disciplining force , for good as well as for evil . 118 . Wielding a power not only usurped , but also irresponsible , the boss is always liable to step out of the moderation which his character of usurper enjoins and which his means of action , as well as the barriers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , absolute power makes him lose his head sooner or later ; he becomes wilful , arrogant , and tyrannical ; he exceeds all bounds in the effrontery with which he and his men use the public resources for their own benefit . At last the public 's cup of patience runs over , a revolt breaks out , and the Machine is " smashed . " This is the fate of every Machine , as it is of every brigand to end on the scaffold . It is only a question of time . But just as the death on the Public opinion let loose . // gibbet of the bandit of Calabria or the Abruzzi does not prevent him from having a successor in the wilds which were the scene of his exploits , so the Machine which has been " smashed " is soon put together again by the same boss or by another , to meet the same fate in the end as their predecessors . It is a regime which recalls , to some extent , that which was defined by the words " a despotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolical ; free institutions enable the revolution to be carried out in an absolutely pacific manner , by the simple action of voting papers . The American people have only , according to the phrase of the stump orator , to " rise in their might and in their majesty , " and everything will come right . In reality , it is not so much in their " majesty " that the people rise as in their fury . For a long time impassive and apathetic , they start up all of a sudden in a paroxysm of wrath . The sovereign people strike without pity and without discernment , guilty and innocent will all do to make up the hecatomb which they must have . The power of public opinion , which is supposed to weigh heavily , and does so really , in the United States , on everybody and everything , reaches the politicians in the end , but it reaches them in a more or less accidental way , which excludes all regular responsibility . The authority which public opinion wields over the Machine is rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the Machine is obliged to treat public opinion are , consequently , limited to the risk which it runs of awaking the Lynch which slumbers in the breast of the public . The Machine , it is true , pays great attention to public Other checks on the Machine . // opinion , it carefully watches the state of public feeling , and in cases where it is possible to satisfy public opinion without any great sacrifice on the part of the Machine , the latter does so with alacrity . But this is not often within its power , for if it always consulted the interests of the public it would ruin its own prospects . The bosses yield only when they can not help it . But often the Machine tries its hand , in spite of this , and it is only after having been beaten that it mends its ways . Then it brings forward excellent candidates at the elections , adopts a humble , cringing attitude , practises virtue , until such time as public opinion goes to sleep again . 119 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of party loyalty , give the Machine large subscriptions to the election campaign funds , do act as a brake on the bosses when important candidatures are involved . Far more effective is the check imposed on the Machine by the Machine of the opposite party : whenever the two parties are evenly matched , a small number of good citizens can turn the scale ; the two rival Machines are in that case obliged to vie with each other in cultivating the good graces of these independent electors , by making up their tickets with names of men as respectable as the business of the Machine will allow . This intervention of the independent electors supplies a corrective to the Machine , which is daily growing more important and more efficacious . The most extensive limitations to which the power of the Machine and of the politicians is subject are to be found in the social and economic character of the // particular community . In places where the population is more homogeneous , and forms smaller sets , in which opinion has consequently more consistency and asserts itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties which it does in large cities where public spirit is smothered under the huge agglomerations of heterogeneous elements brought together promiscuously . Its proceedings do not escape the attention of the public so easily , and the Machine is from necessity more circumspect and more moderate in its desires . In places where there are no large public works to be tendered for , or important contracts to be awarded , where there are no powerful corporations with extensive interests depending on administration or legislation , in a word , where the material for plunder is not considerable , the Machine is necessarily frugal . Hence the earls of the Union least contaminated by the Machine . and the politicians are the country districts . The South , which is still largely agricultural and where big cities arc very few , does not present a very favourable field for the development of the Machine . Apart from the two largest cities , New Orleans and Louisville , the odious type of the boss is hardly met with in the South . In the West the Machine prospers more , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its misdeeds . The great hotbed of the Machine and of the bosses is still the Eastern States , which are rich and populous , and where social differentiation has made the most progress . If on the map of the United States all the parts of the country where the Machine has developed were coloured red , the eye would at once be attracted to the // right by a large blotch formed by the States of New York and Pennsylvania with a strip of the State of New Jersey on the cast , with the State of Maryland on the south , and the State of Ohio on the west , partly at least . This mass casts a faint shadow to the northeast over New England , while on the other side , to the west , the red will appear in more or less deep tints in the State of Illinois and will stain the neighbouring States , marking with scarlet points most of the large cities , such as St. Louis in Missouri and others of less importance , like Louisville in Kentucky or Minneapolis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then , after making a brief pause in the States of the Far West and leaving some patches there , it will flow toward the Pacific slope and deposit a thick layer of carmine on San Francisco ; and , finally , jumping right over to the Gulf of Mexico , it will cover New Orleans with a similar layer . A very considerable space will be left hardly coloured at all or will even exhibit the shot colour to be seen in certain fabrics : these are regions or cities where the Machine has no stable and regular existence ; rings of mercenary politicians form in them , disappear after a short time , and re-form under favourable circumstances . A good many points again on the map will appear almost white . It must not be forgotten , however , that the part of the map coloured red , while only a fraction of the whole country , contains almost a third of the population of the United States and represents at least three-fifths of its economic interests . Again , owing to the civic upheaval which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which will be enlarged upon in a subsequent chapter , the power of the Machine has weakened , and while bosses are still there , almost everywhere they carry on their trade with less disregard of decency , with more respect or rather more fear of public opinion . Slowly but certainly the Machine is undergoing a change . It puts better men in offices , it is more refined in its methods of exploiting the public , there is much less open stealing . Public opinion would no longer tolerate it as in the time of Tweed . 120 . But why is the power of the Machine , even limited and mitigated ; why should it exist at all ; why is it tolerated in the full blaze of democracy ? ; The varied materials for an answer to this question have already been disclosed to us , and it now remains to recapitulate them in a more methodical way . The first and general condition of the Machine 's existence and success is , of course , the extraordinary development of the elective regime and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly elaborate and intricate election machinery , worked by experts . But why should these experts be men of the stamp of " bosses , " and how does it come about that they are able to keep a hold on the public concern and exploit it so easily ? The most common explanation given is that the Machine disposes of a large patronage , or , again , that it lives on rich corporations , and that if it had not one or the other of these resources , or both of them , it would ( lie of inanition . This explanation is only partly true , it only deals with the material resources . Foremost among these , in fact , comes the patronage , the places in the public service of the // Union , of the States , and of the municipalities ; these places , supplemented by the hope of getting them , furnish the pay for maintaining the army of politicians who serve the Machine . Next come the principal direct receipts of the Machine ? the assessments , the contributions paid by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The contributions of private individuals , of wealthy zealots of the party , are large enough . They sink , however , into insignificance beside those of the bons by financial or industrial corporations . These latter are the great pillars of the Machine and in fact its partners . Where there is a Machine there are corporations at its back , where there is a corporation there is a Machine to serve it . Alongside of the corporations are the smaller pillars : the contractors , jobbers , and lastly the dive-keepers ? all of them bent on breaking or cheating the law with the paid assistance of the Machine . 121 . Still greater than its enormous material resources is the moral stock which the Machine disposes and which consists of the deliberate or unconscious adhesion of the various elements of the community . The Machine exists and works with their consent , and by no means in spite of them . The first of these social elements on which the Machine leans is made The up of its own servants and of its nearest adherents , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Machine element . " These people work for the Machine as they would have worked for a manufacturer , a merchant , for any one who might have employed them . They get their living in " practical politics , " quite honestly , since they are toiling // day and night . The work is rather dirty ; this may be , but there are so many trades which involve handling unpleasant things ; every trade has its processes , and " practical politics " has its own . The character of the pay , which consists of " spoils , " is not objectionable either , it is almost part of the natural order of things . When the Creator , after making the two great lights of the day and of the night , made the two great political organizations , he ordained that they should divide the public offices between them . It is therefore only fair that these offices should be given to the men who have " worked " for the party , and to them alone . By following this train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the independent members of the party who oppose the Machines as odious and contemptible ; these citizens not only prevent them from earning their living , but even try , while posing as champions of honesty , to get hold of the offices , without having " done the work " for the party ; they are therefore hypocrites , full of " humbug and cant . " At the best , they are only " doctrinaires , " " college professors , " " star gazers , " for the government without parties which they dream of is an idea as absurd as it is flagitious . ' Phis feeling of their uprightness justifies the conduct and stimulates the enthusiasm of the mercenary politicians . . In addition to this category , the Machine has on its side , in the first place , the mass of the people . The criminal and semi-criminal elements , the declasses of every kind , who swarm in the large cities , are devoted to the Machine , because it buys then- with cash or protects them against the law . // 122 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality , but wretched , having only precarious means of existence , and which swells the army of the unem-ployed , also gets assistance from the representatives the boss regime , with its costly administration of the cities , benefits only a number of humble folk . The interested philanthropy and the other attentions lavished by the politicians win them the hearts of the people . It is no use denouncing the bosses as public malefactors , laying bare the corruption of Machine rule . The people answer , " It is good enough for us . " In fact , they do not see the harm done by the politicians , but they know their urbanity and their generosity . Boss Tweed , when publicly convicted of monstrous depredations and sent to prison , lost none of the esteem and admiration in which he had been held by the lower orders of New York ; they were convinced that Tweed had fallen a victim to the nefarious designs of the rich , he who was so kind to the poor . The Machine does not relieve their material wretchedness only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Machine have a kindly word for the humblest inhabitants of their district ; they share in their joys and in their sorrows ; they find a sympathetic smile even for the halt and the maimed ; they shed a ray of human brotherhood on the most miserable of creatures . They do it automatically , in the way of business , to everybody without distinction ; but they none the less appear as ministers of the cult of fraternity in a higher degree than the priests of the churches and the professional philanthropists : they are nearer to the people , they come in friendly contact // point out that bribery is rife even in the rural districts of New England among the well-to-do farmers , descendants of the Puritans . Several foreign elements supply , taken altogether , excellent civic material , such as the Scandinavians and the Germans . Even the Jews who have escaped from the ghettos of eastern Europe promise to develop civic qualities on American soil . The upshot of the matter is that the immigrants make the task of democratic government rather more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rising generation is assimilated with remarkable rapidity . The movement started in the last few years against immigration in a country which had always welcomed with open arms the oppressed and the unsuccessful of the whole world , is not so much founded on facts as due to the calculations of the politicians who , in order to get a little popularity , trade on the spirit of vulgar nationalism and on the professional envy and jealousy which foreign competition excites in certain sections of the working community . An eminent American has summed up the whole question in the following words : " Our danger is not from the contamination of foreigners , but from the surrender of ideals upon which self-governments rest or die . " 124 . The natural guardian of these ideals ? the social class which is superior to the masses by its knowledge and its wealth ? has failed to do its duty . This class , which is called in the United States " the better element " because it is better off , leaves the public interest to its fate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations which , however , may all be referred to the eminently materialistic // spirit that animates the prosperous and wealthy classes . Meeting in one and the same exclusive preoccupation , that of " making money , " these classes measure all things by the sole criterion , " Does it pay ? " Now they find that politics " do not pay , " that it is not worth while neglecting one 's own business to attend to public affairs ; that it pays better to submit to the depredations of a Machine than to lose one 's time in fighting the bosses , at least as long as they keep within the limits of comparative moderation . Many members of the better element think themselves " too good " for politics ; it is beneath them , it is too " vulgar . " They think they have performed their civic duty when they have voted the party ticket on the day of the election ; and some even do not go so far as this . The most " patriotic " among the members of the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to make any personal exertion , to devote their time and their energies . Besides , the party fetichism which sways Blind acmen 's minds , makes many very " respectable " electors quiescence. shut their eyes to the misdeeds of the Machine ; they really believe that it is the other party which is a hotbed of corruption , that theirs is honest by virtue of its name . Others , more clear-sighted , groan inwardly , but take care not to kick against the Machine at elections , letting themselves be persuaded that the " life of the party is in danger , " and that this is not the time to pick holes in the doings of certain representatives of the Organization . The timorous conservatism which characterizes most of the members of the better element makes them apprehend unspeakable catastrophes if they should leave // the beaten track of the party . Electors of a philosophic turn of mind take their stand on the proposition that the American government is a party government , that parties can not exist without an organization , and that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They refuse to see in the boss aught but the organizer of victory for their party , and do not see in him the corrupter of the Republic . Other electors , wiser in their generation , but deterred by respect for the world 's opinion , are afraid of incurring the reproach which disqualifies a man more than anything else in American life , that of being " unpractical , " of appearing on a level with a " college professor , " capable of imagining that action can be taken in politics irrespective of one 's party . Certain electors carry their independence so for as to speak with cynical unconcern of the parties , but , when the election conies , habit reasserts itself , and they can not even make up , their minds to " scratch " the party ticket . Lastly , certain electors ? and their name is legion are in blissful ignorance of everything that goes on within their party , of all the political scandals and the misdeeds of the politicians . They do not read the newpapers ; they pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , launched by the Press against the Machines and the bosses , for the Press has , through its own fault , lost credit with the public . Each of these electors of the better element reasoning in his own way , or not reasoning at all , ends by voting for the " yellow dog " run by the Machine . 725 . An important section of that class does the same simply from self-interest . It is no longer the unconscious or half-conscious complicity of humble electors // anxious about their daily bread ; it is the cool calculation of men who want things which the Machine is able to give . With the help of the Machine they can succeed better in business , as well as in the professions , and obtain honours , ? honours which in the levelled society of the United States oiler an irresistible attraction to a number of men . One has no idea how many there are who would like " to be something , " to hold a public office , even for a short time , sometimes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone . Members of the bar cultivate the friendship of the bosses , do not scruple to join Tammany I fall , with a view to some position or other , ? corporation counsel , prosecuting attorney , judge , ? a position which will make the holder of it known to the public and extend his connection in case he is obliged to return to his profession . Men who are perfectly respectable and intelligent , but who have cast a longing glance on a public position , look at the Machine with friendly eyes : they are thinking of the " nomination . " The representatives of the corporations docilely pay their tribute as " price of the peace , " holding that their first duty is to think of the interests of their share-holders . Those who are not restrained by what they consider their- duty or their interest acquiesce without a struggle or a protest from simple habit or from apathy . The sort of prescription by which the regime of the Machine thus benefits has recently only been seriously broken in the civic upheaval referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is one of the essential traits of the American character , when confronted with the disorders caused by the Machine // in political life , simply says , " It will right itself , " or , again , " With Americans the thing rights itself . " It is not even shaken by the spectacle of the material ravages inflicted by the plundering politicians , but replies , " We can stand it ; you can not ruin this country . " As for the misdeeds of the Machine , judged from the moral standpoint , there is no need either to make a fuss ; they are part and parcel of the infirmities of human nature ; men are not angels ; " it is human nature . " ' Or , better still , a good many citizens , who are only too well informed , deliberately shut their eyes and stop their ears , ? they deny the facts . One would think that , weary of the ever-present spectacle of bosses , they had made up their minds , on waking one fine morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say to themselves that it is merely a delusion which has taken in sour-minded individuals or credulous foreigners . Lastly , when these citizens who assume that they know better are closely pressed and obliged to admit that the bosses are not altogether mythical beings , they declare that bossism is the inevitable outcome of all government , that without the boss there would be chaos . Hcre we have the clinching argument , which expresses chine sup- the real view of the members of the better element ; the boss governs in their place , he relieves them of the tedious duty of governing themselves , enables them to attend to their own affairs . And here again is the true explanation of the success of the Machine : it is a government . It possesses most of the attributes of a government in a high degree , except legitimacy of origin and honesty of motive ; its staff , the " leaders " and the " workers , " are recruited by natural selection and not by a formal process ; they are representative of the great mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , above all , united among themselves by the closest ties of social cohesion , by feelings of mutual attachment and feudal loyalty toward the chiefs ; individual responsibility and personal merit are the only principles which govern their relations ; firmness , energy , and audacity characterize all their acts . These virtues are exactly those which are wanting to society at large , disintegrated , split up into sets , inert , and cowardly . These vital principles of government ? absence of formalism , individual responsibility , and personal merit ? are exactly the contrary of those which society submits to from the Machine itself , like an exoteric doctrine which , in the old days , made the vulgar an easy prey of the astute holders of the esoteric doctrine . 126 . It is a government , but not that of the people by the people , not that which has been provided by the constitution . If not of the people , then whose government is it ? Within these last years , which have witnessed a popular outburst against the money power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of special interests , it is a commercial oligarchy which owns the country . This assertion , this outcry is far from being unfounded , though as a // comprehensive definition of existing conditions it would be too sweeping . While analyzing the ways and means of the Machine , we have noticed the financial interests to which it is allied , which it is serving . They are not the only special , and at the same time corrupt or even criminal , interests which walk in the rear or in the front of the Machine , but they are certainly the most prominent , the most conspicuous and the most demoralizing . They are not bent on governing the country , ? that is not their prime purpose , ? but to achieve their greedy ends they lay hands systematically on all the departments of government . The similarity of the aims of the several moneyed interests and the natural identity of their methods bring about a co-operation among them which spreads like a cobweb over the whole area of government , so that government comes under their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest market for all the corrupt forces in the community , and the latter are spontaneously drawn to them while the honest elements are delivered to them by the party . So far as this situation obtains , the perspective of the extra-constitutional government which we have traced . would undergo a slight change : at the apex of that government would no longer figure the boss or the political ring but big business . The bosses would appear at a somewhat lower grade as agents and purveyors of the special interests , and that function they would share with other middlemen trading in public power , such as the lobby , the special combines of corrupt legislators or aldermen with the central committees of the dominant party if not of both parties at their back . THE POLITICIANS AND THE MACHINE 28I This sort of political trust headed by big business may have obtained , within the last decade or so , a rather wide extension , but it has not ousted the retail business of political corruption , carried on by local rings and Machines . Their methods may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not resort to the crude methods of spoilsmen ; by a sheer concentration of corrupt forces it may achieve its objects in a gentle way ; without robbing the public exchequer , it creates vast resources of enrichment for the special interests by spurious legislation or by evasion of existing laws with the connivance of their constitutional guardians . The bosses and Machines working with the old plant may come nearer to the traditional Tammany methods . The actual government in either case does not dwell where the constitution has placed it . THIRTEENTH CHAPTER THE EXTRA-CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IN THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLIES 127 . PARTY organization , having produced the political conditions analyzed above , reaches its climax in the very seat of legislative power with the legislative caucus . Wiping out the interval of time , it overtakes that old institution and sets the crowning seal on the extraconstitutional government brought about by the new conditions . The reader will remember that already in the days of the Federalists several members of Congress , and especially senators belonging to that party , were in the habit of holding meetings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pending in Congress , and that the decisions of those confabulations , termed by the familiar name of caucus , were considered as in honour binding the minority . These caucuses began to meet as early as the first session of the fifth Congress , perhaps even in the first session of the third Congress . The practice started by the Federalists , though violently denounced in the opposition Press , was followed.by the Republicans ( Democrats ) . A contemporary refers to it as follows : " During the session of Congress ( the 8th ) there was far less free and independent discussion on the measures proposed by the friends of the Administration 282 // than was previously practised in both branches of the national legislature . It appeared that on the most important subjects the course adopted by the majority was the effect of caucus arrangement , or in other words was previously agreed upon at meetings of the Democratic members held in private . Thus the legislation has been constantly swayed by party feelings an ( I pledges rather than according to sound reason or personal conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are aware , the nomination of candidates for the Presidency and the Vice-Presidency , and performed that function till democratic feeling which burst all over the country , forced the caucus to give it up . The popular tempest did not , however , sweep away the institution of the caucus , and it continued to determine behind closed doors the public action of Congress when a party measure was hanging in the balance . When the slavery question became so acute as to tear the parties asunder , the caucus could no longer assert itself ; for the dissentients , too , there was then a " higher law . " After the Civil War , with the advent of a strong and masterful party , the Republican party , the caucus returned to power . In the absence in Congress of a regular leadership , such as provided by English parliamentary conditions , the caucus , aiming at harmonizing the several elements of the party and securing concerted action , answered a real political need . But that secret conclave , working not in the daylight of publicity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No less prominent a member of the party than Senator Charles Sumner was made to feel its rod of iron . Smarting under the restrictions imposed by the // caucus , Sumner raised in the Senate a debate ( in July , 1867 ) on the obligations of a party caucus . He protested against " making the caucus not merely a sacred but a sacrosanct pact by which every one at the meeting is solemnly bound . . . . We are under obligations here to discharge our duties as senators . We can not in advance tie our hands . . . . You violate the national constitution . " In a later debate , in December , 1871 , Sumner ( who in the meantime had been deposed by the decree of the caucus from the chairmanship of the committee on foreign relations ) treated the senatorial caucus as only a " convenience " and denied the binding force of its decisions . About thirty-five years later , as recently as in 1906 , a similar debate was raised in the Senate against the Democratic caucus , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of the spirit and intent of the Constitution of the United States and of the rights of a State to equal representation in the Senate , as a senator , under tine caucus rule , votes not as a senator from his own State , but as a senator from the other States , whose senators define for him his duty . 128 . ' Phis new fight against the caucus in Congress , after so long a lapse of time since the great debate raised by Charles Sumner , shows that the caucus is still alive . Indeed , it has become entrenched in American political habits and ideas . And it is not only as a consultative instrument for bringing together men pursuing common aims , for comparing notes , for eliciting the views prevailing among them on pending questions , and by that very fact helping to harmonize their divergencies ? all most legitimate objects . The authority of // the caucus is not one of opinion , but of power , derived from the obligations towards party . It is above individual convictions and above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the bond of party is supposed to form , is too high to bow to either ; and conformity to its standards , as expressed by regularity , is a sure enough guide , and the only one . Vouched for by this test , that communion involves both duties and privileges . To perform its command is not only a duty but a privilege granted only to strict believers . Thus , recently a Republican congressman , elected in the State of New York against the regular party candidate , was denied admission to the Republican caucus in the House of Representatives , and as he could not participate in the Democratic caucus , he wandered like a poor ghost , until after one session the Republican caucus considered that his penance had been sufficient . Although the power of the caucus has remained unabated as of old , its opportunities have greatly diminished since the period following the Civil War . It proved a very inadequate substitute for constitutional leadership in the growing complexity of political and economic conditions , while the frittering away of the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty ) made more manifest the necessity for a concentrated authority . The centralizing process , which at the same time was going on in the life of the party Organization outside Congress and culminated in bossism , reached the Federal Capitol in the most direct way . The bosses , as we know , thronged Congress , and they brought with them not only their methods but also the authority they wielded over the local party // organizations which make and unmake senators and congressmen . A small inner circle was formed in each House of Congress which ruled the party as an ordinary boss rules his machine . In the House of Representatives , especially , that autocracy has taken formal shape in the extraordinary powers of the Speaker surrounded by the inner circle of bosses , by the " organization " as it is called . The deliberative character of the House has been almost obliterated , all legislative business and influence have fallen into the hands of the committees , and the committees were appointed by the Speaker . The chairmen of the most important committees together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Then , there was no longer the necessity , or the same necessity as before , for setting in motion the caucus in order to make the members fall into line ; the word of command of the " organization " sufficed . There was nothing for members but to obey , ? they were placed between the devil and the deep sea . The kicker was facing political annihilation in Congress , and consequently in his home district . He would get from the Speaker and the 1 louse " organization " no appointment on a committee which had anything to do ; he would be relegated to the committee on acoustics or on a similar subject , where he could not make the slightest impression ; his bills would he pigeon-holed in the committees ; he would not even he recognized by the Speaker on the floor . // People in his district would soon realize the direful fact that he was not a " regular , " and the local Machine would grasp it still quicker ; it might even get word from Washington about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rouse " organization , " but at the next election another man would get the scat. 129 . The only privilege of the bull : of the members of the party is to choose their King Log , and that is done So the chief , if not the exclusive , function of the caucus is now to deliver a carte blanche to the masters of the House . For that purpose at the beginning of each session a caucus is held to nominate the Speaker ; and to confirm the old rules of the House of Representatives . When there is discontent muttering against the ruling oligarchy and on some important occasion even mutiny is feared , a meeting of the caucus is resorted to , not so much to smooth the differences of opinion as to coerce the individual members into submission . Once a member has " gone into caucus , " he must abide by the decision of the majority or become a bolter , an " . insurgent , " as the recent expression goes . That happens once in a while . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , as a congressman pathetically explained it to the author . ' As many a member would therefore in the United States Senate ; // be unwilling to " go into caucus , " the oligarchy convenes sometimes instead of a " caucus " a " conference , " which latter is supposed not to be binding . The difference is perhaps rather theoretical . In any case the conference , and the caucus too , are used by the oligarchy as a means of reconnoitring . To be sure of obedience , it must learn the temper of the House , gauge the relative strength of different opinions , exactly as the city boss or the State boss is watching public opinion to know how far he may venture . In the Senate party divisions are somewhat looser , the position of the individual senator is much more exalted than that of a congressman , and the mutual relations stamped by the " senatorial courtesy " are anything but hierarchical . Again discussion is not stifled in the Senate by the rules as in the House . For these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come but so saliently as in the ! louse . But in the Senate , too , there are the same extra-constitutional agencies as in the House , which work with the same effect . The caucuses , which are supposed to gather all the members of the party on a footing of equality , are more frequently convened than in the House , but their decisions are as binding on the individual senators with regard to measures which are declared party measures . The parties have in the Senate , too , their oligarchy formed into what is called familiarly the steering committee and formally // the committee on order of business . This committee is chosen by the caucus . The official committees of the Senate are practically chosen as well by the caucus . ' The decisions of the caucus in the Senate and in the House of Representatives , while enacted by moral coercion , are not necessarily bad in themselves . They may be often sound and helpful for carrying on legislation . But they are as helpful for special interests getting hold of legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind its closed doors may easily work for them and do so . 130 . In the State legislatures also the party caucus has long existed as a regular institution , and its vicissi tudes have there been exactly the same as in Congress . The lower character of the State assemblies , the corruption which has so often been rampant in many of them , has only brought out in a more lurid light the abuses to which the working of that party engine is liable . The caucuses are now much less frequent in the State legislatures . One reason for this is that there is not much partisanship in these assemblies . The traditional party divisions modelled on those which obtain in Con- U // congress are here more of a formal character ; most measures are adopted unanimously , very few matters are made party measures . Secondly , the infrequency of legislative caucuses is due , as in Congress , to the centralization of party management . In the State assemblies the command of the boss or of the ruling oligarchy is not less , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very great majority of cases the putting into motion of the machinery of a caucus . The Speaker and the House " organization " in the State assemblies are just as powerful in deciding the fate of a bill , and not less high-handed in the use of their power ; the orders of the steering committee are as much obeyed in a State Capitol as in Washington . The complaint of the well-intentioned members of the party is that there is no caucus called , as a caucus means , after all , discussion . Lastly , in Machine-ridden States the organizations of the rival parties very often work in harmony ; there is a collusion between them beginning in the primaries and ending in the legislature . The boss or the House " organization " need not resort to a caucus to repress the opposition of the honest . members of their party , they will get enough corrupt members on the other side to make up a majority for their crooked measures . The party caucus in the State legislatures is usually convened for the selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , and of the United States senators . The decision of the caucus of the dominant party is equivalent to election by the Legislature . All efforts and influences are therefore brought to bear not on the assembly but on the caucus . The contest is frequently a very hot one , and the methods used in such // cases are not of the purest . The " lobby , " the agents of the corporations , are most active in getting a Speaker who will appoint committees favourable to their special interests . Pledges may he required and given , with the result that the committees are packed in advance and the course of legislation is determined beforehand . It happens , but in very rare instances , that a dissenting minority bolts the caucus and votes against its nominees in the legislative chamber . The latter can get no majority , ballot follows ballot , and there is a deadlock . Sometimes the bolters succeed in tiring out the majority of their party , who are forced to give up their candidates ; sometimes they unite with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while caucuses are convened on measures . Very few are the cases when members do not answer the call . As a rule they " go into caucus , " but sometimes , so as not to be bound by a decision which they disapprove , they leave before that decision is taken : they " walk out of the caucus . " The real discussion , the real fight on the controversial measures , is in the caucus ; the greatest speeches are made there . The proceedings in the legislative chamber are perfunctory . The bolting of the caucus occurs on measures just as on nominees for offices filled by the legislature , ? in many a State Assembly there come out from time to time " insurgents . " The bolters are sometimes high-minded men , and sometimes they are as bad as the Machine men against whom they revolt . When all is said , the range of influence of the caucus is not very wide now either in Congress or in the legislatures . But even with its limitations it remains // the highest expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its most salient features are here gathered within a small compass . Party discipline is reduced ad absurdum : a man is in conscience bound to vote against his convictions ; regularity enjoins him to deviate from the path of duty ; he is freed from responsibility for action he can not justify . Majority rule , which is the pretence and the vindication of the caucus , is reduced to minority rule ; not only is the minority of the party crushed out , but the majority of the legislative body is deprived of its will and its power . A corrupt minority may dictate laws . Freedom of speech is as much annihilated as freedom of vote , and legislation by discussion under the eye of the public is replaced by secret conclaves . Irresponsible bodies themselves , they free and shelter from all responsibility the representatives of the people ; the most scandalous vote finds a ready excuse : " it was a caucus measure , " they could not help it . Cowardly and servile to the behests of the party chieftains , these legislators may defy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to do so by acquiescing in the false assumption of the sacredness of the caucus decision . While it shuts out publicity and responsibility , the caucus opens wide the gates for sinister influences and for corruption . The greedy corporations , the special interests all bent on getting privileges for themselves , on plundering the public under cover of the law made for their benefit , have only to stretch out their hands . Concentrating these efforts on a limited number of members , they get hold of the caucus , and this latter delivers them the legislature , which again sells them out the interest of the public . // Thus the constitutional government has its power transferred to and prostituted by the extra-constitutional body which has been allowed to fester in its bosom . It does not matter much that the role of the caucus has been largely taken up by the I louse " organization " or the boss : they are but two reverses of the same medal ; one has an individual face stamped on it , the other one bears a general imprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American democracy be wedded to political conditions such as those described ; is there no way . out of them ? A number of good citizens , for more than thirty years , have not despaired and still do not despair of finding one . In fact this period , which has been marked in the highest degree by political corruption , has also witnessed manifold attempts , differing widely in scope , to lift the American democracy out of the condition to which Machine rule and the encroachments of business have reduced it . To conclude our enquiry we will now review these efforts . Begun soon after the Civil War , they were brought about by the corruption of the party in power , the Republicans , whose mercenary elements supported by party discipline shamelessly exploited the public interest , and under whose auspices monopolies were established for the benefit of large industrial and financial concerns . The movement of revolt , therefore , assumed a double aspect ? economic and political . The economic agita tion broke out both in the primitive regions of the - West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary tariffs of the railroads , and in the East , where it was directed against the excesses of Protection which dated from the Civil War . The farmers ' 294 // movement created a hotbed of social discontent in the West , which became a permanent menace to the political stability embodied in the traditional parties . The ; anti-Protectionist movement took the form mainly of a propaganda of free trade ideas , and became in its turn a centre for free political thought , which attracted prominent men and independent minds from both parties , and constituted a training school for the greater part of the staff that was to lead , ( luring the next quarter of the century , all the campaigns for reform and liberty . The first great uprising , however , occurred on occasion of the presidential election of 1872 . The President in office , General Grant , ? who , in spite of himself , became the embodiment of the regime of party despotism and party corruption , built up on the artificially perpetuated antagonism between the North and the " rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prospect of seeing this regime obtain a new lease of power roused the indignation of several eminent members of the Republican party . At the head of the movement was a naturalized German , Carl Schurz . When almost a stripling he took a part , and a romantic one , in the revolutionary events of 1848 in Germany . Having escaped from prison , he arrived , after a few halts , in the United States . Bred on the generous diet of the sentiments which inspired the men of 1848 , Schurz married his exuberant young life to that of the American democracy . In a comparatively short time he became a figure in the political world , a diplomatist , a general in the army of the North during the Civil War , a senator , a remarkable orator , // a brilliant writer . Having risen in the Republican party , and with it , he now took up arms against it to serve the cause of the American democracy ; and from that time onwards he will always be found in the forefront of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 132 . The dissentient Republicans , called Liberal Republicans , decided to put up against Grant an independent candidate . To choose such , nothing better was hit upon than to summon a national convention , in accordance with established custom . The convention met at Cincinnati in 1872 . The professional politicians were there in force , but the majority of the convention were animated with pure sentiments . However , the intrigues and the manoeuvres , to which national conventions so easily fall a victim , got the better of that assembly . It was not the most distinguished candidate who was nominated , but a surprise candidate , I-brace Greeley . A remarkable journalist , a man of great moral enthusiasm , but with a judgment far from unerring , without experience as a statesman , a notably eccentric man , he could not be taken seriously as future chief of the State . An out-and-out Protectionist , he had to rely mainly on the support of adherents of free trade . With such a standard-hearer the movement of the Independents was undoubtedly doomed to failure . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant remained master of the White House . The very heated election campaign only brought out more strongly the political and moral discrepancy between the system of stereotyped parties and the actual // needs of the day . The Liberal Republicans were " branded as apostates ' from their anti-slavery faith by the regular Republicans ; but slavery , replied the dissentients , had perished for ever . " . . . " ' They were called rebels , but the war had been over seven years and a half . " . . . " It was charged that they changed sides in politics ; but the sides themselves had been changed by events and the substitution of new issues for the old . " The alliance of the Liberal Republicans and the Democrats , concluded under these circumstances , set up against the malignant attitude of the Republicans not only a moral example , but a new method of political action . This method lifted reality above convention , and instead of keeping men rooted in the disagreements and the animosities of the past , brought them together or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations . Co-operation for a political object between men who had been deeply divided on another question was so novel a thing that the Liberal Republicans were astonished and touched to " discover that the men whom they had been denouncing with such hot indignation for so many years were , after all , very much like other people . " 133 . Discouraged by the miserable failure of the - movement of 1872 , the independent Republicans changed their tactics . Their number increased , owing to the scandals of Grant 's second administration , but they gave up the plan of forming a " third party , " an independent party . They thought it wiser and more effective to play a see-saw game between the two parties , joining forces with whichever should bring forward better candidates and better measures . Having stepped aside at the presidential election of 1876 , because the candidates adopted by the national conventions of the parties , Hayes and Tilden , both appeared to be decent candidates , the Independents re-entered on the scene to check the candidature of Grant for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1880 . This candidature , contrary to the precedent created by Washington , which did not allow the same man to occupy the Presidency for more than two terms , was contrived by a few senatorial bosses . It not only threatened the country with a return of the political corruption which had marked the general 's two administrations , but was an audacious attempt by the Machine to lay hands on the national government ; the Machine stepped out of the local sphere , which had been till then the theatre of its operations . Owing to the rivalries of the leaders , Grant was defeated at the convention , as was also his principal rival among the " politicians , " J. G. Blaine , by a " dark horse " ? Garfield . The Independents were no longer under the necessity of following up their warlike intentions . 134 . But four years later , in 1884 , this necessity presented itself . J. G. Blaine , who had long been lying in wait for the Presidency , appeared to have it in his grasp this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican politician . But his political integrity was very questionable ; he was repeatedly accused , without being able to clear himself , of having used his official positions for his personal gain . The Republican National Convention paid no heed to that , and nominated him by a large majority . The next day the Independents proclaimed themselves in a state // of revolt . The investiture conferred on Blaine by the National Convention made it the duty of every follower of the party to vote for him unconditionally . Is party obligation superior to the moral obligation of every citizen to keep an unworthy man out of power ? Must the individual conscience surrender to the formal decision of this or that meeting ? Such was the sphere into which the Independents lifted the discussion . They proclaimed the " divine right of bolting , " declared themselves ready to vote for the Democratic candidate if the person nominated for this purpose was an honourable man . When the Democratic National Convention adopted the candidature of a man who had earned the hostility of professional politicians , Grover Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis , not in order to become an appendage of the Democratic party , but solely for the particular occasion , in order to ensure the best choice of the future chief of the State . The campaign was a remarkably vigorous one , in spite of the extremely unfavourable conditions under which the Independents had to fight . They had no local organization ; they were attacked with violence , reviled , and derided . A contemptuous nickname was fastened on them , that of " Mugwumps . " The word , which was taken from the language of the Indians , had a great success , like that other word of the same language ? " caucus , " but a success of a more elevated kind . The word " mugwump , " which meant in the language of the Indians a chief , a superior man , was applied to the Independents in ridicule of the moral superiority which they assumed . But soon the Independents consented to be called by this name , and it passed // into political language to denote a citizen who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party is not an end but only a means , who preserves the liberty of his mind and of his conscience in his political conduct . There was a regular revival of the spirit which in the old days had led the great abolitionist fight . Young men burning with enthusiasm became missionaries , going out into the highways to win souls . The purely moral plane on which the Mugwumps placed the contest for the Presidency , attracted the support of the clergy . Schurz was indefatigable , exerting his powerful eloquence in city after city , in State after State . The day of battle arrived , and Cleveland was elected President . This result , obtained with the aid of the Mugwumps , was highly significant and pregnant with consequences ; it affirmed that the obligations of morality are as indefeasible in political life as in private life ; it proclaimed that the conscience of the elector and his private judgment can not be fettered by ties of party ; it naturalized the Mugwump , gave him citizenship in American political life , with the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Mugwumps was followed twelve years later by a still more formidable bolt , which took place , on this occasion , at the expense of the Democratic party when the Democratic organization thought it shrewd to adopt the free silver idea . The more cultivated and wealthier section of the Democratic party refused to follow , frightened by the prospect of the financial catastrophe which the establishment of a depreciated currency might entail , and by the revolutionary tendencies of certain elements allied with the THE STRUGGLES FOR EMANCIPATION 30I Silverites . The number of the secessionists was very considerable ; never had such a bolt been seen before . While often actuated by personal or class considerations , the " gold Democrats , " as the secessionists were called , were obliged to invoke the general idea of the independence of the elector 's conscience . And never before had this idea been so complacently expounded and so widely accepted , even by these at whose expense the bolt was carried out . It was possible to quote the declaration of Mr. Bryan himself , made only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rob me of my convictions , nor can any party organization drive me to conspire against the prosperity and liberty of my country . . . . A man 's duty to his country is higher than his duty to his party . " The person of the candidate who , through a combination of circumstances , happened unexpectedly to represent the cause of the gold standard , ? McKinley , the Protectionist champion , ? inspired the Gold Democrats with but little enthusiasm ; but they forgot , most of them , their differences of opinion with him on questions other than that of the currency , and thanks to their support he was elected . He was elected , not because he was McKinley , but in spite of his being McKinley . The Republicans did not triumph as Republicans opposed to Democrats . The victory was not that of a man or of a party . For the first time , at least since the controversy on slavery , the contest was fought on a special , clearly defined issue . At the same time , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their memories and traditions , their sympathies and antipathies , but between two solutions of a definite problem , called for and inaugurated a new mode of action , in the form of special organizations grouping the combatants on the exclusive basis of the particular problem in dispute . To defend the cause of the gold standard a " Sound Money League " was founded , with numerous ramifications in the country , which brought together for common action all the opponents of the free coinage of silver , irrespective of their views on other political questions . This league contributed greatly to the defeat of the Silverites by its vigorous oratorical campaign in which veteran Mugwumps like Schurz , orthodox Republicans and lifelong Democrats fought side by side . Soon afterwards , when , in consequence of the war with Spain , the country was agitated by the problem of " Imperialism , " the policy of territorial conquests in which the Republic was becoming entangled , the opposition to this policy took shape in an " Anti-Imperialist League . " This free organization brought together men who the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , Silverites and adherents of gold , Republicans who had never deserted their party and Independents . 136 . Party regularity beaten down inside the parties , by the bolts to which political issues had led , and by the combinations formed by members of various parties on single issues , was also undermined by the independent parties or the " third parties , " which we have already seen on the political stage in the guise of the party of " Liberal Republicans . " The other " third parties " were , for the most part , formed in opposition to the existing economic regime , they were the expression // of the social discontent which arose after the Civil War , especially in the agricultural West , and which I have briefly referred to at the beginning of this chapter . The pursuit of economic panaceas gave birth , in this way , to a whole series of new parties which , after an ephemeral existence , disappeared to revive shortly cinder another name and promote more or less analogous or kindred objects . The most considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Populists , " a semiSocialist party developed in the last decade of the nineteenth century . The advent of these independent parties did not fail to throw the ranks of the old parties into confusion by detaching from them a good number of adherents , and by introducing fresh elements of uncertainty into their existence . The cause of the emancipation of the elector 's political conscience benefited thereby in consequence , but in an indirect or negative way and to a limited extent . Most of the new parties had but a local existence . Those of them which attained the rank of a national party , such as the Populists , and succeeded in winning seats in Congress , nay , even in the Senate of the United States , owed their success to the alliances which they made with the old parties whom they denounced , in one place with the Republican party , in another with the Democratic party , joining forces in each case with the party in a minority against the party in power . This being so , the dissolvent action which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutralized . The utopian character of the favourite remedies of the new parties , or of certain of their remedies , has , in its turn , limited the dissolvent action of these parties . // It has even brought discredit on " third parties " in general , and has helped to popularize the idea that a " third party " is always utopian , and that a man of good sense joins one or other of the regular parties . This discredit brought on " third parties " has not been removed by the oldest of them , the Prohibition party , which aims at the prohibition , by law , of the manufacture and sale of spirituous drinks . It rose against the old parties whose organizations protected the saloon-keepers in return for electoral services received from them , and purposed to capture power in order to carry the much-needed reform . From 1872 onwards the Prohibitionists ran candidates for the Presidency and the Vice-Presidency of the Republic , with a modest but increasing success . The adhesions to the Prohibitionist cause were partly due to the concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great extent to the disgust with the old parties which was spreading among honest people . But since the presidential election of 1896 the Prohibitionist vote has been going down.The cause of prohibition on the contrary makes very great progress , and in the last few years its champions have succeeded in getting anti-liquor legislation enacted in most of the States , especially in the South . This result has been largely secured by a non-partisan organization , the Anti-Saloon League . The latest third party of real importance is the Socialist party , which polled at the presidential election of 1904 408,000 votes , and at the election of 1908 , about 424,000 votes . 137 . The sphere of local politics , that of the States , was much more frequently the scene of resistance to // party discipline and Machine rule ; but this resistance had less significance , because more often than not it was confused with the rivalries of the national parties . and the local quarrels of the " ins " and the " outs . " Even when sincere , the attempts at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare of the party in the sphere of national politics ; that anxiety soon revived party passion and brought the dissentients back into the fold . The separation between municipal affairs and the interests of national politics was somewhat more easy to establish in the public mind . The contests , therefore , with the Machine in the municipal field , could more easily influence electoral manners . In this respect , certain revolts against the Machine in the large cities marked epochs in American political methods for the same reason as did the national movements which we have just been considering . The first of these municipal risings was brought about in 1871 , at New York , by the misdeeds of the famous Tweed Ring . Public-spirited men with no Ring . formal mandate , without the hall-mark of a caucus or of a party convention , volunteered to lead the assault against corruption . They formed themselves into a committee , which became famous under the name of the " Committee of Seventy , " and included men of different professions and political opinions , ? lawyers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergymen . The Committee instituted an enquiry into the abuses denounced by the Press , proved its case , and brought the members of the Ring to justice . Then it carried the next election , by making the issue turn // solely on the question of honest government . The Ring was dislodged , the abuses were partly corrected , but the attempt to set up a municipal government free from party taint failed . Soon afterwards , the good citizens having relapsed into political lethargy , the city of New York , as we are already aware , found itself once more under the sway of Tammany Hall . Nevertheless , the " Committee of Seventy , " which soon disappeared , had not lived in vain ; even before the struggles with party tyranny had begun in the sphere of national politics , it had , in some measure , laid down the new principles of public action , which were about to make laborious progress , at one time in the field of national struggles , at another in that of local contests . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any popular mandate , broke the prescription established in favour of the democratic formalism which had converted the evolution of the leadership into a mechanical process . The precedent was created , and from that time onward similar " self-appointed committees " became tolerably common in the struggles with political corruption . Again , the Committee of Seventy outlined a new base of operations , consisting not of the stereotyped organization of an existing party , but of a free combination of men without distinction of party effected for a definite object . The struggles against party corruption and tyranny were to be crowned with success , at least with moral success , in the precise degree to which use was made of these new methods of civic liberty and duty . 138 . The most celebrated municipal Ring next to that of Tammany , the Gas Ring of Philadelphia , was // overthrown by the same means as Tweed 's clique . But here too the effect was not lasting . The civic apathy of some and the sordid egoism of others reas serted themselves . The candidates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reform movement after the fashion of the " Committee of Seventy " in New York ) , when elected , often betraved it and went over to the regulars , who , they foresaw , had more staying qualities . The people became restive , and refused their support to what jarred on their con servative ideas and what they were pleased to call the dictation of an autocratic , self-constituted body . The cry was raised , " Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ? " However , no more appropriate method was discovered for making war on the Machine ; and whenever in a city the good citizens , weary of boss rule , organized a rising , recourse was had to a " committee of one hundred " or " of two hundred . " New York , which had started this kind of committee in 1871 , itself felt the need , more than twenty years later , of calling in a new " Committee of Seventy " to fight the corruption of Tammany Hall . The victory over Tammany was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of political organizations which were the rivals of Tammany , it allowed Regulars. them to claim and to get for their men places in the municipal administration , to the great prejudice of good government . This case was not unique . All the movements described by the epithet of independent paid their tribute to party influence . It was all very well applying to them the title of " citizens ' movements " and giving the name of " citizens ' tickets " to // their lists of candidates , as opposed to the Machine slates . To succeed , the Independents courted or accepted the alliance of a regular party . Such alliances , when victorious , helped the cause of good government , first of all , by the proof which was afforded that the Machine was not invincible : the spell protecting it was broken . Moreover , a purification , at all events a partial and temporary one , of the government was obtained . But the Independents , having agreed to " fight the devil with fire , " were obliged to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of the spoils system . 139 . After the city of New York , which had been independent rescued , in 1894 , from the power of Tammany , had experienced a few years of the new regime , the Independent , ' thought that the city was ripe for a genuine tin ancipation movement as regards the parties and the Machines . At the municipal election of 1897 they organized themselves into a " Citizens ' Union " and fought a battle which riveted the attention of the whole country and , it may be added , of the civilized world . Its platform boldly proclaimed the principle of nonpartisanship and put forward an exclusively municipal programme : " The Citizens ' Union is by no means opposed to the national parties ; it asks no citizen to abandon his party . The Union merely demands that our city officers shall no longer be chosen because they are ready and able to promote the aims and ambitions of one or the other of the national parties . In national elections we must have national issues , but in city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence the Union refused to enter into negotiations // with any party organization even opposed to Tam- Both Low 's many Hall , and itself selected , in perfect independence , as candidate for the post of mayor , AI r . Seth Low , who had a brilliant municipal record as a reforming exmayor of Brooklyn . To ascertain the reception which Mr. Low 's candidature would meet with among the general body of the electors , the Citizens ' Union asked for the signatures of all those who approved of it . In a short time it collected more than one hundred thou sand signatures from men of every political party and of every rank in life . This direct appeal to the people , for the choice of a candidate , over the head of all the regular organizations , and this popular investiture which ignored party distinctions , was a veritable revolution in American political methods . If it were to become the rule , then the occupation of the Machines would be gone . The prospect of the defeat of Tammany was small consolation to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican Organization preferred to deliver Greater New York into the hands of Tammany . It put forward a third candidate , an orthodox Republican , intended to attract the votes of all the " good " Republicans and prevent them from going over to Mr. Low . This strategy achieved its end . Out of close on 500,000 votes recorded at the poll , Mr. Low obtained nearly 150,000 , the Republican candidate over 100,000 , and the Tammany candidate nearly 230,000 . One hundred and fifty thousand votes , deliberately given to a candidate opposed to the bosses , at the first trial of non-partisanship in municipal government , in a city as little capable of displaying public spirit as the city of New York , was undoubtedly a success . // 140 . This result showed that the struggle undertaken against the Machine was not a hopeless one , but it also proved ? for the hundredth time , it is true , or for acting the thousandth ? that it was not by sudden attacks culminating in a furious assault that the enemy could be overcome . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , by fits and starts ; when they roused themselves it was always too late , the politicians were always a long way ahead of them in the popular mind . Moreover , the Reformers inclined too much to oratorical resources and did not know how , ? or but seldom made up their minds , ? to put their shoulder to the wheel , whereas the Machine did nothing else ; it " worked " the electors , one by one , caring nothing for displays of eloquence . Even the more or less successful " citizens ' movements " were paralyzed in their effects by the exertions which they entailed : the heroic character of these efforts soon wore out the zeal of the Reformers , and filled them with a conceit which made them complacently celebrate a triumph on the occasion of the slightest success . To checkmate the Machine , or at all events to cope with it , it was necessary to display a less heroic , but more methodical and more steady , activity . This lesson taught by experience was at last grasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which opened a new chapter in the history of the indepen dent movements and of American political methods . The new departure consisted in non-partisan associations , leagues formed on a permanent basis for systematic warfare against civic indifference and political corruption . They almost always aimed at municipal THE STRUGGLES FOR EMANCIPATION 31I government . Some of these leagues assumed the functions of vigilance committees , which kept a daily watch on the people 's representatives and the officials , and put constant pressure on them to keep them in the path of duty . They also made it their business to detect infringements of the law and prosecute the offenders . Other leagues were rather committees of investigation and for initiating legislation . ( ) thers , again , endeavoured to form , by combining together , centres of moral energy and of civic enthusiasm which would provide a steady supply of motive power in public life ; they tried to bring the citizens together and to include even the humblest electors in civic co-operation by taking them into a social alliance . Some of these free associations made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while others openly took part in them by deciding between candidates chosen by the parties or even by nominating candidates on their own account , or , again , they simply volunteered information to the electors on men and things , likely to guide them in their vote , without trying to influence them in other ways . Several leagues combined these various methods of action . The outburst of civic leagues began in the second half of the decade 188o ? 1890 and attained a luxuriant development in the following decade . Among these organizations may be cited the City Club of New York with a number of Good Government clubs in the several districts of the city , the Citizens ' Association in Boston , the Reform League of Baltimore , the Municipal Voters ' League in Chicago , the Municipal Association in Cleveland , etc. 141 . The success of these leagues was very marked // in many a city . At the elections the voters accepted their recommendations with alacrity , most of the candidates condemned were beaten , and most of those whom the leagues supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses themselves submitted to the league beforehand , in confidence , the candidates whom they intended to bring forward , and if the league rejected them and said it would oppose them , the bosses put better candidates before it . Equally valuable services were rendered by leagues which confined themselves to the special work of enforcing the laws and the regulations which are so often defeated by political influence or by negligence . Such are the Law Enforcement Societies and the Law and Order Leagues , which at one time made up for the shortcomings of the authorities by instituting legal prosecutions through their detectives and their lawyers , and at another time put pressure on the officials to make them do their duty . The parallel existence in one city of societies whose energies devoted to local public life met or crossed , and the necessity of mustering against political corruption and civic indifference all the moral forces of the community , whether organized on a philanthropic , or religious , or economic , or social basis , suggested the idea of bringing them into a central focus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chicago set the example , which was very soon followed in several cities , such as San Francisco , Detroit , St. Louis , Boston , etc . The work of inspection and enquiry carried on by the model Federation of Chicago extends to the schools , to conditions of labour in factories , to conflicts between // employers and workmen . The Federation has its police , its staff of detectives , its sanitary inspectors ; it prosecutes law-breakers ; it resorts to agitation , and at the same time gives lessons in good government , as , for instance , by having the principal streets swept for several months at its own expense and at a cost of twelve dollars per mile instead of the twenty-seven paid by the city . Several of the civic leagues solicit and receive the help of women . The co-operation of the latter in civic move ments is becoming more and more important . Holding aloof from party politics , women descend into the arena to combat the corruption engendered by the parties , sometimes joining the men , sometimes hoisting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women . Some rush into the electoral fray , others endeavour to arouse public spirit in a less militant fashion in the social or philanthropic field . Special citizens ' leagues are founded under the banner of Christianity " to make Christian principles operative in public affairs . " Societies for political education , recently founded in various places , work on the same lines by means of lectures and discussions . But the most powerful help comes from the independent Press . Its importance and its influence are growing daily . The rise of the independent Press is alike one of the effects and one of the causes of the public awakening which is working against party politics . 142 . On the whole , thanks to all these varied efforts brought to bear on municipal government , the aspect of things has changed perceptibly for the better . The disorders which marked the administration of the // American cities have been remedied to a not inconsiderable extent ; and interest in the public welfare , at all events within this limited sphere , has been awakened to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War . Municipal reform is not only before the public , but is fashionable . It has become almost the correct thing to dabble in it . Electoral manners are already strongly influenced by it ; party " regularity " is no longer observed with the same strictness at the municipal elections ; a " straight ticket " is no longer voted with the same devotion ; the " citizens ' tickets , " including candidates of different political complexions , are habitually victorious . In the sphere of national politics , the cause of civic independence is very far from having made the same progress ; there regularity is still the supreme law . However , the national political life itself did not wholly escape the new notions about the independence of the elector 's conscience , even apart from the tangible successes which Mugwumpism obtained in certain great crises , by contributing to the defeat of Blaine and to that of Bryan ; these notions pervaded the political atmosphere , exercising a subtle and deleterious influence on the traditional sentiments of party loyalty . 143 . Since these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now about a decade ago , a still greater change for the better has taken place , a change which has been called by many a revolution . The beginning of the twentieth century witnessed an unexampled prosperity and an extraordinary concentration of financial undertakings . Wealth became more defiant than ever of the general interest and even // of common honesty . The patience of the American people burst at last . Their eyes were opened to the greed of the corporations , to the dishonesty of high finance striding along with political corruption , developing it , exploiting it . And with angry passion the people longed to smite them . The feeling aroused 1-mud it most powerful interpreter and inciter in the new President who unexpectedly succeeded McKinley  --  Mr. Theodore Roosevelt . his exceptionally combative term per delighting in a fray , his aggressive honesty and his passion for public utterances were turned against " illegitimate wealth " and political corruption . The whole nation . was made to listen to his daily imprecations of iniquity and exhortations of righteousness . The Press seconded him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of crooked politicians became a necessary part of the daily diet of the American citizen . The supply seemed inexhaustible : the systematic graft in the great cities , the abuses of the corporations , now of insurance companies , now of Standard Oil , now of the meat packers . The Trust and the Boss became a great moral issue , and an emotional hatred of the abuses they caused seized the popular mind . The better element allowed themselves to be roused from their selfishness and apathy . Many well-intentioned civic people who had kept aloof came out , gathering courage and energy from the President 's moral backing . Young men of good families , inspired by Mr. Roosevelt 's example , went into politics , entered even the party organizations with a view to purifying them . Reformers and reform received an extraordinary impetus . Civic leagues and good government associations multiplied // tenfold . Along the whole line there was a mobilization of forces against graft and political corruption . While the stirring influence of President Roosevelt carried the middle class , the feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower orders from several other quarters , political and non-political . The socialist idea made great progress , and the Socialist party , till then insignificant , gathered strength and votes . The Prohibition propaganda pursuing the suppression of the liquor trade made tremendous strides all over the country , aiming alike at the saloon and at the politician behind it , both made more contemptible amid the general moral upheaval . The urban masses of some of the greatest cities were stirred up by a radical millionaire from the West , Mr. W. R. Hearst , who , equipped with his millions , came out single-handed against the plutocracy and the corrupt parties , forming a party of himself and , as his opponents say , for himself . The papers which he started , while representing the extreme type of sensational journalism , not only aroused the masses but forced even the " respectable Press " to adopt a more radical tone . These different influences united to impress the American people with the notion that they were robbed by high finance and corrupt politicians , that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy in America . While several proposals and attempts to achieve that purpose by legal enactments , which will be examined in the next chapter , have been made , the awakened consciousness of the nation manifested itself all over the land in a violent // anti-boss movement . That movement reached its climax at the elections of T905 , with the result that in State after State many a boss remained on the battlefield. 144 . Along with pitched battles against bosses and grafters there has developed a more methodical way of fighting them through continuous publicity thrown on their doings . The idea obtained that people tolerated the abuses because they did not know of them . The work inaugurated by vigilance committees and associations , like the Chicago Municipal Voters ' League , in the preceding decade , extended and broadened . Not only did the leagues publish at the eve of elections the records of the candidates , for the instruction of the voters , but the measures under discussion in the legislative assemblies were , as soon as presented , scrutinized and explained to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pressure of opinion was brought to bear on crooked legislators , who used to sell out the public interest unheeded . By analogy with the classical agency of the lobby , working on behalf of private interests , those representatives of the good citizens were called " the people 's lobby . " Such watch bureaus have been established at Congress in Washington , at the legislatures of New York , Illinois , California and elsewhere . The searchlight of publicity thrown on legislators and legislation was projected on administration as well with the object of promoting efficient and economical government . A Bureau of Municipal Research , founded in New York by and at the expense of a few high-minded citizens , opened the way in that direction . It is an // independent investigating body , which aims at securing constructive publicity in matters pertaining to municipal problems ; it collects , analyzes , and interprets facts as to the administration of municipal government . It asks for the co-operation of the city officials , and gets it from their fear of public opinion . The voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those Bureaus of Research , People 's Lobbies and Voters ' Leagues appeal from the party organizations to the people . That is the new method ? strange as such an innovation may appear in a democracy . That method has been taken up by the best of the highest public officers themselves , State governors and mayors , who , when confronted by the Machine in the legislatures on this or that measure , go straight to the people , stumping the State or the city . ( ) n these lines were carried on , during these last years , the greatest and most successful struggles against the Machine in Wisconsin , Missouri , Minnesota , New York , by Governors La Follette , Folk , Johnson , Hughes . The battles waged by the governor of New York , now acclaimed by the people and striking to all appearances the Machine at its very heart , and now Belied by the Machine and kept in check by it , formed the most dramatic incident in recent politics and the most characteristic of the existing conditions . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were slaughtered , but the Machine is still standing . The fundamental conditions , political , economic , and social , which make for the boss are still there , and in many quarters a fear is expressed that the Machine may wear down the good citizens called out on a vigilance duty to which they are unaccustomed . // 145 . However , the movement has affected deeply enough , for the better , the political society at large , the parties , and the Machine itself . In public life a higher tone prevails , the ethical standards have improved in politics as well as in business . There is in the community more political and social consciousness , the individual is more impressed with his duties and responsibilities towards the State and his fellow men . The better element have developed a greater interest in civic affairs , and the private citizen in public service is now more prominent than ever before . Under the exposures of the abuses not only has moral callousness given way but also intellectual supineness and self-complacency ; the public mind has broadened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had been hitherto considered as radical notions . This greater mental freedom has manifested itself - most saliently in the life of the parties , where boss rule has given an object-lesson of the effects of party idolatry . The latter has not been destroyed , but it has lost numbers of its worshippers . In the States of the Middle West especially the lines of party have been broken and brought into utter confusion . Third parties have been developed or formed anew . The Socialist party has made strides . Mr. Hearst founded an Independence League , proclaiming that the reforms necessary for restoring the power of government to the people could not well be accomplished either within the old parties or in conjunction with the old parties . This new organization , after having played a prominent part in upheaving the political soil of New York and bringing its creator almost within reach of the // mayoralty of the Atlantic capital , was , like so many third parties , not a lasting success . But independence asserted itself most powerfully within the old parties . Swarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shifted from one party to another , looking out for the better candidate or the sounder issue . In municipal elections especially voters began to care much more than at any time before not for the party label but for the merit of the man . This tendency spread into the State elections and even to the national elections . People voted at the same time for a Democratic governor and for a Republican President or vice versa . The voting of a split ticket became quite common . Party lines became less and less rigid . The independent voter having become a power in the land , the Machine had to recognize him , to cater for him , to become more decent . Tammany Hall has presented a most eloquent example of it . The caliber of candidates has greatly improved all over the country . The municipal government has become purer . The legislatures too have improved in many a State . The force of public opinion , used more frequently , became more potent . The possibility of appealing to it successfully , through discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again . More easily aroused , public opinion is still liable to proceed by spasms , and there is a strong tendency to make up for personal exertion and continuous vigilance by some contrivances of governmental machinery , a tendency to expect salvation from the legislator . FIFTEENTH CHAPTER THE STRUGGLES FOR EMANCIPATION ( ( om fusion ) 146 . THE tendency to put down political corruption by means of legislation took shape from the very beginning of the struggles for emancipation . At the same time as the " Reformers " endeavoured to dislodge the politicians in pitched battles , they tried to suppress the opportunities for corruption by legislative reforms . Their first attempts were aimed at the degradation of the public service by the spoils system . This system , which had made public office an electoral coin for rewarding services rendered to the parties or simply to the bosses , had alike demoralized political life and deteriorated the government . Skill in electoral wire- spoils pulling and " work " done for the party constituted attacked the sole claim to office , at the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of rotation , the government departments were periodically upset with every change of the party in power . The President and the heads of the departments with whom the appointment to offices rested as a matter of right , and the members of Congress who had snatched it from them , were all continually exposed to the solicitations of the office-seekers . They had to waste with them , even in the gravest conjunctures , the time that ought to have been given to affairs of State . Lincoln said , a // month after his accession , that he wanted to attend to the Southern question , but that the office-seekers took up all his time . His successors have not fared any better . Every aspirant wanted to " interview " the President , even when the appointment was not in his gift . The greedy throng pressed on at Washington , and if some came back empty-handed , others succeeded in carrying off the places by sheer importunity . The Republic was regularly looted . " If ever , " said Lincoln on this subject , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly demoralized , it will come from this wriggle and struggle for office . " It was absolutely necessary to withdraw the selection of officials from political favouritism , from party influence , but how ? The experience of the mother country appeared to offer the means in the form of a system of admission to office by open competition . Favouritism had long flourished in England and with equally disastrous effects ; the patronage of the Crown , which afterwards passed into the hands of members of Parliament , had been but a source of corruption , and at best made public office an appanage of the privileged few . The competition system introduced into England , from and after 1853 , for admission to the lower-grade appointments , had thrown these open to merit . A modest Congressman of Rhode Island , Jenckes , made himself the promoter of a similar reform in the States . . Year after year , from 1867 onwards , he indefatigably submitted to Congress a series of bills supported by a remarkable array of data , but without success . The places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large fund with which they could buy elecTHE // toral services , and they had not the slightest wish to deprive themselves of this resource , in spite of all the annoyance caused them by the importunities of the office-seekers . From that time a duel began between the politicians , with the members of Congress at their head , who clung to the spoils system , and public opinion , which was gradually won over to " civil service reform " on the plan of competitive examination . 147 . The struggle , begun soon after the Civil War , still goes on . President Grant and his successor I laves made earnest efforts to help to bring about the reform , but they ' , were checkmated by Congress . ' I'lte champions of reform did not allow themselves to lose heart . Many of them saw in it the germ of a veritable revolution in American public life : not only would favouritism make way for merit and public office cease to be an object of traffic , but the Executive , relieved from the pressure , henceforward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its independence , while the legislature would be restored to its proper function ; last , but not least , the Machines would no longer be able to subsist ; there being no places to give away , there could be no " workers " ; the bosses , being unable to support their men , would be deserted , and before long the tribe of mercenary politicians would perish from inanition ; booty no longer being , because non-existent , the object of the organized parties , the latter would be able to revert to their proper mission , to reform on the footing of ideas and common , principles . There arose in different parts of the Union special associations of friends of the reform , who applied them- // selves to its propaganda . Federated soon afterwards into of voluntary a League , these associations public opinion with remarkable perseverance and patience . The task was by no means easy , for the indifference of opinion was great ; every one had got so accustomed to the spoils system that it was considered part of the natural order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the reform into ridicule . Objections of a serious kind , or considered as such , abounded : the reform tended to set up an insolent bureaucracy , an aristocracy of office-holders ; it was an English importation ; it was contrary to the democratic genius of the American people ; it was destructive of the independence of the Executive and of its constitutional prerogatives ; the system of examinations was pedantic and incapable of bringing out the merits of the candidates ; the existing system was necessary for maintaining the cohesion of the parties , and without parties it popular government can not exist , etc . Slowly , like the drops of water which wear away the stone , the apostles of " civil service reform " destroyed the common prejudices against it , they converted people one by one . The politicians paid attention to this movement , in their fashion , by inserting in the party platforms platonic declarations in its favour , without believing a word of them . The revolver shot of a disappointed office-seeker which killed President Garfield converted a number of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , however , were not among the converts . Nothing less than the serious defeat suffered by the Republican party at the Congressional elections of 1882 and the prospect of the accession to power of the Democrats who would divide among themTHE // selves the spoils were required to change the views of the Republican majority in Congress . Reinforced by a certain number of Democrats , that majority promptly passed the bill of Senator Pendleton , which in reality was the work of the Civil Service Reform League . 148 . This bill , which became law on the 16th of January , 1883 , is the Magna Charta of civil service reform . It set up competitive examinations for admission into all branches of the executive civil service of the United States which have been " classified " for that purpose . While including in the " classified service " almost all the departments at Washington and postoffices and custom-houses with not less than 50 employees apiece , the law empowered the President to continue the " classification " of public offices , ? that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of the executive civil service . Certain categories have been exempted from classification , particularly the most important ones , those which are filled up by the President under the Constitution with the confirmation of the Senate , and the posts which come at the other end of the hierarchical ladder , those of simple labourers or workmen . Classification is , in short , applied or applicable to the small employees only , such as clerks , etc . Besides , certain positions within the classified service may be excepted from the requirement of competitive examination by the rules which the President is empowered to make . The unclassified offices and those excepted by the President are filled up in the old way , while to the classified offices the chiefs can only appoint one out of three of the candidates certified to them as having passed the competitive examination heading the list in the // order of merit . Once appointed , they can not be removed for political reasons ; but the chiefs retain a discretionary power to dismiss their subordinates for reasons unconnected with politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their subordinates , the law also prohibits them , as the reader is already aware , from soliciting or receiving from them contributions to the party funds . Attempts were made to evade or even to openly break its provisions ; but , on the whole , the letter of the law has been obeyed . The same thing can not be said of its spirit . The officials were no doubt appointed by competition , but they were often taken from among the adherents of the party in power . The abuses are disappearing more and more , thanks to the extreme vigilance of the civil service reform associations with their central League . These private organizations , whose propaganda . had powerfully contributed to the passing of the law , now mount guard around it . The offices withdrawn from competition , and they include the most important , are still distributed as spoils . Such has been the case since 1883 , under all the Presidents . The " clean sweep " was carried out as before , although confined to the posts " unprotected " by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is practically still free from any regulation and therefore still exposed to political influence . However , the atmosphere has become purer in the " non-classified " service too . Political assessments have gradually discontinued and have now become almost a matter of the past . Office-holders do contribute , but they are no longer coerced thereto . Yet their undue political +i // activity , although emphatically condemned by the law of 1883 and by the Executive instructions of Presidents Cleveland and Roosevelt , dill goes on in a scandalous way . Paid out of the public treasury , the office-holders are really campaign managers of members of Congress and are chosen for political and not professional fitness . 149 . The effect of the bestowal in the old way of the Progress of non-competitive places and of partisan promotions within the classified service was attenuated by the steady extension of that service , which at the time of the enactment of the law , in 1883 , included only 14,000 places . This extension was brought about partly in an automatic manner , in consequence of the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office to 50 , and partly by presidential authority . Almost all the Presidents in succession after 1883 , and especially Cleveland and Roosevelt , have enlarged the " classified " service . McKinley was the only president under whom the extension of the reform and even the sincere enforcement of the law met with a check . Towards the end of his second administration , in 1896 , Cleveland " classified " more than 30,000 offices . During Roosevelt 's administrations 32,000 offices have been transferred from the unclassified to the classified service . On the other hand the executive civil service has increased under him by more than 116,000 offices , of which over 8o,600 came in the classified service in accordance with the law . The formal provisions of the law of 1883 , completed by the successive extensions of the classified service , had brought into it about 220,000 offices out of over 350,000 which exist in the Federal service . The // number of non-classified offices now is about 130,500 , of which about 8700 are " presidential " offices , filled with the confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus there is still left a field of pasture for the politicians . Moreover , Federal offices form but a part of the fund of corruption ; offices in the service of the States and of the municipalities , which afford an abundant supply of spoils , have been withdrawn to a slight extent only from the political plunderers . The competitive system , started in the Federal administration , for a long time had great difficulty in penetrating into the service of the States and of the cities , and still more in being honestly enforced . Two States only had promptly followed the example set by the Federal legislature , New York and Massachusetts . Within these last years only four other States adopted the reform , and in some cases only in limited application to certain areas or certain offices : Wisconsin , Illinois , Colorado , New Jersey . The competitive system has made more progress in the municipal sphere , where remedies for the rule of rings and bosses are such a crying necessity . The effect of the reform in the States and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less thorough than in the Federal service . In some places the provisions enacted are a sham and their application is a farce , while in other places the rules work very well , perhaps better than in the Federal service . 150 . On the whole , to the limited extent in which it was applied , the reform yielded very good results . It procured more competent , more honest employees . Stability became almost the rule in the competitive // service , and in any event presented a singular contrast to the sweeping changes carried out in the " unprotected " service , namely , in the " excepted " positions , and still more in the " unclassified " offices . Complaints have often been heard , of late , about the inadequate efficiency of the reformed civil service : employees protected by law in their positions feel less responsibility and are inclined to form a red tape bureaucracy , while the chiefs are somewhat hampered in dismissing incompetent officials . From a general point of view , the political effects of the reform are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses and the Machines , for , if the supply of spoils has diminished , there is still enough left to inspire their henchmen with hopes and to make them " work . " Moreover , the " classified " offices , taken out of politics , have been made up for by the very numerous offices recently created in consequence of the extraordinary development of government regulation , which is therefore much approved of by the politicians . But , in any event , there is one effect produced by the movement for civil service reform which is a permanent gain , and that is the moral effect of the propaganda . After the Civil War , when public spirit seemed to be in a state of coma , when the political conscience of the community , engrossed in the mad pursuit of material prosperity , was , as it were , blunted or deadened , this movement against the spoils system rekindled the extinguished flame of the ideal in American public life ; it stirred the choicer spirits to an outburst of generous revolt ; it enlisted genuine devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The civic enthusiasm which // animated the noblest and the most eminent of these men , like G. W. Curtis and Carl Schurz , ? to mention the dead only , ? spread to a number of young men now scattered all over the Union ; it will not die out in them nor , in all probability , with them . There was formed in American society a sort of permanent fund of political righteousness from which high-minded men drew their moral supplies in every great crisis , in all the political struggles which filled these last forty years . The body of civil service reformers furnished large contingents of the mugwumps , the independents , and the municipal reformers . 151 . After the endeavours to starve the Machine by putting the public offices out of its reach , attempts were made to deprive it of another means of subsistence . The principal source of its influence was thought to lie in the fact that it had obtained possession of the material organization of the elections , which included especially the printing of the voting-papers and the distribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , added to the varied expenses of the election campaign , raised election expenditure to such a point that it became impossible for a new party , and all the more for an independent candidate , if he was not very rich , to enter the lists . Again , the expenditure required gave the Machine a pretext for levying assessments on the candidates and an opportunity for obtaining enormous resources . Henry George , the author of " Progress and Poverty , " summed up the situation in the following formula , " What we call Machine politics springs from the cost of elections . " To checkmate the Machine the first thing to be done , therefore , was to reduce election expenditure .
