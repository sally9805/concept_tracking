The rioters immediately gave ground and began to run headlong to get out of rifle range .

At 10 o'clock a group of strikers approached the main body from the direction of the city , and it was observed that these newcomers carried axes , crowbars , and sledge hammers . A sudden cheer went up among those assembled , and the new arrivals pushed and jostled their way to the front of the mob , and . as if by magic , a dozen red flags waved over the heads of the crowd . A blue-shirted , stalwart ironworker placed himself in front of the assemblage and held up his hand for attention . " There are scabs in the works ? " he cried . " They have been brought here to take your jobs away from you . What are ? you going to do about it ? " " Kill them . Drag there out , " shouted a score of voices in English , while from the majority of the mob cries arose in several foreign tongues from those who evidently understood the purport of the speaker 's words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cursing in a dozen tongues .

No one fell , and immediately a shout of fury - went up from the strikers and a hundred voices cried in chorus : " Blanks ! They 're using blanks ! , Do n't mind the guards ; get the scabs ! Bring them out ! " Axes . crowbars , and ' sledgehammers were raised aloft ; heavy logs were picked j up from a. pile of railroad ties near the ! ruins of the ruined trolley station , and with . a yell like madmen the strikers I charged for the fence pelle-mell , with here ' and there the red banner of the Indus- I trial Workers of the World tossing over their heads .
