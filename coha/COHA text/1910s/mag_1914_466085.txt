AR out in Chesapeake Bay lies Tangier Island , the home of the quaintest and most isolated community in the United States . For more than two centuries the Tangiermen have sailed their heavily laden craft across the bay to the coast villages on the eastern shore of Maryland , during the fishing season , taciturnly marketed their catch of oysters , crabs , and fish , to sail unsmilingly out again to their mysterious island hidden somewhere beyond the western skyline . All along the mainland shores the oystermen and villagers told us ? often with portentous nods and lowered voices ? that " them Tangiermen is mighty cur'us folk , " or " there 's queer goin's-on over yonder on Tangier . " But not a man of them will say he has ever visited the island . Hints of inhospitality , and worse , were frequent , the facts being as elusive as the intimation was definite , and our desire being keenly spurred by the mystery of it all , I presented the letter we bore to a prominent oysterman of Crisfield , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , after dealing with the Tangiermen for twenty years , could tell us little . " There 's a Captain Peter Crockett who keeps a store out there . Look him up and tell him I sent you . I reckon you gentlemen will get along all right , but be careful . They 're sure a strange lot . " The big oyster-boat was skippered by Captain Harry , who has sailed the Chesapeake for a score of years . To our questions he responded expansively concerning all things on , beneath , or above the waters , save only that strange community somewhere out ahead of us . Of that he seemed to know no more than any of the others . " Thar 's yore island , " said he , at the end of an hour , looking up from the magnificent shad he was cleaning For our noonday dinner . Dead ahead along , a thin line of land lay rim-like along the gray horizon . Captain Harry threw the finished shad to the fisherman who officiated as cook , and climbed into the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " We 're in pretty shoal water from now on . " A moment later our keel bumped over the crown of a sand-bar and we jumped up in alarm . " That 's nothin ' , " laughed the skipper . " I take soundin 's that away . It 's easier than heavin ' a lead . " For two miles he dodged over and around the bars , often scraping the weeded bottom , even though we drew but three feet aft . Steadily the island grew clearer to view ; the white spire of a church stood out definitely against the lowering sky , rising above tree masses that half hid a cluster of white cottages . From either end of the village ran far reaches of low marshland , broken in two or three places by small clumps of trees that sheltered a house or two , and at the end were long spits of glistening white sand . With Tangier still a long mile away , Captain Harry ran his boat firmly aground and stopped the engine . " Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer than I expected . She 'll be off in an hour with the tide , and it saves droppin ' anchor . " He launched a wobbly , flat-bottomed dingy , and himself undertook our transportation across the last protecting mile of shoals . There was a narrow , twisting channel somewhere thereabouts and twice we crossed it , but only a Tangierman could have followed its tortuous way . Captain Harry landed us on a sort of point at one end of the obviously picturesque water-front in a pouring rain , and we ran to shelter . But we did not run far . The charm of the place was too instant , too arresting . From the point we rounded a group of weather-beaten fish-houses that spoke vividly of Volendam , and caught our first near view of Tangier . " Marken ! " exclaimed Ellis , who knows his Holland . To one side was the shore-line with its fishing-craft of strange sorts ; to the other a row of small , fresh-painted cottages , inclosed in whitewashed picket fences . Between the houses one caught glimpses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canted masts of fishing-boats . A later inspection of the meadow revealed the network of small canals , " the horse and buggy of the island , " as one of the Tangiermen aptly put it . But we were looking ahead along a broad footpath that fronted the picket fences and lost itself beyond the church in a group of cottages under high cottonwoods . It was all so fresh , so still and wholly inviting , even through the haze of rain , that again we thought of Holland . We had not gone fifty feet before the empty footpath ( which turned out to be the main and only street of the village ) began to come to life . From the door-ways of all the cottages came wide-eyed , silent children to gaze wonderingly at the sight of strangers and to follow us respectfully on our way . Behind them in the doorways were the fisher-folk and their women , equally amazed , curious , and silent . Determined to win at east their tolerance , if we could , we spoke a greeting to all we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without shyness or unfriendliness . Quickly it became plain that they liked it , and later , when they found us inclined to conversation , they came out to the gates on the chance of a word from us . The procession of children , most of the boys wearing blue overalls , and several the cast-off rubber boots of their much more elders , grew as we proceeded , but its respectful silence was unbroken . The pathway made a sharp turn around the church and we were in the main part of the village . The street , lined on both sides with whitewashed picket fences , was a well-trodden dirt walk about six feet wide that stretched away for half a mile to the other end of the village . Overhead the green boughs . of the trees arched across the walk , and upon each side were close-set rows of speckless cottages fronted by prim lawns , flower-beds , and occasional fruit-trees . A few of the yards had no lawns , but were level- floored with hard - packed earth and were swept clean . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Still other yards were solidly paved with oyster-shells , their insides up , and they glistened dazzlingly- in the sun that followed the shower . While we were gaining our first impression of the Tangier fishermen and their homes , on our way to Captain Peter 's store under guidance of the children , Ellis pointed over a fence . Directly in front of a cottage were three marble tombstones at the head of graves , covered with cleanly whitewashed cement . I looked ahead and saw that this was no exception . In almost every home the living and the dead shared the little family property . Here was a newly built cottage , over which a broad cotton-wood threw its protecting shade . At its foot was a single tiny grave , pathetically fresh and new ? a sad beginning for the young family . A few steps beyond was a much older house , its yard almost entirely given over by the living to their dead . More than a score of graves were here , some of them weather-beaten by the storms of nearly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's store , and the brilliant afternoon sun burst through the low , scurrying clouds overhead . Its rays sparkled from a myriad raindrops still clinging to the massed , dripping leaves of the great trees lining the tiny street , their interlacing branches forming a wonderful pleached aisle into which the sunlight filtered in vivid splashes . Beneath our feet , the gleaming white of thousands of bits of shell caught a glow of gold from the sunshine , the rain pools dotted along the path , mirroring every image on their clear , trembling surfaces . " There 's Captain Peter 's , " said a pink-cheeked little girl in gingham and braids , and dropped hack into the crowd of wondering youngsters behind us . She had pointed to a one-story frame house whose broad , low piazza reached to the street line . Only a few men were inside ? for the fishing-boats had not yet come in from the day 's work ? and these silently , ratherquestioningly , returned our greet-ings . Captain Peter , owner of the store and a nabob of the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , sometimes took in strangers . Then there had been other visitors . We were not the first discoverers of Tangier , after all . We made diligent inquiry on this point a little later . Oh yes , there was a drummer or two every few months , and once in a while a ministerial visitor to the Methodist parsonage . Artist ? No , there had never been an artist , only a lady . We thought with wonder of the sensation a well-dressed city woman would make . As we left the store , a rather ill-kempt man , whose face and physique were in marked contrast to the clean-cut , powerful Tangiermen we had seen , told us he was the doctor ; that he hoarded at Captain Ed 's , and would show us the way . No , he was not a native of the island . It had never , he believed , produced a professional man . In any case , it did n't need many ? just a doctor and a minister . There had never been any lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat two-story house with an ornate but comfortable veranda . The front hall was bare , except for a small deal table hearing a wash-bowl and pitcher , and the stairs were uncarpeted . We knocked . A door opened and a tall , spare , gray-haired and mustached man , in a reefer and rubber hip-boots , appeared and looked us over . Apparently we did not look like " drummers , " and he seemed in some doubt . As persuasively as I could I explained our desire to remain on the island for a day or two , offered literal evidence that I , at least , was soaked to the skin , and craved his hospitality . Would he put us up ? After a long , silent inspection he " reckoned he might , " and without another word led us above to a bare but cheerful and very clean room , containing chiefly two old - fashioned wooden bedsteads and a stack of crazy-quilts . An hour later , in clothes dried at the kitchen fire , we had settled ourselves in the sitting-ronni with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Storm off the Coast of Maine " chromos of half a century ago . Then Captain Ed appeared , and we won him . Within the hour he was giving us a much-desired version of the story of Tangier . " No , sir , " he said ? and his speech was neither of the North nor the South , ' but had something in it of both , besides characteristics strange to either ? " thar ai n't never been no hist'ry story of Tangier ever writ as I knows of , ' cept one my father , Thomas Crockett , writ nigh fifty year ago . He called it " Facts and Fun , ? and he sent out and had it made into a book by a printer . There was a hull hox of ' em clutterin ' roun ' here for years , but the wimmin-folks said the Fac 's might be all right , but the Fun wa' n't , and one day they tore ' em all up . I ai n't seen one for years . " You gentlemen ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a man from the Eastern Shore settlements , back in 17o7 ? morc'n two hundred years ago . The island were the home of a tribe of Indians , and this here man , Post , got the idee of raisin ' stock on it . So he runs over and tells the Indians that the colonists are goin ' to come out and massacree them and they 'd better get outen the way . That scared the Indians , all right , and they sailed over to the western shore of Virginny . But before they went , Post said , as the island was n't goin ' to be any more use to ' em , he 'd buy it ofF.them . The chief agreed , so Post gave him two old overcoats , and the island was his . Then he brung over five families and a passel o ' horses and cows . " The Captain stopped to relight a cigar from our stock . " Were the Crocketts in the first lot ? " asked Ellis . " They war , sir . They an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livestock began to die off fast , and the other two families went back to the mainland . But we stayed on , and in a few years thar was a right smart settlement , mebbe thirty or forty people . " " Have others been coming over since ? " I asked , for we seemed face to face with a striking case of inbreeding . " Wall , a few now and then , " said the Captain . " Once in a while one of our boys goes over to the Eastern Shore for a wife , but most generally we Tangier folk kinda like to flock to ourselves . " Thar 's nigh five hundred Crocketts on Tangier to-day , " added the Captain , in efFective illumination , a note of pride in his voice . " And ? and the other old families ? " I ventured . " Have they done as well ? " " Thar ai n't as many as there be Crocketts , " he said , reflectively , " but ? let 's see . Thar 's fourteen hundred all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' a third of them 's Crocketts . The other four families would he nigh six hundred altogether , and that ' d leave about three hundred for the rest . Yes , sir , I reckon that 's about right . " My thoughts went back to the succession of graves we had passed , and now I wondered if we would nor find a densely populated asylum for defectives tucked away somewhere on Tangier . " You 've a remarkably healthy-looking lot of children here , Captain , " said Ellis , who was evidently thinking in the same channel . " 1 do n't suppose you have much sickness on the island , or ? or insanity , or anything of that sort ? " " Thar never was a doctor here tilt ' 89 , " was the reply . " Most of us lives till we 're ' bout ready to blow away . Co'se that 's some ailin ' off an ' on , but mostly it 's old age or child-bearin ' . " He chuckled . " Thar 's always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a poor place for a doctor ? with only fourteen hundred of us . " The entrance of Mrs. Crockett , whose sturdy health was declared by every line of her ample figure , with a reminder to the Captain of " them eysters " ( the women of Tangier have oddities of accent that the men do not ) , turned us to exploration . Cameras in hand , we sallied forth , and , as before , were the spectacular center of curious interest . The children had been on the watch for us and they soon collected in droves to discover what we were going to do . Ellis 's camera , with its hood and reflecting mirrors , was a source of intense , though silent delight . At his suggestion they formed in a long file , and one by one looked into the camera , seeing for the first time in their lives the familiarobjects about them pictured in miniature on the ground glass . At first we were a hit dubious about taking the villagers , but no one dodged us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unsmilingly , and without a word or question . In their own way they enjoyed it , yet the only one of them all who asked the ubiquitous " Mister , rake my picture ? " was the one negro on the island , evidently a privileged person . The one street ended in a narrow dike that ran out beyond the cottages and lost itself in an inlet . From here the village lay flat before us , marvelously trim and bright in the evening sunlight . To either side of the dike the little canals cut the meadow into strips and were dotted otted with fishing-craft , generally hull-down in the rank marsh grass . To the west rose another low ridge with a thinner row of homes , and between ran the narrow dikes with old split bridges over the canals , and at one place a crude but efficient miniature drawbridge that worked by hand . It needed only windmills to be entirely an American Holland . The women wore sun-bonnets in-stead of caps , when they wore any head covering . There is no modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves at the upper end of the village , near the place we had landed , and facing a two-story house with rather a larger lawn than the others , and no graves . This aroused our curiosity , and we turned to our faithful bodyguard . rhe minister 's house , " was the answer . " That 's him in the garden . " The minister was busy spading up a flower-bed with the active assistance of a flock of chickens , but he came to the fence at once to greet us . The charge was new to him , he having been here only a few months . He had come from Minnesota for the customary four-years ' term enjoined by the Methodist Conference , in whose charge the religious life of the island lies . Certainly he found it pleasant . The church was amazingly strong ; its congregation extraordinarily devoted . It was indeed a fertile field , and his chickens were doing remarkably well On the whole , a very pleasant existence ? a little out of the world ( they had been frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that ? Visitors were few at all times and his people were quite content among themselves . We liked the minister . The church is the only social center on the island , if one excepts Captain Peter 's store , where the Tangiermen gather without their women-folk . Its members and adherents embrace virtually every adult in the settlement , and the Sunday-school is attended by all of the six hundred children and many of their elders . As fishing is the sole industry of the island , so is religion , of the sternest and most uncompromising sort , the only intellectual stimulus or recreation . No alcoholic drinks , playing-cards , dancing , or frivolous amusements are tolerated or apparently desired by the fisher-folk of Tangier . Life is too serious a matter for such things . Naturally , the minister is a benevolent despot whose word is law . Apropos , a characteristic story was told us and later confirmed : The Tangiermen seem never to have taken any interest in either state or national politics until after the Civil War . There has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw was preparing to leave fur a ( to him ) less lonely abode , and as the island has never had any local government of any sort , and had been all but forgotten by Virginia , politics meant nothing to them . When at last the Tangiermer did take to the ballot , they voted solidly ' Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic stare . The reason , we discovered , was that their ministers had been almost all Northern men of Republican persuasion . There came a rime in later years when a close state election made the Democratic State Committee turn with concern to consideration of the three hundred odd votes to be contributed against them on the island . So , selecting with what must have been rare skill two fluent speakers , they despatched them at the last minute to Tangier . The two arrived on the eve of the election , and their oratory ? doubtless the first of its kind ever heard there ? so impressed the simple Tangiermen that they went to the polls a unanimous Democracy .. Secure in the belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundown , intent upon gaining the mainland that night . The minister , visiting a neighboring island , returned later in the day and learned what had transpired . In high wrath , his good Republican soul utterly shocked at the backsliding of his flock , he seized the first available banner ( his wife 's red-flannel petticoat ) and , climbing the steeple of the church , nailed it to the spire . Then grasping the bell-rope , he sent peal after peal of quick alarms ringing across the still marshlands , bringing the entire population to him on a run . From the church steps he poured denunciation upon the recreants , then led the way to the pulling-place . The ballot-box was opened , the debasing Democratic votes strewn to the four winds , and replaced with perfectly good Republican ones . These went to the mainland for the official count , and they were counted , too . As one of the Tangiermen , who would really like to be a- Democrat , told me rather mournfully , " Tangier has gone Republican ever since . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island are a justice of the peace and a deputy-sheriff . For the latter there is absolutely no official employment , and for the former little more than an occasional transfer of property to attest . Entirely without any local government for more than two centuries , Tangier is and has always been singularly free from crime or misdemeanor . Twice in its history , it is true ? but let Captain Ed tell it as he told it to us around the sheet-iron stove that evening . We turned the subject to law . " Thar ai n't been more'n twice when it was needed that I know of , " said the Captain , " an ' then we made enough to fit . " " Burt I hear you have a town constable , " I persisted . " Wall , I reckon we keep him to look after what strangers come ashore , " was the reply . When that had been allowed to soak in a little , he told us the real story of the constable . " A few years agu , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There got to be a regular spell o ' swearin' ' , an ' it wa' n't only on the boats , but right on the street within hearin ' of the childer . So thirty of us met right here in this room an ' formed a Law an ' Order League , an ' we pledged our sacred lives an ' property to put a stop to this wickedness . I toldthem that a man could be fined five dollars for swearin' ' in any state in the Union , an ' it ought to be the same here . So that 's what we decided to do , an ' we told Bud Connerton , the deputy-sheriff , to give every man who swore a fair warning , and the next time to fine him five dollars . " " Did he make any arrests ? " encouraged Ellis . " Forty-three the lust week , " said the Captain , " an ' none since . The boys soon decided that swearin' ' was too expensive to be careless about . " " How about strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We warn them twice , " he said . " We 've only had to fine one . Bud , he 's great on doin ' his duty . " As every effect must have its cause , we sought the underlying inspiration for the amazing simplicity , rigorous morality , and intense religious devotion so variously apparent among the people of Tangier . The almost absolute isolation of two centuries and the stern influence of the old-time Methodism had obviously been contributing influences , but without something more intimately personal it seemed that either or both of those might easily have resulted in what we really expected to find , a community morally and mentally weakened by inbreeding , and made sullen and inhospitable by their self-chosen immolation . The convincing and conclusive answer was " Joshua Thomas . " Without knowing of him one does not know Tangier . He is called " The Prophet of the Isles , " and his deeds are a sacred tradition in every island home . Born on the Eastern Shore in 1776 , Young Joshua was about five years oid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon afterward and his mother became the wife of a dissolute member of the Pruitt clan . The stepfather 's dissipation brought such depths of sorrow and wretchedness to the family during Joshua 's boyhood that there grew in the lad a stern hatred of all forms of self-indulgence . In those days the island was the place of the annual Methodist camp-meeting , and the young fisherman , now intensely devout , felt a call and became an " exhorter " of extraordinary power . He could read only the simplest words in the Bible , but he pored over it nightly and developed a gift of simple , moving speech that lifted him to amazing influence . That he possessed also to a great degree the gift of prophecy is undoubted . Scores of instances were told us , every Tangierman to whom we mentioned Father Thomas reverently adding his favorite story . Absolutely without fear , he dominated the life and thought of the island for half a century and left his imprint indelibly upon his people . His fearlessness is vividly illustrated in one incident that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1812 , when the British fleet was on its way up the Chesapeake Bay to storm Baltimore , it dropped anchor off Tangier , and several thousand of the troops were sent ashore for field-drill . Landing at one end of the island , they marched upon the village in a body . In the line of their march were the laboriously cultivated cornfields of the islanders , which , besides fish , were their chief food-supply . The terrified natives gathered in the street bewailing the oncoming destruction , but Father Thomas alone went out to meet it . When he faced the army he simply raised his hand ? and the armywas halted . He warned them that they must not trample the corn of his people , for it was all that lay between them and want . It was not a plea , but a command , and behind it lay a strangely perfect faith . The word was passed back from company to company , and when those twelve thousand men passed and repassed through the fields , not a hill was found destroyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word to Father Thomas , asking him to preach to his men , and the following day saw the twelve thousand British soldiers drawn up on the beach , and , facing them , the rude , barefooted preacher standing between officers with drawn swords . Fearless as ever , he preached peace and sought to turn the invaders from their attack upon Baltimore . They were in the wrong , he said , and God would bring destruction upon them . Thereupon he launched into a vivid and detailed prophecy of the British defeat , frankly claiming divine inspiration , and begged them to turn from a purpose that would make widows and orphans of thousands of their wives and children , before it was too late . He was allowed to make this extraordinary address to the end , and a sense of impending disaster went with many of the men to their ships . A few weeks later the shattered remnant of the defeated British army sailed past the island on its way to the sea , but it stopped long enough to allow a visit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , " was the message , " and somehow we knew that it would be as you said . " There were many stories told of miraculous healings by the prayers of Joshua , and one , an odd parallel to the New Testament story , of his having cleansed the camp-meeting ground of money-getting peddlers and tricksters by exhortation . The parallel , however , seemed to have escaped the islanders . The ministers sent by the Methodist Conference come , reign for their brief term , and go , but their names and deeds rest lightly in the memories of Tangier compared with those of the prophet , though he died sixty years ago . His body lies on a small neighboring island , where he rounded out his long mission . His tombstone bears the following epitaph , written by himself : Come , all my friends , as you pass hy , Behold the place where 1 do lie . As you are now , so once was I. Remember , you are born to die . After slipper , a smoke , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I strolled out for a glimpse of the island by moonlight . We longed for a hillock , an elevation of any sort from which we might look down upon the q , - 'et white village , wrapped about by dailt waters and bathed in the clear moonlight of a perfect night . It was only a little after eight o'clock , but the village was almost asleep . Here and there a gleam of mellow lamplight shone through an open window , and twi:e we passed young couples , seated on or near the white cement graves in the yards in front of their homes . Nowhere was a mother 's voice singing or crooning to be heard , though many times during our stay we both verged near to impertinence in our surreptitious attempts to discover even a hymn tune being hummed over a baby or a wash-tub . We were finally forced to the conclusion that the melody of the human voice , 23 well as instrumental music , must be taboo except at Sahhath worship . As a matter of fact , we did not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tangier . We had crossed one of the many little bridges leading from the village to the dikes on the marshland , overlooking the stretch of dark grasses interlaced with strands of ribboned silver where the sheen of the moon glistened on the little canals and gleamed on the white sand beyond . It made us sigh again over the inadequacies of the camera . We recrossed at the upper end of the village , to find ourselves in a narrow footpath , with blossom-laden trees lending their fragrance to the keen salt air . On each side of our path were ancient houses , black and weather-beaten , and strangely contrasting with the almost Dutch-like cleanliness we had found in the village . " Looks almost like Poe , " commented Ellis . A few moments later we stopped beneath the low-hanging branches of a tree to look in actual blank amazement at a God 's Acre inclosed within a rotting fence . There were fully twoscore white marble headstones gleaming in the moonlight , but all about was neglect and decay . Rank weeds grew everywhere ; pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , littered the sacred spot . And silence ! Not the peaceful , serene calm of the country churchyard , but just grim silence . We cut short the walk and went back to our rooms , to be told later that these were graves of those who had had no homes . We were awakened on the morning of our last day on Tangier by a stiff nor ' - wester that rattled and shrieked furiously through the trees . Looking out to westward , we caught glimpses of a distant line of frothing white- caps and a heavy sea breaking on the beach . " What a bully day to go out with the fishing-fleet ! " said Ellis , who is amphibious and water-proof . But he was to be disappointed . The fishermen were holding back , Then we knew it really was blowing . After Mrs. Crockett 's customary breakfast of fried oysters and fish ? a combination that formed the mainstay of dinners and suppers as well went out to seek excitement and to learn of our chances of getting back to the mainland that clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high , brilliant sun intensified all the fresh , spring colors of the island . One faced the salt wind with infinite relish . Many of the fishermen were gathered in Captain Peter Crockett 's store . Every counter , box , and barrel was occupied , and a score or two were standing motionless except for the slow movement of whittling knives . The whittled sticks always became miniature boat models . There was strangely little talk for a store meeting , and what there was Was chiefly in monosyllables . It may have been our presence , for we were still the objects of unfeigned interest and curiosity , and whatever we said was listened to with odd attention . It was remarkable , though , that despite this attitude never once was the question asked of us whence we came or what we were doing , a type of reticence rarely to be found in American villages . Ellis 's best efforts failed to develop anything remotely approaching garrulity , but he acquired a rapt audience in the discussion of picture-taking . He was playing for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said aloud . " Would , if I could get a good crowd on the porch , " said Ellis , so as to be heard by every one . " All hands for'ard , " boomed a voice behind me , and with one accord all rose , moved quietly to the door and ranged themselves along the front of the porch . They remained stolidly motionless until Ellis released them with , " All Over . Thank you , men . " Then they filed back into the store and soon were whittling away in silence . We walked across to the wind-swept western beach with our usual troop of youngsters at our heels . The boys knew all the wild creatures of the beach and dune ; beat Ellis at the standing long jump , and taught him an entirely new game of marbles . He was certainly enjoying that island . It was on this walk that we discovered the only horse on the island , a superannuated creature long past years of usefulness . That same day they were moving the post-office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Ed. ' s , three of the Crockett grandchildren had come for a visit . They were roly-poly , pink-andwhite babies , from two to four years old , and they had never been photographed , we were told . Of course they were photographed there and then . " We 'll send you some prints , Captain , " we promised . " Be sure to address it to E. L. of T. Crockett , " he said . " E. L. of T. ? " we repeated , in bewilderment . " Of course ! There are two E. L 's . I 'm E. L. of Thomas , and the other 's E. L. of Joshua Crockett . Thar 's lots more has to do the same thing here . " Toward nightfall the nor'wester had blown itself out , and we bade an revoir to the Tangiermen . A quaint and sturdy clan they are , to whom life is serious , and the world beyond their island a vague speculation , and , like all things vague and speculative , to be eyed with distrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward life ; much sweetness in the clean simplicity of their women and their homes , and their island is a treasure trove of rare delight to a lover of the quaint and quiet charms that Tangier may justly claim .
