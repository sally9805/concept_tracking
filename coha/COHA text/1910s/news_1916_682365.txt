txt . . TOPICS OF - I- HE TIME .. Connecticut pays its Certainly legislators only 5300 a Argued year . That amount . in . n i a V in the opinion of The i Hartford Courant , is not enough , and it supports its opinion by various arguments , presented with apparent earnestness . First-it calls the attention of the too-economical Nutmeggers to the fact that other Staten pay more for their annual grist of new laws , and some of them a lot more . Illinois , for instance , thinks its Wise Ones worth $3,300 a year . At any rate , that is what it gives them , Now York and Pennsylvania fix the legislative remuneration at $1,500 , while Iowa , Ma-ssechusetts , Minnesota , and Ohio , though cutting it down to $1,000 , are still three times as generous  --  or appreciative  --  as Connecticut . To Connecticut 's $300 The Courant applies the harsh word " paltry . " Better revive England 's abandoned policy of paying nothing at all than pay so little , it is almost tempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know " the modern way " to be different . Also it recalls that " people get just about what they pay for " ? an adage cold and cynical , indeed , but of a veracity admitted not less generally than sorrowfully . Thus The Courant argues , and then it spoils its whole case by adding : " We frankly admit that the larger salaries paid In Now York and Pennsylvania , and even across the line In Massachusetts , do not get any better product than we get for so much less money here . " Of what use is It to add , after an admission like that , the further statement , " but.salarles are not the only factor " ? That statement is so darkly enigmatic that it will carry no weight at all . If Connecticut gets for $300 a " product " as good as others purchase at far higher rates , the logical conclusion certainly Is not that the salaries of the Connecticut legislators should be raised . To do so might be magnificent , but it would not be business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is in Connecticut . There be those , especially all the people who for one of several widely different reasons object to selling munitions to the Allies , who would say that nowadays business in Connecticut counts for more than , anything and everything else . Of course it does n't , but  --  well , there 's no doubt that The Courant wrecked its own contention , Automobile statisImpressive , tics lost , some years If Not ago , the power of Surprising . startling , or even astonishing , anybody by their size . The steadiness of their growth soon came to be taken as a matter - of c  --  iarqe , and now the only mental reaction to them is an effort to realize ' ' the meaning Of ' figures so large ? facilitate this process ; presumably , the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce is not content with announcing in its annual report that its members compute from the orders in hand a sale this year of 1,250,000 cars . It adds that this is one sale to every eighty people in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious , for it is almost sure to revive an old question in a new form . Can it be that of the Americans still unprovided with automobiles one in eighty can afford to buy a machine so expensive both to get and to keep ? To that inquiry there can be no definite , answer . but probably it need cause no very deep anxiety to the social ' economist , for the chances are that before now most of the unjustifiable buying of motor cars has been done  --  with results considerably less disastrous than gloomy prophets used to foretell  --  and that at present the things are rarely bought without either a good reason or a decent excuse . Another assertion of the report was that by the end of this year , if existing demand holds out , there will be in the hands of American owners something like 3,500,000 motor vehicles of one sort or another . That is about three to every hundred of us , or one to every eight family units . It seems plausible enough to anybody who watches the streets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open country . Everywhere the automobile . is nearly as common as horse-drawn vehicles were in the old days . The change to the new means of transportation , hcwever , is not yet by any means complete , for the horse still does co much more than survive that those who talked of his doom to extinction are quite evidently going to be proved false prophets , at least as regards the near approach of ht ultimate departure . His field of service has been much restricted , but in a not inconsiderable part of his former domain he remains without a dangerous rival , and it looks as if he would always do so . There are still AmerViolated lean boys , it seems , who All of hear and answer the call of the sea to which so the Rules . ninny of them formerly gave glad response . There is something of reassurance in that , and the revelation would almost quiet anxieties caused by recent successes of pacifist propagandists among our college youth if the behavior of the boy whose nautical experience was told in yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint a strange . sad difference between him and his predecessors . For one thing , this boy did n't run away to sea , as was the old-time fashion  --  the fashion of the true adventurer . He came here from the country with his mother , and it was under her care and with her help that he started out to see the world ! That was a change indeed , and though one would not venture to call it exactly reprehensible , the Spirit of Old Romance views the phenomenon askance and a little mournfully . In the next place , this boy evidently did n't yearn to be a real sailor . He ? signed on " only when told that he would serve as waiter in the Captain 's cabin ! The boys of old often took that position , too , but reluctantly , and only till they could do better and more manly work . The worst remains to tell . This boy encouraged only to disappoint , for he rebelled when he found that he had been shipped on a sailing vessel instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status , and he did well to swim ashore at the first opportunity . His is not the sailor soul , else would he have rejoiced at the deception that put him where alone sailoring can be learned . What he wants is a job on land in one or , another branch of domestic Service
