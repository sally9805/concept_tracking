txt THE MORMON VOTERS Not Influenced by the Political Views of President Smith . To the Editor of The New York Times : This morning 's issue of your paper contains a special from Salt Lake City , quoting a statement made by Joseph F. Smith , President of the Mormon Church , which is headed in bold type , " Mormon Church for Taft . " The Mormon people are not a bunch of cattle or sheep to be bundled into this camp or that just as the Mormon leaders desire . If you will analyze the votes of past elections and compare them with elections in other States you will find that such a charge is unjust . Mormon Democrats are fighting for Wilson just the same as Presbyterian or Catholic Democrats are . Mormon Republicans are fighting for Taft just the same as Catholic or Baptist Republicans are fighting for him . What President Smith says about Taft is a personal expression of opinion , and has no more weight with Mormon Democrats or Mormon Progressives than what Cardinal Gibbons says against Roosevelt with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the same thing may be said concerning other candidates . BEN E. RICH , Eastern States Mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . Now York , Sept. 27 , 19l2.
