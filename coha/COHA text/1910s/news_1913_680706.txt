txt In an opinion handed down to-night in response to a communication from Secretary of State Mitchell May , Attorney General Carmody declares Lieut . Gov . Martin H. Glynn is Acting Governor of the State of New York , pending the trial of the impeachment lodged against William Sulzer as Governor . The trial is set for Sept. 18 . Gov . Sulzer to-night told friends that he would ignore the official dictum of the Attorney General . " When the Governor is impeached by the Assembly all of his powers are automatically suspended until he has been acquitted or the Impeachment proceedings dismissed by the Court of Impeachment , " says the Attorney General . " In the meantime the Lieutenant Governor acts as Governor . This is plain intent of the Constitution . Ant other construction would nullify its ex press provisions . " In his opinion , a summary of which is printed elsewhere in THE NEW YORK , Times to-day , the Attorney General goes exhaustively into the history of constitution-making in this State , with a view of showing that under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred from exercising his powers and performing the duties of his high office until after he has been acquitted on trial or the impeachment dismissed . This contention is at variance with the view expressed by Mr. Sulzer and some of his legal advisers , who hold that the Governor can not be deposed until he has been found guilty by the High Court of Impeach ment . The Attorney General also meets the contention of Mr. Sulzer and his advisers that the Legislature was without power to act on the impeachment resolution because it was in extraordinary session . The Attorney General holds that the Assembly , in impeaching Gov . Sulzer , exercised no legislative functiop. but a judicial function pursuant to powers vested in it by the Constitution . Not to Affect Sulzer Plans . Mr. Sulzer said to-night to interviewers that he had no comment to make on the Attorney General 's opinion . In discussing the opinion with his friends , however , he declared that it would make no difference in his plan to hold the Executive Chamber against all corners . Acting Governor Glynn. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declared , merely had borne out his contention that the impeachment charged him with the duties and vested in him the powers of the Governor 's office . The opinion has strengthened the position of Mr. Glynn immeasurably , for it is regarded as certain that no head of a State Department , no matter what his degree of personal loyalty to Mr. Sulzer , will dare to ignore the official expression of the Attorney General . Many persons at the Capitol believe that , under the opinion , Mr. Sulzer will be forcibly dispossessed , should he refuse to vacate the Executive suite when , as is expected , it is assigned to Acting Governor Glynn by the Beard of Trustees of Public Buildings to-morrow . That body was to have-met to-day , but word was received from Speaker Alfred E. Smith of the Assembly that he could not attend . Mr. Sulzer. seconded only by Chester C. Platt , his secretary , went through the motions of presiding over a meeting of the hoard , much to the amusement of a large Dotty of spectators in the Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance . Sulzer $100,000 Defense Fund . New light was shed to-day on the elaborate plans of defense that are being made on behalf of Mr. Sulzer . It was learned that friends of his are preparing to-spend $100.000 in the next four weeks to arouse sentiment throughout the State to prevent the impeachment from going to trial . The Governor 's friends here are constantly declaring that the High Court of Impeachment would be a biased tribunal and that it would never do to have the Governor tried before it , no matter how complete his defense . The $100,000 plan is being engineered by ex-Judge Lynn S. Arnold from the office of The Knickerbocker Press , a local newspaper , which on its editorial page has urged that Sulzer never ought to be tried on the charges lodged against him with the Senate . The Knickerbocker Press is owned by Stephen J. Clark and Edward Clark . the owners of the Singer Building , the Singer Sewing Machine Company , and the large thread manufacturing concern which bears the family name . They have immense wealth , and Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term , is said to be nurturing hopes that one day he may land in the Governor 's chair . The fight the Clark paper is conducting is being waged largely in an effort to bar Mr. Glynn from taking Mr. Sulzer 's place at the head of the State Government . Mr. Glynn is the ek-g. , . r of a rival newspaper at the cap , tal . Much and varied litigation pending here gives proof of the bitter rivalry between Judge Arnold and Mr. Glynn . A page advertisement distributed from the office of The Knickerbocker Press under the direction of Judge Arnold figures prominently In the scheme of gaining newspaper support for the purpose in view . In this connection an illuminating story was told by Z. A. Stegmuller , editor of The Binghamton Press , who left for home this morning after spending two days at the Capitol in conference with Judge Arnold , Mr. Stegmuller 's newspaper printed the page advertisement last Saturday . After the order had been received Mr. Stegmuller received a summons over the long-distance telephone to come to Albany and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , managing editor of The KnickerbOcker VOntinued on Page 3 . . GLYNN GOVERNOR , SAYS CARMODY // Press . Mr. Stegmuller arrived here Saturday morning . Plan . of Selzer Campaign . Judge Arnold told Mr. Stegmuller his plans ' n some detail . From the conversation the Binghamton editor inferred that , summed up . they were : To arouse such a widespread public sentiment throughout the State by reports that Acting Governor Glynn would he a Tammany tool , and that he impeachment was intended merely as ameans by Tammany Hall to get Sulzer out of the way and open opportunities to Tammany to loot the State Treasury , via Glynn , that the Court of Impeachment would let Mr. Sulzer off on technical objections to be interposed by his counsel in the form of a demurre7 .

To make Harold J. Hinman of this city , at present minority leader of the House , Speaker of the next Assembly . Harold J. Hinman , who now is looked upon as a Barnes man , is the junior partner in Judge Arnold 's law firm . It was he who , on the floor of the Assembly last Tuesday night , first referred to the story of Mrs. Sulzer 's " confession . " Judge Arnold was at his elbow at the time . According to Mr. Stegmuller , Judge Arnold opened the conversation by referring to the page advertisement and said there would be other advertisements of the same size later . He pointed out that already 510,000 had been spent in that way throughout the State . Said Sulzer Could Explain All . Judge Arnold told Mr. Stegmuller that the State-wide campaign to prevent the impeachment from going to trial was necessary because no one could know what would happen to Mr. Sulzer at the hands of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in due time would confound his enemies , that he could explain fully all the charges that had been made against him , that already he had done so to Judge Arnold and other intimate friends , and that all were satisfied that Mr. Sulzer was an honest man and the ; charges against him were inspired by motives which could not stand the light of day . Mr. Stegmuller explained to Judge Arnold that his newspaper already had taken the position that Mr. Sulzer should meet the charges and be cleared or ousted , and that he was unwilling to change . Judge Arnold invited Mr. Stegmuller to accompany him on a midnight visit to Mr. Sulzer at the Executive Mansion . " The Governor will explain to you , as he has explained to us , and you will change your mind , " said the Judge . The editor declined to visit Mr. Sulzer , declaring that nothing could change the situation . so far as he was concerned . Sulzer 's Lone Hand . ' When he resolved himself into a committee of one to receive proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and sixth floors of the west end of the Capitol air . Sulzer was fully aware that Attorney General Carmody was at work on his opinion regarding the contentions of Mr. Glynn . He did not know just what situation he was about face when he appeared in the Executive Chamber at 4 o'clock , for the news had not reached him then that Mr. Glynn and Speaker Smith had definitely decided to ignore his call . Earlier in the day Deputy Attorney General Kellogg had rendered a decision that , even without a quorum of the Capitol Trustees present , the bids could be received and referred to the State Architect . On this decision Mr. Sulzer acted . Besides Mr Sulzer there were present State Architect Pilcher , H. Gorder Lynn . Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Efficiency and Economy ; Deputy State Architect Sussdorf . Mr. Sulzer 's Secretary Mr. Platt , a half dozen contractors and twice as many newspaper men . " The Trustees of Public Buildings will meet , in accordance with the adjournment . to receive bids and award contracts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the Governor spoke again . " Are there any bids , Mr. Secretary ? " he asked . Mr. Platt began to open the proposals . There were fowl- , and he read them quickly . Then he handed the bids to State Architect Pilcher . The lowest bid , 5243,141 , was some 520,000 lower than the minimum bid for the same work at the previous meeting , and Mr. Sulzer was quick to grasp the point . He said a statement would be issued later , showing that money had been saved . At that point the meeting came to a halt . Mr. Sulzer came to the rescue . " Are there any other bidders ? " he asked . No one spoke . " In view of the fact that there is not a quorum of the board present . " continued Mr. Sulzer , " these bids and the certified checks will be referred to the State Architect , who will report back as soon as possible . " Then he declared the meeing adjourned . Friends of Mr. Sulzer asserted that by receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amused Mr. Glynn . During the proceedings Mr Glynn remained in his offices off the Senate Chamber on the third floor . laughed when told of what had happened . " How could it be ameeting without a quorum : " he asked . " I was in my office , and I do n't know where Mr. Smith was . There was only one out of three there . Mr. Kellogg said that the bids could be received by the State Architect without a quorum being present , but that no awards could be made . " It was-apparent that Mr. Glynn took the position that Mr. Sulzer was , in the eyes of the law , merely present at the proceedings in the capacity of a spectator . Mr. Glynn was asked if he was making plans to ; : all another meeting of the Capitol Trustees for to-morrow , at which other offices than those held by Mr. Sulzer would be designated as the Executive Chambers . " I should hate to say what is going to happen to-morrow , " he replied . " Nothing serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glynn if he was going to send a special message to the Legislature . He hesitated , but made no I definite reply . Mr. Sulzer spent a rather uneventful day aside from the fifteen minutes devoted to the business of the Building I Trustees . He arrived at the Capitol at 10:30 o'clock . He said that Mrs. Sulzer was feeling better . In reply to other questions he said that his lips were sealed . A moving-picture operator caught Mr. Sulzer as he If t his residence , and later he consented to pose before the camera in the outer office of the Executive 1 Chamber .
