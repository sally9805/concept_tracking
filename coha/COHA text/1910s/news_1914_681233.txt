txt Following the first shock of the Claflin receivership a disposition was shown yesterday by all parties interested to get together and help put the company back on its feet . This was evidenced by a joint meeting of the committees representing respectively the note holding banks and the merchandise creditors , at which it was agreed that they should Co-operate toward a prompt reorganization , and by a declaration by the attorneys who filed the bankruptcy petitions which are to be heard on Thursday , that they were satisfied to leave the working out of the problem to the receivers , so long as all creditors were protected . The action of John Claflin in retiring from the Presidency of the United Dry Goods Companies and the Associated Merchants ' Company to devote his time and resources to the rehabilitation of the H. B. Claflin Company was cited as another evidence of the general disposition to set things right , as was the fact that Cornelius N. Bliss . Jr. , with his large interests and extensive training in the dry goods trade . had taken hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks that he would have ample finan-cial support if needed . While it was much too early for any definite plan of reorganization to be considered , the prediction was made on all sides that it would proceed with all dispatch . as soon as the status of the affairs of the principal company and the stores scattered through the country had been determined , and that in the end 100 cents would be paid on the dollar . Strong Reasons for Optimism . The cheerful feeling yesterday was based largely on two features of the situation that stood out clearly from the preliminary analysis that the banks and the dry goods trade had been able to make since the receivers were applied for . ( me was that the indebtedness of the company for merchandise was a small proportion of its liahilities , amounting to about ** out of $3-4,0o0,000 . Had half of that sum represented accounts payable it would have indicated a much more serious condition so fa : - as manufacturers were concerned . llt &i.ny; manufacturers on a small scale had long regarded their Claflin accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been paid on the dot . The receivership , consequently , meant the tying up of their chief quirk assets , and if they had been on the large scale of the note indebtedness of the Claflin stores . serious erithartassment might have ensued in a number of cases . . ks it was , while the company owed ** for merchandise . much of it was to big concerns and the rest was scattered to such an extent that it was not expected yesterday to embarrass any of the creditors . So far as the note indebtedness was concerned , the reassuring element was the fact that the notes were so widely held that they were not likely to cause serious embarrassment among the 3.001 or more banks among which they were distributed . In the dry goods trade the opinion was expressed that the reorganization would probably take the form of taking the Stores throliehout the country from under the wing of the H. B. Claflin Company and making them stand on their own bottoms . This , it was said . would bring about a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claflin company financing them and lending its credit by millions . Any that wore unprofitable , it was said , would he disposed of , and would cease to he a drag on the entire V  --  ** retail structure . The Noteholders Committee . of which James S. Alexander . President of the National Bank of Commerce is Chairman , had a meeting yesterday morning with it ! , counsel , Joseph M. Hartfield , to prepare the agreement under which will be deposited the claims that banks throughout the country have been invited to send in . No official statement was made after the meeting . but it was learned that claims of about $8 , - 040,000 had already been deposited . These consist chiefly of notes held in or near this city , as the time has been too short for even places comparatively near by to be heard from . Committees Get Together . The committee was soon joined by a anb-committee iepresenting the merchandise creditors , with their counsel , James N. Rosenberg . The purpose of the joint session was for the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that they might pull together in straightening out the situation . The Merchandise Creditors Committee , it was learned , had already obtained the deposit of claims aggregating about S2 , - 500,000 out of the 14.000,000 total . It held a separate meeting in the afternoon at the Merchants ' Protective Association , where plans were completed for reaching other creditors . Mr. Rosenberg said later that there had been no developments during the day and spoke enthusiastically of the joint meeting earlier . ? The two committees . " he said , " will co-operate toward a prompt reorganization . The - Merchandise Committee has received satisfactory and general support from merchandise creditors . " Andrew C. Brew , Secretary of the committee . announced yesterday that in view of the public importance of the matter , its members had consented to represent the creditors without cost to them . When Gregg &; appeared before Judge Hand on Thursday , ten minutes after receivers had been applied for and filed a petition in involuntary bankruptcy . it was feared that a fight would ensue over the further proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Govern , who explained that his clients had no intention of plunging the companies into bankruptcy . " I feel confident . " he said , " that our clients will he satisfied to permit Messrs . Marindale and Juilliard to straighten out the affairs of the company . provided all the creditors are protected . Our design in filing the bankruptcy petition was merely to protect the creditors . . ? " Suppose . for example , the receivers should discover their inability to either reorganize or liquidate with the consent of the creditors and hand their resignations to the court What would happen ' : Within two hours there would be filed hundreds of individual suits and hordes of Deputy Sheriffs with writs of attachment would seize anything they could lay their hands upon . It is in order to prevent just such a situation that we have taken this step . Will Not Force Petition . " The petition is returnable on July t.  - -  next Thursday . The Claflin Company must then make answer to the charge that they are insolvent . If we believe that the receivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we will gladly consent to an adjournment and permit the matter to remain pending until things shape them-selvt:s Mr. 's clients consist of several employes of the Claflin Company who had suing on deposit with it , exceeding in one case $28,000 . The company , it was learned yesterday , made a practice , as many other companies do , of receiving such deposits , on which it paid 5 per cent . interest . The money was carried as a credit to the owners and could be withdrawn in whole or in part at any time . Most of the amounts were small and their amount in the aggregate has not yet been determined . That is one of the things that Marwick , Mitchell , Peat &; Co. , public accountants , who began work on the books yesterday , will ascertain for the information of the receivers . It is possible that this money may be released from the receivership , If the court follows the precedent made yesterday when it released $707 from the assets of the Defender Manufacturing Company . This represented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory . There are 330 employed and of these 230 had made an arrangement by which 23 or 50 cents a week was deducted from their wages and held until their vacations , when they might draw it . For a time it looked as though the girls , whose vacations are just beginning , might have to stay home for lack of funds , but the receivers , through their attorneys , Rushmore &; Stern , applied for the release of the money , and Judge Hand signed the order . The work the accountants have just begun will take at least a week , it was said yesterday , which means that the receivers will not be in a position to make any statement of assets and liabilities before that time . Even then only the figures as to. the Claflin Company and the Defender Company will be known . It will remain to . get the data from the twenty-six stores , some of them far away , before a complete showing can be made up . Until these facts are known the protective committees will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can do little in the meantime except to get in under the agreement as large an amount of the outstanding notes as possible . Joseph B. Martindale , one of the receivers , said yesterday : " We have to get an inventory of the stock of the H. B. Claflin Company and then ascertain the amount of bills receivable . After getting the facts relative to that company it wilt be necessary to ascertain the amount of stqck and the financial condition of the outside stores . ' As these stores are widely scattered it will require some weeks ' time to get that information . I believe that it will be possible to get a condensed statement regarding the affairs of the H. B. Claflin Company much sooner , " but even this task will require many days of work .. Every facility . is being given the accountants by the officials of the company , but pending the compilation of the .. accountants ' report there will be no statement .

There was little . outward , indication . in the Claflin building yesterday that anything unusual had happened .

Sentiment in the dry goods district is I wholly in favor of the firm . Its prestige and long- standing and its conduct in times of financial stress have always made for it firm friends . The present merchandise debts of the firm , while amounting ' only to about $4,000,000 , are not regarded as serious in the trade be ! cause . of the area over which they are spread . On the other hand , the outlet the firm has afforded for tremendous quantities of merchandise is very highly regarded . Commission houses and man1 ufacturers seem to be willing to do anything they can to lighten the burden of merchandise debt , and to bring the bankers involved to a favorable view of the situation .
