txt AUTOMATIC TRAIN STOPS E. A. Simmons , finding fault with certain articles published in THE TIMES , says : " The plain fact is that no device for stopping steam railway trains automatically has ' yet been perfected that will work successfully under all operating conditions . " The expressions used by Mr. Simmons are accompanied by charges that those responsible for introducing automatic train stops are doing so that they may make money for themselves . Now , I have been connected with railways long enough to have witnessed all inIlltOre. ments that have been effected upon locomotives and signals , and I fall to see why inventors who have perfected valuable life-saving improvements should be blamed for desiring to make their work pay .. I began running locomotives in Scotland at a time when all the Conveniences provided to operate a. locomotive were the means of starting and provision for purreing water into the boiler . The signals were semaphores that were hauled to danger by a man at the station . and breakage of that wire permitted the signal to show line clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements that were always depreciated by the ultra-conservative men of the time . and similar sentiments were expressed toward the inventors who improved signals and brakes so that they called for stoppage of trains wl:ca anything went wrong with the apparat  --  Ld . That was the time of true progress and it is still going on . The signals In common use have proved themselves far from being perfect , so it seems perfectly right that inventors should persist in their efforts toward perfection , undiscouraged by the suspicion that their devices may be I do not remember in fifty years ' experience with railway appliances of any useful invention being introduced for the improvement of railway machinery that was not open to the objection raised by Mr. Simmons .
