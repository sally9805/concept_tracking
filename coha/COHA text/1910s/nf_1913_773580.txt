txt 300 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere subtly and most quickly feel the indefinable magic of his touch . The flesh painting is superb and particularly well illustrates the strong purity of the master , that quality in tone and in brushwork which does so much to give him his place apart . Even if the initials cited by Mr. Greig had been demonstrated to exist ? and the manner in which they revealed themselves to some observers and not to others imported an element of humor into the situation ? it would still have been left to the doubting critics really to make good their case . If Velasquez did not paint this exquisite picture then it must have been executed by another master of the same name . V EL GRECO AND GOYA El Greco is one of the painters who have lived by ideas . The melodramatic aspect of much of his work has obscured this fact . Criticism has been baffled by the eccentric elongation of form which generally marks his treatment of the figure , by his strange and even sinister traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of light and shade . The impression he conveys , as of a genius lying in a sort of penumbra , outside the traditional lines of development in European painting , has been happily summarized by a clever English artist and writer , Charles Spanish 4rt in Spain and Elsewhere 301 Ricketts . The works of El Greco , he has said , look as if they had been painted by torchlight in a dungeon of the Inquisition . The saying is perfect save for the implication it carries of an atmosphere harsh and cruel . M. Barres takes us nearer to the painter 's secret in his ingenious hypothesis making El Greco simply the predestined interpreter of the spirit of Toledo . A mystic in the last , subtlest ingredients of his being , he threw in his fortunes with a centre of mysticism when he made the old cathedral town the scene of his labors . Man of the world though he was , and vividly alive to all things touching the eye and the mind , his genius as an artist was still in harmony with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be conclusive , but at all events it affords a profitable clew , inasmuch as it directs attention to El Greco 's more spiritual qualities . The connoisseur of technic will linger appreciatively over his portraits , but if he is wise he will go on to consider not only the powerful execution but the sympathy with which El Greco painted the princes and minor servants of the church , and a host of laymen too . In his studies of character , no less than in his religious subjects , and in pictures like the famous " Burial of Count Orgaz , " where devout ecstasy and the realistic traits of secular portraiture are commingled , there is something mysteriously poignant , a sombre emotion , a point of view which is not that of a painter merely , but of a man sunk in half-paingot Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere ful revery . His amazing " View of Toledo , " almost the sole souvenir of his interest in landscape , is remarkable for much more than its dramatic sky , its intense " picturesqueness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual record . The theatricality of the piece is due to no misreading of nature , but to the fact that the scene has been observed with some indefinable " inner vision . " Was that vision notably inspired ? Do we owe to its operation pictures of extraordinary moment ? Despite the fervor with which El Greco is appraised in some quarters , one may be permitted to doubt . The recent craze for the old masters has promoted varied developments . When the dealers , ransacking Europe anew , turned their attention to Spain , El Greco came in for an astonishing and not altogether rationalized popularity . His present rather esoteric vogue is not necessarily going to last . When the dithyrambic cease from troubling and the scoffers are at rest , appreciation of El Greco will probably be found somewhere between acceptance of him as a great master and rejection of him as a morbid eccentric . The contrast between El Greco and Goya is profound . One used in his pictures a light that never was on land or sea . The other used the familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuineness of El Greco 's mysticism we can not question , however we may speculate as to its ultimate value . Goya 's religious emotion , when he brought it into Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 303 play , was not precisely insincere , but it certainly had no depth , no real force . He too , like El Greco , lived by ideas , but they were the ideas of a satirist , and an ineffably worldly-wise satirist at that . His art is saturated in intelligence . It is as modern in feeling as it is in technique . All his sitters were " subjects . " That is why his work has such tremendous vitality . It interested him to the point of passion . Style in art is of personality all compact . You can read a man 's character in the play of his brush . Goya 's history is writ plain across the surfaces of his portraits . He was an eager , militant creature . The period of social decadence in which he lived enraged but could not disgust or depress him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not pretend to disguise , but he painted it with delight and gratitude . For a man of his moods and sardonic , inquiring mind what could have been more welcome than such a mass of raw material ? And besides the bad and the weak there were so many figures in Goya 's Spain that were , on the surface , merely beautiful . Look at one of his portraits of the great court ladies of his time and observe the delicacy with which the painter caresses an exquisite motive . Watch him as he renders the elusive charm of texture in a fashionable dress or gives himself up to the sensuous grace of " The Famous Bookseller of the Calle de las Carretas . " Beauty of form and of color , the magic of light , the dramatic 304 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere significance of movement ? these things find in him truly " the devouring eye " and a hand itching to translate the thing seen into terms of paint . Goya is of his time , of course , and his portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ease of every-day actuality with a certain stiffness attributable to courtly modes carries us straight back to eighteenth-century Madrid . But in their ruthless psychology and in their peculiar technical brilliancy , which is wreaked upon human nature as in a fury of artistic passion , his portraits might have been painted yesterday . VI FOUR MODERN SPANIARDS I FORTUNY Was Fortuny a man of genius , and , if so , in what does his genius consist ? There are commentators who barely admit that he had more than a cheap talent . I have heard an artist , himself possessed of at least a streak of genius , disparaging the young Spaniard , untimely lost , as though he had a personal and somewhat mean little grudge to satisfy . Well , I know that Fortuny 's vogue is not what it once was , but neither is it plain that he is on the way to be forgotten . The genius , I think , is there . It consists Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 305 in impeccable draughtsmanship , dazzling color , and abounding sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into works of brilliantly original style . The Impressionists might protest that Fortuny had no atmosphere , and it is true that his outdoor work lacks the subtle vibrations which the Barbizon men first introduced into their pictures and which the Impressionists have since made the chief object of their study . But Fortuny 's landscape is nevertheless true , his light and air are unmistakably drawn from an intimate acquaintance with nature , and though he is pre-eminently a magician of nineteenth-century painting , pre-eminently a master who gets out of the palette such coruscating effects as we look for in the art of a musical virtuoso , he is one of the most accurate and one of the most human painters of his time . Somewhere in his correspondence Henri Regnault speaks of Fortuny 's having robbed him of his sleep through the tremendous effect of his art . It is easy to understand how the young Frenchman must have been overwhelmed . Coming from Paris , where academic precept has always held such sway , he must have felt that as a matter of course good drawing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Fortuny he saw it spring on the canvas as though by legerdemain . Fortuny studied , studied all his life long , and in a number of sketch-books which his widow still possesses in her palace in Venice there 306 Spanish . drt in Spain and Elsewhere are pages and pages of drawings which reveal the most ardent search after the last details of structural truth . The painter never wearied of verifying his impressions . He labored with well-nigh as much assiduity as Meissonier showed , and that is saying much . But he never fell into Meissonier 's rigid methods of drawing . On the contrary he went on handling his brush and pencil and etching-needle with the freedom and dexterity of one for whom difficulties did not exist . It is surprising to find how soon he arrived at this freedom . Born at Reus , in Catalonia , in June , 1838 , his modest circumstances kept him for a while unable to pursue his artistic studies to advantage . And when , in his teens , he labored at the Barcelona Academy , he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triumphs of his manhood . When I took a long journey to look up the memorials of that early time I was somewhat disappointed by the little collection preserved at Barcelona . But in 1859 , when General Prim was carrying on military operations in Morocco , the young painter was sent to the front to make studies of the campaign . He made them . Ultimately , after vexatious delays and negotiations too complicated to be touched upon at length in this place , he produced " The Battle of Tetuan , " a large canvas which may be seen in the Barcelona museum . It is an interesting picture , and shows that the artist had found Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 307 his style . But still more eloquent are the small studies made by Fortuny at this time . If he had felt the witchery of the sun in Spain he had not yet carried it into his art . Arriving in Morocco the sun took him captive forever , and the bizarre character of the landscape and people settled the direction of his genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . A few years later he was in Paris : then he visited Madrid and married Senorita Madrazo , daughter of the director of the Prado ; and in a little while he proceeded to Rome , living there until his death in 1874 . Neither in Paris nor Spain nor Italy did he let go of the Moorish inspiration . That had saturated his nature , and his entire work shows him the master of those exquisite effects of color and light which he first saw on the campaign with General Prim . Even in such pictures as " The Spanish Marriage " or " The Academicians of Saint Luke Choosing a Model , " which are far removed in their fastidious elegance from the blaze and brilliancy of Moorish scenes , he is true to the old point of departure . The sparkle which belongs to his sketches of Tangiers still plays about his drawing-room scenes and his studies of rococo figures , furniture , costume and manners . His critics have sometimes averred that it was all a matter of trickery , a skilful application of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much devotion . But one way of proving the fallacy of this judgment is to compare 308 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere Fortuny with any of his numerous followers , especially in Paris , Madrid and Rome . His methods become trickery and jugglery in lesser hands . With him they were the spontaneous and artless expression of his nature . Hence his paintings glitter without being artificial , they are like jewelled canvases , but they are never hard or mechanical . Furthermore , they have , for all their daintiness and fragile charm , a peculiar strength and even dignity of composition . Few cautious and thoughtful Academicians have had a finer gift for filling a canvas than Fortuny possessed . The great picture of " The Academicians of Saint Luke Choosing a Model " is one proof of this , " The Spanish Marriage " is another ; but , indeed , Fortuny 's smallest and most casual sketch was apt to have this balance and this beauty of proportion . I recall the arrangement of the accessories in a little sketch of the artist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark background and the just proportions of the two contrasting spaces . Instinctively Fortuny put his figures in the right part of the canvas or paper , instinctively he introduced or omitted just the things that would make or mar his design , and if " The Academicians of Saint Luke Choosing a Model " and " The Spanish Marriage " are more remarkable in one way than another it is in their illustration of sumptuousness combined with perfect simplicity of design . There is a water-color of Fortuny 's which represents a Kabyle chief standSpanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 309 ing on a prayer-rug in a mosque in Tangiers , his picturesque figure set boldly against a massive white pillar . In the background the broad walls of the mosque , with their bands of arabesques , are drawn with great breadth and force . It is just such a composition as would reduce most artists to despair , the materials are so hopelessly simple . Fortuny keeps each detail in exactly the right relation to the next and makes a symmetrical picture where it would have seemed impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing ephemeral about his work . Gay as it is , light-hearted and vivacious as is the sentiment which runs through it , there is still a remarkable solidity about this master 's art . Whatever he did he did so well , whatever vein he cultivated he forced to yield such beautiful and original results , that the one law of experience which promises to harm him is really suspended in his honor . He glitters , and the artist who glitters is almost invariably tiring . But Fortuny does not tire . II SOROLLA A long time ago , in Madrid , the painters and sculptors I met there were unanimous on the question of what one of their fellow-artists would ultimately do 310 Spanish " In in Spain and Elsewhere to astonish the world . They maintained that Joaquin Sorolla , a painter then still in his young manhood , was going sooner or later to revolutionize the school to which they belonged and to win European fame . At first it was a little difficult to understand this enthusiasm . A picture by him , much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marguerite " ( which is now , by the way , preserved in St. Louis ) , made its impression rather through its pathos than through any special qualities of technique . Later , certain open-air studies of his provided an explanation of the emotion of his friends . They showed that he was achieving remarkable mastery over effects of light and air , and that he was developing also great adroitness as a draughtsman . Since then Sorolla 's progress has been phenomenal , and I was interested to observe , at the large exhibition which he opened in the Georges Petit gallery , in Paris , several years ago , that he had more than fulfilled old expectations . This exhibition was repeated at the Grafton galleries , in London , and more recently , early in 1909 , the artist made a similar appearance in New York . Three hundred and fifty of his paintings and studies were hung in the building of the Hispanic Society of America . Sorolla 's significance as a figure in modern Spanish art is the better appreciated if the student considers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Goya , in 1828 , Spain bade farewell to an Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 311 artistic vitality which , in fact , he alone had kept going for a long period . Even Goya had but fitfully revived gleams of that sacred fire which had burned with so steady a glow in the art of Velasquez , and it is especially important to note that he founded no school . The Spaniards following him were , to tell the truth , a rather mediocre company , painting in dull , academic fashion . The first man of consequence to rise amongst them was Mariano Fortuny . He was a type of what is familiarly known as diabolical cleverness . He manipulated his pigments with the skill of a conjurer taking a rabbit out of a hat . But , as I have already shown , he was not a mere producer of jeweller 's work , of bric-a-brac in paint . Unfortunately , it was his sleight-of-hand that appealed to the men who gathered around him in Rome , and that they made popular there and in Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aglitter . To the credit of some of its makers , be it said , they had talents strong enough to triumph over the besetting temptation . Pradilla , for example , was quick to perceive that man can not live by bric-a-brac alone , and his individuality pushed its way through the web of filigree and sparkle which Fortuny had made so bewitching . Yet Pradilla remained a sharer in his clever countryman 's love of detail , of picturesque costume and so on , and this predilection caught any number of other Spaniards in its net . Villegas is perhaps the most conspicuous of these , but a long ti 314 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere of a lady in black , by Degas , which is one of the gems in Mrs. Gardner 's collection in Boston and Fortuny 's superb portrait in the same key in the Metropolitan Museum . Neither of these , by the way , it may be said in all courtesy , has he yet even approached . Probably Senor Sorolla himself would be quick to recognize the fact . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman whose passion for the open air is likewise his own . His draughtsmanship is closer , he follows form with a simpler , more confident , and , above all , more flowing touch . The odd thing is that he charms , gives you the sense of a certain personal quality in his drawing , for all that his style might be roughly described as more photographic , more scientific , than artistic . I may cite his " Sea Idyll , " a picture of a boy and a girl lying in wet sand with the water just touching their legs . The boy wears nothing save an old straw hat with a wide brim . The girl wears a bathing dress of some thin material , and this , saturated with water , clings to her body . It would be impossible to beat the sheer technical proficiency shown in this painting , and , as has been said , there is an odd savor of individuality , of style , to be apprehended , fused with the clever brushwork . It is with such motives as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over and over again he paints his young bathers , scampering along the sands , enfolded in the towel brought by a nurse , just plungSpanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 315 ing into the waves , or , as in one beautiful example , " Swimmers , " showing their lithe brown bodies in the very element itself and taking on therefrom a new beauty . His " Oxen Ready to Beach Fishing Boats , Valencia , " the picture with well-filled white sails billowing above the boats and cattle , is known everywhere through reproductions . It admirably illustrates his bravura . It is a picture painted for the Salon that is , nevertheless , not wholly a " Salon picture . " That is to say , Sorolla boldly arrests your attention , yet puts not a trace of sensationalism into his work . His drawing is as sound , his color is as well managed , his spirit is as sincere as when he is making one of his smaller studies or even painting one of his innumerable little snap-shots . You would say , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a great " show-piece " and in a casual note of movement and color , that his resources could never fail him ; but it must be confessed that , with all his gifts , he still has certain clearly defined limitations . Let him work in a flood of sunlight and he is at his ease , but ask him to paint nature in one of her tenderer , more poetic aspects , and he is not so sure . His science does not forsake him . He paints his ground forms truthfully enough . But he brings no emotion to his task , no subtlety , and to note this fact in his landscape work is presently to note it elsewhere with even greater regret . 316 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere As a portrait-painter Sorolla is , one may be sure , a master of the likeness . You are impressed by the firmness with which he models a head , the nimbleness with which he passes swiftly over the features , and , above all , the vitality with which he invests his sitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character may be demonstrated in these heads , and while he may paint the bodies of his men and women with understanding , the want of sunlight seems to react upon his temperament and to make him cold , to deprive his style of most , if not all , of its elan . Furthermore , his portraits show , even more than his open-air pictures ? and these are by no means devoid of significance in the matter ? that while his color is true it never possesses a fine quality . About nothing that he paints does there hang the charm of beautiful surface . He uses his pigments not sensitively , not with a loving feeling for them , but with a kind of brutality . His pictures , especially when seen in large numbers , have an almost blinding effect . They do not beguile , they dazzle . They bring vividly into the foreground the fact that Sorolla is not an imaginative painter , not a man of dreams or of complex emotions . He is simply a marvellously equipped technician , born to paint human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Though his works do not " wear well , " having no creative inspiration in them , their immediate , momentary appeal is irresistible . Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 317 III ZULOAGA The exhibition at the Hispanic Museum of the works of Sorolla was followed by one of some thirtyfive or forty paintings by his countryman , Ignacio Zuloaga . This artist , like the other , has made some stir in Paris and elsewhere , though he has not in his own land enjoyed quite the same popularity as Sorolla . The explanation is simple . The methods of Sorolla are of special importance to existing conditions in Spanish art . The example of his direct dealing with open-air subjects has been needed by the school to which he belongs . Zuloaga , a very different type , has no invigorating inspiration to transmit to contemporaries already predisposed to excessive artifice . He is himself of artifice all compact , one of those painters who retire to a world of their own , consulting Nature only in order to clothe her truths in a specious garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , to be cavalierly dismissed . A reputation like that of Zuloaga must rest upon some more or less substantial foundation . It would seem to have its basis in novelty or rather in the exploitation of old ideas by a piquant personality . This painter derives , in substance , from Goya . He is interested in national types of a picturesque 32o Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere whom doubtless they adore ? Their color may be never so brilliant , and yet it is without quality and very nearly opaque . The best of Zuloaga 's pictures is never anything more than a tour de force , as sharply vivid in its definition of form as a merely honest , in no wise " touched-up " photograph might be , and with every note of color in it given its full value . This color , too , is kept well together , and it tells effectively against a somewhat factitious but still very skilfully painted background . The figure is full of life , and in the strongly modelled head and face , brimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax to his vitalized , pictorial motive . Only a powerful and original craftsman could do this thing . What is it , then , that disturbs our impression ? The excess of detail in the painting of the costume , the forced simplicity of the background , which too obviously , too trickily , throws out the figure ; the savor of studio pose which underlies the indubitable reality of the piece ; ? all these things might conceivably fall into subordination to the artist 's main purpose and even appear negligible if it were not for one cardinal limitation . This is Zuloaga 's blunt indifference to the genius of his medium . I have called his color brilliant , but it is a hot and heavy brilliance . His drawing , though not precisely turgid , is unquestionably wanting in ease , and , by the same token , in distinction . He is an able painter , and yet the conSpanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 321 viction will not down that he paints , so to say , by main strength . His work is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zuloaga is one of those painters who excite in us a kind of wistful revery . We speculate as to what achievements might have been theirs if only their gifts had been a little better balanced . We look at a picture by him , so well composed , so masterfully done , and wish that the composition had been a little more artlessly framed , that he had got into it something of the spontaneity of life instead of the immobility of a good tableau . We wish for more atmosphere , for tones more subtly broken ; in a word , for less of brute force and more of creative mystery . He can paint a boldly assertive portrait , working on the surface . He can not paint the soul of things , for amongst all his rich resources we find neither imagination nor taste . IV VIERGE I Paris paid a handsome tribute to the memory of Daniel Vierge in the late winter of 1912 . I saw then , in the Pavilion de Marsan , a voluminous and impressive array of his drawings and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his genius needed to be , in the characteristic 322 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere French phrase , definitively established and consecrated . For this purpose the organizers wisely chose as their most desirable souvenir of the great draughtsman the series of illustrations for " Don Quixote " in which he fulfilled the ambition of a lifetime ; but there were scores of other things to affirm his fame . And it was high time for him to be thus commemorated . When he died , some seven years prior to this exhibition held in his honor , I remember noticing with chagrin how little attention was paid to the event by the world at large . And yet public indifference to the termination of a remarkable career was perhaps to be expected . When this born draughtsman left Madrid , his native town , in his nineteenth year , and went to Paris , he reached there just in time to make sketches of the siege for the Monde Illustre . His work was so good that he had thereafter no difficulty in obtaining commissions . He poured forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the midst of his miscellaneous labors contrived to produce a masterpiece in the shape of a series of drawings for the famous picaresque novel of Quevedo , " Don Pablo de Segovia . " He had won fame , and fortune also was almost within his grasp . When he was stricken with paralysis his right side was rendered useless , and though he trained himself to work with his left hand , he necessarily dropped , in a measure , out of the race . He was only thirty years Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 323 old . He was not without honors or prosperity during the remaining twenty-three years of his life , but he was as modest as he was proud , and worked on contentedly in a retirement which explains , in some sort , tehe slight attention paid to his death . Strolling one day on the outskirts of Paris with the late Philip Gilbert Hamerton , I spoke to him of Vierge , whose " Pablo " illustrations , in a copy of the book I had picked up in Spain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eulogy of the artist , who had long been his friend . Hamerton praised him as one of the most extraordinary technicians he had ever known , but he was almost warmer in his tribute to Vierge as a man . " Be sure you go to see him , " he said . " You will find him one of the gentlest and sunniest of afflicted men . " Soon after I had the privilege of spending a couple of hours with him in his home at Boulogne-sur-Seine . He lived in a little house set back in a narrow garden , with vines clambering everywhere , even across the old iron gate through which one passed on ringing the far-off , tinkling bell . As I walked up the gravel path I saw on the right a wicker enclosure occupied by a number of aristocratic fowls . On the left , further on , was the house , and behind it the studio in which he spent most of his time . It was a comparatively bare room , with few of the luxurious appointments familiar in the studios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with a few pictures , 324 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere a few cupboards , a few well-filled bookcases , an old table , with one or two chairs , and a screen hung with dilapidated costumes . There were no rugs on the floor . It was , in fact , a very Spanish interior , characteristic of a race capable of being gorgeous to a degree , or equally austere . Vierge himself provided the best key to his surroundings . He seemed simplicity itself , a tall and stalwart man who must have been commanding in the old days , before paralysis overtook him . It was pathetic to see this fine artist compelled to move with hesitation across the room , compelled to rely upon his wife 's interpretation of the almost soundless movement of his lips for the understanding of his every wish . Madame Vierge , a kindly , matronly woman , as simple in her manners as was her husband , was his right hand in everything save his drawing . It was good to see the two together , Vierge as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of health , and laughing over his own jokes with the spontaneity of the true humorist . They told me of what had happened when the paralysis came . His memory failed then , he lost his power to remember the significance of the printed word ; but , read aloud to him , everything became vivid in his mind . The slightest jottings in his old sketch-books gave him sufficient material for elaborate drawings , for when once facts of architecture , scenery or costume were brought back to him by visual suggestion , he never forgot them again . His Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 325 talk was naturally limited , but what he said was in a modest and generous strain . He expressed his admiration for Abbey , Pennell and one or two other Americans , and spoke cordially of the illustrative work in American magazines . When he referred to his own performances it was with the intonation and gesture of a man regarding himself as the least important practitioner of his craft . When we talked of the folio edition of " Pablo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his illustrations , he was wholly good-humored over the fact that no one had up to that time thought it worth while to send him a copy . There was something touching in his sweetness . Life had used him hardly . The paralytic stroke from which he suffered was doubly tragic , considering his profession . But he did not murmur . The atmosphere in his almost sequestered home was as cheery as the sunny suburb in which he had made it . II Vierge long since saved his critics the trouble of " placing " him by the simple process of seizing the chief position in modern pen draughtsmanship and holding it . It is the purity of his method that makes him unique . In the sphere of pen draughtsmanship , by which is meant , of course , that of the book and magazine illustrator , he is what Velasquez is in the sphere of painting , or Rembrandt in the sphere of etching , a man of genius whose technical practice 326 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere constitutes a kind of law . Fortuny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not even in the best of them did he so " live by line " as it was Vierge 's habit to live . Neither Menzel nor Keene , his two greatest contemporaries , had quite his way of giving the beholder a sense of delight in pen drawing for its own sake . Phil May might have approached him in this , but Phil May , pace Mr. Whistler , had not an atom of Vierge 's distinction of style . That is the Spanish artist 's great virtue . His technique is not merely impeccable , but has quality ? is an affair of manual dexterity enriched by temperament . He was , indeed , temperamental or nothing , a man for whom study could do no more than superficially affect the fruits of instinct . I suppose he had something of the modern artist 's flair for " documentation , " and frequented the paths of historical research enough to make sure of his facts when he was dealing in the costumes and accessories of bygone social epochs . But there was nothing in him of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innumerable properties and authorities on which some artists of to-day lean so heavily ? Perhaps he would have cherished them , if he could have fitted them into his modest studio , but I prefer to believe that having once devoured them with his eyes he would have let them go . That , at all events , is the impression I get from his innumerable designs , every one Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 327 of which has the spontaneity of an improvisation though it is " all of a piece , " a work more convincing than the most elaborate Academical reconstruction is apt to be . His people ' wear their clothes as though they had a right to them , and move about in scenes to which it is obvious that they were really born . They always move ? a fact which must have done almost as much as Vierge 's style to commend him to the publishers and editors he sought on coming up to Paris from Madrid in search of work . The military painters , men like De Neuville and Detaille , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketched the stirring incidents of the Commune . He loved action , if we may judge from his personal tastes before the paralytic stroke that practically chained him to his studio in his prime , and a mobile subject called forth his best efforts . He handled it with ease and swing . In my collection of his illustrations there is a gouache of a refectory at the Salpetriere in which the note of movement in the central figure , a nurse walking rapidly down the room , is caught up and repeated in the attitudes and fantastic gestures of all the surrounding patients . The scene has a horrible reality , the more horrible because nothing in it is exaggerated ? Vierge seems to have seized in a flash the most natural aspects of his unnatural theme . He used the same insight when he turned ? as he was always turning ? to more romantic material . In 328 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere romance as in reality , in books as in city streets , hospitals and theatres , or wherever else his insatiable eyes carried him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but actual life . I miss the glamour , sometimes . There are moments in which I wish that Vierge had put more tenderness and atmosphere into his work , had shown more feeling for sensuous beauty . But pursuit of these less tangible things might have diverted him from his true aim , which was to make his figures look simply human and natural , to portray , above all else , character . This most expert of technicians was never content with technique alone . He had something to say as a great portrait-painter has something to say . Looking at some of his little nude studies you would infer that he had no desire to improve upon his model , to make her the symbol of an idea ; they are uncompromising renderings of fact . His pictures of Arabs are nothing more than impressions of the picturesque . In neither case is any imaginative intention visible . But the moment he drew a figure to accompany an author 's text , or noted one in the highways for its human interest , he made it a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could not possibly be confused with the attributes of any other figure in his crowded gallery . His fecundity in this matter has not yet been widely enough recognized . There has been too much talk of his technique , and too little about what he did with it . Thus his " Pablo Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 3 29 de Segovia " is commended to the student as a masterpiece of pen draughtsmanship . I would commend it to him also as a masterpiece of illustration . The book offers a crushing rebuke to those popular illustrators who work , evidently , each from a single formula , and , having taken the town with a new type of pretty girl , fit her into any environment , any period , any situation , regardless of whether she belongs there or not . Vierge never repeated himself . Every personage and every episode in Quevedo 's curious novel he drew with a freshness disclosing the liveliest mental activity . In nothing does the artist show his sympathy for his author more than in his humor . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is of the grim sardonic sort characteristic of the Spaniards . Moreover , though Vierge delighted in a passage of comedy involving several actors , he could give as free play to his humor in the delineation of a single type . He could draw you a pious matron or a mischievous soubrette with equal whimsicality . His beggars are superb , the finest in European art since Callot or Hogarth . In fact he seems to have had a special feeling for the life of the vagabond ; he relished the grotesque elements in it , and sketched it in " Pablo " with so racy a touch that the story gains new vitality from his embellishment of it . Yet so wide was his scope that it may be doubted if the figures in his compositions are any more effective in preserving the illusion than are the 330 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere architectural or landscape backgrounds against which they are placed . In his treatment of these things he used great restraint . Indoors or out , he looked only for the essentials , and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by itself a joy to the connoisseur of the art of omission . One of his " Pablo " drawings has always seemed to me to illustrate this point particularly well . It is the sketch of Pablo in converse with a pedestrian beneath the shadow of the old Roman aqueduct at Segovia . Who but Vierge , I wonder , could have introduced that cyclopean structure into a design , the picturesqueness of which is so light in hand , with such aptness and such skill ? He indicates the great mass of masonry with lines of the utmost delicacy , keeps the motive in due subordination to the two figures in the foreground , yet there you have El Puente del Diablo in all its stark weightiness ? an instance , if ever there was one , of " local color " judiciously applied . Vierge was chary of his blacks when distributing his light and shade . The richest in tone of all his " Pablo " drawings is the night scene in which the hero has his encounter with the alguazils , and this is chiefly remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design with brush or pen , but especially with the pen , would have shattered the darkness of the cavernlike street with violent strokes of light , and would have turned the shadows into pools of inkiness. 1 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 331 Vierge liked the quieter key . Even when his scenes are bathed in light he keeps them , somehow , cool ; there is no glare , there is no shock in the transition from sunshine into shadow . He knew all that there is for the pen draughtsman to know about values and rendered a Spanish street or square , or open landscape , with a truthfulness that evades many a painter using a varied palette . Still further to demonstrate his fertility and his deftness of hand , he threw in , as though for good measure , head and tail pieces as truly decorative in conception as they are polished in execution . He was a master of the vignette as he was a master of the full-dress composition ; his still life is as effective in its way as his most ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shown in the pages of " Pablo " and elsewhere when paralysis deprived him of the use of his right hand , and he had to begin life all over again under a terrible handicap . Training himself to draw with his left hand , however , he became proficient enough not simply to carry on his work as before , but to undertake an heroic task ? and to finish it . This was the illustration of " Don Quixote , " which he undertook for the Scribners and completed on the eve of his death . Going slowly over the plates in this book as the four volumes went through the press , a process which , as it happened , I was privileged to follow from the beginning to the end , I marvelled anew that an artist situated as he was 332 Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere could have had the courage to embark upon such an enterprise , to say nothing of seeing it through . When I saw him in his studio not long before he started this series , it was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it plain that , having once conquered his physical disability , he recovered all his brilliancy of style , and , in power of invention , made a stride forward . They reveal him as an extraordinary illustrator of Cervantes , following the immortal narrative with unerring perception for the right passage to illustrate , and with as sure a faculty for giving the right form to his illustration . His inspiration never flags ; there is not a perfunctory drawing in the whole collection . The gaunt hero of the Spanish classic carries himself throughout with a kind of galliard austerity , but his expression is never stereotyped . The broad humor so well exploited in illustrating Quevedo is exchanged for a kindlier sense of fun , and at the same time , in setting forth those wonderful adventures , Vierge employed all his old vivacity , all his dramatic point . As you turn the pages you will note the artist 's freedom in grouping , his readiness in characterization , his veracious and picturesque touch in the handling of landscape and architecture , and his adroitness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition , that the work as a whole possesses a richer significance ; that Vierge truly rose to the height of his theme and , responding to the finer apSpanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere 333 peal in Cervantes than that which he had found in Quevedo , produced a masterpiece greater even than his " Pablo . " The " Don Quixote " drawings are lighter in tone than their famous predecessors ; I suppose because long confinement to the studio had unconsciously adjusted the artist 's vision to a more subdued key . But this only heightens the charm of his designs , making the delicacy of his line more apparent . The publication of the book , marking the crowning achievement of a well-spent life , was a memorable event in the history of illustrated literature . SECULAR TYPES IN ITALIAN MURAL DECORATION I PINTORICCHIO OF Bernardino di Benedetto di Biagio , called it Pintoricchio , or the Little Painter , Vasari says that " although he performed many labors , and received aid from many persons , he had nevertheless a much greater name than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuted Vasari , but has , on the whole , made reservations leaving the Umbrian painter in a somewhat ambiguous position . Those who love him rank him with Perugino . Those who view him with more temperate feelings are constrained to admit that he stands somewhere below the atrabilious yet exquisitely lyrical painter of Citta della Pieve . The exact truth lies , of course , between the two extremes , with this interesting point to be remembered : that Pintoricchio , for all his declinations from this standard or that in some of the elements of his art , had nevertheless a distinction in one field which he made 337 Italian Mural Decoration peculiarly his own . One begins by comparing his decorations with those of Carpaccio and Raphael , his Venetian and Roman contemporaries , but one ends by perceiving that his work was in some respects essentially different from theirs , and therefore to be approached by a different canon of criticism . Interest in his art , perennial for all close students of Italian painting , was revived for the public at large when those chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorations of his had been hidden , were opened in 1897 . They were executed for the Borgian Pope , Alexander VI , and in more ways than one they glorify the sinister family to which that Pontiff belonged . Not only is Alexander himself portrayed in one of the frescos , but in the design representing St. Catherine before the Emperor the latter is impersonated by Casar Borgia , and Lucrezia , of edifying memory , figures as the Saint . The five apartments in which the surviving members of Pintoricchio 's scheme exist make part of a suite of six which belong to the Vatican library and have always been specially designated as the Borgia apartments . Pintoricchio completed them in 1498 . It was Pope Leo XIII who made himself responsible for the comparatively slight restoration they needed and had the rooms put in appropriate condition . Pintoricchio was born at Perugia in 1454 . He died at Siena in 1513 , according to Vasari , from // ignoble vexation , but , on other testimony , from hunger and neglect , his wife and her lover having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill . Vasari states that Perugino was his master , but it has been pointed out that Perugino was only eight years older than Pintoricchio , and that the latter was more probably a pupil of Bonfigli or Fiorenzo di Lorenzo . Be this as it may ? and the hypothesis of Pintoricchio 's having studied under Fiorenzo di Lorenzo seems to me particularly plausible ? it is plain from internal evidence that he must have profited by Perugino 's example , and that he must also have obtained inspiration from companionship with the young Raphael , whom he would have met in Perugino 's bottega . These points , however , can not be traversed minutely here , nor can I go over the old controversy about the share which Raphael may or may not have had in the Piccolomini frescos at Siena . Vasari , with his genial recklessness in playing ducks and drakes with another man 's reputation , has been responsible for so many fruitless burrowings among the records of Italian art that his innuendoes about the Siena decorations may be ignored in this brief essay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in Siena , as in the Vatican and in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo , at Rome , the work left by Pintoricchio is of a sort to justify him against all the historians , from Vasari down , who are disposed to impugn his originality . In these three places , and in // some others , Pintoricchio can afford to snap his fingers at this kind of criticism . He had qualities akin to those of Perugino and Raphael and was , in fact , as I have indicated , strengthened in his art by their example , but he never leaned upon them , he stood on his own feet . One more citation from Vasari and I have done with that indispensable but sometimes exasperating chronicler . " Bernardino was much in the habit , " he says , " of decorating his pictures with ornaments in relief covered with gold , for the satisfaction of persons who understood but little of such matters , to the end that they might have a more showy appearance , a thing which is most unsuitable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Caterina in the above-named apartments in the Vatican , he executed the triumphal arches of Rome , therefore , in relief , and painted the figures in such a manner that the objects which should diminish are brought more prominently forward than those others which should be larger to the eye , a grievous heresy in our art . " Making due allowance for Vasari 's offended orthodoxy in this passage , we reach in it , nevertheless , one of the crucial elements in Pintoricchio 's genius . Other Italians had employed raised details in their work , in easel pictures , as well as in decorative panels . Pintoricchio used them as an important factor in work executed on a large scale , depending upon them for much of his effect . His gilding was devised as // though by inspiration for that splendid pageant which was his aim and for the creation of which he is to be regarded as apart from all his countrymen . The Borgia rooms being somewhat similar in construction to Raphael 's famous " Stanze , " and possessing surfaces , curved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , they have sometimes been mentioned in the same breath with them . They are poles apart . Raphael had essentially a philosophic mind , he unfolded symbolic compositions upon the walls of the Vatican , and the philosophers , almost as much as the artists and critics , have pondered his work . Pintoricchio threw himself into what might be called ecclesiastical metaphysics in the Borgia frescos ? probably because Pope Alexander ordered him to do so ? but the key to the work is not metaphysical , it is one of narration purely . Our artist was a born story-teller . He had proved this before he came to Rome , when painting the Piccolomini frescos at Siena . He proceeded to elaborate all kinds of lofty schemes in the Vatican . The decorations celebrate solemn religious themes , saintly martyrdoms and even more esoteric ideas of a classical and learned nature . But while it would no doubt be legitimate to appraise the Borgia designs as imaginative schemes imperfectly done , it seems more just to regard them ? as one regards the walls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the thing that Pintoricchio , consciously or unconsciously , // always aimed at ; this is the thing which he unmistakably secures . He paints a procession , he paints the movements of picturesque groups , and he still quivers with the life of his ornate time . Just what the groups are doing , just what they signify , we can not always tell . The frescos of the Vatican will not yield to the analysis which sets the decorations of Siena before us as a sort of historical document . I have called him a born story-teller . In so far as his meaning is obscure he belies the epithet . But he has all of the story-teller 's vividness , all his skill in making companies of men and women concrete , plausible , human . We can fancy him appalled at the Pope 's request for one symbolical design or another , and then blithely going to work with no other thought than to put the personages demanded by his master into natural , genial attitudes , as so many actors in a beautiful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is rarely a hint of dramatic ingenuity in his work , but he is a modern of the moderns in the spontaneity of his accent , in the naturalness of his crowds . Having decided to set forth his group , having laid out his background of landscape and architecture , having evolved , as it were , another page of his picture-book , Pintoricchio drew upon those resources which Vasari thought so heretical . He had others . He had brilliant coloring ? some of it among the most brilliant of the Renaissance ? and he had draughtsItalian // manship , fortifying , in its turn , a happy gift of characterization when it came to the introduction into his design of such tangible types as Lucrezia or Casar or the Pope himself . But the raised details were necessary to him , they helped him to get that warmth and even that splendor which are as the crown and finish to his art . The eye lingers over the individual figures in his compositions as it lingers over those in the pictures of the Bellini , of Carpaccio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longhi . But most of all the spectator is aware of a broad and beautiful impression as of something gorgeous passing by , of glimpses into a quaint and yet majestic world where amazing people jostle one another on their way to the execution of some business or other ? one does not quite know what it is and does not quite care . Of course , this purely sensuous appeal of Pintoricchio 's has its drawbacks . A little of Raphael 's intellectuality would be welcome . Something of Perugino 's tender Umbrian charm would transmogrify the whole work . But tenderness in Pintoricchio was always limited . It comes to the surface fitfully in some of his smaller paintings , but when he is working as at Siena and in the Vatican the essential spirit of the man dominates him and puts the lyrical note into the background while a frankly material feeling comes to the front . Fortunately the materialism is never gross . On the contrary , there is a touching naivete about Pintoricchio even in his most superb // flights of courtly pride . He may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Umbrian landscape which Raphael found it hard to forget in the midst of his Roman triumphs ; he may have missed the last secret of that feminine witchery , that pensive beauty , which the business-like Perugino knew and worshipped , for all his hardness and sordid , jealous passion . But he was an Italian living in the time of the Renaissance , he was quick , receptive , full of lively feeling , and sensitive to the spell of beauty in all but its most poetic relations . The upshot of it all is that he is neither a major nor a minor painter , but one of those rare individualities who through the richness of their merits and the qualities of their defects become inexplicably endeared where greater men are regarded with not half so much affection . The Siena frescos would alone have kept him famous . The opening of the Borgia apartments , the decorations of which are in very nearly as perfect a state of preservation as those of the Piccolomini library , have heightened and extended his renown . Some artists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent forces , with nothing in them for modern emulation , but , as a matter of fact , they are full of living inspiration . Puvis de Chavannes recognized this , going even further back than to Pintoricchio and profiting by the example of the Giotteschi . I have referred to Pintoricchio 's // modernity of spirit . He had also , and so had Carpaccio , Mantegna , Raphael , Signorelli , Sodoma , Michael Angelo , and Perugino , extraordinary modernities of design . That is to say , these painters exercised exactly the arts of composition which are required , to-day in decorative painting . Moreover , since modern mural painting ? as the French have shown much more than the Americans ? must concern itself with the narration of historical events and with the representation of scenes from actual life , there is obvious benefit to be derived from men who were above all things skilful in the adaptation of virile themes to architectural spaces . Raphael was a philosophic painter , but in the famous scene of the conflagration in the Borgo he handled prosaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Parnassus . " Pintoricchio had remarkable ability in this grouping of unimaginative subjects with appropriateness to the form of his wall . The Siena decorations glorify the travels of AEneas Piccolomini , and some of the episodes treated are of the most matter-of-fact description , but the figures are disposed between the dividing pilasters with as much regard for the general effect of the whole chamber as though they were parts of a conventional design . In his strictly conventional work , too , Pintoricchio has much to teach the moderns , just as Raphael has much to teach them in the " Loggie " of the Vatican . Both men appreciated the value of arabesques and of geometrical patterns // skilfully applied . In the Vatican the attention is naturally concentrated upon Pintoricchio 's paintings , but his stucco ornamentation and his laying out of the ceilings will be recognized as equally characteristic of his genius . He , with all his astonishing facility in purely pictorial directions , was , nevertheless , incapable of the loosely scattered effects to which the modern mural painter is so prone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Borgia apartments , but in both cases he bound the pages together so symmetrically , with so penetrating a sense of their interdependence , that , while he falls far short of the grandeur of Raphael , he is comparable to him in the unity of his work with the architecture in which it is set . II GHIRLANDAJO Amongst the Florentine painters of the Renaissance Ghirlandajo occupies a position indubitably honorable , yet not to this day permanently fixed . Like Pintoricchio he has his rather grudging critics . For one who will whole-heartedly laud him there are generally several who will patronize his art , if they do not dismiss him with something like contempt as " a mere illustrator . " Well , as we have seen in our brief survey of the work of Pintoricchio , illustration , // according to the hypothesis of the old Italian mural decorators , could take on a not by any means negligible significance . In the hands of Domenico Ghirlandajo it was made extraordinarily beguiling . This painter , who was born in 1449 and died forty years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was known as " del Ghirlandajo " from the gold and silver garlands made in his workshop for the Florentine ladies to wear in their hair . The lad was apprenticed to his father 's craft , but he soon turned to painting , under the instruction of Baldovinetti . He was quick and clever and readily made a career for himself . As this developed he showed that he had profited by study of the works of men greater than his chosen master . In his earlier productions the influence of Masaccio has been traced , as well as that of Verrocchio . He was not to disclose a genius comparable with that of either of those two great painters , and this not simply because he lacked their power in respect to style , but because he had nothing like their subtler resources . He was not a high-souled creative genius , and , in fact , if you begin to compare him with this or that Renaissance type of the noblest calibre you steadily expose his limitations . He has not an atom of the linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roman austerity and power , none of the plastic grace of Mantegna . But it would be manifestly unfair to dwell on the things which Ghirlandajo lacked . The // important point is to apprehend him for what he was . The most recent and on the whole the most favorable of his biographers , Mr. Gerald S. Davies , concisely and accurately describes him as " the simple , straightforward historian of the outward appearance of the life of the Renaissance as he saw it and knew it in the town which he knew best and loved best ? his own Florence . " In this character he distinguished himself with a sympathy and a skill making him invaluable to the student of his time , and , what is more , delightful to the lover of Renaissance painting who is not obsessed by a desire to distribute pedagogic marks of merit among all the members of the Florentine school . He was an adept at pictorial narrative , and he had a passion for portraiture , as well as a kind of loving flair for the details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His frescos in the Sistine Chapel and elsewhere are dignified performances , imbued with sincere if not profound emotion . Mr. Davies , discussing the question of what his painter made of the figure of Christ , is perhaps unnecessarily analytic . He finds in Ghirlandajo 's ideal " more of manhood than in the sweet and feminine beauty of Perugino , but far less of sorrowful dignity and depth of feeling , far less of the Divine , than in his great contemporary Leonardo . " He goes on to bring Piero della Francesca and Melozzo da Forli into the argument . All this is beside the point . It is better // to face the fact that Ghirlandajo had no great spiritual inspiration and have done with it . One may grant , also , with the same promptitude , that he was no more the master of composition than he was the master of line ; but his work has the vitality of work that is founded on life . Though he was not a draughtsman or a designer of genius , he drew and designed well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bodied forth his figures not only truthfully but with some breadth and nervous force . He was a competent craftsman , a painter who knew how to fill a given space in such wise that you can not pass his decorations by , but must pause and look with ever-growing sympathy upon his intimate scenes and friendly , human personages . Witness , for example , that fresco of his in Santa Maria Novella , " The Birth of the Virgin Mary , " which shows him at his best . Could anything be more beguiling than this interior , in which St. Anne and the women about her are put before us with no pretence whatever that they have not been studied from Ghirlandajo 's contemporaries in a Florentine palazzo ? The maiden who advances toward the nurses and their little charge is believed to be Lodovica Tornabuoni , but even if her name had never been surmised we would know that in this figure , as in every other included in the composition , the painter had made a portrait . That , in fact , was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work any num350 Italian Mural Decoration ber of personages have been identified . In the fresco of " Zacharias and the Angel , " for example , also in Santa Maria Novella , we may see not only divers members of the Tornabuoni and Tornaquinci families , but the noted humanists , Cristoforo Landini , Poliziano and Marsilio Ticino . Because Ghirlandajo was content to bring these people into his paintings , grouping them adroitly and with animation , but showing no poignant emotion and no rare inventive faculty , and because , finally , his style is not far above the pedestrian order , he is frequently dismissed , as I have said , as just an illustrator . But are not his illustrations charming ? Was he not an accomplished painter according to his lights ? Could he not , on occasion , fashion a Madonna full of matronly dignity and touched with a grave sweetness ? Moreover , is not that portraiture of his something in itself altogether captivating ? No merely bourgeois hand could have produced that lovable portrait of an old man and his grandson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile , in Mr. Morgan 's collection , of Giovanna degli Albizzi . Ghirlandajo is one of those painters who we know perfectly well are not demigods , like Michael Angelo or Leonardo , but whose lesser gifts are equally authentic and whose services to us it is foolish to underestimate and vulgar to scorn . // III CARPACCIO When Pompeo Molmenti and his friend Gustav Ludwig were writing their fine biography of Vittore Carpaccio they delved deep into Venetian history and brought to light all the facts about their hero that are likely ever to be known . But the prettiest " find " in their volume is a passage of modern origin , a fragment of a letter by Burne-Jones . " Of all things , " he writes to Lady Lewis , " do go to the little chapel of S. Giorgio degli Schiavoni , where the Carpaccios are . The tiniest church that ever was , like a very small London drawing-room ? but with pictures ! ! ! And whenever you see him give him my love . " It is in just this spirit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venetian painter . If he is anything he is lovable , a type of peculiarly sweet and winning art . Carpaccio , born in the middle of the fifteenth century , touches hands , so to say , on one side with the tradition of the Venetian primitives , and on the other with that of the golden age . He preserved in his work much of the naivete of the formative period in the history of the school . We read of him as being summoned in company with his master , Lazzaro Bastiani , to appraise Giorgione 's paintings on the facade of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi , and this episode // vividly brings home to us the fact of his contact with the movement which owed so much to the painter of Castelfranco and to Titian . Yet Carpaccio never developed the glowing tones which were ultimately to dominate Venetian painting . His color , which is sometimes exquisite , is , on the whole , restrained . Indeed , the whole character of his work is that of an artist in no wise impassioned , but trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived . The fates conspired to give him precisely the opportunities calculated to be favorable to the development of his gifts . We know that he was employed with Gentile and Giovanni Bellini and others to decorate the Hall of the Great Council in the Ducal Palace with historical compositions , but even if his contributions to this vast scheme had not been destroyed by the great fire of 1577 we would have the essentials of his art in those works which he produced for one or another of the fraternities conspicuous in the social and religious life of his day . These organizations wanted a painter of picture-books , and such a painter they found in Carpaccio . It was customary in old Venice for men and women to form themselves into schools or societies dedicated to the observance of religious duties and to the forwarding of good works . Always these bodies enrolled themselves beneath the standard of some saint . Thus the " Scuola of Devotion of St. Ursula " framed its statutes and rules at once in the service of the // Madonna and in that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as may be seen from the decree of the Council of Ten relating to the Dalmatian Scuola officially recognized in 1451 . Having heard the devout and humble petition of certain Sclavonian sailors , resident in this blessed city of Venice , moved by piety , knowing and observing the infinite variety of men of their nation . . . stricken to death , or sickness , who perish of necessity and hunger , having no support , nor help from any one in this world because they are aliens . . . leave was implored by the said Sclavonians to form in Venice a Brotherhood , otherwise a Scuola , according to the manner of the other small Scuole in honor of Messer S. George and Messer S. Tryphonius in the church of Messer S. John of the Templars . . . by means of which the said supplicants can receive and hold alms for the support of such of their brethren , and besides that the said brethren can go and carry to burial the said brethren for the Love of God , and can place their corpses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waxed the more popular and prosperous they built their places of meeting the more luxuriously , and , of course , sought the aid of art . Carpaccio appears to have become a kind of painter in ordinary to the Scuole . For the brethren of St. Ursula he painted the canvases which were originally placed on the walls of a building erected beside the church of SS . Giovanni e Paolo , but which are now housed in the Academy . For the Dalmatians aforesaid he made the series which may still be seen at S. Giorgio degli Schiavoni . For the Albanians in Ven- // ice he produced the series , now scattered , illustrating the life of the Virgin . He painted other pictures , and some of them , like the " Presentation " for the Church of San Giobbe , now in the Academy , are superb monuments to his genius , but you get the fullest sense of his character as an artist from the " picture-books " he made for the Scuole . I call them picture-books , because in each set of decorations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling his story in a succession of scenes , which might have , now and again , a certain mystical significance , but which he always interpreted as closely as possible in terms of ordinary Venetian life . He copied the gait and demeanor of his contemporaries , reproduced their costumes with minute care , and in his accessories , as in his broad effect , sought an intimately realistic impression . There is an almost domestic note in his religious designs . His St. Ursula asleep in bed might be a kinswoman in his own house , and the picture he made of St. Jerome in his study was doubtless based on a room familiar to the painter in its every detail . Carpaccio had a fine sense of composition , which comes out magnificently in a painting like the St. Giobbe altar-piece mentioned above , but in his Scuole pictures his feeling for design is subordinated to his eager desire to tell a straightforward and artless story . This is where his naivete comes in . He is too keen on his narrative to worry overmuch about questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colvin pointed out resemblances between episodes in works by Carpaccio and drawings made by one Reuvich for Breydenbach 's " Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam , " printed at Mayence in 1486 . If he plagiarized it was only in the most innocent and childlike fashion and with no sacrifice of his individuality . He simply took what would help him to build up his simple tale , making it the more natural and picturesque . There was , in fact , a good deal of the ingenious craftsman about Carpaccio . There was also a good deal of heart , of warm and tender feeling for religious things . His spirituality was none the less genuine because he expressed it in pictures reflecting Venetian types and ways . He was profoundly sincere . The criticism which would pigeon-hole and label every manifestation of art would assign to him a modest place in the hierarchy of Venetian painting . But it is wiser to take him for what he is ; to rejoice in his simple realism and his unworldly spirit , and ignore the question as to his relative value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiepolo . Indeed , a great gulf stretches between the naive illustrator of fifteenth-century manners , with his simple but sincere religious sentiment , and the worldly , even // pagan artist who gayly decorated the churches , palaces and villas of Venice in her decadence . But that gulf is easily bridged where types of authentic power are concerned . The transition from Carpaccio to Tiepolo is , after all , that from one true artist to another , a transition never impeded by differences of temperament . To sit for a quiet hour in that little church of San Giorgio degli Schiavoni , with mind and heart attuned to the pure and almost childlike inspiration of Carpaccio 's paintings there , and to plunge immediately afterward into Tiepolo 's hectic monde is to feel , momentarily at least , that a rather unedifying descent has been made . But the observer 's mood is soon changed . He sees that Tiepolo 's violence , after Carpaccio 's tranquillity , may be the sign of a lower nature , but is also compatible with the exercise of great artistic gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fade , for he perceives that , as a technician , as a painter , Carpaccio was scarce qualified to grind Tiepolo 's colors . The eighteenth-century decorator may not have had a great soul , he may not have had the faintest spiritual emotion , but he was a prodigious man of his hands . Without underestimating his mentality , we may still see in him just the consummate and prolific craftsman . We recognize in him , too , that central virtue of sane vigor which will lend a kind of dignity even to an artist not exceptionally dowered with intellectual or imaginative power . There is a curious contrast between the man and // his time . When Tiepolo was born , late in the seventeenth century , the glory of Venice had begun to wane . Elements of corruption were at work in her political and industrial life . Manners were deteriorating . The old heroic traits of the people had practically disappeared and an enfeebled populace had only the artists it deserved . The splendid tradition of Veronese was seemingly as dead as nail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could no further go than in the crowded yet strangely empty compositions of a Bastiano Ricci or a Gregorio Lazzarini . Then appeared Giovanni Battista Tiepolo , like a portent in the sky , and eighteenth-century Venetian art was conclusively rescued from its sad estate . There were other painters who were to make the period memorable ? Canaletto and Guardia with their pictures of the lagoons and the monuments of the city ; Rosalba , with her bewitching portraits , and , in the later years of the century , Pietro Longhi , with his vivacious souvenirs of everyday familiar life . But it was only Tiepolo who possessed positive genius ; he alone it was who revived something of the splendor of an earlier day . It is a pity that we can not know more about the man , about his personality and private life . Signor Molmenti , his efficient biographer , is zealous in research , but he has very little to communicate on the more intimate side of Tiepolo 's career . We know that he came from an humble and even obscure // family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annals of the Venetian nobility . We know that he received instruction from Lazzarini and that he married a sister of Guardi 's . But , for the rest , his story is no more than a record of his work . One fact is made plain by that record ? his energy as a traveller . He moved to and fro on Venetian territory and elsewhere in Italy executing commissions , and professional engagements also carried him to Germany and to Spain , if not further afield . Another revelation lying upon the surface of his work bears upon his whole character as an artist . His productivity was enormous . If there is one thing more than another that impresses the student it is his rapid execution , the miraculous ease with which he fills vast spaces . Tiepolo 's art is fairly electrical in its note of animation . The mythological and religious subjects abounding in his work are not by any means profoundly conceived ? but then one does not go to him for ideas . His genius is decorative , in the strictest meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish in this matter . The decorative tradition of Raphael is one essentially formal . That of Tintoretto is turbulent with the vitality of life itself . Tiepolo abides by the laws of neither the one nor the other . He does not depend upon the scientifically fixed balance so indispensable to the Roman master . He does not seek the poignant dramatic effect always // characteristic of the great Venetian . He frames an ideal of his own , an ideal of aerial space in which figures are piled helter-skelter upon billowing clouds , or wanton in the empyrean with an almost birdlike freedom . He knew , of course , how to order his resources , how justly to fill a given space ; he is entirely rational beneath his seeming airs of reckless improvisation . But the broad impression received from his work is that of a joyous riot of form and color , light and air , of wonderfully poised movement . There is something about him that suggests a great master of the ballet , a man with a gift for deploying his figures in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , but always preserving control over his forces , always adhering more or less to a well-pondered pattern . It is one of the paradoxes of artistic history that this mundane painter , who lightly sentimentalized nearly every religious motive that he touched and turned the gods and goddesses of mythology into operatic figurantes , nevertheless had the largest possible way with him when he tackled a spacious ceiling in church or palace . He was as lavish of thrones as Napoleon himself . It would be amusing to count the number of them reared amid his clouds , or set against the architectural backgrounds he was wont to use on vertical walls or in many of his smaller pictures . He liked the regal type , whether it was Cleopatra or some divinity on Olympus , and he would trick it out with 36o Italian Mural Decoration the most gorgeous habiliments . Did he thereby make it the more convincing ? The question is embarrassing for a lover of Tiepolo . He knows well enough that he could not for a moment believe in his painter 's imaginings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiepolo could not pull himself up by his boot-straps . He was a child of his time , and he had the fancy of a clever man rather than the creative imagination of a poet . Compare him , for a moment , with Watteau . The romance of the dainty melancholy Frenchman is thin enough , but in his " Embarkation for Cythera , " for example , you can still hear , faint but true , the music of faery . Tiepolo is all for the theatre . His paintings of martyrdoms cause no shudders . There is nothing tragic about his Iphigenia , though he paints that marble heroine at the moment of sacrifice . He gives you cunningly arranged tableaus , not scenes vibrating with passion . It is with a certain amazement that one pauses before his " Supper at Emmaus , " in the Louvre . By what stroke of fortune , you ask , did he obtain the illumination which led him to the painting of that picture ? not a great picture , but not , on the other hand , one without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectator cold and sometimes they very nearly move him to a smile . There is an " Annunciation " of his in a private collection at Madrid which is positively comic . The Virgin , standing in her humble room , is dignified // enough , but her winged visitant is literally flopped down upon the floor , and is as grotesque as a figure in a pantomime . It is only when he is illustrating some love-story , like that of Rinaldo and Armida , or is painting scenes of secular pomp , as in the decoration of the Palazzo Labia , or is sketching some episode of Venetian life , as in the " Carnival " which belonged to the late Princess Mathilde , that he is on firm ground as regards the substance of his work . In the main his figures are merely so many bodies to be played with for pictorial and decorative effect . But how superbly he plays with them ! He used them in two ways . Either he flung them with magnificent gesture upon his luminous ceilings , or , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score of other places , he disposed them with much elegance ? and occasionally some humor ? against doorways and window-casings , between cool , stately pillars , or in the reposeful attitudes invited by a convenient bench or balustrade . Wherever he painted his grandly robed gods , his nude nymphs , or his ladies and cavaliers in the latest Venetian velvets and ruffles , he drew his models with incomparable sureness and grace and lavished upon them the colors of a palette in which you find reflected the pinks and whites of roses , the blues of heaven and the pearly , glowing flesh tints of Aphrodite fresh risen from the sea . Tiepolo put forth , as has been indicated , an immense amount of work , and an astonishing propor362 Italian Mural Decoration tion of it shows him at his best , but if his very essence is to be found anywhere it is to be found in the study of " The Car of Venus , " a sketch for a ceiling , which hangs in the Prado . The light charm of the design is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glamour of exquisite color . Never were there purer , more flowerlike effects ; never was sensuousness nearer to getting itself turned into something subtly poetical . That , then , is Tiepolo 's supreme gift , a gift for covering a surface with gay and lovely forms , with color as soft and pleasing as the down on a peach , and so skilfully organizing this entrancing frou-frou of his that it becomes magnificently decorative . In the eyes of some enthusiasts he is not unworthy of Veronese , and , indeed , when you think of the wholesome , robust way in which Tiepolo developed his art you can not deny his right to a place in the great hierarchy of Venetian painting . He had not Veronese 's weight and grandeur . But he had the master 's sincerity and he was , like Veronese , an artist of genius . XII RODIN WHAT immeasurable good luck has followed this artist ! No doubt he has had his vicissitudes , in the distant past , but for some years now the Fates have been more than kind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his art conspicuously before the world . In fact , Rodin 's career as a spoilt child of fortune makes a story by itself . An article in Le Temps not long ago represented him as saying that on a visit that he had made to Rome he was scrupulously left alone by the members of the French diplomatic circle there and the people of the Villa Medici , in which neglect he saw an official condemnation of his works . However this may be , it is to be noted that the government commissioned his gigantic ? and still unfinished ? " Porte de 1'Enfer " as far back as 188o , and it has generously entreated him ever since . You positively stumble upon his sculptures in the Luxembourg , there are so many of them in that museum , and elsewhere in Paris they turn up . His " Victor Hugo , " in marble , has been placed in the gardens of the Palais Royal . He has contributed to the inside of the 365 // Pantheon , and one of his most important monuments , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that building . It is true that the Societe des Gens de Lettres rejected his " Balzac , " but there was never any occasion for regarding that incident with sorrow , the truth being that in so far as it made a martyr of Rodin it also stimulated to frenzy the enthusiasts who have long made it their business to see that he was not left to toil in obscurity . There is already in existence a large literature relating to the sculptor . Leon Maillard published a book about him in 1899 ? a book especially valuable , by the way , for its illustrations . Another volume , by Camille Mauclair , appeared in an English translation in 1905 . Two years later Mr. Frederick Lawton brought out an exhaustive biography , and in 1908 there appeared in Brussels the monumental folio by Judith Cladel . There is a booklet in the " Langham Series " devoted to Rodin , a brief study by Rudolf Dircks , and , unless memory fails me , there is a second monograph by a German author . As for articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seashore . Multitudes of writers have found good " copy " in Rodin . Finally he has taken to letters himself . Grasset , the Paris publisher , recently issued , under the title of " L'Art , " a volume in which the sculptor 's conversations with his friend Paul Gsell are , by the latter , piously reported and , more recently , this work has been put into Eng- // lish . Never was an artist kept more devotedly in the public eye . The sentimentalists have risen en masse to declare his fame , and it is perhaps no wonder that he is to-day one of the most fashionable makers of portraits in the world and the object of a cult . Neither is it surprising that he has become a little oracular in his sayings and a little complacent in his work . What does it all amount to , and how are we really to regard this man of genius , who is also the hero of a preposterous reclame ? It is indispensable , at the outset , to lay hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all events was there when Rodin was in his prime . Nor is there anything at all esoteric or baffling about it . His hierophants , of course , would have it that there is something about him grand , gloomy and peculiar , and quite beyond the scope of ordinary canons of appreciation . They are the people who in an earlier generation would have stupefied themselves making guesses at the Correggiosity of Correggio . Now they occupy themselves with the Rodinesquerie of Rodin . Of this it is enough to say that " there ai n't no sich thing . " Rodin is not a mystic , thinking profound thoughts and embodying them in puzzling forms . Take , for example , his group called " Pygmalion and Galatea . " Rodin once showed Gsell the first ebauche for that composition , wherein he represented the embrace of a nymph and a faun . Naturally , his interlocutor 11 // was astonished , and wondered if subject , as subject , meant anything to the sculptor . It did not do , the latter replied , to give too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he added , they had their value and helped to interest the public , but the great anxiety of the artist , he maintained , should be to get the play of living muscle into his work ; the rest mattered little . That carries us quickly to the point with Rodin . It is merely life that has interested him , and , with life , character and expression . His genius has been for these things , and for these things alone . It is an old story that when he sent " The Age of Brass " to the Salon in 1877 the jury accused him of having put before them nothing more nor less than a cast from life . They could not have paid him a juster compliment . Gsell , describing his master 's method of work , tells us that Rodin is wont to have several nude models , men and women , moving about in the studio . He is always watching them , training his eye , and presently , when he notes a good pose , he arrests the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be something in this more favorable to spontaneous effect than the mode followed in most studios , where the model takes an attitude fixed by the sculptor , but he wondered if Rodin 's system did not put him , so to say , at the orders of his models . " No , " replied the artist , " I am not at their orders , but at those of Nature . " He qualifies the principle // there laid down , however , by observing that everything still depends upon the eye of the artist . The mediocre craftsman , interpreting a pose , thus observed , would not get out of it that which is accessible to the man of genius . Thus it is interesting to note in passing that Rodin has no patience with those contemporaries of his who complain that they can not make a good portrait unless they have a sitter with an interesting head and face . He , I gather , would undertake to find almost any sitter worth while , and accordingly one is not surprised when in his talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were luckier than ourselves in their models . The Frenchman is not in the least dissatisfied with the men and women who pose for him , and , in fact , grows quite ecstatic over certain of his types , bitterly regretting , as he looks over some of his drawings , that he has not done justice in them to quite obvious traits . We see him , then , in the role of the realist , if we must find some convenient designation for his mode of procedure , and this view of the matter is easily confirmed by reference to his works . Look at such sculptures as the statues of Adam and Eve , the grim study of aged and broken-down womanhood , " La Vieille Heaulmiere , " the statues of " Le Penseur " and " The Age of Brass , " and the busts of Dalou and Puvis de Chavannes . Their first merit is that of truth , clearly grasped and simply expressed . It is , too , a truth having a poignant human origin . // " La Beattie , c'est @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not find character or expression existing in lifeless shells . The best of Rodin 's figures seem to have been realized by him from within outward and hence they possess extraordinary individuality . On the other hand , one has unquestionably seen things more beautiful , and that raises the point as to how far Rodin 's genius " carries , " how far it justifies the vast claims of his admirers . He loves the Greek masters . He collects their works when he can get hold of them , he is always studying them , and something , a faint something , of their exquisite strength has just touched his own artistic character . The hierophants to whom I have already alluded make an easy mouthful of the assumption that in emulating the Greeks he has quite recaptured their power . The disinterested onlooker can hardly see this . Gsell paints us a charming picture of an evening in the studio at Meudon , with Rodin hovering around his antiques , lamp in hand , and exposing with delight the effects of " color " thus extorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique torso , he asks , " Is there not there a prodigious symphony in black and white ? " Unconsciously , as it seems to me , Rodin was thus exposing the little rift within the lute , he was thus marking his essential detachment from the spirit of Greek art . It is the insidious element of " le pittoresque " lurking in the point of view revealed by Gsell 's anecdote that promptly // brings Rodin down to his own level , and careful scrutiny of his art soon gives the measure of his fall . His sculpture is full of " holes , " spots where deep shadows play their indubitably effective part . Bodies are flung about at any angle , limbs are entwined or lifted in nominally sublime gestures to heaven , and one immediate result of this contortion is an amazing play of light and shade . In unskilful hands a procedure of the sort instantly gives itself away , but Rodin is , among other things , uncannily clever , and there is nobody like him for disguising a meretricious habit beneath an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure , the very word . How many times has it not been applied to figures of Rodin 's like the " Adam , " say , in which muscular arms and legs and gnarled extremities recall , as the elect would express it , some early race , heaved up out of the caverns of the earth by the sheer force of nature ? Only this primitiveness does not wear well , especially if you happen to turn back from it to the serene might of Greek or Egyptian sculpture or to the heroic types of Michael Angelo . What is it that first wakes a doubt ? It is that these large contours in Rodin 's art spell not so much style as manner . The dictionary explains the word " mannerism " after a rather formidable fashion . " Monotonous , " it says , " formal or pedantic adherence to the same manner ; uniformity of manner , especially a tasteless uniformity without freedom or variety : excessive adherence // to a characteristic mode or manner of action or treatment . " Let us by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of hurling the dictionary at Rodin 's head . And yet ? there is appositeness in that outrageous definition . Repetition has nearly killed Rodin ; not repetition of specific types of composition , though that has been his tendency , but of that very " effect " of his which he founded , in the beginning , so successfully on truth . It is , after all , rather narrowly the truth of the flesh , endued , as we have seen , with character and expression , but primarily and too exclusively an affair of bone and muscle , blood and skin . Over and over again it comes out in the conversations reported by Gsell that what enthralls Rodin is the body , as the body . Steadily , as time has gone on , he has played with it as with a medium , until a bony plane , a leg full of sinews , a soft voluptuous curve , has come to mean to him what a theme means to the musician improvising upon an instrument . Whither does it all tend ? The genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays , and produces , one after the other , organic fabrics of design . By those works of his you know him for the great creative artist . The lesser man does not fail us in quantity , nor is he necessarily without a certain passing charm , but he remains inchoate and capricious , and by his works you know him , not for the great creative artist , but for the diffusive , unstable " tern- // perament . " Rodin began by suggesting that he might , perhaps , range himself in the first category , and there are among his earlier works pieces so fine that it is idle to imagine their ever falling into oblivion . But for years he has been unmistakably the man of the smaller gift , consummate in his exploitation of that gift , but none the less a man on the wrong track . He aimed at grandeur , as witness the astounding pell-mell of figures in the " Porte de 1'Enfer " and the massy conception of " Les Bourgeois de Calais , " but grandeur was not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He figured to himself Victor Hugo , listening to the voices of nature , and if we are to believe the nonsense of his acolytes the poet as he portrayed him is truly rapt by the murmurs of the sea , but , as a matter of fact , he shows us only an old gentleman looking absurd in the absence of his clothes . He has had any number of noble intentions , which we are told he has fulfilled , but he may design an Apollo in a violent attitude , and we get only attitude ; he may depict for us Ugulino and his sons , but we have simply some sprawling bodies , instead of that figure of freezing horror whose words Matthew Arnold put among the touchstones of great poetry I wailed not , so of stone grew I within , They wailed . That instinct of his for character and expression is searching , so far as it goes , and he moves you Rodin when he wreaks it upon subjects that lie well within his scope . With the mere human animal he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of his portraits , too , have a rich vitality , but it is significant that while he immensely admired Puvis de Chavannes it has been one of the bitterest regrets of his career that his bust of the latter did not please the great painter , who thought it , in fact , a caricature . The episode sheds a little light on the question of Rodin 's ability to rise with his theme . He faced in Puvis de Chavannes a type of great intellectual force , a calm and lofty soul . He could model the stately head and express the physical life in it , but he could do no more . What was subtlest and most precious in his friend 's character escaped him . Apropos of this faltering touch of his when he is moving about in worlds not realized , one may profitably compare the first study for the head of his " Balzac " with the head of his statue as it was finally modelled . The earlier version is the conception of the realist pure and simple . We owe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the would-be dealer in truth heightened by imagination . In neither does he portray the true Balzac , but he is at least on safer ground in the first mask , which is an affair of mere flesh and blood . Extend this criticism from the field of portraiture into that of symbolism and of those poetic myths from which Rodin has drawn so many of his motives , and you fall upon even greater dubiety . Despite // the vaultings of his ambition he does not impress us in his works as a man of ideas , calling new and wonderful things out of the void and animating them with a life stronger than that of poor human clay . Rodin 's obvious handicap has been the quality of his mind and imagination . His is a profoundly sensuous art , sensuous to the core , and while he has been attacking high erected themes these have not , on his own confession , really mattered to him ; it has been enough for him to caress in his marble or bronze a living form . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource . It is a byword among sculptors that Rodin , as a modeller , takes their breath away . His is a fatal facility if ever an artist had that affliction . One of Gsell 's most interesting chapters describes the sculptor modelling in his presence a statuette after the principles of Pheidias , and then doing another a la Michael Angelo . The old fingers worked like magic ; almost in a moment the statuettes were there . It is interesting to know that , and delightful into the bargain . One rejoices in skill so swift and so sure , so responsive to the movement of a fine intelligence . And among Rodin 's works one would have to be much of a pedant and philistine to remain insensitive to that marvellous modelling of his , which is just one endless succession of subtleties pleasing and true . How they soothe the eye ! How you kindle to the mere tenderness of form that they express ! It is amusing , for // a moment , to remember in their presence one achievement of another French master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picture is a wonderful bit of drawing , but it has no warmth , no glow . There is a burning life in Rodin 's nudities . But it is a life invoked through mechanical skill and through a very earthy passion , if that there is no one above the ruck in modern sculpture who is less haunting than Rodin . We observe his work with interest and enjoyment , but it leaves no mark . That seems , perhaps , a risky thing to say of the man who bulks so largely not only in French but in other museums , who has had so many imitators all over the world , and has stimulated such a horde of eulogists to unceasing effort . When one has accounted for all the ignorance and sentimentality that have gone to the promotion of the Rodin legend one is still confronted by a body of opinion , among artists as well as among laymen , which is bound to command respect . It is still permissible to believe , however , that Rodin has been vastly overrated , that his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather narrow boundaries , and that when the imitators and the panegyrists have gone down the wind they will be accompanied by a considerable number of his works . By that time there may be , too , a more general recognition of the fact now so curiously // overlooked , that Rodin came in an epoch not overwhelmingly rich in great sculpture , and by virtue of that very fact secured a not unprofitable salience which might not have been his in other circumstances . The modern French school has been characterized since Rude by thoroughly academic traits , and its leaders , save for a rare type like Dubois , have lacked in distinction what they have possessed in manual dexterity . Rodin , with his truth to nature , his skill in reproducing the surface beauty of nature , his light and shade , and his freedom , has seemed dowered with a greater originality than he actually could claim . He has been the " new " man , the one type that was " different , " and in their longing for reaction against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his contemporaries have hailed him as a kind of Moses , destined to lead them into the promised land . Poor Rodin ! He never dreamed of doing anything of the sort . Sometimes , in the quietude of reflection among his beloved antiques , he must think with a sort of mild astonishment of all the bother that has been made about his art . XIII FOUR LEADERS IN AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE ARCHITECTURE is the most richly vitalized of the arts in America to-day , more closely allied than any other to national needs and taste . In the mere bulk and scope of our building operations we have made , in the last twenty-five or thirty years , such heroic strides that if we had not possessed resourceful designers we would have had to invent them . Imagination boggles at the thought of what the United States would now look like if something like an efficient school of architecture had not been developed to keep abreast of a stupendous material expansion . Industrial prosperity , the growth of railroads , civic and State pride ? all these things have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the stern , practical demands made upon them there has gone an extraordinary artistic stimulus . There are more clever , ambitious men in the profession than ever before in our history , and one has only to take a swift bird's-eye view of what they are doing , from New York to California , to see how high the average of merit is everywhere . The first question raised by such a survey 381 382 Leaders in American Architecture concerns , however , not the men now active but their immediate predecessors . How was this Renaissance brought about ? Who were the givers of the new dis-pensation ? The striking thing about the field of inquiry thus opened before us is the narrowness of its boundaries in respect to time . It is within a comparatively few recent years that American architecture has been made over , and made over , as we shall see , almost as though in a vacuum , with no help from our own historic past . To the casual observer , recalling the Capitol at Washington , certain other public buildings there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall , it might seem that there had been carried over from the eighteenth century , well into the nineteenth , a classical tradition quite inspiring enough for any school to go on with in a fairly vigorous frame of mind . Some of the heroes in that austere but fruitful period died a long time ago : Latrobe in 182o and Bulfinch in 1844 , but others , like McComb , who designed our beautiful City Hall , and lived until 1853 , seem to ' touch hands with the present generation . Isaiah Rogers , who built the old Custom House in Wall Street , was alive in 1869 . Of course , one superficially reflects , they left a school behind them . They did nothing of the sort . When these architectural masters of ours ? for they were masters , in their grave , academic way ? retired from the scene , the Muse strayed off into the wilderness . The Civil War , Leaders in American Architecture 383 doubtless , had something to do with her sulky withdrawal . It took time for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as less ponderable conditions had to suffer readjustment . The buildings waiting for the genius that was to give them form had also to wait for old fortunes to be restored , and new ones to be made , in order that money might be forthcoming to pay for them . Meanwhile , for several decades , say from the thirties into the seventies and even into the eighties , such architecture as appeared on this continent , apart from that proceeding from the old school , was wont to be a fearful and wonderful thing . I would not frame its elegy . The less said about those well-meant aberrations , the Queen Anne cottage , the brown-stone front , the " ornate " public building , etc. , the better . " His name was Dennis , " says one of the talkers in Kipling 's " Conference of the Powers , " when tactless inquiry is made as to some incompetent , " and we 'll let it stay so . " All that we need note at this point is that when the new men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another we owe our present status in architecture , they were offered a clean sheet of paper . The horrors around them were , perhaps , not unhelpful either , for at least they showed the adventurers in strange seas what to avoid . i I H. H. RICHARDSON Leaders in American Architecture They were contemporaries , the architects with whom I am here specially concerned , and hence there is no strict chronological sequence in which to view them ; but in the matter of influence for good or for ill , of the broad relation of each man in the group to their common period of architectural history , we may safely range them in a certain order , beginning with Henry Hobson Richardson . Born in 1839 , he was a younger man , younger by ten years or more , than Hunt , but his course was run quicker and earlier than was that of his friend ; and when I say this I am glancing not-'so much at the date of his untimely death , 1886 , as at the curiously swift and circumscribed nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted . There was a time when Richardson 's vogue was tremendous . The man himself was robust and inspiriting , a type of bold , affirmative force ; his loyal disciples " backed " him not only for what he did but for what he was . La Farge , who used to visit him in old days at his home on Staten Island , before he had " arrived " with his design for Trinity Church and had made his definitive removal to Boston , told me of his ample ways . " Like many other great men he was a mighty eater and drinker ? a pitcher of milk , a pitcher of champagne , a pitcher of water ? everything was done on a large Leaders in American Architecture 385 scale and his work is of that kind . " A Southerner by birth , he began life in New Orleans , but he was educated at Harvard and on his graduation proceeded to Paris , where he entered the Ecole des Beaux Arts and fitted himself for the architectural profession . In one of the letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her biography of Richardson , there is a brief , arresting sentence . " To Athens and Rome I must go , coute que coute , " he exclaims . Curiosity is piqued , but as a matter of fact whether he went or not is beside the point . The interesting thing is that he came back to America in 1862 neither the Renaissance man that he might have been made by the one journey nor the classicist that he might have been made by the other . Nor had the Ecole made him an Academician . His first commission , the Church of the Unity in Springfield , was an essay in English Gothic ! That was built in 1866 . Within three or four years he was designing the Brattle Square Church , in Boston , and modelling its tall tower on an Italian campanile of the earlier type . Other instances might be cited to show an eclectic tendency . But even at this period , in the early seventies , he was feeling his way toward the idiom which was ultimately to distinguish him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity Church , he had this idiom sufficiently under control to use it with a flourish . The Gothic influence persisted , but the Romanesque prevailed . Later 386 Leaders in American Architecture he was to develop still another manner , but his genius was at bottom Romanesque , and so it stayed until he died . It is with the Richardson of Trinity Church that we have to reckon in the perspective of our subject . There is a great building lying about in it , a masterpiece struggling to be born . The huge central tower , so strongly reminiscent of Salamanca , would alone challenge interest and admiration . Perhaps it is in its too proud predominance that we have a clew to Richardson 's predestined failure as a lasting influence ; it marks him the creator of the fine episode rather than of the organic , full-rounded , great design . But I think there is a more conclusive explanation of the fact that most if not all of the enthusiasm he once excited has gone down the wind . Passionately as he cared for his warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nevertheless on the wrong track . While admirers everywhere cheered him on , while clients testified to the faith that was in them by storming him with commissions , while pupils drank in his stirring gospel and presently went forth to practise in offices of their own what he had preached , no one fallen under the Richardsonian spell took account of the little disintegrating force even then working at its centre . This was the too exotic nature of the architect 's inspiration . All our styles have been brought from overseas , but this one , I think , was the hardest to acclimatize , the one most alien to Leaders in American Architecture 387 the genius of the country . When we are flamboyant we are prone to be shrill . Our fervor does not visit us in a vague , cloudy , solemn way ? it flickers . There are no mysterious reverberations about our artistic romanticism . When we are at our worst our utterance is thin and hard . When we are at our best we are above all things glittering and lucid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain sharp , sane , and perhaps somewhat prosaic lucidity which goes with our very blood and tells in our style . And because Richardson quarrelled with it , without having the last imperious power to put a spiritually incongruous , unwelcome inspiration in its place , he remained at the height of his fame , and still remains , a kind of exotic , a mistaken interpreter of his time and his opportunity , a great artist manque . In expressing himself , or perhaps I should say in expressing a misdirected zest , he pleased himself , and , by the same token , countless others . But you get some idea of his irrelevance and thereby of his failure when you note , for example , his resemblance to a painter like Watts , the English idealist who tried to recapture the grand manner of the old Italians and did great work , leaving a great name , but without convincing us that either belongs amongst the things that really endure . Both men tried to pull themselves up by their boot-straps . It ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more composite , more generous soil than ours . Trin388 Leaders in American Architecture ity is a magnificent effort , but it shows the strain . I may risk an appeal to another art . " For poetry , " says Matthew Arnold , " the idea is everything ; the rest is a world of illusion , of divine illusion . " Richardson had the idea ; but the illusion escaped him ; and to architecture such as he strove to make the illusion is indispensable . His art needs depth , warmth , color , and an atmosphere both of ebullient tangible life and of shadowy , even mystical , beauties . It needs illusion , charm . Trinity is stark , muscle-bound , one of the coldest piles in architecture anywhere . Richardson had weight , too much weight . For the burgeoning grace of Romanesque , which enchants even while it gravely impresses , he was heavy-handed . The best monuments to his genius , though not the most characteristic of his ambition , or , unfortunately , the most fertile in influence , are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Court House and Jail at Pittsburg , in which his exuberance is tamed , his style is simplified , and he comes back to plain prose . That , too , he overdid . " A pitcher of milk , a pitcher of champagne , etc . " He would make a warehouse , or , for that matter , a private dwelling , look like a fortress . Whenever he was content to be simple he had , to be sure , his reward . The Richardson who built Sever Hall at Harvard and certain modest libraries and railroad stations in New England will be not ungratefully remembered . Neither , on the other hand , will he be lauded as he once was lauded , Leaders in American Architecture 389 and the imitation of him which raged for a time is unlikely ever to be revived . And yet his place as one of our leaders is secure , for reasons highly germane to the present inquiry . Richardson 's work , diverging from the permanent channel of American art and carrying us for a while into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure stream of ideas and made for a fine standard . He helped to abolish a meretricious regime . He made buildings which if not perfect or in harmony with the true spirit of the age still called men to a higher plane of esthetics . He cleansed taste . Through him architecture was brought nearer to re-establishment as an art . What he did reacted upon the minds of laymen and architects alike , waking new and nobler desires , stimulating new and more intelligent ambitions . His energy reached far . He communicated precious elements of life to a movement needing just the burly impetus that he was qualified to give it . It was his misfortune , not his fault , that he encouraged exoticism , redundancy , and an inexpressive , florid kind of swagger , at a time when the one thing we needed was discipline . 390 Leaders in American Architecture II RICHARD MORRIS HUNT Richardson 's magnificent sincerity and the sheer creative ability of the man gave an astonishing weight to his influence , and there can be no doubt at all that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de force upon us , as the popular solution of our architectural problems , for a number of years on which it is distinctly uncomfortable to reflect . The challenge was to come , however , from at least two powerful quarters , and in both instances it was to drive at that weak point in his armor upon which I have laid stress . Strengthened by European precedent , it was nevertheless to make clear that not everything in Europe is suited to our conditions , that there are traditions infinitely more to our purpose than the Romanesque . Of McKim 's pure style I shall speak later . It worked mighty changes when it came fully into play . But before then Hunt was quietly doing much to redress the balance , and he was doing it because the difference between him and Richardson went to the root of the matter . Richardson was an absolutely idiosyncratic type , a man whose individuality would not down . Hunt abandoned the personal bias at the outset of his career . He was from first to last an academic artist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholastic to the Leaders in American Architecture 391 core . To any one who meditates on the progress of architecture in America at the crucial period of which I speak it is fascinating to watch the two influences working side by side , and to see in the longer survival of Hunt 's another proof of the cosmopolitan , eclectic nature of our art . Richardson 's style was too personal to himself to be communicable , and so it bred only ephemeral imitation . Hunt was all for abstract principles , and these he could and did teach to his countrymen . He did not make them mould their styles on his . But he drilled them in the logic of architecture , in its rectitude , in those elements of it which are independent of temperament and might even be described as independent of time and place . In the light of these ideas he looms as one of the most remarkable artists of his time . One link he had with Richardson , the dominating , enkindling power of the master , and I can not forbear pausing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I used to know him . As a man Richard Morris Hunt was the antithesis of his architectural self . He was a picturesque figure , stalwart for his inches ( he was not tall ) , and with something in his carriage as well as in his manner of speech that made you suspect the military officer rather than the artist . His head was handsome ; it conveyed even an impression of stateliness , at times , under the gray hair . But the air of stateliness was fleeting . In the main , Hunt was prodigiously vivacious , almost a French-i 392 Leaders in American Architecture man in some of his quick passages of talk , and the talk itself was explosive . He liked pungency and never failed to introduce it into his discourse , no matter what the occasion . At a public dinner , no less than in private conversation , he was fond of accentuating what he had to say with that tempestuous rhetoric in which old Mr. Hardcastle indulged , and yet there was no sting of wrath in Hunt 's fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genially , and with a touch of humor that somehow made the objurgation seem almost a form of approval . He would grow apocalyptic sometimes , piling up his denunciation in heroic masses ; but all the time there was the twinkle in the eye that prepared you for the harmless conclusion , and it was usually odds that you would burst into laughter with the crash of the wordy climax . And Hunt laughed with you . He was helpful and sympathetic by nature . To the veriest stranger he was accessible and cordial so soon as he saw that his interlocutor was seriously interested in the question at issue . For in the great question for him , in the question of architecture , his own interest was inexhaustible . As a man he was impulsive , quick-tempered , ebullient , picturesque always . As an architect this unflagging enthusiast , fighting always for what he believed to be the best , could do nothing hasty or ill-considered . The study which engrossed his life was begun when he was only fifteen . At that age he left Bos-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pursuing his education in the High School and the Latin School , and went with his mother to Europe . She took him to Geneva , where in 1843 he entered the architectural atelier of Samuel Darier . From Geneva he proceeded to Paris and continued his studies . Hector Lefuel was his master . Hunt studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts for some time and then went off to Egypt and Asia Minor . Returning to Paris in 1854 he was made Inspecteur des Travaux by the Government , the appointment directing his energies upon the construction of those new buildings which connected the Tuileries with the Louvre . Lefuel was in charge of this work and he gave Hunt the Pavilion de la Bibliotheque for his province . It meant priceless experience to him . It gave him practical training in exactly the school which pleased him most ? the French school of academic architecture , a school in which splendor , and a certain monumental dignity , are the indispensable ingredients of style . When Hunt was engaged upon the Louvre he was still in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to America , with a foreign experience behind him probably unique in the annals of our school . His powers were soon recognized . He had scarcely settled here before he was invited to share in the completion of the Capitol at Washington . He served for six months as assistant to Thomas U. Walter , the architect in charge , and then returned to 394 Leaders in American Architecture New York to found the practice which he carried on to the day of his death in 1895 . He established himself also as the master of an office ? in Paris it would have been called an atelier ? to which the young architects of the country were eager to gain admittance . It was at this time that his influence was perhaps most definite and potent . He drew any number of clever men to his side , and , while no one of the group copied his style , they were all immensely benefited by the sound principles he taught . These were , that architecture to be good must be good in construction , that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that the architect must be above all things moderate , respectful of well-ascertained rules , true to the golden mean of taste marking the school from which Hunt came . A building with him was a problem to be solved with strict reference to the necessities of the situation , and with even stricter reference to laws of proportion , of balance . In a word , he was healthily academic . His genius was not creative and he did not strike out on a new line , but he was brimming over with vitality ; there was nothing crassly conservative about him , and he kept his work within almost severe bounds without ever making it barren or coldly conventional . Richardson triumphed over Hunt in the Trinity competition , but the loser there won elsewhere a longer and a truer victory . His tonic influence , keyed perfectly to the American spirit , was of incalculable value in counteracting the spread of that Leaders in American Architecture 395 Romanesque fallacy whose ravages we have considered . And he proved , too , what it was important to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not incompatible with artistic freedom . ' How far Hunt could go in the direction of mere picturesque charm , for example , when he chose , in the direction of mere elegance and sensuous beauty , he showed in the house for Mr. W. K. Vanderbilt at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-second Street in New York . It is perhaps less characteristic of him than many other designs which might be cited . It is his tour de force , and its revival of old French motives in the environment fixed for it may seem open to question . But it is an enchanting revival , standing alone in all America . There has never been anything to equal it here for grace , for exquisite finish , for a daintiness reminding us of some French chateau with its romantic background rather than of Fifth Avenue . It has often been said that the house needed a park around it . This is very true . It would be greatly enhanced by slight distance , by avenues of trees and by adequate terracing . But just as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picturesque . The ornamentation comes as near to being lace-work in stone as architectural decoration has a right to come . And for a fairly princely effect , for the suggestion of that organized , highly wrought luxury which we associate with European social life , the r ' 396 Leaders in American Architecture spacious portal has always seemed to me an achievement by itself . Hunt was possibly aware that he had produced a masterpiece in this building , that he had done something in the glittering casket of pinnacles and fretwork which neither he nor any one else in America would surpass , or even rival . He had , for once at least , been a poet as well as an architect , and he caused himself to be represented in stone upon the roof of the house . You may see the statue there any day as you pass along Fifth Avenue , a little figure clothed as an artisan . It is a pleasant conceit , and one which fits the building as it would have fitted no other designed by Hunt . The French chateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has advantages which this city house lacks , a beautiful site and unlimited free space around it . But that design is not , to my mind , half so sympathetic as its urban predecessor . The difference is significant , reviving that question of personality to which I have more than once referred . Hunt 's instinct was always for restraint , for a subordination of personal feeling to reasoned principle . Turn from the W. K. Vanderbilt house to the J. J. Astor house in Fifth Avenue , facing the Park , and the Gerry house near by . There is less charm in them than in the miniature chateau . But they are admirable illustrations of what can be done for American architecture with French ideas , when these are employed as ideas and not as mechanical formula . Leaders in American Architecture 397 They make for clearly articulated and interesting design , for a well-bred elegance , for a quality which may not be startlingly original but is neither , on the other hand , mediocre nor colorless . Hunt 's predilections made him , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwellings and , in fact , the best things he did in country architecture , apart from the Southern chateau just mentioned , were modifications of his accustomed style . The Cornelius Vanderbilt house at Newport presents more than a modification . It was really based on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance in many of its most important features . But even here the design is brought together under the influence of a spirit closely related to Hunt 's earliest training . You can tell in a moment that the designer of this work was taught at the Ecole des Beaux Arts . There are indications of it in the grouping , in the massing of the different parts . Working toward the close of his career Hunt may have tried to move freely in the style of the Renaissance , but he could not quite cast off the academic mode he had been following for years . Better than either his city houses or his country houses were Hunt 's public buildings . There the old worker on the Louvre came back to the problems that interested him most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Library , swept not so long ago by the march of time from its beautiful site opposite the Park in New York , had no charm at all ; 398 Leaders in American Architecture but it was never meant to have any , and at the risk of seeming to labor the point I must reiterate that just here we come again upon this architect 's shining virtue . The Lenox Library , repellent as it was , was also superbly sound , a piece of rigorous scholarship . I used to shiver before its bleakness , but I used to rejoice in its finality ? at the sureness and repose discernible in its unified proportions . It had the grandeur of some ancient monolith . In its majestic simplicity it read American architects an unforgettable lesson . And at this point it is delightful to recur to Hunt 's flexibility , his demonstration of the fact that that discipline which he had himself obeyed and loved to impose meant no handicap whatever to the true architect . I would cite now the Administration Building at the World 's Fair at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , the grandiose note of a kind of formal magnificence , of academic and official dignity . There was no building at the fair more precisely adapted to its position and purposes , more perfect in its field , than the splendid structure at the entrance to the grounds . It was brilliant , as befitted the place and the occasion , but it was also designed with the right formality . It was as picturesque as could have been desired , yet it was obviously academic . Its proportions were good , its details were good , it fell judiciously into its given space , and yet it dominated , as was intended , everything that surrounded it . Hunt did much for the Leaders in American Architecture 399 artistic side of the fair . His energy flowed everywhere and was of endless service to the army of workers concentrated in Jackson Park . But his best service was rendered in showing how a public building could be designed with originality and yet with reserve ; independently , and yet in a sort of worldlywise taste ; with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity that makes even the most festal of buildings impressive . It was this building , coming near the end of a career which had throughout been fruitful of fine results , that brought Hunt the gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects , an honor conferred by the Queen through the great professional society of England and regarded as one of the chief prizes of architectural merit in the world . He was always being thus recognized by the professional bodies of his own country and of Europe , and not simply because he had designed this or that good building but because the wholesomeness of his broad influence came more and more to be realized . His genius worked like a leaven , the leaven of wise authority . In his work men could see the virtue of careful , impersonal training ; from it they could infer the absolute necessity of some ordered principles to the development of a work of art with consistency as well as with flexibility . Richardson heightened our architectural enthusiasm . Hunt did much to chasten and organize it . 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen , it was not so very long ago , as years are counted , that our architecture was flung into the melting-pot , but the moment now seems historical . The artist in building was coming into his own . It was good to be alive and in the midst of tremendous changes , which seemed none the less tremendous because the public at large was hardly aware of what was going on . I was there , in my youth , and I know . Architecture was more important than any other human interest , and in New York at all events it was tempting to believe that its fortunes for the entire country were largely in the hands of one group of men . Everybody knew and honored the two pioneers whose careers I have sketched , and everybody knew that certain other brilliant men were at work . There was , for instance , a memorable stir when Babb , Cook and Willard built a warehouse in Duane Street placing a new and beautiful stamp upon commercial architecture . But the rising tide was dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Rutherford Mead , and Stanford White settled down in the later seventies to work in harness . They were foreordained to be associated together , each contributing something that the others lacked , while all three moved naturally to a common end . Young
