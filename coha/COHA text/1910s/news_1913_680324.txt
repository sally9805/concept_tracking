txt Among the objections to the Militia Pay bill , now pending in the Souse of Representatives , is the burden of expense it will place upon the Federal Government . This has been estimated , by the emotional opponents of every plan to increase military efficiency , at $100,000,000 yearly . Mr. SLAYDEN of Texas . in the minority report of the House Committee on Military Affairs , states that the annual cost will be $9,234,729 . Mr. SLAYDEN adds to this the $5,000,000 yearly which has been paid put by the United States for the purposes of the State militia since the passage of the Dick law , but even then there is a broad margin between his figures and those of the hot-headed opponents who argue without figures . The Dick bill placed the organized militia of the United States under Federal control , as a reserve force in time of need . Since it became a law the citizen soldiers have had the advantage of training in field ' service and Inspection by officers of the regular army . Undoubtedly the duties and responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now proposed to pay the officers from $100 to $360 lyearly and the enlisted men from $45 to $225 yearly . Mr. Sr ... kriDEN 's report , however , is a temperate document which deserves intelligent consideration . His prophecy that the National Guardsmen will never be contented with the sums first allotted to them , and will ask for more , seems at first to be needlessly alarm ' ing . It would not be necessary to give them more , merely because they ask for it . But he sees in this new measure a source of danger which should not be overlooked . The politicians , with a paid militia to " conciliate , " will doubtless act as they have acted , since the passage of the " Arrears of Pensions bill " in 1879 , in regard to the " Old Soldier " vote . An annual expenditure of more than $200,000,000 for pen= sions is now , as Mr. SLAYDEN says , ' in sight . And he argues that the veterans of the civil war " have never " formed a oompact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Guard . This is a sounder argument against the Militia Pay bill than the statement that we may in the future have a National Guard of 1,000,000 men which will cost the Federal Government $116 , - 000,000 yearly . We need not invent bogies . But it is clear that if the bill now before Congress is to be passed , ( and Its specific purpose has the approval of the best military judges , ) it should be so carefully amended as to make any political trickery with it in the future absolutely impossible . The army , and all the subsidiaries of the army , should be kept out of politics . If the bill 's provisions Can not be made definite , and impervious to political onslaught , it should not be passed . But we have no idea that it can not be so drawn as to defeat all the tricksters . Assuredly , we do not want a National Guard vote to compete with an " Old Soldier " vote . But we ought to have faith in the good intentions and patriotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
