txt // destroyed every relic of Roman life and faith , the land became a desert so far as Christian art was concerned . The van-quished Romano-Britons were slowly driven back into Cornwall , Wales , and Cumberland , and such was their hatred for the invading English , that , instead of trying to conquer their conquerors by the faith of Christ , as the Christians of Provence had done , they were glad to believe them lost amongst the heathen . In Wales , however , the Christian Church of Roman times had lasted on , and when in the middle of the sixth century the Christianity introduced into Ireland by St. Patrick in 432 had practically died out , it was re-founded there by Gildas and other Welsh mission-aries . This Irish Church became very flourishing , and in 565 Columba passed over into Scotland , where he founded the monastery of Iona , and in conjunction with a band of Welsh missionaries under Ninian established the Celtic Church of Northern England . This Irish Church had re-tained the traditions and liturgy of the Romano-British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her faith and ritual had come to her with the eastern tinge of the Ephesine liturgy , from the Gallican Church of Lyons and Vienne . The influence of this source of its Christianity is traceable in English art well into the Middle Ages . Amongst ? other eastern usages was that of the Veil or Curtain dividing the sanctuary from the nave during the consecration of the elements , a use which the Roman Church had early aban-doned for that of the Ciborium and Baldacchino . That this separation was used in Ireland we know from the account of St. Bridget 's church in Kildare , ' where a wooden screen with two doors in it divided the nave from the choir . This use the Celtic clergy brought with them when they settled in Iona and subsequently under Aidan in Lindisfarne in 634 , whence they christianized the North of England about thirty years after Augustine had landed in Kent and had baptized King Ethelbert . Both forms of this re-established Christi-anity were essentially missionary and monastic , and their buildings were small and unimpressive compared with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern invaders , in France and South Europe . // Yet small and unimportant as our buildings are , we English can probably show a more continuous architectural record from the sixth to the tenth century in our Anglo-Saxon remains than can he shown by France or even Germany . When Christianity was re-established in the sixth century the conversion of the people was entirely the work of monks : in the north , Columbites from Scotland ; in the south , Roman Benedictines . For the first century after the conversion every monastery was a mission station , and every mission station a monastery . These monasteries , from which most English dioceses were governed , were generally in the country and not in the towns , tribal not territorial , with their bishops often residing in an anchorite 's cell , or in some small place . Even Theodore made no effort to alter this system , but accepted these tribal bishoprics . This intensely monastic constitution of the Celtic and early English Church stamped its character indelibly on all the subsequent organization and architectural character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which from the first were served by secular priests , as Rochester and London . For even in the towns the church had to be re-established de noon , and this was clone by set-ting up a monastery , or its semblance , within its own walls and gates , a self-centred , exclusive little world of religious life , strictly excluded from all share in the worldly municipal life around it , as unlike as possible to the semi-secular French Cathedral . This character was marked as regards the exterior by the enclosing wall , which has given us our modern cathe-dral close , entered through great gateways in a crenellated wall . To it also we owe the cloister , which became so much part of the necessary adjuncts of a cathedral that it is found even where , as at Salisbury , the building was in-tended for secular clergy from the first . ' But as a rule the abbeys were not placed in the chief towns ; indeed , there were few towns to place them in . Often , it is true , a town grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in France dependent on its influence , but owed its rise partly // to other causes , and the townsfolk had their own church near , but of later date than and separate from the abbey church , like St. Thomas 's at Salisbury , St. Cuthbert 's at Wells , St. Peter Mancroft at Norwich , St. Nicholas at Durham , St. Margaret 's at Westminster , St. Mary 's at Bury . The churches of the greater towns in England , unlike those of France , may be reckoned in the same category as country churches , as the towns grew so gradually . For this reason the parish arrangements of places like Manchester , Leeds , Sheffield , Birmingham , and Wolverhampton were till lately on the same footing as those of Aylesbury , Witney , // Abingdon , or Uppingham ; and the English cathedrals were not , except in the case of London , in the centres of the national life , in large towns like Bristol , Northampton , Colchester or Oxford , but at Crediton , Chichester , Wells , Lichfield , Dorchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly in Saxon , not in Romano-British centres of population . ' // Our cathedrals , therefore , generally stand apart from the cities to which they belong , nestled amidst the elms of their quiet close side by side with the chapter-house , where the monks transacted their business during life , and with the peaceful cloister where they slept at last , two buildings hardly ever found now in connection with a French cathedral . For if there was an enclosing wall , it was that of the original Roman praetorium , as at Paris , Rouen , and Evreux , and though so-called cloisters did exist in some cases in France , yet they were usually the dwellings of the secular clergy of the church , and very early became a tangled mass of tortuous streets surrounded by a wall , not a cloister in the usual sense , and if any of them had still existed there are remains of one at Rouen ? they would only have marked still more the contrast between the people 's cathedrals of the French , and ours , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of past popular struggle , no tale of bloodshed , save at Canterbury . Such contrasted views as those of Chartres and Lichfield , Wells and Rouen , sum up completely the stories of the two national churches , and any one who can remember Rouen as it used to be , with the old houses built against its walls , will be able to realize how completely the French cathedral is the centre of the life of the city . There can indeed be no more telling contrast than the view of Rouen ( pp. 42 , 43 ) , with the fortified palace of the archbishop adjoining the cathedral , in the very centre of the town , and that of Exeter from the bishop 's quiet garden , with the large-windowed Elizabethan house . The only thing like it in France is St. Ouen , which was a monastery , not a cathedral . The same story is told by the plans as by the views , perhaps even more clearly , but in order to trace out the history of the English cathedral as we have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting-point , the early Christian Basilica . The Anglo-Saxon church of Brixworth affords an example of the Basilican type , with apse , circular passage below ground , and loculi , as did the original church of St. Augustine at Canterbury . In France the eleventh-century church of Vignory ( p. i r ) furnishes a corresponding speciTHE // men , where the circular passage being on the ground level has become a true ambulatory aisle , and the loculi have developed into chapels , while the interior shows a rude attempt to construct a basilica with the insufficient resources and knowledge of the northern invaders of Gaul . But while this example contains in embryo the plan of all the later great French cathedrals , the same is not the case with Brixworth as regards the English ones , for the northern type of Saxon church with a square end was that which ultimately pre-vailed over the apsidal plan reintroduced by the Normans . Norman plans were of two kinds ; the first , with a single apse and the aisle running round it as an ambulatory , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and existed in the great pilgrimage church of St. Martin at Tours , which probably became the prototype of numerous churches in France , but the only complete examples of it left in England are Norwich Cathedral and Gloucester crypt ; the second , or triapsidal or Lombard plan , had been al46 GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE ready used in the Saxon church of St. Frideswide , Oxford , and was that of the great French abbey of Jumieges ( 1040 ) , whence it was taken by Lanfranc for St. Stephen 's at Caen and for his new cathedral at Canterbury ( p. 54 ) . We have no example left in England of this plan , but in France it is preserved at Cerisy-la-Foret ' and St. Georges de Boscherville . Both these plans , associated in the Saxon mind with the intrusive foreign clergy and their Norman masters , were gradually superseded by the old Saxon square east end , though usually the aisle was returned at right angles at the back of the high altar to form an ambulatory , as at Romsey ( II 15 ) and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square ending would have supplanted the apse to the extent it did if it had not been for the great success of the Cistercians who came into England about 1150 . A reformed branch of the Benedictines , one of their rules was to enforce absolute simplicity in church architecture , to the extent even of imposing an identical plan on churches so far apart as Kirkstall , 2 Maulbronn , and Casamari . This plan consisted of a square-ended , unaisled choir , eastern tran-septal chapels divided by walls , and no towers . But in the thirteenth century the regulations were much relaxed , as may be seen by the beautiful east end of Fountains Abbey ( 1240 ) and its late unfinished tower ( 1J40 ) .3 But whatever the original plan , with a single apse like Norwich and Gloucester , with a triple apse as at Durham ( originally ) , with a square east end like Romsey , or like St. Hugh 's Lincoln , copied from Cluny ; the history of an English cathedral is that of constant extension eastwards . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ac-commodating in the same building from time to time a great congregation of pilgrims , and in permanence all the members of a large monastery . French churches did not increase to anything like the same extent , partly because , not being monasteries , there was no need of a large choir for the monks , and partly because going on pilgrimage does not appear to have been such a universal custom with the town-dwelling French as it was with the English peasantry . " // But the accommodation required is not the only criterion by which to judge the size of a medieval church . It was by no means the chief aim of the monks or clergy to provide for a congregation of a certain size . Their churches were built in the first instance for the honour and glory of God , and for that it could never be too large or too splendid . In the larger English churches , whatever the actual size , the nave and western transept formed the bishop 's cathedral , or the parish church , or that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three at once . This was cut off from the monks ' church , which consisted of the spacious choir and eastern transept , by a heavy stone screen or pulpitum , such as still exists at Gloucester , Southwell , Christchurch , and York . This pulpitum usually had a doorway in the centre and an altar on either side of it on the western side . Even when , as at Wells and Salisbury , the church was built for secular clergy , and not for monks , or regulars , the fact that the whole history of English church building had been monastic from the beginning , brought the design into conformity with what had become the national type , and with admirable results , for nothing can exceed the beauty of such east ends as those of Wells , Salisbury , and Lincoln . In the thirteenth century , when increased veneration was paid to the Blessed Virgin , a large Lady Chapel was frequently added eastwards beyond everything else , as at Gloucester and Chichester . The total length of an English cathedral or larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England were from the first much longer than those in Normandy . This probably resulted from the idea of the western bays taking the place of the great narthex or porch which existed in the Benedictine churches abroad , and especially at Cluny , but which is not found in any English cathedral except Ely . " When , as in the later forms of Ely and York , choir , retrochoir , and at York , Lady Chapel also , are all of the same width and height , the impressiveness of the horizontal expression of the unbroken avenue is fully equal to the soaring grandeur of French verticality ; damaged though the perspective now is by the ruthless removal of all the screens which once separated chapel from sanctuary , sanctuary from presbytery , presbytery from nave , ending with // the rood-screen with its lofty Calvary above and proces-sional doors below . " ' But even in this fully developed result of English work are to be seen , as in everything else produced by the race , the continuity of its historical tradition . The square Saxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first of Roman and then of Norman , apsidal building , twice re-asserted itself ; the eastern transepts are built on the foundations of the towers which in the Anglo-Saxon church , as for instance at Canterbury , stood on either side of the choir , as they do still in Norman Coutances and Exeter , and as they did in what was perhaps the prototype of all , S. Cesare al Palatino2 in Rome ; the side porch ? the great " Suth-door " and Justice Room of Augustine 's Canterbury ? is still the entrance , and the place for legal notices in most English churches . The screens of which we have just spoken were the Saxon inheritance from that eastern liturgy which came to the shores of Britain and so to Ireland and Lindis-farne from Greek Marseilles , and up the Valley of the Rhone . Lastly , the central lantern tower , that great glory of our English churches , though of later origin , Norman not Saxon , persisted to the end , and more than compensates externally , as does the varied perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English cathedral as compared with that of France . Let us now look at the plans of Amiens and Salisbury side by side ( p. 50 ) . There could hardly be a greater con-trast . They are contemporary buildings , both having been begun about 1220 , both have sprung from the same simple basilican plan , and both are bishop 's cathedrals , built at one effort . Yet how the history of the two nations has told upon them . In the French example , the idea of a great hall without central point or leading lines as at Notre Dame or Bourges , has given way to that of a large open choir with circling chapels . Yet as a mere piece of planning there is a shortness and heaviness about the nave which is very striking if a visitor enters , as is usual , for the first time by the west door . One can tell also from the plan that there will be lack of shadow and of breadth of effect over the whole exterior , and some want of varied perspective inside THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amiens alsr entirely lost the effect of a cross-planned church , and th , h in Early English Salisbury the enormously long Norman nave has become shorter , yet the main impression will obviously be one of broad masses of light and shadow out-side , and of endless cross-views within . Salisbury also , in its squareness , speaks of Saxon tradi-tions , and though built by secular clergy , yet , in its great eastward extension and double transept , and in the cloister and chapter house , tells how the missionary monks of earlier days had stamped for ever their requirements on English religious art . But there is another point shown in this eastward extension . Its constant breaks formed restful re-cesses , and the transeptal chapels were easily approached yet more out of the crowd of pilgrims than the nave chapels of Amiens . ( The worship of relics in most of the great French town-churches , except Chartres , seems never to have quite reached the proportions which it attained in England , where the cathedrals were to so great an extent monastic establish-ments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every English church therefore , after early Nor-man times , aspired to possess the shrine of some wo Ider-working saint , and to become an object of pilgrimage . To what an extent this had roused the contempt of thin k ing men by Reformation times is shown by the curious account of the visit of Erasmus and Colet to Canterbury , ' where they refuse with disgust the offer of some rags said , Eto have belonged to Becket , and this same feeling accounts for much of the iconoclasm of the English reformers . ( This bidding for pilgrims was not mere greed , but largely due to an honest longing for the honour and dignity of the House and of its Church . Also , owing perhaps to the absence of great towns in mediaeval England , and to the country being all one , the spirit of pilgrimage worked itself into the habits of the people . It furnished a much-needed break in the monotony of their isolated lives , just as it did in Brittany , but as it seemingly did not to the same extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numer52 GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE ous civic festivals and processions and centring of popular lire and pleasure in large towns . ( With this also grew up a spirifof devotion to the Blessed Virgin which , by the end of the twelfth century , had become peculiarly English , and necessitated the provision of a large Lady Chapel at the far eastern end of the building . ) The absence of nave chapels , except at Chichester , also finds its explanation in the history and circumstances of the English people . In France , after the middle of the thirteenth century , the only means of getting money to finish the immense buildings which had been begun with such enthusiasm was by marching with the times and falling into line with the growing organization of civil and municipal life . Every trade was then forming its guild , and each guild , and every association or " confrsrie , " for whatever purpose founded , placed itself under the patronage of some saint , and wished to have its own chapel . In the later thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedrals , we find the necessary funds being slowly collected from these associations and from rich merchant princes , to each of whom is assigned one of the new chapels built between the buttresses of the nave . But in England we have none of this . The strong individualism of our Teutonic race , contrasted with the Roman heritage of the French , of a more social and centralized organization , is to be seen in most of our cathedrals , though not , alas , at Salisbury , since the havoc wrought by Wyatt . Each great noble or rich man not only desired masses to be said for him after his death , but wished his name perpetuated . So our cathedrals are even to this day full of exquisite isolatedchantry-chapels like those of Bishops West and Fox at Ely , Wykeham at Winchester , and the wonderful series at Christchurch and Tewkesbury . It was the same spirit which gave us our colleges at Oxford and Cambridge , and which finally died out in the seventeenthcentury tombs , and in the marble tablets of the eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth . None of these ever existed in France to the same extent . ( The full history of the development of the plan of an THE ENGLISH CATHEDRAL English cathedral can not be better traced than in that of Canterbury , , admirably worked out as it has been by the late G. G. Scott , following Professor Willis ( p. 54 ) . Augustine found the old Roman basilica in ruins , and rebuilt it as his cathedral church . We have a description of it by Eadmer , who was precentor in the eleventh century , and had seen it before the fire of o67 . From this it appears that the Roman church had a western apse , with the altar placed on the chord of the semicircle . Behind this stood the celebrant , looking eastwards and facing his congregation , behind him was the throne of the bishop , and round the apse the seats of the clergy . Augustine , in rebuilding the church ; prolonged it eastwards beyond the two towers , in the south one of which was the main entrance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this apse , raised on the confessio by the height of several steps , were two altars , one the original high altar against the east wall , and the other further west , which later became the high altar , dedi-cated to Christ , in front of which stood the celebrant , facing east , the same way as the congregation . The choir , as at S. Clemente in Rome , extended some way down the church , from which it was separated by a low balustrade . This choir had its own third altar on the floor level of the church , at which the services of the monks were said . The con-fessio was approached , as in Old St. Peter 's , by steps lead-ing down from either aisle into a passage running round inside the apse , from which the tombs of the different saints could be seen ; the body of St. Wilfrid under the high altar , the head of St. Swithin under the Jesus altar , and west of the crypt the body of St. Dunstan under the monks ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , was another altar , containing the head of St. Furseus . The whole arrangements are those of an early Christian basilica , with its altars placed over the bodies of the saints . Already in this , the first cathedral built on English soil , we find the arrangement peculiar to English cathedrals , of their being used in common by a monastic community and by the bishop of the diocese , the latter being a less important person in his own cathedral than the head of the monastery , to THE ENGLISH CATHEDRAL which the building really belonged , though during the times of Augustine and his immediate successors the archbishop and the abbot were one and the same person . In the year 1067 this church was burnt and immediately rebuilt by Lanfranc on the model of St. Stephen 's at Caen . Scarcely a trace of the basilican plan remained . There were great western towers , and a still larger one over the cross-ing , where the transepts ceased to be a nave at right angles to the other , but were cut off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the lantern , whence a flood of light would shine down upon it . Across each tran-sept end was a gallery , as at Winchester , at Christchurch , Hants ( originally ) , at Ccrisy-la-Foret , and St. Georges de Boscherville . The transeptal chapels also were in two stories . The choir of the monks still projected far into the nave , from which it was cut off by the pulpitum or chancel screen . Further down was the rood screen , with two processional doors and the people 's ( or Jesus ) altar against it , and the rood above it . A new crypt was made under the presbytery as far as the eastern arch of the crossing , in which possibly some of the pillars of the original crypt were re-used . The aisles were vaulted with intersecting groin vaults , the nave had a wooden roof . Although the choir and monks ' church were so much more im-posing than in the old church , the monks were dissatisfied , and only twenty years later , under Anselm , Lanfranc 's eastern wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double its original length , forming the " glorious Choir of Conrad . " The building of this was the last touch given to the mon-astic character of our English cathedrals . It was really the addition of a second complete church for the monks , with a second transept in front of the original one , which was now left entirely to the people . The monks ' choir was moved into this new church , and the pulpitum or chancel screen with the organ on it placed in the eastern arch of the crossing , the rood screen with the Jesus altar and its two processional doors occupying the western arch . The eastern end was altered from being triapsidal to the single apse with an ambulatory and three chapels opening out of it , and a crypt beneath the whole . In 1174 this choir was Go GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE burnt , and was rebuilt and the church completed by William of Sens and William the Englishman . The former gave it its French character ( p. 58 ) and introduced from his own cathedral of Sens the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the nave was rebuilt in Perpendicular times . Except for its having retained its eastern apse , owing to a Frenchman having designed it , Canterbury furnishes a typical example of the growth of an English cathedral . CHAPTER IV VAULTING SINCE this chapter must be somewhat technical , the following abstract may be of use . The origin of Gothic lies in the attempt to vault a basilica , and in the consequent use of ribbed vaults . These sprang from the groined or intersecting vault derived from the Romans . The groined vault was a solid mass consisting of two equal semi-cylindrical tunnels crossing at right angles . The Gothic vault consisted of arched ribs placed at right angles to each other and diagonally , forming a skeleton of stone work above an oblong or square space , and sup-porting thin independent stone panels , which in France are made up of a number of flat arches of small stones thrown from rib to rib , and which are therefore self-supporting . In England they are fre-quently not arched , but flat , as if made of planks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( tiercerons ) to support then . The pointed arch was used as a means of getting the summits of the arches approximately level . The diagonals and intermediate tiercerons being of different lengths would rise to different heights ; their curve therefore was altered in the upper part to keep all the crowns level . Hence arose the four-centred arch . To hide the breaks of curve , cross-pieces  --  liernes-were inserted with bosses at the intersections ( Berne vaulting ) . If the ribs are very numerous and have all the same curve , an inverted cone or fan results from this construction ( fan vaulting ) . THE development of Gothic architecture springs from the attempt to put a stone roof on the thin walls of the central aisle of a basilica , a thing which the Romans had never tried to do . They had put concrete vaults over the great halls of their baths , and had built domes of hori-zontally ' coursed brickwork as at the Pantheon , in both of which cases t'he thrust became very small as soon as the wonderful pozzolana mortar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire had failed , such work became // quite beyond the powers of those who tried to imitate them in the tenth and eleventh centuries . In the neighbourhood of the great eastern trade route through southern and central France , and in Auvergne , are a number of domed churches of various dates and types , the origin of which is much disputed . The oldest are Germigny les Pros ( 8o6 ) , 13rant6me and St. Astier ( dedicated 1013 ) near Peri-gueux , St. Mar-tin , Angers ( re-built 1020 ) , St. Etienne de la Cite , Perigueux , begun 1013 and dedicated 1047 , on the same day as St. Front ( p. 20 ) ( the plan ofwhich was copied from St. Mark 's Ven-ice ) , and Notre Dame du Port , Clermont Fer-rand , about the same time . St. Jean de Cole and a number of smal-ler churches come between io8o and 1090 , then Font-evrault , Cahors , and Angouleme ( all consecrated i119 ) , Souillac and Solignac , 1143 . From the Auvergne churches with their two-storied aisles was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tours , and there is some resemblance between them and the Anglo-Norman churches in the single western tower , the superposed vaulted aisles , and the cylindrical columns . The other churches influenced the style of Anjou and Poitou , where , during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , // ribbed vaults were built partaking of the character both of Gothic vaults and of domes . At Poitiers Cathedral they are ribbed domes ; at St. Maurice Angers is an immense true Gothic vault of domical appearance built ten years after St. Denis ( t15o ) , but prob-ably not derived thence . These so-called Plantagenet vaults have also been thought to have influenced English work , but it is very doubtful if they did so . In their domical form they are quite unlike the level English vaults , and though the fact that the ribs pass through the vault , and are rebated to receive the panels , as in the later English vaults , is a point of resemblance , yet the rebate is differently cut . In France the ribs merely support the panels , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic vault took its origin , not from the dome , but from the groined vault formed by the intersection of two equal semi-cylindrical tunnels , one of the two forms of vault-ing used by the Romans , the other being the simple tunnel or barrel vault . When two of these barrel vaults intersect at right angles , a projecting edge is formed on the diagonals , the curve of which is an ellipse . In building these groined vaults the Romans used two elliptical wooden centrings crossing diagonally , and on them generally built brick arches , afterwards buried beneath the surface of the vault . The early builders of Burgundy managed these on a small scale in the aisles of their churches , but over the wide naves they found it easier to construct a continuous barrel vault , which had the further advantage of supporting the tiles direct , without any wooden roof . But whereas the cross or groined vault exercises little thrust except at the corners , these tunnel vaults pushed out their walls all along . In small churches like Champ-deniers , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groined vaults over the side aisles counter-acted the thrust of the centre barrel vault , but left the // church lighted only by the aisle windows . But where the vault of the nave was raised much higher than those of the aisles , in order to get windows over their roofs , as in most of the Cluniac churches , the lack of side-support caused the vaults to fall before long , and none are left except where , as at Autun , buttresses were added later . But at Vezelay , a daughter of Cluny , and at Langres , it second edition of Autun , the nave is covered with a groined vault , for the builders got over the difficulty of the elliptical centrings for the diagonals by making them semicircular . ' They thus found themselves able to cover any space , oblong as well as square , with a separate vault over each bay , resting on // semicircular transverse arches separating the bays . But these vaults were higher at the crossing of the diagonals than at the crown of the transverse arch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roofing tiles on them direct , and a wooden roof became necessary . The transverse arches separating the bays , not being properly buttressed , dropped a little , opening at the extrados at the haunches , and at the intrados at the crown . The builders noticing this , concluded that the triangle A B C , between the two points of pressure A C , was useless , and therefore omitted it , and struck the arch from two centres , a little on each side of the median line , and thus DIAGRAM OF ORIGIN OF POINTED ARCII obtained an obtusely pointed arch . That this was one source of the pointed arch is made probable I by the fact that in the Ile de France , where , owing to the small size of the materials , the transverse arches are of slight thick-ness , the pointing is scarcely visible in the earliest arches , while in Burgundy , where thick arches of large stones are used , it is much more marked . The pointed arch certainly appears first in the churches of the Cluniacs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the East , but rather to have been used first in Burgundy , and afterwards in their // churches in Jerusalem . ' Once used it was regularly adopted , because it enabled spaces of all widths to be spanned with arches of the same height , and also because its thrust is much less than that of the round arch . That thrust , how-ever , was still the great difficulty . To raise the aisles to the same height as the nave seemed hardly safe , but a satis-factory solution had been found in Auvergne , where they were made into two stories by a great gallery being placed above the aisle , as at S. Ambrose , Milan ( 1046-1071 ) , and S. Michele , Pavia . If the nave was covered with a barrel vault so as to require a continuous abutment , this was fur-nished by ahalf barrel vault over the triforium gallery ; if the nave was groined , an arch ( as at Durham choir and tran-sept ) or half arch ( Durham nave ) was sufficient against the back of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groins where the thrust came . From Auvergne probably , this arrangement was adopted for the great church of S. Sernin at Toulouse , and probably in St. Martin of Tours , now destroyed , and from them passed to Notre Dame and the early French and Norman churches , such as St. Etienne at Caen . These arches , though still hidden by the triforium roof , are in reality flying buttresses , and only need to be placed above the roof to be obviously so . In south-western France , as we have seen , the dome w-as not unknown , and no objection was felt to domical-looking vaults . The Normans , however , who at this time were the most logical builders in Europe , always aimed at keeping the crowns of the vaults approximately level throughout , and therefore stilted the curves of the cells over the narrower spans , or " doctored " the curve of the vaulting surface in one way or another , so as to make it suit that of the groin , instead of , as the Romans had done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elliptical curve of the groin . In this change , small as it seems , lies the origin of Gothic vaulting . This is very well seen in Gloucester Cathedral , where , in the western side of the southern apsidal chapel , the wall arch of the groined vault is pointed ; that is , the curve of the lateral cell or filling-in has been modified to suit the curve of the groin. - // Having once adopted the system of using diagonal cen-trings to support the groins , it was but a short step on-wards to build stone diagonal arches over the centrings , and then use them as permanent ribs on which to build the vault surface . " After the introduction of the rib , the wall cells of oblong vaults generally assume the elliptical form , though in the earliest ribbed vaults the groin is no longer a semi-ellipse , but a segment of a circle struck from a centre below the springing line . The rib-curves henceforth control the construction , and the vaulting-surfaces are adapted to them . " These surfaces then ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangular cells or panels , each resting on two halves of the diagonal ribs , and on an arch , either the transverse arch across the nave or aisle , the pier arch dividing t e nave from the aisle , or the wall arch on the outer wall . ' n the ribbed vault the French usually made their diagonal ribs semicircular , and so got a series of domical-looking vaults ; but the Normans , and after them the English , tried to keep the ridge level by making the ribs segmental , that is , less than a semicircle. /Indeed , at Durham , in the nave , the transverse arch is omitted , and in English work generally is not more important in section than the rib , whereas in the earlier French work it is usually more important , so that each vaulting bay forms a separate composition . It must not be imagined that this idea of building the vault in separate pieces , resting on permanent diagonal arches or ribs , sprang into being all at once . It had been " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly the same time all over Western Europe ? in 1032 at Montefiascone ; a little later at S. Ambrogio , Milan ; at S. Abbondio , Como ; at Durham , Gloucester , and Avening ( 1120 ) , then in a number of smaller churches in Picardy and the Beauvaisis , of which the best preserved is Morienval 7o GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE ( 1120 ) , and at St. Denis in 1140 . From this last example sprang the wonderful Gothic of the Ile de France . Until the middle of the twelfth century all vaulting was in the experimental stage , and while many churches had the aisles and even the choir covered with groined vaulting , and while the intention was possibly to cover the nave in the same way , as shown by the plan and design , and especially by the vaulting-shafts afterwards carried up to the roof ; yet , if this were so , the courage of the builders often failed them when they reached the top , and they contented themselves with a simple wooden roof , generally celled , as at Peterborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large unribbed vault built of rubble is a very weak construction , and they did not realize the extent of its thrust on the walls , nor that the thrust would not diminish , as in the Roman vaults , when the concrete had set solid , but rather increase as the widely jointed rubble settled , and the loosely combined materials worked on each other . But with the adoption of ribs an immense amount of elasticity was given to the vault . It was a much easier thing to build ribs and fit separate panels over them than to construct a groined vault all at once on planked centring ; and , when finished , each panel could adapt itself separately to any movement in its supporting ribs without endangering the safety of the whole . Then , when the plan of alternate major and minor piers was adopted by the Normans , it became the obvious thing to make the vaulting embrace two bays , as the Lombard and Rhenish vaults did , carrying the diagonal ribs across between the major piers . This system had the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easier to work than the oblong . Quite possibly even the earliest churches , like Jumieges , were intended to be vaulted in this way , but the nave vaults were never carried out , only those of the aisles and triforium . But when , as in the two Caen churches , at Bernidres ( see p. 73 ) and many others , both major and minor piers have shafts running up on the nave side , it was difficult to know what to do with that of the minor pier , since there was no rib for it to carry . It was , therefore , made to carry a rib which met the others at their crossing , but itself did no work , being connected with the VAULTING 7I vault merely by means of a little vertical wall which rises to the under surface of the vault , as at the Abbaye aux Dames and Bernieres . It was an awkward arrangement , which represents oniv a transitory stage , and in the vaults of the Abbaye aux Hommes , Laon ( p. 115 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was improved on by making this rib a genuine vaulting rib supporting a vaulting panel ; and since the vault is thus divided into six cells , these are called sex-partite vaults . A large number of the Norman vaults are of this character , and most of the earliest French vaults , but i2 GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE it is not found in England , except at Tickencote , Boxgrove , and Canterbury ( p. 58 ) , nor anywhere later than the thirteenth century . It is not easy to say why it ever became as popular as it did , for it had two great drawbacks ; ( 1 ) Extreme height , owing to the great span of the diagonal ribs , so that the nave walls had to be raised uselessly to allow the tie-beam of the roof to pass over the vault . ( 2 ) Its incon-sistency with any other plan than the alternating or double-bay system . As the vertical expression of the style became stronger , the difference between the major and minor piers looked out of keeping . But it was obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , to have half of them carrying only one useless rib and the other carrying the three essential ribs as appears to be the case at Notre Dame . ' At Sens we find the double-bay plan , the inter-mediate piers being two coupled columns , and at Bourges and Laon the alternate piers are strengthened . In the thir-teenth century sexpartite vaulting was entirely abandoned , the piers were made all alike , and each carried three ribs , a transverse and two diagonals ; the wall rib being usually carried by a separate shaft which had its base either on the clerestory sill or on the triforium level as at Amiens ( p. 62 ) . These vaults are called quadripartite . The earliest examples on a large scale of true ribbed vault-ing in England and France respectively are found at Durham and St. Denis . Every part of Durham was covered with ribbed vaulting between 1093 and 1133.2 In the choir aisles the transverse and diagonal ribs are received by triple shafts on each side . Since each bay is much longer east and west than north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than double that of the transverse rib , and to keep the ridge as level as possible , they are segmental , and leave the pier at a very abrupt angle . The high vault of the choir was rebuilt in the thirteenth century , but that of the transepts is original , and it is evident that in spite of the plan of alternate piers and columns a quadripartite vault was // intended from the first , for , even if sexpartite vaulting had come into use , which it had not at this time , nothing would have been gained by using it , since the greater length of the bay in the direction of the axis would have increased the very difficulty which vaulting two bays together was meant to avoid . Each major pier carries a round transverse arch , and the diagonal ribs are segmental . In the nave ( about 1130 ) the diagonals are semicircular , and to keep the ridge level the transverse arches are made pointed . But these Norman builders had become so attached to their splendid round arched style that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the far-reaching consequences which the vaults of St. Denis did in the Ile de France , where no previous strongly-developed style like the Norman was already in possession . Until the middle of the twelfth century the Royal Domain of France , as in politics , so in art , had been the weakest and least developed part of France . With Philip Augustus it became the most vigorous , and being architecturally almost virgin soil , the seedlings transplanted into it from Normandy on one side , Picardy and the Soissonnais on the other , took root and flourished exceedingly . While , therefore , the builders of Durham and the other churches of the beginning of the twelfth century were hampered by their reluctance to use the pointed arch , the Abbe Suger at St. Denis ( 1140 ) was quite unfettered , and showed complete mastery of the whole system of Gothic vaulting in the ambulatory of that church . For in the curved plan lay the real difficulty , and it is there that its infinite adaptability is most clearly shown . For , owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being of much smaller span than the corresponding ones on the outer wall , the vaulting space becomes a trapezium instead of a square , the crossing point of the diagonals is thrown much too near the pier arch , and since the crown of that , from its smaller span , is , unless it is awkwardly " stilted , " much lower than the crown of the opposite wall arch , the vault slopes down in a very ugly manner . These defects are clearly seen at Langres ( ii6o ) , a rib-vaulted version of Autun , and twenty years behind St. Denis , where the problem is solved by the use of the pointed arch . Any // space of any shape , if it could be cut up into triangles , could be vaulted with perfect ease , and the summits of all the arches and vaults kept at any level desired . Thus at Notre Dame , Chalons-sur-Marne ( p. 77 ) , each pier of the apse carries three transverse arches over the aisle , one in a line with the centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpendicular to the plane of the adjoining arch . The vaulting compartments are thus reduced to alternate squares and triangles , all the irregularity being thrown into the triangles . In " the Round " of the Temple Church ( r18o ) in London much the same system is adopted , each interior column carries two radiating transverse arches , so that the vaulting consists of alternate triangles without ribs , and rectangular divisions vaulted in the usual way . At Notre Dame , where there are double aisles , the number of columns is doubled in each row proceeding outwards , and the aisle vaults are cut up into triangles , there being no true ribs . ( See plan , p. 5o . ) But it had begun to be realized that the diagonal ribs need not be complete arches , but that half ribs could be used butting against each other at the crown on the centre line of the aisle , as at Sens ( p. 115 ) , and from that moment every difficulty was conquered . In England , owing to the square east ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite so beautiful as the vaulting of the ambulatory of a French cathedral , except at Canterbury and Westminster , which are partly French , and at Wells ; but on the other hand the beauty of our octagonal chapter houses surpasses anything of the sort in France . Indeed , Salisbury and Wells ( see frontispiece ) reach the very climax of beauty in Gothic vaulting . Let us now examine in detail the construction of the Gothic vault . Let us suppose the skeleton of a vaulting bay over the nave handed over to a French mason . He has before him four ( or in the case of a sexpartite vault , six ) triangles , each composed of the halves of two diagonal ribs , and a whole wall arch or transverse arch . He has to build a vaulting panel over each triangle in ' such a way as to leave a straight joint between the key of the transverse arch or of the wall arch , and the intersection at the crown of the diagonal rib . " Let us suppose him to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall arch . He will mark off first an equal number of divisions on each of a convenient size , working down from the straight line joining the summits ( p. 79 , fig. 1 , H ) . Obviously these spaces will be larger on the diagonal rib than on the wall arch . He will then build a succession of little arches across each space , beginning at the bottom , up as high as they will hold together ( fig. 2 ) . Each row // of stones will have to be cut narrower on the wall arch than on the rib , and owing to the stones forming an arch they will be a little larger in the middle than at either end . When the lower surface of these arches has come to be too horizontal to hold together without centring , he may use a cerce " or movable centring of two sliding boards , increas-ing it in length as he goes up , and placing it for each row on the rib and wall arch by the little iron hooks at its ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the workman , for if he does not take great care that the sizes of the stones in each row adapt themselves gradually to the different widths of the ribs at either end , he will get some rows too broad and some too narrow ; some of his arches will be wedge-shaped , resting only on one rib , others a kind of balloon shape , too wide in the middle : Several instances of unskilful fillings-in of this kind can be seen in the cloisters of Westminster . But except in the Ile de France this strictly scientific method was not that always followed . Skilled workmen were difficult to get , and the panels were often filled in with rough rubble plastered inside . ' And even when skilled work-men could be had , the French method is not the only good one . It was less scientific but more roughly practical to divide the half rib and half wall arch , not into an equal number of unequal parts but into an unequal number of equal parts . The courses will then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the panel will not be arched as in the French system , but flat as if made of planks nailed across ; in this case , a number of the courses , starting from the long rib , will find no resting-place on the shorter wall arch , but will form a jagged edge along the ridge and will dovetail with those from the other side . It was probably the fondness of the English for rough and ready methods and " rule of thumb " work which caused the adoption of this system . Whatever the cause , the results were far-reaching . First a ridge rib was added to carry the ends of the extra courses and hide the unsightly dovetail ; 2 and , secondly , since the surface of the panel , being no longer 8o GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE composed of separate arches from rib to rib , was flat , as if made of planks , and consequently , in a vault of any size , weak and unable to support itself , especially at the ridge , it became desirable to put another rib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat panels and the weak B centre point of the ridge rib . ' Then it was only natural to treat this like a main rib , and instead of letting the filling-in courses pass behind it , to start them again from it . Then by degrees more of these intermediate ribs , or tiercerons , were added , until the section of the vault , instead of being a triangle attached to the wall by its apex , became an in- // verted cone as is seen at Exeter , which is probably the most beautiful true Gothic vault ever constructed . But with this multiplication of ribs two difficulties arose . 1 . It was not easy to make the mouldings of ribs meeting // at such different angles as the tiercerons and ridge rib , " mitre , " that is , run into each other satisfactorily ; a " boss " of carving was therefore put at the intersection . 2 . Owing to the different lengths of the various ribs , they will leave the impost or capital at all sorts of different angles if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be kept level ; and the result was unsightly and difficult to work . The plan was therefore adopted of altering the curve in the upper part , the curve of the lower part of all the ribs remaining the same . Thus , by giving a flatter curve to the upper part of a long rib it could be made to reach the same height as a shorter rib with a sharper curve . To mask the points where the curve changes , short cross ribs or liernes were introduced , forming a network , as in Winchester Lady Chapel . Admirable in principle as it is , the French method admitted of no further development , and there is no change in it till late in the fourteenth century , when the appearance of some of the English vaults was copied . The earlier French vaults are generally very domical , the English are level at the ridge ; and it is worth notice how each ' of these types accords with the general character of the style to which it belongs . The French , influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arches of the Burgundian barrel vaults , looked on each vaulting bay as a separate entity , and let the crossing of the diagonals rise above the key of the transverse arches , thus keeping the bay as the unit of design and carrying up to the very summit that principle of verticality which is the essence of French Gothic . But in England we find the horizontal lines which mark the walls carried into the vault , and , in order to keep a level ridge , the curves are constantly " doctored , " even in our earliest vaults , and doubtless this habit helped in the development of lierne and fan vaulting . To these let us now return . Lierne vaults soon became extremely popular , especially one form in which the ribs are so arranged as to form a star , as at Tewkesbury ( p. 84 ) , Christchurch Hants , and West 's Chapel and the choir , Ely . One of the simplest and most satisfactory is Norwich ; the most complicated and puzzling is Gloucester choir , which has two sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the clerestory // ( p. 145 ) . This and some others of these complicated vaults are quite simple on plan , but become distorted in perspective ; some few , like that over the monument of Archbishop Stratford at Canterbury , are distorted on plan but quite symmetrical in execution . The later lierne vaults , with their ribs symmetrically arranged at the springing and the same curve for each rib in its lower part , become inverted conoids , and it only remained to make all the ribs of the same length by cutting them off by a circle to arrive at the fan vault , in which the use of the four centred curves for the ribs simplified matters greatly by making it possible for them all to be of similar curvature and yet all to rise to the same height . A perfectly true cone or trumpet shape was thus obtained , generated by the revolution of the curve round a vertical tangent . This is called fan vaulting ( p. 86 ) . In it the ribs have become so numerous as to be merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling in , rib and panel being cut out of the same stone . In fan vaulting , if the plan is square and the fans spring from the corners , they meet in the centre of each wall and // leave a flat space easy to decorate in the middle . But when , as is generally the case , the space is oblong , the semicircular fans or conoids , if made large enough to meet in the centre of the nave , intersect each other and leave a straight but sloping ridge , as at King 's College Chapel , on the narrower sides , or if made small enough not to interfere with each at the narrow end , they leave a broad space in the middle , which in the very beautiful example at St. George 's Chapel , Windsor , is covered with a flat barrel vault . In the Divinity school at Oxford ( p. 102 ) , and in the cathedral , are two very beautiful lierne vaults , which in construction and principle are really fan vaults , but without their monotony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward on brackets for them to have touched if they had been fans . As it is they have the effect of a very beautiful flat lierne vault . In the Divinity school , which is also a lierne vault , in front of the half conoids on the walls , complete ones are put , whose edges would touch in the centre if they were fans and which one would expect to find carried by columns . But the columns have been suppressed , and their capitals , instead of being supported from below , are sus-pended from above , from a great transverse arch which really takes the place of a girder . The marvellous vault of // Henry VIPs Chapel , which is a true fan vault , is of precisely similar construction , except that the transverse arch , instead of being visible through its whole breadth , is carried above the vault in the centre part . Nothing more wonderful than this has ever been done in stone , and except Oxford Cathedral and Exeter nothing more beautiful , and it is no fair criticism to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs are obviously merely decorative . This is the important point to notice in these latest vaults  --  that the true function of the multiplied ribs has entirely disappeared , and they and the intermediate parts are all cut out of large blocks of stone . They would be just as sound if all the ribs were pared off and a smooth surface left . In fact , the vault of Henry VIPs Chapel , with its apparently excessive elaboration , is really a return to the simple Roman barrel vault with its continuous thrust ; a strange result to follow from a slight alteration in the arrangement of the stones in the vaulting panels , and yet an inevitable consequence from rigidly following artistic reasoning . In France the later history of vaulting is very different and much simpler . They adhered nearly to the end to their severely logical method of making each vaulting panel arched and self-supporting : except , therefore , in a very large vault like that over the crossing at Amiens ( p. 62 ) they needed no tiercerons , and consequently no liernes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitring . The simple cross-ribbed , quadripartite , slightly domical vault continued to he the form in use , ' until the beauty of the English lierne vault induced them to copy it , though they rarely used bosses , but merely little pendants ( pp. 91 , 93 ) . The finest French lierne vault is probably that of St. Ricquier . At Caudebec a long pendant is hung from a transverse arch , something after the style of Henry VIPs Chapel , and at Rue ( p. 90 ) is a very elaborate vault cut up into highly decorated panels . But these late French vaults , such as that of St. Pierre Caen ( p. 91 ) , though beautiful , are not a natural development of a living art , but simply dead copies of an admired form . In the latest French vaults the column entirely disappears // and the ribs themselves run down to the ground . Fre-quently the mouldings of these ribs are wiredrawn and narrow , and the vaults themselves hollow and weak in ap-pearance , but occasionally they are wonderfully graceful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 93 ) . Later still , as the Renaissance comes on , the excessive complication was felt to be wearisome , and the ribs spring from a cylindrical column as at Carcassonne , St. Severin Paris , or Gisors again , where the shafts are polygonal and decorated with heraldic devices . It is curious to note how the characters of the two nations come out in their vaulting . To the practical Englishman , accustomed to the use of curved planking on his ships , and cut off from French influence during the Hundred Years ' War , any rule of thumb was equally good which would give the desired result of closing the panels , while the logical and clear-minded Frenchman must needs keep to the strictly accurate and reasonable method . " It is not surprising , " says Viollet-le-Duc , " that men like these English workmen , who already possessed a spirit of generalization and simplification so pronounced , should have been equally imbued with that spirit of discipline and order which was so fatal to the French in the days of Crecy and Poitiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation , when it is carefully looked into , and it is that fact which makes the architecture of the // Middle Ages , clearly stamped as it is with the genius of the nations who practised it in France and in England , so inexhaustible a source of interesting observations . " Before passing on we must notice the method of supporting the vault by the invention and use of the flying buttress . We have already referred to the way in which the Norman builders counteracted the thrust of the high vault over the nave by a continuous half barrel vault over the aisle gallery , if the main vault was itself a barrel vault ; or by arches , or slices of a barrel vault applied against the back of the piers under the gallery roof , if the high vault was an intersecting , or a ribbed vault , as at Durham and Gloucester . But if kept thus under the roof this resistance was applied much too low , so the architects of the Ile de France in the middle of the twelfth century boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it butt against the wall opposite to the capital of the column carrying the high vault , and by doing so invented the flying buttress . At Poissy , near Paris , flying buttresses were built in 1135 , and very soon after at Sens and St. Germain des Pres. These are simple arches like those under the roof of Durham , but still applied too low as at Noyon and Sens . Soon two points were noticed : ( I ) that the head of the arch of the buttress must not be built into the wall , as in case of any settlement it would be carried down.and the arch broken . It is therefore in the earlier French vaults , as at Amiens , but not in England , made to abut on a large stone carried by a short column independent of the wall . The neglect of this precaution caused the ruin of many of the later French vaults . ( 2 ) That the thrust of a vault is not confined to one point , but extends for some distance vertically on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nave of Amiens ( p. 97 ) , just as in shoring up a bulging wall the timber shore has to butt against a vertical plate . Then the two arches were combined into one sloping girder by an arcade between them as at Chartres ( p. 94 ) and the choir of Amiens . The upper slope of the buttress was then used as a channel to carry the roof water down to the gargoyles or spouts . In the choir of the Cathedral of Troyes ( p. 96 ) ( X IV century ) , water channel , flying buttress , pinnacle , and gargoyle are // combined in an arrangement as ingenious as it is beautiful . It is a good instance of the way in which every constructive feature of Gothic architecture is made into an element of beauty , but the most perfect is that afforded by the nave buttresses of Reims , where the dead weight required by the outer buttress is given by an exquisite combination of niche , statue , and pinnacle ; and the pinnacles at Rouen are almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buttress , the principle of exposing the main support of their building to the variations of a northern climate was a bad one . It was all very well to make their walls " form fours , " as Mr. Prior puts it , by cutting them up into slices and standing the slices at right angles to the building , but it gave a singularly unstable construction , for though they got rid of the vault thrust by doing so , they exposed their building to another strain from east to west , for the huge standing buttresses , with their arches and pinnacles , were liable to wind-strain and twisting ( ? flambement " ) in the direction of east and west , and could not be left isolated , but needed stiffening and tying together in the direction of the main axis of the building . The need for this explains the difference between the French and English vaults in the use of the wall arch . In a French church , where the walls between the buttresses have been entirely replaced by glass , the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is well seen at St. Urbain of Troyes ( p. 261 ) and at the Sainte Chapelle ( p. 98 ) ; and in some later buildings , like Mt . St. Michel , the buttresses are connected again by arches lower down . In England , where the wall always retained its importance , there was no need for this , so we have none of the gabled windows of the French . This point needs a little explanation , which will furnish us , // by the way , with a final demonstration of how the most beautiful features in a French cathedral are the results of the severest reasoning . When the walls were turned round in slices at right angles to the building , the wall arch , which was at first simply the arched end of the vaulting butting against the wall , was treated as a discharging arch which rendered unnecessary any wall below it . But unless weighted in some way this wall arch might be pushed out of the vertical at the crown by the pressure of the vaulting panel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a flat arch between the diagonal rib and the wall arch . Merely to build a straight wall across would weight the haunches of the wall arch , but not the crown . But a gable would put the weight exactly where wanted . In Champagne and // Burgundy , with their large stones , this was not needed , but in the Ile de France , the Beaux aisis , and Picardy , where materials are small , Ave find these gables from about 1240 . The annexed figure shows the arrangement at the Sainte Chapelle . It is not so simple as it looks . Gutters and balustrades are needed , and these must press , not on the vaulting panel , but on the arch , the water from the gable itself must have an outlet , and the whole must form an element of beauty . A is the or drip - moulding wall arch , B its hood ( vide section ) , 1 , the outline of the balus-trade butting- a-gainst tine gable , D the gutter , which , when free of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; F small cess-pit and gargoyles receiving the water from the slope of the gable , G the sloping cover-stone of the gable , where i t is narrow , below the cornice , with a little channel for the water , x the slope above the cornice throwing the water right and left . The finial K holds all together , and the crockets projecting a little over each joint protect it , and break the hard sloping line . Later these gables were pierced , and in Flamboyant times become per-fect lacework , as at St. Maclou ( p. 281 ) and Rue , but though lighter , they are quite stiff enough to do their work , and form one of the chief beauties of a late French church . // N'The flying buttress never became an essential feature in England . The Norman tradition of thick walls never lost its influence , and Durham , Lindisfarne , St. Cross , Wells , Rochester , Worcester choir , Salisbury , Southwell , Gloucester , Dore , Tintern , and Oxford had no flying buttresses originally , though in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steeple , they have been added since . At Selby , York , and Ely octagon , the vault was made of wood , so they were not necessary . Even when used they are seldom the objects of beauty which they are in France , but are applied in a halfhearted way as at Lincoln , or with far too great a slope as at Bath and Malmesbury . Westminster is a French church with a triple tier of buttresses in two flights , and it furnishes with Sherborne and St. Mary Redcliffe one of the very few really beautiful examples in England . In Henry VI I 's Chapel the wide double buttresses are connected by beautiful tracery , and the reversed curve so dear to sixteenthcentury builders is scientifically employed to prevent the upper arch rising at the haunches as it did in many later French buildings like Abbeville . One other contrivance must still be noticed , called by French architects the " tas de charge . " This will find its explanation if we analyze an imaginary French cathedral built with iron and wood as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a nave column carrying B the springer of the nave arch . The capital is larger towards the nave in order to carry the three iron and therefore incompressible vaulting shafts . Above B is a series of large blocks of stone corbelled out towards the aisle , the third of which , D , carries the transverse arch of the aisle vault . The three stones B , C , D form a third of the apparent height of the nave arch , but as their joints are horizontal they exercise no thrust and form a " tas de charge " or corbelled springers . The wall of the triforium is carried on an arch thrown across from the corbel v above the aisle vault . On the floor of the triforium , or on the slab K which forms its roof , rests the column m carrying the wall arch which also forms the head of the clerestory window . K serves also to bind the vaulting shafts firmly to the triforium wall . Up as high as m the courses L of the vaulting ribs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de charge , " so that the thrust of the vault only loo GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE begins at the block m , Q. N is the great outside buttress , generally heavily weighted with a niched statue and pinnacle and carrying the shores P which are tied together by a lock couple ( or " moise " ) R and end against the buttress Q. It will be seen from this that the flying buttress exercised little or no pushing effect on the wall , but simply trans- // mated the vault thrust to the buttress N. The whole wall , with its double passage on the triforium and clerestory levels , forms a sort of hollow buttress with its inner surface rigid , and its outer compressible . If the walls 1 settle , the only effect is to press the head Q of the big lintel more firmly against the shore p , and the only fear is lest this should buckle up in the middle , which it is prevented from doing by the lock couples ( or arcading ) R. It will be noticed that as the arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital ought by rights to be placed there , but since at that point the ribs have already begun to separate , it would be impossible to find room for them all , and later builders , feeling the capital to be a false piece of construction , omitted it altogether , as at St. Lo . The " tas de charge " appears in England at Glastonbury at the end of the twelfth century , but is by no means invariably made use of . In France it is not found in Notre Dame ( finished in 1220 ) but is in Soissons , begun in that year , and almost always afterwards . ' Io2 GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE On p . Iol is shown the springing of a vault in perspective : the blocks A and B with horizontal beds form the " tas de charge , " c ? the first with a radiating joint ? the skew-back , and above , n is the transverse arch , D ' the rib . The colonnette on the right is that which carries the wall arch . CHAPTER V THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle Ages took its origin in an attempt to reproduce that of ancient Rome . Now Roman architecture was chiefly an external show , a kind of scene painting in stone , with endless avenues and porticoes of monolithic columns , practically all of one style , the Corinthian . However imposing it may have been , it must almost have ceased to be beautiful from its monotony . Columns were little used internally except for decoration , standing in front of piers , as in the halls of the great baths like that of Diocletian , which now forms the church of Sta Maria degli Angeli in Rome ( p. 64 ) . Only in the peristyles of houses and in basilicas were they used constructively to separate by a colonnade the central court or aisle /from the sides . When the basilican form was adopted for the/Christian church , it was natural for the builders to strip th " columns from Pagan buildings and use them as best the could for their own purpose . By the eighth or ninth cent ry , or even earlier , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition of their use still remained in di . ricts which had been Roman or had Roman ruins still exis ing , such as Southern , Eastern , and Central France . In th Ise districts , therefore , we find the nave arches of the churches , even of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , genera ly carried by columns , often monolithic , as at Langres , M ' ntes , St. Leu , Vezelay , Pontigny , St. Remi at Reims , Nevers and throughout Auvergne , Berri , and Poitou , and th tradition of columnar supports persisted even where s ones of sufficient size for monoliths were not obtainable , as throughout the Ile de France . On the other hand , where there was nothing left to tell of Roman times or where the conditions of labour and materials io6 GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE did not allow of any attempt to imitate Roman columns , as in Normandy , we find the arches supported as a rule on piers . It should be remembered also that Norman archi-tecture was derived through Burgundy from Lombardy , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and piers had become the rule . The streams of development rising from these two sources soon run into one , but certain differences , due throughout to their different origin , should be borne in mind . We will begin with the Ile de France , starting with the cathedral of Notre Dame , where , as in most of the churches of earlier date , the nave arches are carried by cylindrical columns , with very large square cap-itals of extremely beauti-ful and somewhat class-ical character , forming a most impressive arched colonnade . On these capitals , on the nave side , stand the bases of three slender shafts which rise up through the triforium and carry the transverse arches and diagonal ribs of the high vault . The arrangem nt was illogical and the effect of these shafts standing on t e great capital unsupported from below was unsatisfactop , jy , so at Laon other shafts are placed below them ( p. 1151 , and at Paris , in finishing the nave , the last two columns lll have an engaged three-quarter colonnette in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own capital carrying the three bases , in the other running up through a mere band and supporting the shaft carrying the transverse arch . It was already felt that to maintain the principle of each arch or rib being carried by its own shaft with a base on the ground-level was more important than to keep the aspect of an unbroken colonnade . Indeed , this principle had already been carried out fully in the aisles . // In 1215 at Amiens , the transverse arch of the aisles and the inner " order " of the nave arches have each a separate shaft with a capital of one course attached to the main column , whilst that of the transverse arch of the high vault passes up in front and has its own capital at the springing of the vault , the original main column with a capital of two courses appearing behind these four attached shafts ( p. 240 ) . We here have the principle illustrated that every arch or rib must have its own column , and every column its own capital at the springing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Bourges , and a little later in St. Denis choir in 1240 ( p. 231 ) , we find this fully carried out , the colonnettes of the ribs also being brought down off the capital and passing to the ground in front of the main column which finally becomes surrounded with colonnettes . To lessen the monotony of this , a fillet was put on the front of each , giving a bright line . But even so this accumulation of little similar shafts became wearisome , and , after the " tas de charge " had come into use , it was seen that the capitals under the ribs marked nothing . The rib mouldings themselves were therefore carried down unbroken instead of being changed into colonnettes at a capital the transverse arch alone sometimes retaining its capital , as at St. Ouen ( p. 265 ) , in order to avoid the excessive projection which carrying the mouldings themselves down to the ground would have caused . The transition can be well seen by comparing the piers of Notre Dame de 1'Epine ( Marne ) , St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pier therefore gave very nearly a section of all the ribs and arches . Very nearly but not quite , because so soon as the " tas de charge " was adopted it became necessary to concentrate the ribs and let them die into one another , to allow of their finding room on one capital . This could not be done if the important mouldings remained on the sides of the ribs as in early work . They would disappear or become hopelessly confused after the intersection . It became necessary to make the central projection of the rib the important feature of each moulding , that is to make the rib triangular and to mark its apex strongly , first by a fillet on the front of the original roll , later , by considerably deepening the hollows on either side . Finally , in constantly aiming to Ito GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE get the lights and shadows strongly contrasted , fillets were added again on either side of each hollow , and the central point sharpened and lengthened , till the hard wire-drawn prismatic mouldings of the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an inevitable process of evolution . But all this was very costly , and in the latest buildings the cylindrical column reappeared and the mouldings were allowed to die into it , as in the crypt of Mt . St. Michel ; or as at St. Severin , Paris , into the plain surface of a lozengeshaped pier , in which all idea of the column has vanished . It will be noticed that owing to the vault and not the column being in the mind of the French builder from the first , he never arrived at the lozenge-shaped clustered column of the English Decorated , nor at the Perpendicular pier of four colonnettes and four shallow hollows or bracket mouldings . But these logical French builders felt that they must not abandon the principle that every arch or rib ought to find its proper base on the floor line . Let us look for a moment at the development of the base . Before the thirteenth century the round bases of the columns rested as in classical times on a square plinth with which they coincided in diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangles between the circle and the corners of the square . In the thirteenth century the plinths were usually made octagonal as at Reims , while in Normandy and England they became circular . Then the claws became unnecessary , but in their place the torus moulding of the base of the column was made larger than the plinth , and little corbels were put under the projecting part , and when the columns were engaged in a wall , the base moulding was continued along the wall , and all columns large or small had the same moulding for their bases . The feeling was that the building ought to rest on a strongly marked horizontal line of support near the eye . The feeling was a true one and the artistic effect of the early thirteenth-century bases is far more satisfying than that of the later ones . But in French architecture the reason gradually killed the art , and by the fourteenth century it was beginning to be felt that the smaller columns ought to have smaller bases than the large ones . So the // mouldings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building became predominant , two weak rounded mouldings , resting one on the other , were substituted for the broad base with its double torus and dark hollow be-tween , and all the different bases of columns and colonnettes were put at different heights ; till at last , as we have seen , the column itself disappeared and the rib mouldings ran down to the floor . But it was still felt that in spite of their having intersected with each other or died into the pier surface , each arch or rib ought to be indicated on the base line , or the idea of the upspringing of the vault complete from the floor would have disappeared . Each little rib must have its own base ; so even if it had itself vanished in some other moulding or died into the pier it was supposed to have been continued down inside , and " on this supposition the place of its emergence is calculated with the utmost nicety and cut with singular precision , so that an elaborate late base of a divided column , as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looks exactly as if its smaller shafts had all been finished to the ground first , each with its com-plete and intricate base , and then the comprehending base of the central pier had been moulded over them in clay , leaving their points and angles sticking out here and there , like the edges of sharp crystals out of a nodule of earth . " We have just seen that though the French started by carrying out the traditional basilican form of a row of columns carrying arches on either side of the nave , yet in the final form of their Gothic pier the column disappears , drowned beneath the ribs of the vaulted roof which have passed down in front of it and absorbed it . In Normandy and consequently in England , it was not the basilican colonnade which gave the origin to the Gothic pier . If it must be traced to any Roman source , it must be the pier and attached column of the cooling rooms of the great Baths , between which is a filling-in of smaller columns and arches . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Ambrose at Milan , and St. Michael at Pavia , where we find an elaborate development of the simple square pier with a half column attached to // each face , as in many earlier Lombard churches , in all of which the principle shows itself of every arch or arch " order " having its own support . The early Norman piers such as those of Winchester ( p. 54 ) and Bernay ( p. 188 ) are simply modifications of this . The angular piers of Norwich ( p. 104 ) and Peterborough , with their slender shafts in each nook , give a greater impression of strength and perfect adaptation to their function of carrying an arch , than even so beautiful a modification of the original column as that of Laon where some of the shafts have three banded colon-nettes standing in front of them and supporting the abacus and the bases of the five vaulting shafts above ( p. 115 ) . For a while this Norman type was superseded by a modification of the French columnar model . In the year ii8o William of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a direct copy of Sens but with round instead of pointed arches , and the beautiful coupled columns of Sens ( pp. 59 , 1i5 ) are copied in the Trinity Chapel . Except in one par-ticular Canterbury had little influence on English art , that one being the clustered columns of the choir which consist of eight banded shafts of Purbeck marble surrounding a central column ( p. 58 ) . They are of purely French type , very like those of Laon , with square abaci and capitals of one course , the central column having one of two courses . But unlike Laon they are of Purbeck marble instead of free-stone , and for the next hundred years this form of support gave the keynote to our English style , almost as much as the downward continuation of the vaulting mouldings , till the nave pier was entirely composed of them , did to French art . The contrast of the dark polished shafts of arcade or nave pier set off against the white background of the wall or central column , took the English fancy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry its lines up into the vault . It tended , therefore , to strengthen the English inclination derived from Norman times to design the building in three horizontal stages of main arcade , triforium and clerestory , and not in a vertical treatment of each bay separately . Its influence went further than this , however . Purbeck marble can be got only in short lengths , and circular bands were needed to divide and support the shafts . Base and abacus soon followed suit , so the square form of capital of liltl llit . I:l'III the French cathedrals and of Wells gave place Best to the octagonal form of the north porch ( p. 223 ) , and then to the round turned mouldings , which crown the foliage of Lincoln ( p. 238 ) and the hollow bell of Salisbury . On looking at the graceful outline of the caps which encircle such a group of shafts as those in the choir of Ely , one sees at once that their beauty is almost independent of their function as supports , and that to make them carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat surface and simple roll moulding on the arris , would produce a horrible discord . At Amiens the twocoursed central capital gives a largeness of scale which harmonizes well with the broad square arches , but which is entirely lacking in the English example . For charge and carrier to be in harmony the arch , like its support , must show marked bands of black and white such as can be given by undercut rolls and dark open hollows . So with the shafted marble column comes that wealth of full rich mouldings which is very seldom found in France . To get such richness was impossible while the square form of the arch order was retained , so English mouldings are generally designed upon a chamfered contour instead of on a square outline , an advance which was not adopted in France until a very late period . Yet beautiful as the shafted column was , it was hardly- a logical support , and when after some sixty years it was found that Purbeck fossil marble ? one of the most perishable of marbles ? soon lost its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detached shaft also . Meanwhile the Norman pier , with its engaged columns , had never been wholly abandoned , especially in the North , but had been undergoing a steady process of development , from which resulted in the fourteenth century the lozenge-shaped clustered pier which retained its supremacy to the end . It would be difficult to find any more beautiful forms of support than those of Beverley and Exeter ( p . Si ) or St. Mary 's , York . In these , the shafts are no longer detached nor formed of dark Purbeck against a white ground , but the whole pier with its semicircular engaged colonnettes is built in courses ; the effects of light and shade are half tones , symphonies in gray , not violent contrasts . The arch-mouldings follow suit and in Decorated work become broader and shallower , the casement , or hollow dividing the different 16 GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE arch orders , is much less deep though broader , and finally , in Perpendicular times , the bracket and the wave , with their subtle gradations of tone , take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One may perhaps compare the change to that from the sharp crisp tune of early music to the pensive melody of a nocturne . In following out , as we have just been doing , the development of the column or pier and its mouldings in France and England , it is interesting to mark once again the same national characteristics which we have already noted pursuit of a logical scheme by the French , contentment with a smaller but satisfactory practical result in detail by the English . That the pier should indicate and lead the eye up to the vault was the French ideal , that it should be beautiful in itself was the English one , so much so , that often , as in the exquisite examples of Exeter and Durham , the arch mouldings are adapted to the pier instead of the pier to the arch . The clustered columns are not even arranged and designed in various groups and sizes , as at Bayeux and Coutances , so as to mark distinctly their various purposes i.e. , what arches , mouldings or ribs they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest number of detached or semidetached shafts , some of which may even have nothing to carry , as at Durham and Lincoln ( p. 238 ) . It was quite in accordance with the same idea of nothing being allowed to interfere with the shafted or clustered pier as a thing of beauty in itself , that the vaulting shafts were so seldom allowed to run down to the ground . In the earlier examples , as at Peterborough and Malmesbury ( p. 211 ) , they rest , as at Notre Dame and Laon , on the abacus , an unsightly arrangement as was felt in both countries . But when the French ran theirs down the English stopped them either on the clerestory sill as at Wells , or on the triforium ledge as at St. David 's , Hexhani and Rievaulx , or a little below it as at Salisbury , none of which systems is satisfactory , and the last much the reverse . They all leave an awkward spandrel between the pier arches , so at Ely , Lincoln presbytery ( p. 238 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest on long floriated corbels , generally of great beauty , whose points just touch the abacus , and which form stops to the hoodmould enclosing the arch . This is quite as good an arrangeTHE // men ' , constructionally , as the French one , and far more beautiful . The hoodmould is a projecting moulding concentric with the arch , of dripstone section , and properly an outside feature . It is peculiar to England , being found only in one or two churches in Normandy , at Bayeux , and Graville , and probably arose from the Anglo-Norman habit of covering the wall surface with scale work as at Christchurch , or with n square diaper pattern as in Ernulph 's Canterbury , and Rochester . The custom of diapering the wall lasted till the end of the thirteenth century , and is largely used with beautiful effect in Grossetete 's Lincoln , and Westminster Abbey ( p. 54 ) . Some moulding was necessary above the arch , against which to stop it , and the hood mould was probably used by the Normans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly to the richness of the archmouldings . There was yet another Norman use which permanently influenced the character of English mouldings , that of enriching them . Until the chisel came into use , rough zigzags or chevrons , cut according to the size of the stone and before it was placed in position , were as much as could be man-aged with the axe , but when mastery had been obtained over the chisel , the chevron became undercut as at New Shoreham and Glastonbury , the Norman nail head be-came the early English dog tooth , as at Canterbury , the pearl developed into the decorated ball flower used in such profusion at Gloucester ( p. 121 ) . Although as the hollows in the mouldings became larger and shallower the oppor-tunity for enrichments diminished , yet they by no means J disappeared ; the paterae of the triforium of Ely choir , and the portcullises and Tudor roses of Henry VIPs chapel , are all relics of the same tendency which is hardly found in France outside Normandy , until the latest style , when the GOTHIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with beautiful undercut leaves of twisted thistle . There is a point which may be noted here as forming one of the great distinctions between the building methods of mediaeval and of ancient and modern times , since it is seen most strikingly in enriched mouldings . If an old Norman doorway with its zigzags and bird heads be compared with its modern copy or restoration , the latter appears quite flat and dead , though as a copy it may be perfectly exact . The reason is that in the original the delight of the individual workman in his work appears , in the latter there is no sign of it . The same difference exists between ancient Roman and mediaeval work . In Roman times the great gangs of workmen following one another round and round a building and each doing his own special piece of work , took precisely the same amount of interest and pride in it as is felt by the men taken on for the job by some great modern contractor , that is they cared nothing at all about it . Also in Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run up with their mouldings and details simply blocked out and were cleaned down ( ravales ) , and the mouldings run afterwards quite regardless of the joints or of any relation between the size of the blocks and the details . But in the Middle Ages , the wide joints and rough slow setting mortars would not have allowed of this , every stone had to have a form fitted for its work or position or to carry a complete leaf or zigzag or ornament , and to be cut and finished for its place beforehand in the sheds ( sur lc /as ) . Each workman therefore had a personal interest in his own particular stone and in its success : it had to be complete in itself , independently to some extent of its size or exact position amongst its fellows , it had a sort of personality distinct from the others , just as he himself had . This is why the machine-made perfection and regularity of modern work seems so dead ; it is dead , it has in it no spark of human life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same difference between the results of the heart-felt personal labour in mediaeval days which brought joy to the worker , and those of the organized , irresponsible gang-work of Roman and of modern times which is a weariness of the flesh , as there was between that of the Israelites in Egypt // g fulfilling their work , their daily task of bricks all exactly alike , and that of Bezaleel , the son of Uric , who " was filled with the spirit of God in wisdom , in understanding and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship . " It may be well to enter rather more fully into the develop-ment of the mouldings in the two countries . Till the end of the eleventh century , both in France and England , arches in all positions are square edged as at Winchester ( p. 56 ) , and they remain so in France longer than in England ; the intrados , or inner surface of the arch , being kept flat in France , so that one centring might suffice , but in England there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Christchurch , ' Durham , and Gloucester nave , which must have involved the use of two centrings . At the Abbaye aux Hommes and Bayeux a roll is cut on the angle , and at Durham ( 1696 ) , w probably is of somewhat earlier date , the addition of a ca.rveollow on each side of the roll adds greatly to the richness of the effect . At Norwich ( p. 104 ) the increased delicacy of the moulding foreshadows the richness of the following period . This richness increases rapidly in England , but in France , except for the addition of a projecting round or oval on the intrados , the general character changes but little until the middle of the fourteenth century , when the large shallow hollow , characteristic of flamboyant work , appears at St. Severin , Paris . This is chiefly due to the fact that each arch order has its own set of mouldings , cut out of the rectangular block and always ending with a roll or bowtell on the edge , and there is little undercutting . In England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series forming one archivolt looks as if it had been set out as a whole , and the distinction between the arch orders disappears in a way it does not in France till much later . Undercutting diminishes in England after the middle of the thirteenth century , the mouldings becom-ing flatter and broader , but it increases steadily in France until just before the end , and the mouldings become smaller and sharper . // Both in England and France mouldings as a rule are formed out of the solid block solely by removing edges , and sinking hollows , and are never excrescences on the original surface of the block , the projecting hoodmould ( d , figs. r and 2 , below ) over an English arch being formed from a separate stone . ' There are three planes out of which mouldings are cut , one parallel with the wall the wall plane a one at right angles to it , parallel with the soffit , or under surface of the arch ? the soffit plane b and the third , the plane formed by chamfering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forty-five degrees the clurmfer plane c . In France , until well on in the fifteenth century , mouldings are never cut on the chamfer plane , and in England very rarely until the end of the thirteenth century , but in Perpendicular times almost invariably . In fig. i the mouldings are on the rectangular planes ; those in figs. 2 and 3 wholly on the chamfer plane . Figs. i and 2 are Early English . They are both modifications of the roll and fillet , and both show the extreme capriciousness of Early English mouldings , in which the members and curves are drawn free-hand , not geometrically ; they are characterized by deep undercut hollows , leaving the projecting rounds with very narrow necks ; they are , in fact , much more suitable for woodwork than for stone . Effective as they usually are , the nearly equal size of the members and the regular alternation of dark and // light is apt to produce a monotonous effect . In Decorated work ( fig. 3 , p. 120 ) this is avoided by much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hollows are broader and shallower , and form a separa-tion between groups of mouldings , instead of between individual members . They are usually compass-drawn and not free-hand , and therefore sometimes have a machine-made look , which , however , is far greater in Perpendicular times , an effect increased by the constant repetition of the shallow double ogee , the so-called brace or bracket ( fig. 4 e , p. iao ) , alternating with the broad hollow casement moulding ( f ) . The tendency in English work then is to constantly increasing shallowness and breadth of effect ; in French work it is precisely the reverse . One cause of this has already been indicated in the influence of the dark shafts of Purbeck marble upon the arches above . To the Frenchmen of the late twelfth century the column , and its load , the arch , were two distinct things , and there was no reason to do more than soften the rigid squareness of the arch ; to the Englishman they formed a whole ? the lower story of his building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was probably due in part to the feeling that greater unity was thereby given to the pier and arch , especially after moulded bands had had to be introduced into the former , to take the short lengths of the Purbeck shafts . During the latter part of the thirteenth century , when the vaulting ribs of a French church begin to come down to the ground , they also begin to influence the arch section , and in the later fourteenth century they practically deter-mine it , but this was never the case to any great extent in England . The earliest vaulting ribs in both countries are // simply square arches , unmoulded , as in Gloucester crypt , or later with a roll on each angle . But it soon became evident that what was required in a vaulting rib was not breadth but depth , which was obtained by slightly narrowing the rib and adding a filleted roll beneath , as at Amiens , the Sainte-Chapelle , and Salisbury . The difference in the history and character of the two styles is so clearly seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trace it out ( p . I21 ) . In the early form of rib of Amiens or Salisbury there is a vagueness and indecision in the half tones between the rounds and hollows which makes the member look weak . The lower roll therefore is filleted , and the hollow is enlarged . Then , in France , all the rolls receive fillets , which gradually become so large that they absorb the rounds and the moulding becomes a series of hollows separated by sharp lines of light . In the latest examples the fillets are all turned downwards , and a second thin course is added above the original rib , leaving a ledge under the vaulting surface on which the movable " cerce " could be placed , and giving a dark line between the rib and the panel , which adds greatly to the light appearance of the vault ( p. 121 , Io ) . We have said that the section of these late vaulting ribs practically determines that of the arch . This is well seen in the choir of St. Ouen ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covers the full width of the pier except the shaft , c , which receives the transverse arch c and cross ribs of the high vault . The mouldings , G , form the transverse arch of the aisle , and n its rib , and as these die into the corresponding members of the pier , there is no need for any capital , and the " tas de charge " reaches up to N. // See also St. Maclou , Rouen ( p. 123 ) , and Abbeville ( p . III ) . / In England , where the vaulting ribs remain independent of the arch , they follow the general tendency of the other mouldings . During the thirteenth century there is sometimes an attempt , as at Southwark ( 1250 ) and Lincoln , to get an additional line of light by adding a curious square-edged projection above the rest of the rib ( p. 121 , 4 ) . This , like exaggerated undercutting , was soon abandoned , and the rib mouldings , like those of the arches , become shallower and broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to their complicated intersections , they become extremely simple and small , and consist merely of two hollows and a small roll beneath ( p. 121 , 9 , II ) . The string courses in French work are singularly beautiful and better adapted to their purpose , on the whole , than English ones , at least in the form of dripstones on the exterior . In England but little difference was made between those on the exterior and in the interior . Both had as a rule a rounded surface , which even when there was a fillet below ( lid not throw the rain off from the walls ( p. 120 , I and 2 , d ) . In France the profile of a cornice or exterior string is admirably adapted to throw the water far off and prevent its creeping round the hollow as the English form allows // it to do . Nothing can be better than the cornices of Notre Dame or Amiens ; that of the facade of the towers of Notre Dame is on an immense scale and is taken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in buildings of this period . We have chosen this example because it offers also a striking instance of the use of crockets to break a hard , straight line against the sky . Owing to the strong ver-ticality of French Gothic , string courses are rare in interiors , but at Amiens the grand band of carving carried under the triforium is splen-did in effect and execution , and above it comes a plain sloping string like a drip mould in appearance , but set back from the edge of the lower course ; and here , as at Lincoln , the bases of the triforium pillars and , in this case , their capitals also , have curious stilted forms , very ugly when seen from the level , but of perfect outline when viewed from below as they are meant to be . In the illustration on this page A gives the real mouldings of the capital , shows them as they appear from below , B gives those of the base , s and B " as they show from below at an angle of sixty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI WINDOW TRACERY BY the end of the twelfth century , both in France and England , the pointed arch had come into use , not only as a constructional expedient , as in the earlier part of the centur , but as a decorative feature in all parts of a building/ It appears first in England , as we have seen , in I128-33 in the transverse arches of Durham nave , and shortly after in other vaults , as a means of covering vary-ing spans with arches of the same height . /By the middle of the century it is found used in the nave arches , as at Malmesbury ( p. 211 ) in order to facilitate the vaulting of the aisles ; and then gradually , as the eye became accus-tomed to the new form , it was used everywhere . In France , and especially in Southern and Central France , it appears earlier than in Normandy and England . In France the development of window tracery follows on that of the vault , and it therefore appears first in the clerestory win-dows . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romanesque window changed its round arch for a pointed one , and at Notre Dame a little later , when the uselessness of the wall became apparent , and the desire for a larger field for the display of stained glass was making itself felt , the window was ( 1225 ) en-larged . The head was retained but the window was enorm-ously lengthened by destroying the roses which had existed below , and by including in it the space covered by them and the triforium roof . This whole being far too large for glazing in one light , a central colonnette was inserted , carrying two small pointed arches , on which rests a huge circle of stone filling nearly all the space of the old Roman-esque window ( p. 129 ) . Even so , the whole has required // strengthening by an elaborate system of iron bars , and the effect of the great bare circle is far from satisfactory . At Chartres ( early thirteenth century ) where they possessed a hard stone easily split into thin slabs , this circle becomes a thing of beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forming round the centre a circle of great cusps holding the iron ring which carries the glass . In this case the wall arch is made semicircular , to enable the rose to be exactly fitted under it . Beneath the rose are two pointed lights placed side by side . Other places , like Reiff and Amiens , which had not the advantage of the Chartres stone , had to build up their windows with small materials , but adopted thence the system of cusping round the circle , which henceforth became one of the chief characteristics of Gothic window-tracery , and did away with the need for the elaborate iron bars of Notre Dame . At Reims , where they first appear after Chartres , the cusps are inserted into a groove in the great circle , and have blunt ends into which the iron ring which sui ports the - lass is screwed . At a Amiens , the circle cuspings are still separate and fixed in a groove , but they are trefoiled , so as to diminish the ring , and the lower lights have cusps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even these had a useful origin in strengthening the little arch of the win-dow-light . This is very thin and liable to break , especi-ally in French work of the late thirteenth century , such as St. Nazaire of Carcassonne ; but the cusp underneath it converted this slender bar into a strong triangle , even when the cusp was itself pierced . But even thus , the glazing spaces of windows of this size were felt to be still too large . Far more was this the case when spaces so enormous had to be filled as those under the high vaults in the clerestory of Amiens . Their truthful // logical spirit made these Amiens builders reject the use of iron as any essential part in a stone construction , and their artistic sense caused them to feel that huge undivided window openings falsified the scale of their buildings , while their practical knowledge told them that they would // be a source of danger in storms . They could , however , only start from what they knew and had seen . They therefore carried out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two small pointed arches resting on a central colonnette and carrying a circle above , and between the central mullion and the walls they simply repeated this design , using in all the circles the Chartres system of cusping . But the stonework is too uniformly heavy , and out of proportion to the smaller lights , and there is a want of subordination iii the whole . In the transepts this fault is corrected ; the side-lights , while larger in proportion to the main circle , have lighter mouldings and trefoils instead of circles in the heads . These windows , and to a still greater extent those of the two Sainte-Chapelles of Paris and St. Germain , are perfect examples of the Gothic window at the time of its fullest development in the thirteenth cen-tury . Like everything else in Gothic art they are the result of subtle reasoning and exquisite artistic sense . No part is useless , the cuspings and trefoils , for instance , come 1 32 GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE exactly where they are needed to strengthen the bars of stone , or to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the space keeps to the human scale of the whole building , and gives a true idea of its size , instead of making it look smaller , as do the huge undivided windows of St. Peter 's , which one instinctively judges to be of the usual size ; the subordination of the mouldings satisfies the eye and indicates that the main arch and central column really carry all the weight . Instead , therefore , of the windows being black caverns when viewed from outside , as in most other styles , they form perhaps the most beautiful and harmonious portion of a perfect whole . We have seen that in France , Gothic tracery took its origin in filling the large space left under the wall arch of the high vaults , with stone bars forming , as a rule , two or four lights carrying circles . ( In these , rather than in the piercing of the wall with grouped window openings as at Soissons , Chalons-sur-Marne , and Chartres , is to be found the origin of French geometric tracery . But if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse to be the case . The French builder of the Ile de France , unhampered by previous traditions or remains of ancient buildings , but gifted with the keenest logical and artistic faculties , had come to make of his cathedral a stone vault , carried by tall columns connected by arches under which no wall was really needed , any more than it is at the ends of the arches of a railway viaduct . It was therefore possible for him , as in the thirteenth-century chapel of St. Germain-en-Laye , to fill up every corner with glass . This little building is the most perfect expression of French Gothic art , finer even than the Sainte Chapelle of Paris . In this latter the buttresses have too much projection on the exterior , and are too close together , the windows too high and narrow and heavy in the upper part , the gables rather heavy and unnecessary , given the closeness of the buttresses , and in the interior the vaulting piers are so slight and have so little projection that they fail to satisfy the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buttresses project inside the building , and the windows , set back as they are , are evidently a mere screen , so the whole rectangle between the cornice and the buttresses // can be glazed without giving any sense of insecurity . The horizontal line of the passage under the windows in the interior gives a firm base to the building , and a fine contrast to the vertical line of the pier , yet without breaking it . The design of the windows as a whole , and in detail , is finer than that of Paris , where some of the hardness and dryness of later French work is just beginning to make itself felt . T34 GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE Had the architect of St. Germain had the resources which enabled Pierre de Montereau to cover his building with its exquisite sculpture , there can be no question as to which would have produced the finer work of the two . To return to our windows , the Englishman , much less keenly logical and idealistic , essentially practical in his ways and aims , caring far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with solid churches , built with immense thickness of wall , looked on his windows as openings made in the wall for the purpose of admitting light , and not as screens built under an arch to keep out the weather . He was the more inclined to do this because , from the first , many of his larger churches were unvaulted . So he simply carried on the window traditions of his forefathers . These were twofold , Saxon and Norman . In the North , the Saxon churches which had owed their origin to Monkwearmouth had almost always very narrow slips of windows placed high up to prevent robbers entering . And in all the larger Norman churches the clerestory almost invariably consisted of a passage in the thickness of the wall , with a tall centre arch and two lower ones carried by a couple of columns , on the interior ; and of a single round-headed window opposite the centre arch on the exterior ( pp. 197 , 289 ) . As soon as the pointed arch became a decorative as well as a constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lancet window of Early English times , that is of the latter part of the twelfth century , became the prevailing form . In the south , where the Saxon churches had been of the Basilican or Roman type , and where in later days the French school had some influence , as at Wells and Canterbury , we find the broader proportions of the Norman window maintained , but with a pointed head . Possibly also , in this part of England , the architecture of the Soissonnais , where broad lancets were in use , was not without its effect . In the north , however , and especially in Lincolnshire , where late Saxon churches abound , the tall narrow lancet became the prevailing type , first singly , then in groups of two or three of equal height , but with the centre one broadest , as at Lincoln ( 185-1200 ) , and then as in the Norman clerestory , in threes with the centre one highest . In the transepts of Hexham ( 1203 ) , // at York ( 1215-55 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which could hardly be surpassed . The lancet windows rapidly spread south , and before the middle of the thirteenth century we find them in perfection in Ely choir ( 1230-50 ) , Salisbury ( 1229-58 ) , and Hereford ( 1230 ) . In the aisles even of small churches like Warmington ( Northants ) we find them in groups of two or three under the comprising wall-arch of the vault , and where they are in two , as at Netley or in Lincoln triforium , it was natural to pierce the space above with a quatrefoil or other opening ( pp. 136 , 137 ) .1 Indeed , this had already been done in Norman times , as at Peter-borough . This fondness for the exquisite grace of the lancet , and especially for its triple grouping , causes our English window tracery to differ in character from that of France . We have seen how the French four-light traceried window of Amiens and Reims arose from the desire to fill the immense space under the high vaults of their cathedrals with stone bars instead of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient , that the space was divided into four . Not until the fourteenth century do we find many French three-light windows . Our English window , therefore , was not merely derived from the French . We have early French bar tracery at Westminster , but it was not thence that our tracery took its character , any more than English Gothic as a whole found its source in Canterbury . The English window is chiefly a development of plate tracery , and arose from piercing the solid wall between a group of lancets and its comprising arch , with circles or quatrefoils . And since three lancets form a happier combination than any other under the end of avault or in a gable , our English traceried windows have an odd number of lights quite as often as an even one . Again the fenestration of an English square east end is totally unlike that of a French transept . Such a group as that of the Five Sisters at York , or the east end of Ely ( p.245 ) , when combined into one great mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space above the lancet lights , will result in a composition of much greater breadth , both in effect and in proportion , and one with much heavier // mullions between the lights than the French window . There is also more subordination of the mullions in English geometrical than in French , in which after the thirteenth century all the mullions have as a rule nearly the same section , which is kept as small as possible , smaller than in English work . Al-though by the year 1250 the two styles had become very similar , yet the differences of their origin can be traced even up to the end . The French , after developing the simple form of tracery composed of circles or spherical triangles , in the thirteenth century , were content to stand still for a century , and we find no practical change in window design till 1370 , when flamboyant tracery suddenly appears in the facade of the cathedral of Rouen and in some of the chapels of Amiens Cathedral . ' We have seen the same halt in the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect early and then stereotyped it , and for more than a hundred years after 1250 there is hardly any variation , while the English moved on with a constant advance of expression . The later thirteenth and the four-teenth century is the time of the great development of window tracery in England , during what we call the Decorated period . Although this Decorated style is commonly divided into three , Geometrical , Flowing or Curvilinear , and Flamboyant , no clear line can he drawn between them . Tracery of all three kinds is to be found in the same building , or even in the same window as at Carlisle ( p. 126 ) , where the presence of the small circles rather detracts from the beauty of the design . There is , however , a gradual development . The early bar-traceried geometrical design , such as the l WINDOW TRACERY ; q shafted one of the east end of Lincoln ( p. 47 ) , by the change of its circles into triangles or trefoils , becomes like the mullioned one of V'ork chapter-house passage ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapel . Then , by a further attempt to get rid of unsightly corners , it comes to resemble that of Merton College Chapel , and finally by flattening the sides of the circle in the head and letting its outline join itself to the light below by a reversed carte , we reach the design of St. Mary 's , Oxford , which may be called either flowing or flamboyant . The difference between the two is more easily seen than described . It consists in the presence in flamboyant of what the French call mouchettes ( snuffers ) and soufflets ( bellows ) ; the latter are quatrefoils with their upper and lower lobes lengthened into ogees by the absorption of the intermediate triangles ; the former are the narrow flamelike shapes formed between the ogees of the lights and the intrados of the containing arch . Flamboyant tracery , therefore , results from and is dependent on the ogee curve . The east window of Carlisle , and the west window                  @ @ @
