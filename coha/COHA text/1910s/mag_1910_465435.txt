THIS is the simple story of J. H. P. , whom we will call Farmer John , blind from birth , who had all the machinery of viaion , except for a pair of cataract lenses which curtained the world from his healthy retinas like ground-glass pebbles . These were removed by Dr. James L. Minor when the man was forty years old , and he then first learned to see , it will be a question which half of Farmer John 's life drama ? his years in darkness or in light ? is the more interesting . For before his eyes were opened he had acquired a marvellous skill with his ether senses ; he could almost rival the homing pigeon in direction sense , follow a spoor like a hound , trade horses with the best of David Harums , tell the color of horse or mule , and that of hosiery , orsteds , and scarfs . This man was well developed , healthy , . : nick-witted , shrewd . and , we may say , observant though uneducated . He acquired a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , mall rails , split shingles , and pick cotton , often eighty-five pounds a day . He wove baskets , gathered rush from the Louisiana swamps , and meshed new bottoms in chairs which had been worn through by lazier fellows . He learned to pick , shuck , and assort corn and pull fodder . He felled trees and split two hundred rails a clay . He built rail fences after the " worm " was laid ? his eyeless senses could not line a surveyor 's plot without running a string from one corner-stone to another . Farmer John did what many a man with five senses and little sense had failed to do ? he earned and bought a forty-acre farm , clearing half , which he cultivated with the hearty aid of his wife and five children . What family would not work tinder the influence of such noble industry ! He could not use the plough or hoe , for the ploughman must look ahead and the man with the hoe must . know " prissly " front cabbage . Ile specialized " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoed his fields . lie was a rare sportsman , following the hounds afoot after opossums , coons , mid even foxes . Ile was usually at the finish , often got the brush , and always knew the a'ay home . We wonder that the spirrow - hawk , flitting with great speed through the thicket , does not bump its heed and fall senseless to the ground . But bird 's eyes make very . quick change in focus . Farmer John ran after the hounds through thicket and brush and woods without bumping , and he had no eyes to guide him . When he walked down the hospital hall they placed obstructing chattels in his path , but he turned aside and touched none of them . After many turns through the streets of the unfamiliar city of Memphis , and the halls and offices of the hospital , when asked which way lay home he correctly pointed to the south . It seems rational to state that Fanner John 's sense of direction was occult . The sun by day ; the stars and moon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunless side , of trees ; the bend of trees Before prevailing winds ; the trend of streams ; the " lay of the land , " paths , broken twigs ; the cipher language of the winds that tells much of the ozone of The hills ; the moisture of seas , earth scent of the lowlands , and chill of the upper air ; the bearing of birds and animals , and many unlisted signs that Leatherstocking would have understood , aid normal men of the woods . And I wish I could complete the list by naming which of these and whatever else are sensed by the homing pigeon when it rises in the air , circles about a moment . and then darts away with unerring aim for the cote that may be hundreds of miles afar . Often , when hunting coons , opossums , or foxes at night , the companions of Farmer John " tried to lose him , " but could not succeed . In fact , lie occasionally heaped coals of firc on their obfuscated heads by leading them home when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the night chasing a fox , he and his companions , having lost direction , disagreed about it . They went their way and he went his . He went straight home , arriving at noon . They wandered away from home until Teaching a railroad , which set . them right , they returned only at evening . If anything in this world seems wholly for the service of eyes it is colors . Whether they flash iridescently from bubble or dewdrop or opal , or glow in the living coals , or stain green the knees of stumbling youngsters , or hold true to the bottom of a pot of paint , they are all intangible reflections ? vibratory waves of light , sensations only in the brain 's centres of sight . Yet Farmer John learned to recognize colors in worsteds , hosiery , and scarfs with more accuracy than most men are capable of who are color-blind , and he could not use his eyes . He could not recognize the color of eyes nor the blue of streams and lakes , for they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which differs from a department store mainly in size ; and with the aid of his wife sold stocking-6 , woollen skeins , bandannas , and occasionally neckties ; and as the most brilliant and elemental colors sold best , he had touch-color lessons of the most kindergarten form . Through constant practice under his faithful wife 's guidance , he learned that certain sensations ( which he could not name ) when handling goods meant red , green , yellow , blue , as the color might he . This acquired skill brought a double reward , as many people " shopped " just to see the miracle . His success as a clerk of colors was not due to his wife 's arrangement of the goods on the shelves , as he would correctly replace the well-shuffled goods after a shopper had done her worst . Farmer Inlm ranked among his neighbors as shrewd and successful at swapping horses . He could pick out a black , white , bay , roan , or sorrel horse or mule , and tell the age by feeling the relative hardness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by looking at the teeth . Scent and sound aided him in this work . Dark animals emanate stronger odors than light ones . Lameness or peculiarity in gait was detected with the animal in motion . Health , spirits , energy , blindness , balkiness , kicking , all came to the knowledge of this blind Sherlock . He would have scorned the use of a clinical thermometer . When first told he might gain his sight by an operation he replied , " I do not care to see . " Was this the retort of habit , contentment , fear of pain , or contempt of sight which had allowed a blind man to lead seeing men home ? After repeated urging , with a germinating curiosity , he promised a friend that he would visit a doctor . He " wanted to see his wife , " who he believed was most beautiful . " Finally consulting Dr , James L. Minor , professor of diseases of the eye , at Memphis , Tennessee , he repeatedly " balked " before permitting the surgeon to remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand pain , " he was unwilling to lie in bed . to have bis eyes bandaged , and . as a last stand . " Can I smoke ? " " No ! " " That settles it : give me my hat , I am going home . Why did I come here , anyway ? I never heard of so much trouble in my life just about getting to see . " Through cocaine and without pain his lenses were safely removed , and for the first time in forty years the retinas that . through a slight transmission of light , had been kept from absolute starvation and loss of function , were flooded with a moving picture ? the kindly face of the surgeon privileged to open these blind eyes . " I see ! " exclaimed the patient . " What ? " " Your face , doctor . I knoi it is your face because that 's where your voice comes from . " " And I see your hand and arm , " he said , swinging his own arm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body . Dr. Minor further describes the case as follows : " Some of my confreres at the hospital and the Sister Superior were invited in to see him , and to allow him to get impressions of other people through his new sense of sight . He looked at each intently and with great interest . but made few comments further than to ask if all women were like the Sister . ( lie told me later that he wished to get some idea of how women looked , and that if his wife looked like the Sister he would leave her . ) Asked if he would like to see himself , ' I sure would , ' was his eager reply . ' I ai n't as pretty as I thought I was , ' he said , and there was visible disappointment in his face . He was shown , but not allowed to touch , an apple ; and when pressed to say what he thought it was , said , ' It might be an apple , because it 's round like an apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' This was the first time colors were seen , and they were correctly recognized and named . " When given opportunity to see horses and cows and farm implements , he scented grateful that they appeared as he had known them , except that . they were only one-third their natural size . He had learned nothing of perspective . Seeing a pug- dog , he said : ' It 's a mighty strange-looking dog , with its tail curled up in a bow-knot over its hack . All the dogs I ever knew kept their tails between their legs ' ? a habit of the hound when petted . Sitting in the park he beheld a peacock , which began strutting toward him . ' I was scared , ' he afterward told me . The thing looked like it was making for me , and I got up and cut for new quarters , and only came back after John his guide finished his laugh and told me what the thing was . ' " While in my office at patient was announeeil who had a veiny pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really a beauty . P ? was asked if he wanted to see something pretty . He assented , and I had the child brought in while his attention was directed elsewhere . t What is this ? ' I asked . I do n't know ; but it . sure is pretty . It is the prettiest thing I ever saw . What is it , anyway ? ' " He could not be made to say what it ' was until allowed to touch the child , when , with keen disappointment in his voice and countenance , he said , Shucks , it 's only a girl ! ' " From the time when his eyes were unhandaged and he had exclaimed , ' I can see ! ' he became a changed man . His one object in life was to There was a complete reversal in his behavior from the former one of indifference and objection to operation to a readiness to follow my suggestions as the laws of his life , " When the eyes of Farmer John had sufficiently recovered from the removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness by bandages , Dr. Minor initiated his untrained eyes and the visual centres of his brain in the exercise of vision by various careful tests . Here was a shrewd adult brain , with all the manifold hits of knowledge that forty years must bring to it , which perhaps had learned to think , to imagine , in measures of sound , touch , taste , and Seen ' . only , about to play with a toy as strange to it as is an aeroplane to a baby . All that you and I have subconsciously acquired ? found in our possession before we realized it ? of perspective , of dimension , of bas-relief , of reflection and illumination , of luminosity and color , of opacity , translucency , and transparency , of yielding and unyielding qualities , of smoothness and roughness , friction , iridescence , and motion , he now acquired consciously and in constant comparison with knowledge which his other senses had brought him . He was shown a round hall and a square box . What were their shapes ? He " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet his third effort was successful . He " took a good look , " closed his eyes , and , after a few moments , said lie thought it ( the box ) was square and the other object round . He had to fit these strange contour sensations of sight to familiar forms of touch . He had to imagine his fingers moving over these objects ? all on curves with the ball : and on flat surfaces , straight lines , angles , and points on the box . The first lesson over , his eyes were put to bed until the next . day . The second lesson was on size . " How long is one foot ? " He showed this correctly with his hands on his walking-stick ; but when a stick twelve inches long and one inch thick was shown him at a distance of a few feet , he said it was four inches long and the size of his little finger . Handed the stick , he quickly corrected his mistake . At another time , as previously mentioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the visional trick of perspective soon ceased to trip him . To state the number of objects held before him was a great puzzle . It took four or five trials to learn to count one , then two , and finally five , but he could not count beyond five . Shown the variously colored skeins of worsteds used by eye specialists in testing color vision , Farmer John named the reds , yellows , greens , and blues correctly , though with some hesitation ; and designated intermediate shades as " light " OT " dark . " To have named colors correctly the first time his eyes beheld them ? and Dr. Minor and others with him were in a position to know positively that he did ? it would seem that he must have experienced the individualized sensations of colors when blind . This einestion will be considered . Says Dr. Minor : " As soon as I had finished testing his color perception , he told me he had supposed there were only two kinds of people ? the whites and the negroes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to be a white man , and yet my face was not white when compared with my shirt front . When he saw a negro the contrast between the black skin and the whites of his eyes and his white teeth appealed to him strangely . He said ' the negro looked as if be was frightened . ' " Shown a glass tumbler , on close scrutiny he hesitatingly named it a drinking-glass , because " the shape was that of a tumbler , outlining it by movements of the hand ; and he knew it was glass because he could see through it . " In all his observations he had to close his eyes and handle the objects in his touch-founded imagination before naming them . He had to translate visual sensations , with which he had not learned to think , into tactile sensations , in which " language " he was accustomed to think ? to make mental pictures . Many people educated in the English system of weights and measures , when learning the metric system in afterlife , must mentally compare a litre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , to " get away from the book " and master the system . Having thus briefly described the salient features in the remarkable sense-organ biography of Farmer John , a complete pen picture of whom by a dose observer would have been of great scientific interest . let us indulge in a little speculation over this man 's peculiar abilities . Dr. Minor says : " As to his perception of colors , he ( the patient ) had no explanation to offer nor have I. It is simply a fact that pronounced colors were correctly recognized the first time they were seen , without previous visual knowledge or cultivation , by an eye forty years old . " Doubtless not only the explanation of how this man recognized colors at first sight , but how he recognized thorn when blind , are the pivotal points of interest to every reader of this article . Medical literature records a few cases of one sense doing the work of another , more especially that of " sight audition " or experiencing the sensations of colors when hearing music . Recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although wo occasionally hear vague rumors of such cases . " Touch audition " ? hearing through contact . and through bodily vibration ? is more or less common to all of us . At our great asylums the deaf and dumb are called from the fields by a steam-whistle , which they feel and which the incompletely deaf may hear . The deaf and dumb are taught . to speak by having them watch the teacher 's play of muscles in phonation , by holding the finger tips on the speaker 's throat , and by feeling the sequence of breath-waves of the speaker . Their speech is seldom musical , as they can not hear and regulate their - utterances . The dumb are - usually dumb because they are deaf , their organs of speech ? beyond making inarticulate cries ? lying dormant until , like a team driven in darkness , their brains can learn to handle breath , vocal cords , tongue , and lips in co-ordinate sequence and without knowing the results . Their test achievements in elocution are not as good as those of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , can repeat by speech or finger language what they see but do not hear , simply by watching the teacher 's facial movements . Their efforts at singing range over many keys in a single tune . Probably little of this dcaf-and-dumb vocalization employs the hearing centres of the brain , except to the extent these centres experience vibrations felt through linger tips and skull . But in seeing colors when hearing music , " sight audition , " all the sensations of color experienced seem necessarily to originate in the visual centres , which necessitates the view that vibrations through the ear may overrun the brain centres of hearing and excite vibrations in the visual centres , which would produce the only sensations they could excite in these centres ? sight sensations . Or we must adopt the views of some ear specialists , that these musically awakened color sensations are born in the imagination . Investigators ? we can not call them experts where there is so much to learn ? subdivide the visual centre , one such being solely a receiving set of brain cells which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ; another a visual memory centre which is , like a photographic shop , at the call of the will ready to hold up any picture image " called for . If this imagination centre only is chromatically bestirred by music , then we would attribute the color harmonies to suggestion by association of ideas and to nothing out of the ordinary . The entire brain does not take part in an act of seeing , or hearing , or speaking , or walking , or any other work . As a general proposition we may state that each individualized function has some portion of the gray matter for its more or less exclusive use . In each half of the brain each of the special senses has its centres , and so have respiration , locomotion , circulation , etc . There are various kinds of brain cells , and each centre has ' largely a certain variety , and such centre is assumedly able to do only its special work . The eelIs of the visual centres can sense light and color and only such matters as pertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . These centres are directly " wired " nerves to the parts of the body from which they receive outer impressions , as retina and optic nerve to the visual centre ; or to those parts upon which they may act , as the motor centres which control the actions of certain groups of muscles . The " sense " centres are all " receiving stations . " the motor ( muscle-moving ) centres " sending stations . " Some forms of brain cells resemble an octopus with their central body , or head . and numerous branching arms ; and these arms of the brain cells join hands with those of their neighbors , and probably unite . all parts of the double brain into one vast system . Like a great manufactory , each brain office is more or less wired to the others , as well as to the main centre , to the office of the manager . T11 the factory knowledge of all departments is presumably held only by the management . Now if one office used a telephone , another a telegraph . another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another a ticker , and another a telaittogust , if there were such an instrument , could each office clerk , after wiring all machines to one another , possess himself of each specialized clerk 's information ? All the machines are re run by the same force , electricity , but each has its own cipher system . Yet the telegraph and Marconi-graph clerks might eavesdrop on one another , and the telephone and telegraphonc clerks likewise ? and if the latter two are readers of the Morse code , they could steal the messages of the telegraph and Marconigraph clerks and understand them . Electricity is the fetch - dog of all these machines , and likewise nerve-waves are the messenger-boys of each brain centre ; and bow seemingly unlimited are the variations and complexities possible in the former ! The quadruplex system carries four messages simultaneously over the same wire . The teleleetrie can make a Brush light play a tune . A half-dozen people can talk over a family telephone wire af. the same time . and do , and a trained phone eavesdropper eon learn something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make every variation of a speaker 's voice so magnetically charge a steel wire that when the wire is re-rim through the charging-point it will reproduce the original voice with wonderful accuracy and tell the story again to-morrow and next day ? vocal vibrations in storage . There is no known limit to the possibilities of transmission or storing of complex vibrations or their reproduction as affecting uur sense organs . In the calm after a storm a cockleshell bobs up and down on a choppy sea and gets nowhere ; but the waves of ether , electricity , sound , and light in choppy seas manage to pass one another . Dr. Cattell made electricity reproduce the characteristic qualities of the violin , clarionette ? and horn by first learning the exact main and overtone vibrations that produce these instruments ' individual qualities of tone and then constructing a most elaborate series of dynamo vibrators with which he could duplicate each ? a marvellous example of mathematical and electrical mastering of sound . All these instruments juggle with the vibrations of sound , which range from a. few thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in handling the vibrations of light , which range through the half - trillion rates per second ? Light mechanism differs from that of sound not only in being much less mechanical , more immaterial , but enormously more speedy and unthinkable . Three thousand waves per second ( in sound ) are difficult to picture in the mind , but when we hearken to a steamship 's sluggisli whistle , first hearing a mere rushing sound of steam , then the beginning tonal vibrations , we can almost picture the gathering speed of successional waves . much as we can sce a great locomotive 's drivers start in their mile-a-minute flight . But light-naves ! Fire a sixteen-inch projectile and snap a shutter at the same instant , and the rays of the uneaged search-light will illumine the far-distant target before the iron mass has flown a hundred feet . Face the moon with closed eyes , and before you can open , shut , open again , and close the lids sib very light-waves will have started from the moon , rushed past your lids during their second opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cones of your retinas and set them vibrating at the known mathematical series which we sense as a whitish orange-yellow silvery moonlight . To my mind , the most wonderful achievement with animal machinery , aside from abstruse thinking , is the ability to handle the rays of light ; and though our eyes can only sense a small per-tentage of the myriad rays which speed about us , this only emphasizes the marvellous accomplishment . The speed of the snail is far nearer the rush of the whirlwind than the speed of the wind to that of light . Ere we can sweep the dew from the rose , a ray of light can come from one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles away , could circle the earth seven times if it could " take the curve . " How can our eyes sense anything so without weight or substance and grasp as they do the thousand hues . shades , scintillations , and iridescences that flood the earth ? And yet every puppy-dog , every ephemeral insect , can work this magical performance without taking thought . Not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several handle sound ? by direct transmission of sound-waves translated into electric waves . The " three - color process " of printing abstracts the red from a landscape with one photograph , the yellow with another , and the blue with a third ; makes three plates . inks them with the " primary " colors , and prints them in turn on a sheet ? mixes the colors on the paper , producing intermediate shades . then finds that pigments distinct from spectral colors need body and adds black . The Tree chretneseope employs the same method largely , but mixes the colors in the eyes when they look at a photograph through red . yellow , and blue plates of glass . The colored rice granules method photographs nature in color by use of imperceptibly minute and variously colored rice granules distributed over a negative film , the percentage of exposure of various colors depending upon the degrees of transparency of the gelatine film caused by its development . Decomposition of . silver as in ordinary photography grades the color exposures in the lantern slide . With microscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marbles . The silenium cell invention , which aims to utilize the ability of this substance to make and break an electric current on exposure to light . may yet prove able to carry a living mobile countenance vibratorially over an electric wire and reproduce it in a distant city by causing a duplicate set of silenium cells in a " receiver " to reproduce the lights and shades of the sender . When accomplished , this invention in handling light will rank with that of the telephone in handling sound . Not one of the inventions which reproduce sound effects imprisons the original waves and sends them thither as mail is shot through a pneumatic tube ; they all work through some foreign medium . and more or less employ codes which must be translated . Not one of the inventions for reproducing scenes approaches direct handling of light rays , either . But in the ease of Farmer John , we seem forced to the view that his recognitions of colors when blind must have been through nerve sensations which reached and acted upon his visual centres , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first apple his eyes beheld . All animals are specialists in the use of the five senses , both as to dependence upon one sense more than another and , in some cases , as to substituting , contrary to the rule , one organ for another , as touch for handling sounds and light . In the rabbit 's brain exposition something like ten per cent . of the entire floor space is allotted to the organ of smell , nearly a hundred times that in man 's . When we consider that scent is secured by impact of microscopic volatile particles against the membrane lining of the nose , we marvel at the speed of the hound led as by a thread by the invisible cloud hanging over a spoor , even though we laugh at his specialism gone mad when we see him fail to use his eyes end see the game watching ' him from an overhanging rock . Habit runs while judgment slumbers . When the hot sun glides beneath the horizon the male mosquito , with whirring wings which he does not hear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden in the grass the sound-waves set in motion by her singing wings will make his be-whiskered antenna , vibrate ? the one nearer the singer more than the other . Pivoting about , when they vibrate : equally lie has learned whence comes the sung and knows what to do . Antemat -- touch levers ? have taken the place of ears . This is not " touch audition , " but substitution . The snail has eyes at the ends of his flexible horns and can explore a cavern before venturing in . This is sight substitution for hands . The worm has spots of pigment which sense the heat that pertains to light . The catfish in his cloudy waters has taste-buds at the ends of his barbels ? water antenna ? and can taste when he can neither see nor hear nor smell . The catfish is a tongue specialist , as the rabbit is a nose specialist ; but the relative size of the rabbit 's brain centre of smell does not grant him keener scent than man because he ( the rabbit ) gets ten per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger per cent . of a very small capital into one investment ; and man , but for civilized interferences of neglect , enlarged turbinates , adenoids , and constant nasal irritations , could rival the rabbit. , as Farmer John did . Nor could any animal , under equal evolutionary training , surpass man in expertness with any sense organ save one ? the homing instinct . Dr. . naval , the celebrated blind eye specialist , claims that the blind are not given any extra keenness in their other organs or even as much as those who see , but gain it wholly by unending practice . These animal variations iu the use of their sense organs do not help to explain Farmer John 's recognition of colors through his fingers . They only show that knowledge of certain things is not obtained alike by different animals ? by use Of the same organs of sense . We human beings can all feel music , but only experience it when we can hear it . The sense of touch limits us to its quivers , jars , and rattling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridged : Can one sense , centre be set in action through vibrations coming " over the wires " of another sense ? Can color vibrations travel over touch nerves and act upon the sight centres ? Apparently not , unless there is something besides light-waves pertaining to colors , and that something appreciable by touch . It is the present view of physicists that most effects of matter , as expressed by heat , light , electricity , magnetism , and X-rays , are founded in the conduct of vibratory waves of varying lengths ; and that most knowledge gained through our senses comes through the varying impressions produced on the organs by such wave lengths and speed . vibrations . The vibratory waves of the ether ? Hertz waves ? are over six hundred feet from crest to crest and are handled by " wireless " machinery . When shortened to lengths of a few inches ( 70,000 micro-microns ) , the medium producing such vibratory waves is called heat and can be detected by sensitive thermometers . When 36,000 such waves can be spanned by one inch ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes as red ; and as they progressively shorten , we sense them as orange , yellow , green , blue , and violet ? the last 61,000 to the inch ; and our eyes can follow them that far only . When they are shorter , they become invisible ( except through the fluoroscope ) and are classed as X-rays , N-rays , alpha , beta , gamma , and out into the beyond of knowledge . Red is almost doubly warmer than violet . Is it possible that time heat-difference in colors can be sensed by some human beings ? it does not seem possible , yet Langley 's bolometer can measure with " nerves " of metal the equivalent in heat of a candle a mile and a half away . When Farmer John named the red and green stripes of the first apple his eyes had seen , he either guessed that an apple that was not all of one color would be red and green ? and he named too many other colors at first sight to make this view reasonable ? or he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his sensations of red and green were just what he had experienced in handling them when blind . He was getting the old messages , but over a different wire . No limit has been found for the degree of sensitiveness of our special senses . The following Case of remarkable visual sensitiveness is cited at the risk of awakening general incredulity : Several years ago a half-dozen members of two well-known New York families were somewhat playfully experimenting in " mind-reading " by blindfolding " A , " who placed his fingers on the forehead of " B , " who looked intently at an object held by " C " under a bright light , the purpose being to learn if " A " could name the object seen by an " Vat , CXNI ? No. 723. - 53 Each individual completely failed , until a girl of sixteen surprised and thrilled all present by correctly naming one and another object seen by " B. " Wilk the circumstances under which this performance developed would suffice Sc to possible collusion for any ordinary event , they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high standing was Present , for such can he fooled by prestidigitation or collusion rather easily . Some days later the writer made the following tests : Acting as the observer " B , " T had a cardboard , which bad a piece the shape of a " red cross " cut out secretly , held against a red lamp-shade . I looked closely at the object , and in a few seconds she ? " A " ? said , " I see a red cross . " Out of a collection of photographs which I held in my hands I held one and another , at random , under the light . Those of people she knew were correctly named . Her father 's face she named when he sat under the light , likewise others ; but when I tried to look at the faces of her father and uncle as they sat side by side as one object she failed , but named each as I looked . at each singly . Her severest test was in spelling out the name " Hatton , " printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spelling it " Hetton . " I could regulate the time when she would name the object by varying my 07.01 , time of looking at it , and die invariably named the object only then ? that is , at the time when my eyes were most vividly beholding the object . The girl could give 110 other explanation of her sensations than that out of darkness , like one sitting in a dark lecture-hall , an image appears when the lantern throws one on the screen . She declared she could not succeed unless all light was excluded from her eyes . A number of physicians had opportunity to witness and take part in tests , but , owing to her father 's fear of having his daughter known as a " freak , " all further trials were soon denied , and whether she still possesses this unique power is not known . It would seem that this girl possessed two unique capacities : First , when blindfolded she held her visual centres in a state of complete rest , sustained no visual images ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the most plausible theory of explanation , we must assume that , like the electric radiations from a charged wire , there are nerve-wave radiations from our optic organs when in action ; that when we look at anything , while the main nerve currents run from our retinas over the optic nerves to the visual centres in the posterior parts of our brains , there to excite our known sensations of sight , a portion of the nerve currents radiate through the entire head . And we must further assume that , as appears in the case cited . these waste currents can be farther carried through fingers , arms , and head with sufficient power to cause faint vibrations in the visual centres of another , vibrations identical to those first started and which reproduce identical pictures in the brain of the one blindfolded . That such a theory demands the possession of a remarkable degree of sensitivity is true , but equal degrees of sensitivity are frequently demonstrated in other ways and especially in mechanical tests . Many people experience as delicate a sensibility as the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barometer , though their sensations are probably excited by chemical bodily changes affecting the nerves . With the galvanometer 's electrodes attached to the human body , the excitation of emotions will cause the needle to defect , as was described by the writer in Harper 's Weekly , 1907. under the caption Measuring Thought with a Machine . " Farmer John 's avoidance of obstacles when blind ' ass probably due to keen , fully developed sensitiveness to temperature variations in the air and to air resistance . Concentration carries one far in sense-organ superiority , blind or not , and exclusion of interfering impression , carries one farther . We can not read a page when holding it with the sun glaring in our faces . We can not scent the rose with garlic under the nose ; nor will we notice , having our eyes open , that the temperature of every piece of furniture in a room is less than the trend of that of the air ; colder than the air when the temperature is rising and warmer than the air when the room is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonplace , though we never tire admiring the skill involved . But Farmer John 's homing instinct ! Alas ! in the quiet darkness of the night woods , with no sound but from . scrambling chipmunks ' feet or hoot of owl and soughing of the wind , too far from home for the millionth particle of a familiar scent to sweep the nostrils , the zigzag of the trail a crisscross of compass points beyond the power of memory to back-track , in a thicket of trees too broken for " wireless " waves to penetrate , with all the known senses marooned in the black forest. , what occult guide led the blind farmer home again ? Farmer John could not tell . When the farmer 's eyes were opened and he learned to see , he lost his extraordinary homing instinct and his " touch vision . " But he continued to be a successful horse-trader.
