 | " LIFE " published the other day a cartoon with a significant title . It showed the Broad Street front of the New York Stock Exchange . In the street stood a patrol wagon . From the entrance of the building to the wagon stretched a line of respectable and prosperous-looking men . Overseeing their journey from Stock Exchange to patrol wagon were policemen with drawn night-sticks . The title of the picture was " Raiding a Gambling Joint . " The significance of this cartoon lay not so much in the truth of what it intimated , about which there are at least two widely divergent opinions , as in its timeliness . It is popular in these days of " money trust " accusations and investigations to vilify the Stock Exchange , to call it a gambling joint , to denounce its members as oppressors of the poor and devourers of widows ' houses . Is it true ? Is the Stock Exchange , as has been said even by a prominent writer on economics , a " gambling hell " ? Is it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ought to be suppressed if it is primarily a gambling joint , just as we have suppressed the Louisiana lottery and , at least partially , race-track gambling , and as we ought to suppress bucket shops , pool-rooms , poker joints , and the little Monte Carlos that an indulgent Police System has allowed to flourish in other parts of the city . Let us look at these questions in the light of what the Stock Exchange really is and does . Let us approach the subject with an open mind and an inquiring eye and see what light an examination of the facts throws upon the duty of the Stock Exchange to the public and of the public in relation to the Stock Exchange . Heat is an admirable thing in its place , but it never yet has been made to do the work of light . Before we look at the Stock Exchange in operation , let me set down certain theses which I believe an examination of the facts will support . I will present them in the popular rather than the logical order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Stock Exchange are virtually gambling . 2 .

With these theses in mind let us go down to Wall Street and see what we find there .  | THE BOARD ROOM It is a quarter before ten on a morning in May in the year of grace nineteen hundred thirteen . We are standing at the railing of the narrow gallery that runs along one side of a great room . A clever painter has recently given expression , through an exhibition of his work in a New York gallery , to the idea that rooms , even when they are entirely free of people , have personalities of their own . The room we are in is an admirable illustration of his idea . Even in its proportions it is unlike other rooms . To the eye it is a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height . As a matter of fact , the eye is not an accurate guide , for no two of the room 's dimensions are the same ; but the impression remains , differentiating this from other rooms ? a great hollow cube . Two walls , the east and the west , are all windows . The other two bear in their middle sections what look like great blackboards divided into a thousand little squares . The narrow gallery we are in runs along the east wall . Its windows look out across Broad Street at its intersection with Wall Street to the United States Sub-Treasury and the longfamous building with the chiseled name over the door , J. P. Morgan &:; Company . With the death of the great financial leader only two months past , the building from which his influence went out over the whole financial world is already melting away under the eager hands of the house-wreckers . In the middle of the north wall is a tiny balcony . There stands the venerable chairman , a black skull-cap on his white head , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal for the opening of a new day . THE FLOOR So much for the walls of the great room , the board room of the New York Stock Exchange . But the floor 's the thing . It is " on the Floor " that things happen , that fortunes are lost and made , that the business of buying and selling the stocks and bonds of a Nation 's industries is carried on , that the financial pulse of a Nation 's prosperity beats and throbs . Spaced at regular intervals over the Floor are sixteen " posts . " Each " post " is a kind of standard , having a large number at the top , a bulletin-board with eight faces around it just below , and a cushioned seat around it at the bottom . Each post is the headquarters for certain stocks , and each of them takes its familiar name from the most prominent stock traded in about it . A few of the posts have two or three nicknames interchangeable at the whim of the moment . Number One is the Steel post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post ; three , the Pennsylvania post ; four , the Sugar or Money post ; five , the Atchison or Missouri Pacific , or , in the shorthand vernacular of the Floor , the Atch. or Mop . post . Six is known either as the New York Central , the Northwestern , or the Can . post . Seven takes its name from Baltimore and Ohio . Eight is known as Katy ( which , being interpreted , means Missouri , Kansas , and Texas ) . Nine is the Union ( Union Pacific ) post , ten the General Electric , and eleven the Reading post . Twelve is interchangeably Smelters ( American Smelting and Refining Company ) and Copper ( Amalgamated Copper ) . Thirteen is Southern Pacific , fourteen Chesapeake and Canadian Pacific , fifteen Petroleum ( so called from California Petroleum and Mexican Petroleum ) , and sixteen B. R. T. ( otherwise Brooklyn Rapid Transit ) and Lehigh Valley . Each post , therefore , has its sobriquet . At each post a certain list of stocks is traded in , varying from half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel post , Number One , for instance , will be found : United States Steel , common and preferred , known to the world of Vail Street as " Steel ; " Chicago , Minneapolis , and St. Paul , common and preferred , known as " St. Paul ; " Utah Copper ; Louisville and Nashville ; Atlantic Coast Line . At the Katy post , Number Eight , will be found thirty-nine stocks , including such prominent ones as Bethlehem Steel , National Biscuit Company , and International Harvester Company , and such unfamiliar ones to the uninitiated as Weyman-Bruton Company , Quicksilver Mining and Assets Realization Company . No. 4 is also known as the Money post , for there the representatives of the banks are found by brokers who have bought stocks and must make the necessary loans to " carry " them . Along the west wall of the Floor are batteries of telephone instruments ranged in alcoves that look not unlike the coat-racks in a hotel or club coat-room . Each member has a telephone connecting with his office and a clerk in constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members may sometimes share a clerk for purposes of economy . HOW THE BROKER IS TIED TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD Now we discover the purpose of the big blackboards on the walls . All through the day we will see the little squares up there winking and blinking their summons to the different members on the Floor to come to their telephones . As we watch the board , suddenly one of the squares splits in two , the upper half drops over with a kind of a comic flop , and instead of a little black square we see a number ? " 450 " ? in white on a black background . Member Number 450 is wanted at the telephone . The pattern made by the white figures on the blackboard is constantly changing . Now , one after another , at regular intervals , half a dozen numbers appear spotted over the board . For every recurring number some man on the Floor has started toward his telephone . Then three or four drop with a simultaneous flop , galvanizing into simultaneous motion across the Floor three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have popped back into the uniform black expanse , and the imagination can picture half a score of members reaching their telephones and receiving messages from their clerks or taking up the receivers to talk with office partners or inquiring customers . Just to watch the shifting patterns on the board is fascinating . To consider their significance is no less so . Here is a twentieth-century messenger service , substituting for the lagging foot of the uniformed page the instantaneous action of electricity and light . It is fascinating to watch it ; it is even more fascinating to consider its symbolism . The hundreds of brokers on the Floor are not isolated individuals , each man playing " off his own bat . " The Floor is not a place shut off from the rest of the world where a group of privileged individuals , freed from responsibility except to their own interests and desires , juggic and manipulate the security values of a Nation 's industry and commerce . It is not the brokers who buy and sell on the Stock Exchange ; it is the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The broker on the Floor is tied by a telephone wire to his office . His office , in turn , is tied by telegraph lines , by telephone wires , by cables , by the mails , to customers , plain citizens " even as you and I , " dwelling from Dan to Beersheba , from the Narrows to the Golden Gate , from the Soo to the delta of the Mississippi . GAMBLING JOINT OR MARKET PLACE ? " Life " has tried to work out from the manifestations of the popular temper in these days of Wall Street-phobia a definition of the Stock Exchange ? " a gambling joint . " Let us , writer and readers together , try to work a definition out of the thoughts suggested by the blinking numbers on the wall ? " a public market place where the people of a great Nation buy and sell stocks and bonds through brokers who are members of the Exchange . " Of course there is a class of members who have no outside connections with the public , who do " play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority , and their activities are supplemental and not antagonistic to the work of the commission brokers whose clients are the public . Of course , also , the movements of prices on the Exchange are not always the unassisted result of the law of supply and demand . Big operators and groups of operators can and do at times raise and lower prices in ways that may be called artificial and for ulterior purposes . Pools are created from time to time to put prices up or to hammer them down . Among the methods which have been used in the past for bringing about such results is manipulation ? creating artificial prices through wash sales " and " matched orders , " fictitious transactions in which no stocks actually change ownership . Whether this manipulation still continues and to what extent is a debated question . Such writers on the subject as Mr. Lawson would give us to believe that manipulation is " as easy as lying " and far more usual . Prominent members of the Exchange say that manipulation is no longer possible , that under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under the new laws of the State making fictitious transactions or " wash sales " a felony , " no man would dare to try it . " Whether manipulation through fictitious sales is still possible and still practiced or not , the Governors of the Exchange are making determined efforts to render it impossible . But the exceptions merely bring the truth of the rule into greater prominence . The members of the Stock Exchange , broadly speaking , buy and sell for the public .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | first supplies the reports of the transactions on the Floor to the offices of members of the Exchange below Chambers Street ; the second to all the other tickers in New York and in fifty cities throughout the country . In each room sit two groups of men , one active , the other in reserve . There are five men to a team . One sits before a round disc studded with red and white push-buttons lettered and numbered like the keys of a typewriter . The other four sit around him , each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . The wires to each sounder are the wires coming from one of the four pedestals downstairs . As first one then another of the instruments chatters out a metallic message of some sale on the Floor , the central operator 's hands with their long , facile fingers spell out the message again on the buttons before him . He has taken the message " by ear , " as he regularly does in dull times when selling is slow and only one sounder speaks at a time . But the listening operator whose instrument has spoken also writes the particulars of the sale on a slip of paper and sets it before his partner . In quiet times this is only necessary in order to help the sending operator in checking his work . On busy day however , it saves him from the impossible task of listening to four instruments at once and disentangling their dots and da ; he s . As he spells out each sale on the red and white buttons the ticker on the table before him prints on the tape the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape we know that on just such a tape at precisely the same instant in 500 offices precisely the same record is being printed . In the next room the same process is sending , the same word to probably ten thousand offices and banks in fifty cities and towns of the country . DOING BUSINESS IN THE OPEN Like the winking blackboards on the walls downstairs , these rooms , with their staccato sounders and the nimble fingers of the operators playing on their parti-colored discs , seem symbolic too . They remind us that every transaction on the Floor , every purchase , every sale , is known to the public hardly more than an instant after it is made . It is little exaggeration to say that a sale of stock is reported all over the city before the brokers who take part in it have had time to record it on their pads . The reporter hears the offer , catches the word " sold , " or the gesture which closes the transaction , walks twenty feet across the Floor to the nearest pedestal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operator at the disc catches the message " by ear , " spells it out on the buttons , and before the buying and selling members have gathered themselves together for the next trade the ticker in every broker 's office in the Street has printed the fact on the tape . In busy times the ticker does fall behind the market . On a three-million-share day , which comes once in a generation , it is perhaps ten minutes behind ! But on an ordinary day it is not behind at all . The swiftness of the electric current and the rapidity of the trained workers who bridge the gaps in the circuit keep the ticker service well abreast of the market . The man who has given an order to his broker to buy 500 Steel at 60 , if he only stays near a ticker can know when the market has reached his price , and his stock presumably been bought , much sooner than , if he were buying a dozen eggs , the grocer could have them wrapped up for him . I say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection which the Stock Exchange offers to the outsider who buys and sells through a broker . I shall tell that tale a little further on . The Stock Exchange does its business in the open . The public knows what has happened there just as quickly as the members on the Floor . No trades are concealed ; no news of trades delayed ; no prices made or broken without instant word going to every part of the land . Of course this is not to say that the reasons for each sale , the forces behind it , the meaning of each movement in price , of each " bulge " or " break , " are transmitted to the public . They are not known even to the members themselves except by inference and deduction and guesswork . The Stock Exchange no more than any other organization of men can penetrate the individual mind and heart and determine infallibly and instantaneously why the individual performs a given act . How , then , can it tell the public why a certain thing happens and what the happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does happen , and it does so with astonishing suddenness . It is hard to see how a more complete and instantaneous mechanism for  | spreading broadcast the news of the course of business in a given field could be devised . What the Stock Exchange does the country knows , and knows it the next moment . BEFORE THE OPENING-A BUSY BEEHIVE But we have kept the venerable chairman and his gavel waiting long enough . While we have been considering some collateral questions the Floor has been filling . The telephones along the west wall are manned by clerks . They are busy answering calls from their members ' offices , pushing the buttons to call the members to the telephone , and sending notes across the Floor by hurrying messengers . Behind the rail along the south side where the arbitrage " business is carried on ? the business , that is , of dealing between New York and London exchanges , and more specifically of taking advantage of the temporary differences in price of the same stocks in London and in New York ? other clerks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the London Exchange , which has now been open for five hours . On the Floor itself shifting groups of members , most of them young , a few of them veterans by their white hairs or lack of them , are gathered at the strategic points . Here between posts one and five is the Steel crowd ; just beyond is the Union crowd ; over near the center of the Floor the Reading ; and near post eight the Copper crowds . In between and all around these nuclei are moving currents of humanity made up of members , reporters , and the gray-uniformed messengers . If you have ever seen one of those portable frames from a beehive which are put up in a window for observation purposes , you know something of what the Floor of the Board Room looks like just before ten o'clock . There is the same incessant motion of the whole mass like the moving of the restless waters of the ocean when a choppy sea is running . There is the same apparently aimless moving to and fro of the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beehive on a summer day . As the hand of the clock marches toward ten the members of the different groups become quiet and intent . Some of them , purpose showing in their faces and their bearing , inch their way persuasively toward the center of the " crowd " they are in . Others stand carelessly on the outskirts , their attitude suggesting that their place at the moment is determined more by habit or idle interest than by any pressing business of their own . On opposite sides of each large group stands a reporter with poised pencil and ready pad . TEN O'CLOCK-THE EXCHANGE IS OPEN Precisely at the sixtieth second the gavel falls and the big gong whirs out the signal . On the instant the groups are galvanized into action . The hum rises several tones in pitch and many degrees in volume . Here and there a single voice sounds above the rest shouting a bid or an offer or the magic word " sold " or " take the lot . " Each crowd sways and vibrates , each member intent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the center of the mass , ready to seize his opportunity when it comes . For on the Floor opportunity is a shy and rapidly fleeting bird on whose tailfeathers it takes a steady nerve , a quick eye , and nimble fingers to drop the salt of capture In half a minute we see a reporter turn briskly from the Steel crowd below us , writing as he goes , and step quickly to the nearest pedestal . The hand at the key taps out a message , and the opening price of Steel goes out to a waiting world . The hand of the clock has barely made a five-minute advance before the din begins to run down the scale , the crowds to subside into quiescence , the members to relax their eagerness . The flurry which always marks the opening has passed . Here an " arbitrageur " steps from the crowd to his clerk behind the rail , handing him a report of a transaction to be sent off to London by cable . There two members step aside to compare in quiet their notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stress of the opening . Other members who have found their opportunity in the whirlpool scribble off reports which messengers take across the Floor to their telephones . The groups still hold their form , but they have become groups of men waiting , like Mr. Micawber , for " something to turn up . " The market has opened , and opened , let us hope , if we are " long " of the market , strong . " If we , perchance , are on the " short " side , a " weak " opening is our prayer . THE ACTIVITIES OF MR . X Since we have been in the gallery there has been one figure in the shifting pattern on the Floor on which we have tried to keep  | an eye . The member who is our guide in this inquiry into the workings of the Stock Exchange has shown us before he went on the Floor the orders which he has to fill : 1 . Buy 10,000 New York City 4s at the market . 2 . Sell 100 St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Buy 100 Steel at the market . 5 . Buy 300 Union Pacific at 149 . Now , here are five transactions to be made at different points on the Floor . Our Mr. X ( let us call him that , chiefly because there is no member of the Exchange whose name begins with X ) , of the firm of commission brokers , X and Y , is an active individual , but he has not even a dual personality , much less a quinquipartite one . Obviously he can not be in five places at the same time , and it is not impossible that all five of these trades must be put through simultaneously . For no man can predict when the market will touch a given figure for any given stock . What shall he do ? How execute his orders without splitting himself into five parts ? THE BOND CROWD , THE SPECIALIST , AND THE $2 BROKER He comes on the Floor at ten minutes before ten . He first goes to that part of the Floor along the east wall just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , on a platform , two steps above the Floor , is gathering the " bond crowd , " a little group of members who spend their time buying and selling bonds and bonds alone . To a man he knows in that crowd he hands a slip like this : His friend in the bond crowd , as soon after the market opens as he can make the trade , will buy ten thousand New York City 41/2 per cent bonds and send a report to Mr. X 's telephone clerk in the booth across the floor that he has executed the order . That disposes of order Number 1 . From the bond crowd Mr. X steps to Post Number One . There he finds another acquaintance , one of those brokers who are known as " specialists . " The member of the " bond crowd " is a specialist in bonds ? he buys and sells nothing else . But the true " specialist , " to whom that name is regularly applied , deals only in a single stock , or in some cases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he sticks to a single " post , " dealing only in Steel , or New York Central , or Copper , or Reading . Ours is a St. Paul specialist , and to him Mr. X hands a second slip : This trade is now in his hands . St. Paul closed last night at 1073A bid , 107/ offered . If the market opens strong to-day , he may be able to sell the hundred shares at 108 at or soon after the opening . If it is weak , he may wait till late in the day before the price touches 108 . Perhaps the trade can not be made to-day at all . If he does make the sale , he will report directly to Mr. X 's telephone clerk . For his services in the transaction he will receive a commission of 1 ? 50 of one per cent on the par value of the stock , or $2 . This disposes of order Number 2 . Order Number 3 Mr. X hands to another trusted acquaintance who becomes his lieutenant for the time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the hardest working of them all . He is known as a $2 broker , for his commission on the orders he executes for other brokers is  | $2 on each hundred shares . He is a rover , executing orders for other members all over the Floor . He too receives a slip from Mr. X : As the market opens he will be found boring into the Copper crowd , offering to buy his 200 copper at 7,1 until the market comes to his price and some fellow-broker cries " sold " to him , or waiting until the stock is " offered down " to his stipulated price and then shcoting a terse " take two hundred " at the offerer . If he succeeds in completing the trade during the day , he also reports directly to Mr. X 's telephone . This disposes of order Number 3 . MR . X MAKES SOME PURCHASES HIMSELF The last two orders on his list Mr. X decides to handle himself . With that in mind , he slips into the " Steel crowd " which has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rail . His order to buy 100 Steel sets no particular price , but is to be executed " at the market . " If it is filled , therefore , at the opening price , the instructions of his client will be carried out . As he waits in the crowd for the opening , he has the good fortune to rub elbows with a fellow-broker who says to him , " I 'll sell 100 Steel at the opening . " " I 'll take your 100 at the opening , " replies Mr. X. So the trade is agreed to , since what one has to sell the other is authorized to buy , and both are directed to trade at the opening price , the price , that is , at which the first sale of the day is made ; but it can not be finally consummated until the gavel has fallen ? first , because they do not know what the price is to be until the market has opened and a sale has been made , and , second , because trading before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour is against the rules of the Exchange . This preliminary negotiation , however , permits Mr. X to complete his purchase at the moment the market opens . He puts down the name of the house with whose representative he has traded on the slip in his hand : He then slips away to the Union Pacific crowd to fill his other order . There he finds that Union , which closed the night before at 151 , influenced perhaps by a pessimistic rumor as to the progress of the dissolution plans of the ' Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger , has broken on the opening . The opening price is 1493A . He accordingly shouts into the little pandemonium that is surging at the center of the crowd , " 9 for 300 , " but no one pays any attention to him for the moment . His price is too far below the market . But a small selling fever is on , and eighth by eighth , to the accompaniment of shouted offers , eager responses of " Sold , " " Sold , " of waving arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the man at the other end of the arm is prepared to buy or sell , of lunging shoulders and digging elbows , as each man strives to hold his place in the shifting crowd , the price is hammered down until it is close to 149 . Then our worthy guide springs more vehemently into action , brandishing three upraised fingers and striving to make it clear above the racket of his neighbors ' voices that he is prepared to buy three hundred shares at 149 . As he shouts he suddenly feels his arm clutched by a hand from behind , and , turning at the magic word " sold " in his ear and recognizing the owner of the hand and voice , he drops out of the  | crowd and scribbles down on the slip on which is already a record of the order the name of the house from which he has bought the stock . Meanwhile the other party to the transaction has jotted down on his pad a similar memorandum on his slip , putting the name of X and Y in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is to it . A transaction involving fortyfour thousand seven hundred dollars is entered into as easily and simply as that . Nothing passes between the parties to the transaction but a word or a nod or a gesture . No record is made but two scribbled sets of memoranda ; there is nothing to " bind the bargain , " nothing to hold either party to it but his word . Buying and selling on the Floor are done on honor . A broker 's word given there is as good as a written contract . " Welshing " is unknown . A BREATHING SPELL His business of the morning done , this being a dull day , Mr. X has nothing to do for a time but wander about the Floor chatting with his friends , listening to rumors and gossip , watching the progress of the market . Now and then as he glances from habit at the number-spotted blackboards he sees his own number displayed . Off he steps to his telephone to receive a message from his office partner , to get an order which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , telephone message , or personal visit , or to answer the personal inquiries of an anxious customer who believes that the board member from his point of vantage on the Floor must know much more of the direction in which the market winds are blowing or are likely to shift than any one who is merely watching the tape . This seeking of news of the market direct from board members seems like an obsession with some customers , and , however much it may interfere with his work on the Floor , the broker can not neglect to humor the peculiarity . Gratified customers mean increased business and a larger volume of commissions . A customer who feels himself neglected by his broker has many other brokers to choose from . Toward eleven o'clock Mr. X is called to his telephone to receive a message from one of the big downtown banks . He is the agent through whom this bank lends money on the Floor to brokers who have margin trades to finance for their customers . TRADING ON MARGIN Perhaps this would be as good a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment whether it is a legitimate and essential good , a crying and indefensible evil , or perhaps an inextricable combination of the two . Trading on margin is , broadly speaking , what makes widespread speculation possible . But let us not jump to the conclusion that therefore it is unqualifiedly bad . Perhaps speculation itself is not quite such an unmixed evil as it sounds in the common ear . Trading on margin may be described as buying stocks on mortgage . Stocks may also be sold short on margin , but in that case the analogy is not quite the same , though the underlying principle is . Let us consider the case of buying . A customer has a thousand dollars with which he wishes to buy stocks in the hope that they will advance in price and he will therefore make money out of them . He knows that for his thousand dollars he can buy not mere than ten shares of any stock selling at par if he buys them outright . On ten shares his profit , on any advance that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He therefore tells his broker that he wishes to buy on margin . After consultation with his broker he decides to buy Steel Common , which was selling the night before at 593 , for he believes that Steel is more likely to go up than down . On this purchase he must " put up " a ten point margin . He must deposit , that is , for each share of stock that is bought , ten dollars . His thousand dollars , therefore , will " margin " a purchase of one hundred shares . He gives the order to his broker to buy 100 Steel at the  | page deleted  | market " and deposits the thousand dollars with him . The broker goes on the Floor and buys 100 shares of Steel at 60 , the market opening strong and Steel going up at once . FINANCING A MARGIN TRANSACTION The sale made , the broker has to provide the rest of the money to complete the transaction . Every trade on the New York Stock Exchange is completed the next day . ' Stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be paid for to-morrow . This purchase calls for a payment of $6,000 , while the broker has only $1,000 belonging to his customer to apply on it . He must borrow the rest . So soon after eleven the next day he goes to the Money crowd at Post Number Four ? the Money Post . There he finds several members who represent the banks , among them our friend Mr. X. He naturally goes to the representative of a bank with which he is accustomed to dealing . Perhaps this is Mr. X. He goes to him , then , tells him that he wishes to borrow , say , $30,000 . He needs only $5,000 to finance the trade we have been considering , but he has four or five other customers also buying on margin , so he needs more money for them . All loans of this sort are made in units of $5,000 . He needs perhaps only $28,000 to cover the actual purchases of the day , but he borrows $30,000 , or six units . This borrowing on the Floor is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both brokers make a note of the amount and the rate and there their connection with it ends . The loan so arranged for is finally effected by the broker 's office and the bank dealing directly . The bank will lend the broker 80 per cent of the value of the stock . The stock is put up with the bank as collateral . The loan is what is known as a call loan ; the bank may demand its payment at any time , the borrower may pay it off at any time . The rate of interest on such loans is lower than the legal rate , and fluctuates almost daily . The rate is determined by the law of supply and demand . If there is a great deal of money in the banks available for this kind of loan , money goes down . If the pendulum swings and money becomes scarce because it is in demand for moving the crops or for other similar purposes , money goes up . During the year the rate for call money may vary from two per cent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on perhaps two or three days during the year , as twenty per cent . It has gone up on extraordinary occasions to fifty , sixty , or even one hundred per cent . The call money rate averages about four per cent . This rate is a yearly rate , and does not of course mean that if a broker borrows for his customer one thousand dollars and keeps it for a day he will pay forty dollars for the use of it . If he kept it for a year and the rate did not fluctuate in the meantime , he would pay forty dollars for the use of it . If he kept it for one day he would pay a trifle over ten cents for its use . But to return to our customer . When his broker has finished the operations necessary to complete the purchase , the customer owns 100 shares of the common stock of the United States Steel Corporation , and owes his broker $5,000 . He also owes his broker , first , a commission of of 1 per cent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , second , interest on the money the broker has lent him to make up the purchase price , . $5,000 . The interest is figured at about one per cent higher than the broker has to pay the bank ? one per cent higher , that is , than the call money rate . Since the rate on call money fluctuates from day to day , the rate the customer pays can not be fixed in advance as on the ordinary time loan . Each month the broker strikes an average of the rates he has paid on his loans during the month , and on this basis decides what to charge his customers for what he has lent them to carry their trades . The interest which the customer has to pay is reduced , however , by any dividends paid on the stock while it is being carried , which belong to the customer . The stock which has been bought by the broker for his customer has been put up as security with the bank making the loan . It will be released when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought 100 Steel for $6,000 , paid $1,000 down and borrowed the balance from his broker . He has an equity in the hundred shares of Steel stock of $1,000 , less the broker 's commission and the interest on the loan . The transaction is precisely like that of buying land . BUYING LAND-ON MARGIN The customer , instead of buying Steel through a broker , might have gone to a real  | estate agent and bought land . Suppose he bought a plot for $6,000 . It is very little likely that he would pay for it all in cash . He would put up a margin , get the real estate agent to borrow the remainder of the purchase price from some bank or some individual , and put up the property as security for the loan . The process is in effect the same . It is true that in the second transaction the customer uses a mortgage in putting up his land as security , but the necessity for this is obvious . Land is not portable and can not be sent round to the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also true that one can not borrow so large a proportion of the purchase price of a piece of land as of a block of stock . But the reason for this involves an essential difference between the real estate market and the Stock Exchange , a difference which is all in favor of the Exchange and illustrates its chief function . There is no market where real estate can be bought and sold at will . There is no institution where prices of real estate are fixed by supply and demand and fluctuate from day to day as those factors change . The owner of a hundred shares of Steel can sell them at an hour 's notice . He can tell from his daily paper every morning what the price of Steel is . He can even tell from the tape , if he is near a ticker , how the price fluctuates from hour to hour . A word to his broker over the telephone sells his stock without bargaining or delay or uncertainty . The owner of a piece of real estate can sell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the price , and perhaps not then , for there may be no market for that pt rticular piece of land or no one ready to buy at a price he is willing to accept . There is ways a market for stocks , always a market price . This is the chiefest service the Stock Exchange does for the investing and speculating public . THE ETHICS OF MARGIN TRADING ? AND ITS DANGERS Is trading on margin , then , an illegitimate practice ? Is it an evil ? Is it indefensible ? Should we be doing a service to the community if we prohibited it ? In its essence trading on margin is as legitimate as any other business transaction in which the buyer pays only a part of the purchase price down and borrows the rest on the security of the purchased property . In principle it is no more indefensible than any other form of buying on credit . It is going on , just as I have de- scribed it here , all over the world and all the time . But in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for men who can not afford to lose to enter upon speculations in which there is a considerable chance that they will lose . It encourages men with small resources to undertake large ventures , a proceeding dangerous to the individual undertaking it , in any sphere of life . The evils which it produces spring from three sources . Many men speculate . who ought not to speculate , or with money which ought to be kept safe , not risked . Some brokers do not insist that their customers keep the margin on which they are operating amply large . Many men trade on margin without adequate knowledge of what they are entering upon ; and , on the other side , some promoters of financial undertakings supply the public with glittering misinformation which may easily mislead any but the expert and the initiated . It puts a premium on the putting of prices up and down by big operators , for the speculator trading with small resources and on narrow margins is easily " shaken out , " to his own discomfiture and ? sometimes ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially a perfectly legitimate process , to prohibit it would be to do more harm than good , even if it could be prohibited without violating the constitutional privileges of the individual , which is extremely doubtful . But it should be surrounded with every possible safety device like any other piece of useful but dangerous machinery ? to keep out of this particularly attractive form of speculation any man who can not afford to lose his stake , to require amply sufficient margins of every speculator , and to restrain the immoral practices of some large market operators and dishonest promoters , most of whom are not members of the Exchange . THE MONEY CROWD This little discussion of margin trading has interrupted Mr. X 's telephone call , but perhaps it will help to explain it . The call is from the bank which he represents in the Money crowd on the Floor . It tells him that the bank has a million dollars which it wishes to put into call loans to-day . So off goes Mr. X to the Money post to wait for borrowers . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin than he sold for customers must be a borrower to-day . Between eleven and two-thirty he must go to the Money crowd to make his loans . When Mr. X 's money is all loaned or twothirty has come , he is through till three o'clock  | except for keeping an eye on the market and watching for calls to his telephone . So the day wears on . THREE O'CLOCK-THE EXCHANGE IS CLOSED At a half-minute before three the chairman rises in his place . At fifteen seconds before the hour the big gong begins to hum , and as it ceases , precisely on the hour , the gavel falls . The Exchange is closed . Another day has become yesterday . Members pour out of the room through the different doorways and make off to their offices to finish up the day 's work before going " uptown " or under or over the river to New Jersey or Long Island . Around the Money post is now gathering a new group . It is the " loan crowd , " and thither Mr. X betakes himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock for delivery tomorrow . It might have been , of course , that the customer who gave the order was " long " of the stock , and therefore had the hundred shares ready for delivery . But not this time . This was a " short " sale , and the stock must be borrowed for delivery to-morrow . In the loan crowd Mr. X approaches a fellow-member who he has reason to believe is long of St. Paul . But his belief is unfounded , and he must seek a lender in the crowd by the stereotyped Floor method of howling out his wants . In a moment he has found his man and made a note of the transaction . For the loan of the stock he is to put up the full market price . THE CLEARING-HOUSE When he has sent a report of this last transaction to the office , his day on the floor is done . Off he goes to his office . Before we follow him let us watch for a moment this quiet man who , with pencil and paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down figures . The list that he carries contains the names of eighty-five of the most active stocks , and opposite each stock he puts down a figure after looking at the sheet at the post where that stock is traded in . On the sheet some member ? probably a specialist in that particular stock ? has written down as the gong sounds the price at which the final sale was made . In St. Paul , for instance , the price may have been 108y . The man with the list in his hand reads this figure and sets down opposite the name St. Paul the figure 108 . If it had been 108y , he would have put down 109 . UTLOOK 28 June This is the " Clearing-House price , " the purpose of which we shall see presently . The man with the list is one of the managers of the Clearing-House . As his list is completed he hands it for a moment to a reporter , who quickly sends the figures out on the tape . Back in his office Mr. X finds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 men during the day have been executed . The clerks are already making out the Clearing-House sheet , which contains the record of the entire day 's operations of the House in any of the eighty-five Clearing-House stocks and which must get to the Clearing-House before seven o'clock . On a light day like this this is very easy . The boy will push the sheet through the window at the ClearingHouse soon after four . But there have been days when , as seven o'clock came , the office has had to apply at the Clearing-House and ask for an extension of time . The Clearing-House acts as the agent of its members in facilitating the business of delivering the securities that have been sold by the members during the day and of making the payments for them . It is a labor-saving device , just as the bank ClearingHouse is . Its action is in principle and indeed in practice simple , but to attempt to make it clear by description would require more space than I have at my disposal here . In brief , if A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to D the same number of shares of the same stock at different prices during the day , A does not send a stock certificate to B and receive a check at the sale price , B to C , and C to D. Instead A sends a certificate to 1 ) and receives a check at the Clearing-House price already described . Each party to this quadrangular transaction also receives from or pays to the Clearing House the difference between the price at which it bought or sold the stock and the Clearing-House price . The final result is exactly the same as if there had been no Clearing-House , and each house had completed each transaction with every other to which it had sold or from which it had bought . The only difference is that a great proportion of the clerical labor , of the running to and fro of messengers , of the certification of checks , of , in fact , the useless labor , has been done away with . The Clearing-House does not in the slightest degree alter the responsibility incurred in any transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alters nothing ,  | relieves of no responsibility . It is nothing but a machine . INVESTMENT AND SPECULATION A certain proportion of the transactions on the Stock Exchange are purely investment transactions . They consist of purchases of securities outright by individuals with money which they do not need for current expenses and which they wish both to put in a safe place and to have yield them an income . Such persons buy stocks and bonds as they would put money in a savings bank . By using it to buy stocks and bonds , however , they can get a larger return on their money . This class of transactions includes also , of course , sales by the same persons of securities which they have bought for investment . They may sell because they wish to invest elsewhere or because they have other uses for the money . investment transactions form but a small proportion of the business done on the floor of the Exchange . The rest is speculation . But to make that statement is not by any means to condemn it or to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far outweighs the good . IS SPECULATION WICKED ? Speculation has a bad name . The loose thinking which it is always so easy for the popular mind to indulge in lumps all speculation together , characterizes it as " gambling , " and dismisses the subject . This is the easy way to treat the question . But the easy way is seldom the right way . The problems that arise from human relations are not often solved in a word . The popular conception of the Stock Exchange could perhaps be expressed in a simple syllogism : Speculation is wicked . The Stock Exchange encourages speculation . Therefore the Stock Exchange is a wicked institution . A perfectly good syllogism , but , Iike every syllogism of this form , depending entirely for the truth of its conclusion on the truth of its major premise . Speculation is wicked . But is it ? Let us see . We have already considered one of the classes of transactions on the Stock Exchange which is largely used for speculative purposes ? trading on margin . We have shown , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegitimate nor wicked . Another class of speculative transactions is " short selling . " To sell a stock short is to sell shares of it which you do not possess , in the hope that at some time in the future you can buy the shares at a lower price than that which you now receive . " SELLING WHAT ONE HAS NOT GOT " A common view of this kind of trading is expressed by Miss Ida M. Tarbell in an article on " The Stock Market " in the " American Magazine " for June . She is quoting the testimony of Mr. Morgan before the Pujo Committee on this point : " I do not like it , not that I wish to criticise it at all , but I do not see how you can get along without it . " " Why , " Mr. Untermyer asked , " can you not get along without a man 's selling something that the has , not got in the way of stocks . " " That , " said Mr. Morgan , " is a principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant by a " principle of life " was undoubtedly the " gambling instinct . " It would find a way . But why should the " greatest financial institution in the world " provide the way ? Moreover , the same reasoning would forbid the curbing of the " principle of life " which bids us take whatever we can put our hands on . Is there a more truly " acquired taste " than what we call respect for property ? or honesty ! Apparently Miss Tarbell classes short selling with stealing . She intimates that " selling something that one has not got " is incompatible with honesty . SELLING SHORT IN MAGAZINE PUBLISHING Let us transfer this selling something that one has not got " from the heated atmosphere of controversy that surrounds Wall Street in these days to the calm air in which is carried on a business whose legitimacy and high character Miss Tarbell would not , I am sure , asperse ? magazine publishing . The magazine publisher " sells something that he has not got " every day of his life . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the publisher of The Outlook accepts the subscriber 's $3 in December in payment for fifty-two issues of The Outlook to be delivered at weekly intervals during the year , he is selling short with a vengeance . He is " selling something that he has not got . " Not only has he not got the completed product which he is to deliver , he in all  | probability has only a very small part of the raw material out of which the completed product is to be made . When he accepts the subscriber 's $3 he could no more deliver , within any reasonably short time , the property which he has sold , than he could fly to the moon . lie has neither the p : per nor the ink , the articles nor the illus. , ations , nor the news on which it almost all depends , which he is to deliver . He is selling short with a vengeance . It is true there is one difference between the short selling of the magazine publisher and the short selling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property which he has sold until twelve months have elapsed , while he has accepted payment in advance . The stockbroker makes delivery the next day , and receives not a cent of money until he has made delivery . ' TO CLASS SHORT SELLING WITH STEALING IS ABSURD If Miss Tarbell 's implication is right and " a man 's selling what he has not got " belongs in the category with stealing and other forms of dishonesty which involve lack of " respect for property , " the magazine publisher is in a parlous way . But the suggestion is absurd . Neither the publisher who contracts to deliver magazines which are not yet written , nor the tailor who agrees to sell a suit made out of cloth of which he has only a sample , nor the builder who pledges himself to build a house for which he possesess neither a stone nor a brick nor a shingle , nor the broker who agrees to deliver stock which he does not possess , is violating any statute or economic or moral law . Publisher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why assume that the broker is not performing a service as well ? It is not wicked to " sell short " a magazine or a suit of clothes or a house when there is a market in which you can get the material out of which and the labor by which they are to be made , and when your resources are such that you have reasonable certainty of being able to complete your contract . It is no more wicked to sell one hundred shares of stock short when there is a market where the stock can be obtained at a moment 's notice and when your resources are sufficient to insure your putting through the transaction . Brokers , like other men , have plenty of sins of their own to bear . Let us not ascribe to them as sins acts which in other men we hail as virtues . No . Short selling is neither unsound in principle , nor , within bounds . undesirable in practice . SHORT SELLING PERFORMS A USEFUL SERVICE On the other hand , short selling performs a well-nigh indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide a free , open , and broad market for the purchase and sale of securities . Such a market must be responsive to the law of supply and demand , but it must be protected , as far as possible , from rapid fluctuations and wide price movements . The best market would be thr in which the swings of the price pendulum were short but deliberate . Short selling is a brake upon the market . It narrows the limits of fluctuation and retards their speed . Curiously enough , the fact that short selling is possible has the same effect whether the market is going up or going down . It checks both booms and panics , is a drag on both breaks and bulges . Let us take the case of a boom . The " bulls , " those members who want to see prices go up or believe they will go up , are buying right and left . Prices are advancing rapidly . The only thing which can stop such a movement is for the bulls to find in the market a plentiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in such a rising market , the bulls have not only to buy stocks which others are " long " of , having bought them " for a rise . " They must also buy other stocks which traders do not possess but which they are willing to sell short in the belief that the prevailing high prices are only temporary and that a reaction is inevitable . The more shares the bulls have to buy , the harder is their task . Short selling adds to the actual supply of purchasable stock an increasing quantity of stock not now in the possession of the sellers but to be bought later . Short selling , therefore , is a brake upon a bull market , a curb upon a wild boom . Now of course an advance in prices , when it is healthy and legitimate , is a good thing ( unless one happens to be on the bear side of the market , in which case one 's normal view of everything is stood upon its head ) .  | Things ought to increase in value . Prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an advantage to the investors . But advancing prices are good only when they are based upon and reflect advancing values . Unhealthy booms are as bad as unsound declines . If the price of a stock goes up because the earning value of the property it represents is increasing , the resulting boom in the stock is healthy and beneficial . But if the price of a stock goes up because a group of men are trying to put it up for their own purposes , regardless of values , the boom is neither healthy nor beneficial . Prices so raised seldom " stay put . " Anything that will retard such an advance in prices as that is a good thing for the whole of the public which is interested in buying and selling securities . This is precisely the service which short selling renders . It tends to steady price advances , to check their impetuous speed , and to keep them within bounds . On the other side , short selling is a brake upon rapid and excessive declines in price . This is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be checked . Short selling at such a time would , of course , have exactly the opposite effect . But the presence of " shorts " in a market ? of men , that is , who have already sold stocks short in anticipation of a downward movement ? is a check upon the decline . The " short " is a compulsory buyer . He has sold something he has not got , and at some time he must buy it . As prices go down the shorts begin to " cover . " They buy stocks to replace those they have already sold . Their buying checks the decline , steadies the market , sets a limit to the fall of prices . If there were no short selling , booms would tend to be wild and unrestrained , with inevitable disaster when the break finally came ; declines would be sudden , rapid , and extensive , with equally disastrous consequences . Short selling is the governor on the engine . It steadies , equalizes , restrains . A market in which short selling was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . THE SERVICE OF SHORT SELLING TO THE SMALL INVESTOR Another service which short selling renders is to the small investor . The ownership of American corporations is widely distributed . The Steel Corporation has 150,000 stockholders ; the Pennsylvania Railroad Company has 80,000 . Two hundred and forty-seven of the large corporations of the country are owned by more than a million stockholders . Of these million stockholders many must be owners of small numbers of shares . A considerable part of the people 's savings is invested in securities . It is of vital importance , therefore , that the interests of the small investor in stocks and bonds should be adequately safeguarded . A market in which the small investor can easily and safely invest , and in which he always finds a ready market for any securities he may wish to turn into cash , is , from this point of view , a good market . The New York Stock Exchange provides such a market . During the past forty years special facilities have been created and developed to handle the business of the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably true that the man who goes into the stock market with a small amount of money is in a majority of cases an investor . On the Stock Exchange special facilities are necessary for handling this kind of business , for the unit in which trades are made on the Exchange is the block of one hundred shares . All sales on the floor are made in " hundreds . " To have such a unit of trading is obviously necessary , and the advisability of making it a fairly large unit has been shown by the experiences of all Exchanges . Since the unit is one hundred shares , the small investor who wishes to buy , say , seventeen shares of Pennsylvania can not have his order executed by his broker dealing with another broker on the floor in just the same way that it would be executed if  | it were for seventeen hundred shares . The business of buying and selling blocks of stock of less than one hundred shares is known as the " odd lot " business . There are five houses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent of their business is suggested by the fact that these five houses have forty-five members of the Exchange connected with them . The customer does not deal directly with the odd lot houses as he does with the commission broker . The odd lot houses , in fact , are not brokers , they are dealers . Let us see how their business works . THE BUSINESS OF THE ODD LOT HOUSE Mr. A , a man of modest possessions , finds that he has a certain balance of savings and proposes either to invest it or to indulge in mild speculation . After study and consultation he gives an order to his broker to buy twenty-five shares of Northern Pacific at the market . From his broker 's office the order is telephoned to the Floor , and his broker 's telephone clerk hands it to the representative of one of the odd lot houses . Now , in order to make the explanation simpler , let us assume that this is the only order that the odd lot broker has to execute that day . The odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Northern Pacific is quoted at 113/ offered , 113 bid . He immediately reports to Mr. A 's broker that he has sold him twenty-five shares of Northern Pacific at 113 and to his own office the same fact . The odd lot broker has now sold twenty-five shares Northern Pacific at 113/ . He must make delivery of this stock to-morrow , but he has not the stock to deliver because he can not buy less than one hundred shares on the Floor . How does he get the stock to deliver ? He goes into the loan crowd , borrows one hundred shares of Northern Pacific , sends the certificate to the Northern Pacific transfer office and has it split into two , one for twenty-five shares and one for seventy-five shares . The twenty-five shares he delivers to Mr. A 's broker the next day ; the seventy-five shares he holds until he has a call for them . Since the odd lot man has only borrowed the stock which he has delivered , he has sold the twenty-five shares short . The odd lot man will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the " bid " price . There is another way , however , in which an order may come to him . The order may be to buy or sell at the market , but with the UTLOOK 28 June proviso , " Wait for a sale . " On such an order he waits until a sale has taken place , and reports his own transaction - at 8 above that price , if it is a purchase , at below if it is a sale . In other words , on such an order Mr. A will pay y more than the prevailing price if he is buying , or will receive less than the prevailing price if he is selling . But , in any case , he always finds a market for his shares , whether they be one or ninety-nine . The odd lot dealer 's business is of course vastly more complicated than the single illustration I have been able to give . Instead of a single order he has scores . In an active market the odd lot business probably makes up one-fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million - share day , which was not an uncommon occurrence before the present period of stagnation struck the security markets of the world , the odd lot business would amount to 200,000 shares . The odd lot house is continually selling odd lots ? from one to ninety-nine shares ? to the customers of other brokers , and buying " hundreds " against them from other traders on the Floor . It is also continually doing the reverse process ? buying odd lots and selling " hundreds . " To do such a business requires immense capital . The odd lot house ? since when it needs small amounts of stock it can get them only by buying hundreds ? has to carry stocks in greater quantities than other houses . Not that it lays in a stock to meet future demands as a grocer lays in sugar . For that would be speculating , and the odd lot house , broadly speaking , does not speculate . But if the house has orders for 87 shares of a certain stock and must buy 100 shares to fill the orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect becomes a forced speculator to that extent . There is another condition which requires the odd lot house to have ample resources . At the times when dividends are paid the transfer books of corporations are closed for periods , in some cases , of a month . During those periods the odd lot house can not deliver its odd lots , for the splitting up of the hundred-share certificates must be done on the transfer books of the corporation . But the demand for odd lots does not stop merely because the transfer books are closed . The odd lot house , therefore , must continue to buy its hundreds and hold them till the transfer books are opened . The necessity for ample capital is apparent .  | THE SMALL INVESTOR NEEDS THE ODD LOT HOUSE The odd lot business , because of this absolute necessity for abundant resources , is probably the safest for the customer of any on the Street . No odd lot house has ever failed . It is reported that in the Hocking panic , when failures were numerous and no man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brokers took their hundred-share certificates , broke them into fifties and sold them to the odd lot houses , of whose ability to weather the storm there was not the slightest question . The compliment to the odd lot houses , we may hope , helped to atone for the burden thus thrown upon them . The odd lot house is , from the point of view of the general public , the most interesting as well as the most important part of the stock market . It is through the odd lot house ( though the customers may not be conscious of the fact , since they deal with it not directly but through their brokers ) that the small investor and the small speculator come into touch with the Stock Exchange . If there were no odd lot houses , the man with modest savings which he wanted to invest in securities or venture in the hope of speculative profit would have no avenue of approach to the market where such investment or such speculation could be undertaken . THE ODD LOT DEALER CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT SHORT SELLING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the odd lot dealer could not exist if short selling were impossible . Just consider the matter a moment . The odd lot dealer always makes a market for those in quest of less than a hundred shares . If any one wants to buy , he must sell ; if any one wants to sell , he must buy . It is a highly competitive business , the odd lot business , and no man could refuse orders and live . Suppose , now , the market is falling . Brokers come to the odd lot man to buy for their customers . He must sell or shut up shop . If he buys before he sells , the market will run away from him . He will be selling always at a loss . He will be committing suicide . He must sell the odd lots short and buy his hundreds to make them up when the market has gone down further . He must sell short or be ruined . So the very life of the odd lot dealer depends on his ability to sell short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stock Exchange of the small investor and the small speculator is through the odd lot dealer . The conclusion is inescapable . Prohibit short selling , and you strike at the small investor . Prohibit short selling , and you narrow your market ? and a narrow market is a bad market , a dangerous market . Short selling and trading on margin are instruments primarily of speculation . They may touch the sphere of investment occasionally , but not to a great enough extent to modify seriously the rule that they are speculative operations . HOW ABOUT SPECULATION ? This naturally raises the question of speculation as a whole . Should it be classed with gambling as an anti-social practice , or with legitimate business operations ? On this point the testimony of students of economic processes is , to all intents and purposes , unanimous . " Speculation , " says Professor Edwin R. A. Seligman , an American student of economics , " subserves a useful and in modern times an indispensable function . " From France there comes similar testimony in the words of the great French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evils of speculation , but the evils that speculation prevents are much greater than those it causes . " In England sixty years ago John Stuart Mill gave expression to the same judgment : " ? The interests of the speculators as a body coincide with the interests of the public ; . . . they can only fail to serve the public interest in proportion as they miss their own . " The services which speculation performs in modern business are , first , to segregate many of the risks of commerce and cause them to be assumed by a special class ; second , to contribute the maximum share to the formation of a broad and free market in which prices are kept steady by affording the widest range to the operation of the law of supply and demand ; third , to make for the individual investor a continuous market in which he may buy and sell at will the securities representing his investments ; and , fourth , to bring together , through the market which speculation so largely creates , capital and the commercial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these valuable services speculation is indispensable . To class it as an evil , as a detriment to the public welfare , as a process illegitimate and indefensible , is a colossal error . The reason for being of the Stock Exchange lies largely  | in the fact that it provides extensive and elaborate facilities for the speculative process . To deny , on the other hand , that illegitimate forms of speculation , detrimental to the welfare of the individual and the community , are made possible by the facilities provided by the Stock Exchange for legitimate speculation , would be an equally colossal error . Where the opportunity for speculation exists , men will speculate who ought not to do so , and in ways that are illegitimate . THE STOCK EXCHANGE PROTECTS THE CUSTOMER That this is true the New York Stock Exchange has fully realized . It has undertaken to minimize the possibilities for the illegitimate practices of speculators to a considerable extent in the past and to a larger extent in the present and the future . The Stock Exchange , like many other commercial organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more lively sense of its responsibilities to the community by the force of an awakening public opinion . The sentiment of the members of the Stock Exchange is moving forward with the times . The group of progressive members who have for years been exerting their influence toward a raising of the standards of the Exchange and more stringent safeguards against illegitimate speculation are finding their way easier as public opinion inside as well as outside of the Exchange is being educated . The Exchange has for a long time done much to protect the interests of the public . It is doing more . It will in the near future , I believe , do more still . The rules of the Exchange are framed to protect the customer . For instance , no error made by a broker can accrue to his advantage ; the customer always gets the benefit , if there is a benefit . But the customer never suffers the loss , if there is a loss . In the phrase of the Exchange , " A broker 's error account can not show a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order to buy Pennsylvania at 108 . If the stock sells at 108 during the day , the broker may explain that he was in the crowd when the sale took place , but was unable to buy because not enough stock was offered to meet the demand . But if he was not in the crowd or was absent from the Floor when the sale was made , he must " put the stock in " for his customer at 108 , taking the loss arising from his having to buy it at a higher price . If , however , the stock at any time during the day , in any quantity however small , sells at any price below 108 , no matter where the broker was at the time , and no matter if Pennsylvania shot up to 110 the next minute , the broker must give the stock to his customer at 108 . On a selling order the same rule holds ; the broker suffers for his carelessness or preoccupation or bad fortune . If , however , on an order to sell Steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 57he must give the customer the benefit of the higher price . For the broker to absorb the difference himself would be to violate the cardinal rule that a man may not be principal and agent in the same transaction . The customer can not lose through his broker 's error , but he may gain through it . If he suspects that something is wrong , he can apply to the secretary of the Exchange . The trade will be verified through the house which took the other end of the transaction . If the broker has made the trade at one price and reported it at another , he has committed the cardinal sin . The penalty is expulsion . The Exchange has an arbitration committee which settles disputes between members , and disputes between a member and a customer if the customer wishes the committee to do so . Any customer can bring a member before the arbitration committee , willy-nilly ; but a member can not bring a customer there unless the customer is willing . THE EXCHANGE TRIES TO PREVENT FICTITIOUS TRANSACTIONS The Exchange protects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate illegitimate forms of transaction . Among such forms are ' wash sales " and " matched orders . " Wash sales are fictitious sales in which no stocks actually change possession . Matched orders are orders given by an individual to one broker to buy shares of a given stock and to another broker to sell shares of the same stock . In such a transaction there is obviously no real change of ownership . One broker must of course deliver the stock to the other and receive payment for it . But since the customers of each broker are one and the same person , the principal in the case is evidently selling himself stocks with one hand and paying himself for them with the other . The acceptance by members of orders for such transactions , as well as the giving of them , . is forbidden by the rules . The penalty is sus- pension for not more than one year . Such transactions , fictitious in reality , but perfectly good on their face , have unquestionably been much used in the past by operators who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringent rule of the Exchange , combined with the law of the State making such a fictitious transaction a felony , has probably reduced them to the vanishing point . TRADING ON LIGHT MARGINS It is apparently a difficult thing to frame definitions of speculation and gambling which draw the line in exactly the right place . But that , in the language of the Hughes Commission , whose report on the Stock Exchange is a classic document , many of the transactions on the Exchange are " virtually gambling " there can be no question . At any rate , whatever our definitions may be , a considerable amount of the speculation on the Stock Exchange has , for the individual indulging in it and hence the community , all the evil results of gambling . The chief cause of this form of speculation is trading on insufficient margin , and trading by men who can not afford to lose . The latter practice it is well-nigh impossible to control . To curb the right of the individual to do what he will with his own is rather beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this practice would be restricted if no brokers would accept orders except upon ample margin . Ten points is probably the usual margin . Many houses make a practice of requiring a twenty-point margin except in unusual cases . But unfortunately not all houses require so much as a ten-point margin . On smaller margins than ten points the danger of being " shaken out " on a comparatively small change of price up or down is a serious one for the customer with small resources . Doing any business on a small margin is a dangerous undertaking , but it is especially so in the business of speculation . To eliminate from the Stock Exchange dealing on insufficient margins would be to eliminate one of the big sources of loss and suffering . It would go far to remove a stigma that has rested upon the business of dealing in stocks and bonds . The New York Stock Exchange has undertaken to bring about this elimination . A rule adopted in February , L J of the present year declares that a member accepting an account " without proper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extent of losing his seat . A new committee has been appointed to carry out this rule and others relating to the business conduct of members . This committee is an active one , and steps have already been taken to make effective the rule against insufficient margins . There seems little doubt that the Governing Committee of the Exchange can do much to eliminate this dangerous practice , if it wants to badly enough to take sufficiently drastic action . A good beginning has been made . Perhaps a system of examinations by expert employees of the Exchange of the books of each Stock Exchange house , at unexpected intervals , as National banks are examined , might be established to advantage to deal with this question . The Exchange is trying to curb this evil ; if it tries hard enough , it will succeed . It ought to have the full support of public opinion in its endeavors . It ought also to have the continued spur of public opinion toward the improvement of the conditions of trading on the Exchange to the greatest possible degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
