txt After the Public Service Commission and the committee of the Board of Estimate had held conferences yesterday with representatives of both the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company , it became known that the majority of the committee is prepared to report to the Beard of Estimate in favor of the acceptance by the city of the B. R. T. subway offer . Mr. ** and President Cromwell of Richmond , ace ? 0. : to the indicated. - line- up of the cA Mittis6. yesterday , will be the majority'aneETeaident Millero ; , the Bronx the minority . The dissenting report of Mr. Miller , it Is understood , will be based upon the fact that the Interborough 's offer includes tho entire Westchester Avenue extension in the Bronx as a. line to be constructed jointly by the city and the company , and the White Plains Road line as an extension to be similarly constructed , whereas the E. R. T offer cuts off the Westchester Avenue extension at the Bronx River , except as it may be considered a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White Plains Road extension . This line-up in the committee would indicate that nine and possibly eleven votes of the sixteen in the Board of Estimate will be cast in favor of adopting the majority report . It is regarded as certain that Controller Prendergast and President Mitchel of the Aldermen will add their six votes to Mr. 's two and Mr Cromwell 's one , and in addition the two votes of Borough President Steers of Brooklyn , according to information obtained in authoritative quarters , are likely to be cast with the report if that report favors the B. R. T. offer . Yesterday 's conference closed the sessions with the Interborough , and there remains a single point to be closed up with the B. R. T. representatives at a conference to-morrow . Then the committee and the Public Service Commission will hold several sessions to Consider the possibility of having the commission concur in the report of the committee , and the result will go to the Board of Estimate next week . for Early Publicity . Mr. said yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite recommendations as to what course the committee believed ! the city ought to take , and he was indined to agree with the suggestion that the report should be made public when it was sent to the Board of Estimate , instead of waiting for the meeting at which it will be considered by the board . Mr. and Chairman ' Willcox of tee Public Service Commission both said that they were through conferring with the representatives of the Interborough unless some earticular question arose in the course of the meeting between the commission and the committee w:iich demanded further light from the Interborough Company . No adjourned date was set for further sessions between the city 's conferees and the Interborough . At yesterday 's meeting President Shoets and Directors Belmont and Freedteen represented the company . The Interborough representatives said that they still adhered to the demand that the granting of their elevated third tracks under 992-3-ear franchises and with payment to the city on the basis of 2 per cent . of the increased gross receipts at tee express stations on the third tracks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer of subway extensions . Chairman Willcox of the Public Service Commission said after the conference that the compensation to the city on the basis proposed for the third tracks would be a nominal sum . The Interborough Directors also reaffirmed an agreement which they made tentatively at the conferences of last Winter , that whatever the construction cost of their proposed extensions should eventually be , they would share In it half and half with the city . This agreement affects considerable sums of money , according to information obtained yesterday from the city s conferees . The total construction cost under the Interborough offer is ** which includes , on the company 's part . 20 per cent for extras . The figures of the city 's conferees based on the experience on the present Subway and on the Fourth Avenue , Brooklyn , Subway , show an allowance of 7 per cent for extras , which difference of 13 per cent . on $135.780,000 amounts to 517,651.400 , half of which would be saved to the city , and half to the company . Mr. Shouts Explains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director Andrew Freedman were asked exactly what was meant by the proposal of the company to build any line on the terms offered to the city by the B. R. T. , instead of on the terms contained in the Interborough 's offer of Dec. 5. as amended by the company 's letter of Tuesday . Mr. Shonts replied that the meaning was that his company would accept the same income basis on its existing lines as the B. R. T. proposed , under an arrangement to pool the receipts from the entire system . " You mean by that , then , " Mr. Shonts was asked , " that after the operating expenses have been deducted from the gross receipts , the company should have a guarantee of a sum equal to its net profits in the year preceding the beginning of operation of the enlarged system ? " " Just so , " replied Mr. Shonts . " That mould be 17.2 per cent . on your investment in the Subway to start with , and as much more as you might earn up to the year preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was asked further . " It would be whatever we were earning in the year preceding the commencement of operation of the enlarged system , " Mr. Shonts replied . A moment later , in answer to another question in ivii:ch reference was made to he Inter ? r , ath 's net profits of 17.2 per cent . es subway investment , Mr. Shortie se ) . ? ? I never said anything about 17.2 per rent . We do not figure it that way . The road is earning about II per cent . on the entire rapital invested in it . " The attention of Mr. Shonts was called to the return of I ) per cent as including the rig 's investment as well as the company 's whereas the B. R. T. offer referred only to the net profits to the company on its investment . He replied : " I do n't care how you figure it . If von want to keep on shooting at that 17.2 per cent .. go ahead and do it , but it is n't fair and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shonts was asked also whether he ? thought there would he legal difficulties in the way of the swap of leases on the lines below Forty-second Street , which his company 's offer proposed , provided could be done legally and the lien of any authorized mortgage be not disturbed . He replied that the best lawyer he knew in New York had told him that there would be no legal objection . " Would you anticipate that some bondholder might fight ? " he was asked . " Oh , yes , " he replied , " there would be sure to be a fight . " " And litigation ? " " Yes , and litigation , " was his answer . Yesterday 's conference between the city 's conferees and President Timothy S. Williams and his fellow directors of the B. R. T. was upon the question of determining the return to be allowed to the company on its present elevated lines , which under its offer are to be merged into the extended rapid transit . system . Several methods of determining this return are under discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's conferees will reach an understanding at their conference to-morrow . The 13 . R. T. is now earning a little less than e per cent . net profits on its investment in its elevated lines , and its offer contemplated that the net earnings in the year before the operation of the extended system began should be taken as a standard . The city 's representatives suggested a compromise on this point , and the conferences of the last two or three days have involved this discussion . WILLIAMS ON LATEST OFFER . Finds Interborough Proposal Puzzling and Compares It with B. R. T. 's . Col. T. S. Williams , President of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit , Company , discussing yesterday the Interborough 's amended subway offer , said : " I have spent five or six hours study ing the six printed pages embodying the Interborough Company 's latest offer , and although I am somewhat familiar with the English language I find myself at a loss to know exactly what the proposal Contains . The whole presentation is so full of complexity and uncertainty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to inject so much confusion into the situation as to postpone indefinitely a decision by the city authorities . " Evidently the principal purpose of the proposal was to tempt the public by Magnifying the amount of money to be expended by the company and to minimize the amount to be expended by the city . In this respect the offer is entirely fallacious . If adopted , it would mean . including the twenty-four miles of existing subway lines operated by the Interborough , a rapid transit system of about seventynine miles . In other words , for the expenditure of $67,500.000 of its own capital the city would get for the public a transportation system , including that already built , of seventy-nine miles , whereas tinder the Brooklyn Rapid Transit offer , for an expenditure of $73.000,000 the city would get a comprehensive rapid transit system of approximately ninety-eight miles . Moreover , it would cost the city under the Interborough proposal at least $30.000 , - 00o additional to give what the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company has offered to lave in the way of extensions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jamaica , and the extension to Corona , so , to put the Interborough offer on a parity with the Brooklyn Rapid Transit offer in these respects , the city would have to spend $97,500,000 instead of $73,000,000 , but from a financial point of view the proposal is still more fallacious . Scarcely a concrete word is embodied in the proposition as to terms of operation , either of the new lirws now to be built or of future extensions. , " Therefore we must go back to the offer of Dec. 5 , 1910 , and it is to be assumed that the same uncertain . complicated method of determining the city 's return from its new lines and the guarantee of losses on extensions are still preserved . Looks to Him Like a Gamble . " Although this phase of the original offer has been under discussion for practically five months with the city 's representatives , the Interborough Company has apparently been unwilling to make any suggestion looking forward or to consent to a franker method of accounting , and for the city to enter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such terms would be a gamble of the worst kind , for no man living can even approximate what the city would get out of it . If the result should be , as is likely , that the city would not get full return on its investment , the bonds issued by It would not be released from the operation of the debt limit and the city would find its hands tied as to future . subway building . ? " The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company , on the other hand , has taken the open , straight course and has proposed to pool all receipts , not only from the new lines , but from the lines which it incorporates into the new city system , and it gives to the city the benefit of all growth on the existing lines thus incorporated . It also has agreed to stand the operating losses on a large number of extensions . Beyond an amount equivalent to the net earnings of existing lines before their incorporation into the city system and interest . on its now capital the company will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been earned on all the city 's investment . The Interborough offer gives no line to Jamaica or to Corona . It gives no line connecting Long Island City with Brooklyn . It does not reach the growing section of Queens east of Ridgewood . It does not cover the populous business section on Broadway from Williamsburg Bridge to.East New York , on Myrtle Avenue , or on Fulton Street . It does not reach the growing section of the Twentysixth Ward known as Brownsville and the rapidly developing territory eastwardly thereof . It makes no provision for that large territory south of Eastern ParkWay in the neighborhood of Utica Avenue . It forgets Flatbush . Prospect Park South . Sheepshead Bay , Kensington , Gravesend , Bath Beach . Bensonhurst , Borough Park , and Bay Ridge . Against the Suburbs . " It absolutely and- effectually closes Broadway , Manhattan , as a distributing line for Brooklyn passenger traffic ex .. cept as to that small portion between Fourteenth Street and Fifty-ninth Street which Is to be fed by the Fourteenth Street-Brooklyn Subway . Instead of presenting a transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manhattan by distributing the population over wide areas of undeveloped land , as does our plan , it is confined , with the exception of short lines in Queens and lines in the Bronx , to built-up districts and effectually discourages the development of suburbs . The Interborough proposal , if adopted , would mean substantial monopoly of city lines for at least thirty-five years , and probably forty-nine years . fcik the city could not exercise its option to take over the lines at the end of thirty-five years without assuming a large ? burden in the shape of unearned profits of the Interborough Company for the remainder of its lease . Nor can the proposed recapture of new lines often ten years be effective , for this recapture , in order that the city may have a continuous line in Manhattan , is dependent " First  --  Upon legislation . " Second  --  Upon payment of money by the city in addition to the cost of the new lines . " Third  --  Upon getting releases from an existing Interborough mortgage which the Interborough people have strenuously in- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , the city 's representatives who are considering the transit question have now had experience in abundance . both with proposers and proposals . They are able to distinguish chaff from wheat , stone from bread , and bricks of gold from bricks of clay . They are sufficiently familiar with the facts to reach a conclusion that will serve the best interests of the city and its people . They know which company in its proposals and its ' negotiations has been frank , straightfor , ward , and direct . They know that without the entrance of our company upon the field no important concessions would have been made by the other company , and the city would have been In a position where it would have been obliged to accept a. bad bargain or to have proceeded with subway construction itself , trusting to the future to find an operator . " Both offers now being before the public , we believe that ours far surpasses the other in the eseiential requirements , namely : First  --  The welfare of the greatest number of people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third  --  The assurance of an operator of all future extensions upon terms fixed In advance . " Fourth  --  The widest possible extension of the five-cent fare . " Fifth  --  The absolute control in the city by virtue of the ten-year termination clause of a consistent , comprehensive , independent transportation system . "
