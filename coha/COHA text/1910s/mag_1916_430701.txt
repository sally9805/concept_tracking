 |p643  THE public is not accustomed to think of boys and bond issues in the same connection . The last general election in New York State , therefore , has given the public something new to think about . The State Parks Committee had before it the problem of presenting to the people of New York State a proposition for the issue of $10 , - 000,000 worth of bonds for the extension of the park system of the State and the preservation of the forests essential to an adequate water supply for the cities of New York . There are over one and one-half million voters in New York State , and the State E. WEST Executive ) Parks Committee had no facilities for quickly placing before the voters the exact facts upon which to base judgment on this momentous question . It was a non-partisan and non-political proposition . Such questions must be presented on separate ballots . In a Presidential election the voter , with three ballots in his hand , might easily overlook and neglect the one which to him seemed of minor importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public . The Committee decided to issue an illustrated twenty-four-page pamphlet setting forth the facts , and appealed to the Boy Scouts of America of the State of New York for cooperation in distributing it . The policies and regulations of the Boy Scouts prohibit participation in political or partisan issues , but this issue was found to be nonpolitical and of benefit to all the people . Therefore the executive board authorized that the eleven hundred scoutmasters in the State be given an opportunity to volunteer in the distribution of these pamphlets through the members of their troops . As a result , twelve thousand boys in the State of New York responded and in a very  |p644  intelligent and effective way distributed nearly two hundred thousand of the booklets , thereby giving the voters an opportunity to analyze the merits of the plan . This has resulted in a large vote being cast , with a substantial majority in favor of the bond issue . In this way the members of the Boy Scouts of America of the State of New York have strikingly illustrated their interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this , in the distribution of these pamphlets and by the thought occasioned incident to their work a very definite conception has been developed in the minds of the boys as to their relationship as individuals to the big problems of the State and Nation , and it was brought home to them very vividly that their membership in the Boy Scouts of America meant practical training for citizenship . SERVING THE COMMUNITY While this is a most conspicuous and striking example of the training for citizenship by doing instead of by merely acquiring book information . this sort of thing is taking place in every town throughout the country where troops of Boy Scouts are organized . Annual troop reports received at the national headquarters in New York during the past twelve months set forth eleven hundred and four different instances of scouts assisting in community clean-up campaigns . Twelve cases are reported in which scouts established public drinking places ; eighteen of scouts acting as volunteer forestry wardens ; forty-two in which they have assumed responsibility for raising and lowering the American flag on public buildings ; 168 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adding to the attractiveness of their home cities ; and 618 in which organized cooperation was given in civic celebrations . In 570 cases scouts have acted as guides or ushers in large conventions or gatherings , such as the G. A. R. encampments , and meetings of societies , associations , and other such groups . In six instances scouts have had the responsibility of making a complete census for the authorities . They have conducted thirty " safety first " campaigns , and have had a definite part in conducting 264 municipal Christmas tree festivities . In addition to all this , numerous cases are reported of scouts performing charitable work , showing kindness to animals , searching for lost persons , delivering circulars regarding some worth-while function , entertaining children in orphan asylums , taking part in Memorial Day , Washington 's birthday , Lincoln 's birthday , and Fourth of July celebrations . Two hundred and twentyeight cases of saving persons from drowning are reported .  |p645  A troop on the Pacific Coast reports that , during the year , the scouts served as a reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all baggage from the depot and acting as guides ; fed several poor families on Thanksgiving and Christmas ; fed birds during the snow season . In the Middle West another troop reports that one scout rescued a boy from drowning , and that scouts took an active part in " swat-the-fly , " " clean-up , " and " safety first " campaigns . The scoutmaster well reports that he is proud of every member of the troop . A scoutmaster in Michigan reports that a portion of his scouts acted as an information bureau at the American Medical Association Convention . At the annual Grammar School excursion the scouts acted as guards at the waterfront and did " first aid " work . They helped the . police to handle traffic during the Christmas rush , took part in the Memorial Day parade , and rendered first aid at the State Fair held in Detroit . A troop in Pittsburgh reports supporting a boy in an industrial school , serving as helpers in civic and philanthropic movements , and selling Red Cross seals in post-offices at Christmas-time . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cooperating in the " preparedness " parade , at the conventions of the , Federation of Women 's Clubs and the National Education Association , and at the civic celebration on July Fourth . A colored troop in East Orange reports that at the request of the chief public health officer the boys of their troop cleaned up the rubbish and refuse from four large lots and piled it in places convenient for garbage carts . In addition to this they collected the tin cans , rags and rubbish , and bottles of every description along the Lackawanna Railroad embankment for five blocks . Mention should be made of the services of the scouts incident to the Ohio floods in 191.3 , the inaugural and Woman Suffrage parades at Washington in the same year , and  |p646  the disastrous fire in Salem , Mass. , in 1914 ; the services of the scouts at Gettysburg , where eleven thousand instances of first-aid work were reported ; and in connection with the centennial celebration of the birth of the " Star Spangled Banner " at Baltimore in 1914 . A total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops during the past twelve months aggregates 10,092 . For convenience these may be classified as follows : Acts of courtesy 1514 Acts of practical aid 2558 Distinctive services to the community .. 6020 THE DAILY " GOOD TURN " Necessarily , the reports which come to the national headquarters reveal only to a limited degree the extent of practical services rendered ; and for the most part the reports are based upon collective action by the scouts as a troop . In addition to the services rendered by troops , it should be remembered that the 200,000 boys registered as members in good standing ( as well as many of the half-million additional who have had the benefit of the scout training in the past ) faithfully carry out the requirement of a " daily good turn . " s Many of the daily good turns are of a distinctively civic character . It is because of this showing ? that is , the actual doing of things worth while along lines of civic and community value ? that the Boy Scouts of America has the active interest and cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movement for citizenship training of the most practical character . Indeed , most of the men believe that this training is of greater value than that which is given in our public schools , and even in our schools of higher education where they have the benefit of special teachers and special courses in civics . The distinction between the training given in the schools and that given by the Scout Movement is that in the schools the training is largely book knowledge , while with the scouts the training is based upon the actual doing of things of a civic character which are worth while . In other words , action , not words , typifies the Scout Movement . SCOUT " PREPAREDNESS " The motto of the movement is ' " Be Prepared . " It should be remembered that this motto was selected long before the present agitation for preparedness took hold of the people of , America . The preparedness of the Scout Movement is of the most practical character , and is more far-reaching in its significance and practical value than preparedness simply for military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active participation in the life of the community , and for all-around citizenship . THE SCOUT LAW Every member of the Boy Scouts of America is obligated by his oath to do his duty to his God and his country , to obey the Scout Law , to be helpful to others at all times , and to keep himself physically strong , mentally awake , and morally straight . The Scout Law is as follows : 1 . A Scout is trustworthy . A Scout 's honor is to be trusted .

WHY SCOUT WORK AND METHODS APPEAL TO BOYS The report of what scouts have done during the past twelve months throughout the whole country is convincing evidence of the interpretation by its memberg that the Scout Movement is a most potent factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of the virile , unselfish leadership of men devoted to our country are but a natural expression of scout training for citizenship . These practical and worth-while results are made possible by reason of the attractiveness of the scout program of activities , which appeal so strongly to boy nature , and thereby capitalize the boy 's gang instinct by organizing groups of eight boys into patrols and three or more patrols into troops , requiring them to pass tests in subjects not taught adequately in our public schools , but which have tremendous value in making consistent the scouts ' motto , " Be Prepared . " These activities include not only the practical knowledge of things worth while , but a test of the ability to do things ? such as knottying , signalling , first aid , map-making , camping , cooking , , agriculture , archery , personal health , public health , physical development , swimming , life-saving , etc. , etc . This program holds the interest of the boy and makes possible the accomplishment of the real objective of scouting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen thousand men serving as scoutmasters and assistant scoutmasters , and the twenty-eight thousand additional men serving as members of troop committees and local councils and special officers , are giving from five to thirty hours a week in volunteer service because of a definite conviction that through Scouting they are making a definite patriotic contribution to our country in citizenship training . These men realize that our country needs a more distinctive conviction on the part of the men of to-morrow as to their responsibility , as well as their privileges , as citizens of our republic . By giving supervision and direction to the manner in which boys spend their leisure time , they are endeavoring to teach them discipline , a proper regard for the rights of others , practical ideas as to hygiene , and ability to care for themselves and to know what to do in any emergency . Furthermore , they are endeavoring to give boys , during their adolescent years , a prac/ tical interpretation both of our history , and also of their own opportunity as future citizens through practical instruction in patriotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Movement recognizes the fact that boys spend much of their leisure time in reading , and has made available expert leadership and advice in the boys ' reading program together with a high-class monthly magazine for boys called Boys ' Life ? the Boy Scouts magazine ? and a selected list of fiction books in the form of its Every Boy 's Library . ALL-AROUND CITIZENSHIP , RATHER THAN TECHNICAL MILITARY TRAINING Much has been said during the past two years about the question of military training , and many enthusiastic advocates of preparedness have sought to impose a part of the burden of the preparedness movement upon the growing boys of our country . The men who are devoting themselves to the Boy Scout Movement almost unanimously agree with the military authorities the world over that the most essential things in the proper training of growing boys are included in the program of the Boy Scouts of America . They believe that if this program is efficiently carried out it will result in making available young men , sound in body , with a patriotic conception of their responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more practical than would be the case if the time of these boys were consumed during their adolescent years with purely technical military training . It is believed by the men in the Scout Movement that the purely technical military training can be best given under the auspices of different agencies , and should not crowd out things which are essential for practical citizenship training . For these reasons the Boy Scout Movement , although only barely started , and with less than six years ' history in our country , has commanded the support of the foremost leaders in every walk of life , including some of our most prominent educators . Theodore Roosevelt has recently characterized the Boy Scout Movement as " distinctly an asset to our country for the development of efficiency , virility , and good citizenship . " President Wilson says : " It is fine to have the boys of our country organized for the purposes the Boy Scouts represent . . . . I am proud of their manliness . " Among many educational experts who have been interested in the movement , Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has expressed himself at length . He regards the Boy Scout Movement as " one of the most valuable educational agencies of this generation , " and hopes " to see the time when every American boy will look forward to being a good scout and will be trained to incorporate the ideals of the boy scout into his life as an American citizen . " THE CALL FOR SCOUTMASTERS The marvellously successful development of the movement during the past six years has been made possible only because of the unselfish devotion of thousands of men who have served as scoutmasters . The opportunity for the further extension , so as to reach a larger proportion of the eight million boys who are eligible for membership , is dependent entirely upon the number of highgrade men who are willing to volunteer their services for positions of leadership in the organization . In all parts of our country more men are needed . All who are willing to help in any way will receive definite advice upon application to our National Headquarters in the Fifth Avenue Building , New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
