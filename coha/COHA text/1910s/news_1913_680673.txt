txt Two new plots to burn Sing Sin prison and to embarrass further the administration of Warden James N. Clancy , came to light yesterday in the course of an investigation of affairs in the institution . The discoveries were really made on Friday , soon after the finding of Kurt Schoenheer in hiding over the ceiling of the knitting shop . The discoveries added to the suspicion which has been entertained all the time by friends of the Warden , that enemies were engaged in a crusade to discredit him . All of the disclosures thus far have strengthened the belief of Clarib-Y ' friends that the ultimate aim of the conspirators was to effect a wholesale jail delivery . Kut t Schoeitheer. the Nassau County burglar . who was serving a fifteen-year term , was found shortly after 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon . Quietly he was taken to his cell . A few minutes later , however , there was an uproar in gallery No. 9 , a few tiers removed from Schoenheer 's cell . " Fire , fire , fire , " came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , serving 16 years for assault , was confined . Keepers ran to the cell from every side . They saw no flames , but they did see a smoldering mattress on the prisoner 's cot . The tier locks as well as the individual cell bolts were drawn back . A little water soon put . nut the fire . The prisoner was forced to remain in his cell . The prison authorities admitted with reluctance that the fire occurred . They said that it was of no consequence . Some of the keepers , however . took another , view of it . They said that it would have been necessary to take Gentile from his cell if the fire had actually flared up - into flame . They admitted also that it might then have been necessary . to release all of the fifty prisoners on that Vier . In such an emergency the preservation of order would have been difficult , it was said , and a rush for the gates might-have been made . Kindling Set for Fire . The second of the arson plots was spoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warnings of the big negro convict given to him Thursday morning . This negro told the Warden that he had a- " tip " that there would be two fires , one in the storeroom and one in the knitting factory . The fire in the storeroom occurred as predicted . Then the Warden closed the knitting shop and threw a. cordon of guards around the building . Under those conditions the second fire could not take place . Just after the finding of Schoenheer on Friday afternoon , however , one of the night watchmen found a heap of sticks and papers in a recess of the ceiling in the knitting shop . Everything was ready to set the match . The watchmen happened to look in this spot because It corresponded exactly with the recess from which Schoenheer crawled . He wanted to see the dimensions of the place . This discovery was guarded in the Warden 's office . The Warden , in fact , said that he knew nothing about it . One of the keepers let the cat out of the bag while talking to reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of Schoenheer which have not been cleared up . When Schoenheer was asked to explain yesterday he-said : " Why should I tell who told me to run away ? Do n't you know what I would get ? " He added nothing to his confession of Friday when he said that his escape had been instigated by convicts . He Knew that he would lose his good behavior marks , he said , and he could n't understand why he should turn Informer tor the benefit of the Warden . Strangely enough , Schoenheer , although lie wore nothing but an under : - shirt when he emerged from the eleveninch wide belt shaft , had in his possession a. hair . brush and comb . This same brush and comb had been found In his discarded prison clothes when he was first missed a week ago yesterday . He held to them as if they were very valeable possessions . Warden Clancy chn not understand this . He would also like to knoW who brought to the knitting shop the bread and tobacco and new clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No convicts had been in the building since late on Wednesday afternoon . Ossining Hints at Polities . " Talk of political " conspiracy " did not cease in the village of Ossining . Some of the villagers said that the Sing Sing troubles were directly connected with Gov . Sulzer 's troubles . Ex-Warden John S. Kennedy and the new Warden Clancy held a conference I yesterday . They met in a private room of a hotel in Ossining , quite by accident , they said . With them was Henry M. Carpenter , a banker and long time resident of Ossining . Reporters confronted the Men while they were discussing the prison situation . Mr. Kennedy made this statement : " If there is any man in Sing Sing , employe or convict , who is instigating or aiding in any disturbance there I Vouttunvd on . Page -- 2 . FIND TWO NEW PLOTS TO BURN SING SING // want it understood that such a man is no friend or mine . Such a man , if there is one , is doing . me more Injury than he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good wishes and feeling of Warden Clancy . " Warden Clancy thereupon shook hands with his predecessor , and said that he had never suspected him of having anything to do , directly or indirectly , with the Sing Sing troubles . Warden Clancy regretted , he said , that such a , scare had been created over the militia . and wanted it understood that he had never entertained the notion 44r seeking aid from the militia . That suggestion , he said , had come from some excited person in the village . The man referred to , . - of course , was John F. Jenkins , Town Supervisor . Mr. Jenkins is a brother of George Jenkins , who is State Controller Sohmer 's representative at Sing Sing . George Jenkins dropped in at the conference and heard his brother criticised . He denied that he had told his brother that conditions were serious enough at Sing Sing to warrant the calling of the militia . He was wholly in sympathy with the . Warden . he said . " I regret exceedingly . " broke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so nearsighted as to believe that the town itself , or its- people , were in danger from the outbreak of prisoners . This notoriety has hurt the village of Ossining . At one swoop property has depreciated hundreds of thousands of dollars here . " What was the cause of all the trouble ? " Mr. Carpenter was asked " Politics , " he replied . Mr. Carpenter is a Democrat , and said he was proud of it . " Tammany Hall is all right , " he continued . " but I have no respect for Murphyism . For years and years politicians have been trying to Murphyize Westchester County . The present prison situation is the result of their political activity . " Everything was quiet within the prison walls for the whole of the twenty-four hours yesterday . The Warden kept about 300 of the disturoers of Thursday locked in their cells , but the remainder were permitted to work in the shops in the morning and to loiter in the yards in the afternoon . It was a sign of peace , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their protests at such discrimination . It was learned that the prison authorities were considering the elimination of the sounding of the prison whistle when a convict is found missing . Gossip in Ossining has it , however , that such a step would be hard , fought . Citizens who were questioned about it said that the whistle was a warning which they had become accustomed to and could not do without
