 | THE railroad problem is constantly assuming a more prominent place in the public interest . In the face of the increased outlay for labor which has attended the settlement of recent wage disputes , the cries for protection against impoverishment raised by railroad officials throughout the land have been intensified . They claim that labor costs of operation have rapidly advanced . Because of the general rise in prices they declare also that more must be paid for railroad supplies ; and that the cost of borrowing capital has increased because of the upward trend in interest rates . It is further claimed that the orders of State Railroad Commissions and the Interstate Commerce Commission relative to the installation of safety devices and hours and . conditions of employment have deprived the transportation systems of an increasing amount of their resources . It is also pointed out that the amount of railroad revenues absorbed by State and local taxation has advanced by leaps and bounds . The railroad officials also lament the fact that politicians and demagogues have used the railroads unjustly to win popular favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been reached , and that the only hope of maintaining the credit of the railroads upon which they must secure new capital for much-needed improvements and extensions lies in increased freight rates . The railroad officials assert , in short , that the transportation industry will be starved into a state of insolvency unless the Interstate Commerce Commission recedes from its decision of three years ago denying authority to advance freight rates . The employees of the railroads would welcome the prospect of an advance in freight rates . Obviously , increased rates mean additional revenues and a better prospect for higher wages . The other side of the question is taken by  | the shippers . The fundamental basis of their opposition in the past has been forcibly expressed in the argument that increased transportation charges constitute an added tax upon business and industry . It is denied that the railroads have reached the limits of economy and efficiency in management , and it is asserted that they should look within and not without for more revenue . The further charge has been made by the shippers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their earnings , that indefensible stock-watering and manipulation have been characteristic of railroad finances , and that from the standpoint of their legitimate needs there is no economic justification for the claims of the railroads . The problem , therefore , which will soon be passed upon by the Interstate Commerce Commission , has two important phases . In the first place , the operating performance of the railroads during recent years must be considered . It must be determined as to how far operating expenses have been increased by higher costs of materials , labor , and capital ; how far operating revenues have fallen because of reduced freight rates , and , furthermore , to what extent these rising costs of conducting transportation have been offset by gains in operating efficiency . In the second place , the financial management of the carriers must be given careful consideration . It is entirely possible that the operating efficiency of a railroad may be of the highest order and attended by large operating profits , and yet the company itself be in a deplorable financial condition because of mismanagement . Briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commerce Commission is whether the present financial needs of the railroads are legitimate in the light of their operating and financial records . It is at once apparent from a superficial study of railroad transportation statistics that the operating expenses of the carriers have recently advanced . The operating ratio , which means the proportion which operating expenses hear to operating revenues , of the railroads of the East during the period 1900 ? 1911 increased from 67 to 71 per cent. , in the South from 66 to 69 per cent. , and in the West from 62 to 67 per cent , In 1901 , 65 per cent . of the operating revenues of all the railroads of the United States was required to meet operating expenses ; in 1912 the ratio had advanced to slightly more than 69 per cent .. The oper- ating ratio , in other words , was 6.8 per cent . higher in 1912 than in 1901 . This condition of affairs is partially accounted for by pronounced advances in price of supplies used by the carriers . Although the proportion of total operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enginemen , trainmen , switchmen , and stationmen -- has generally tended to decrease , the total labor cost of operation of the railroads , due to heavier outlay for maintenance labor during recent years , has steadily increased in amount . Furthermore , in the course of the recent arbitrations between the Eastern railroads and their employees , it was asserted by the representatives of the carriers that it would require an additional outlay of about $2,600,000 annually to comply with full-crew laws ; about $12,000,000 yearly to meet the legislative requirements regarding hours of work and boiler inspections ; and more than $18,000,000 , during the next five years , to install safety appliances on locomotives and cars in compliance with national and State legislation . Increased tax payments have constituted another growing item of expense . Fixed charges are also much greater than in past years , owing to the general demand for higher interest return on invested capital . Along with these constant and harassing advances in operating expenditures , the carriers have suffered a serious decline in receipts per unit of traffic transported . The average amount obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freight carried in 1901 was $1.05 as compared with $1.04 in 1910 , the last year for which this information is available . The average rate for each ton hauled one mile declined from seventy-five hundredths to seventy-four hundredths of a cent during the period of 1901-1912 . The average rate for each passenger transported one mile for the past fiscal year was only 1.985 cents as contrasted with 2.01 cents in the year 1901 . Being thus confronted not only with rising costs of operation and of borrowing capital , but also with declining returns on each unit of traffic transported , obviously the only recourse which the operating officials of the railroads had was to attempt to increase efficiency and thereby reduce the outlay required for moving each unit of traffic . They gave their best endeavors to the solution of this problem , and produced remarkable results .  | To move a train requires an outlay for fuel , maintenance of way and equipment , and for payment of wages . A certain proportion of these costs are fixed and are the same regardless of the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the railroad officials that if the size of the freight . train load ? the number of tons of freight to each train ? could be increased without a corresponding increase in the expense of hauling the heavier train , there would be a gain in net operating results . So they set about to devise measures for increasing the tonnage of trains . Engines were designed which , although not burning proportionately as much coal , could haul a greater number of tons than those formerly in use . During the period 1902 ? 1912 the tractive power of locomotives used by Eastern railroads increased 120 per cent. , and the average tractive power of each locomotive , 54 per cent . Freight-cars were also greatly enlarged . Additional capital outlay during the same years was also made by the transportation companies in straightening curves and reducing grades in order to make possible the movement of larger trains . Road-beds were greatly strengthened to meet the new conditions , and in many cases were entirely rebuilt . As the combined result of these improvements , the average revenue freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 281 tons in 1901 to 409 tons in 1912 , or 45 per cent . By the development of the size of the trainload the carriers were able to handle a greater volume of traffic with comparatively fewer trains . In 1912 , as compared with 1902 , the Eastern railroads transported an increase of about 63 per cent . in ton mileage with only 20 per cent . increase in freight train miles . The effect of this increase in the productive efficiency of the transportation industry upon operating revenues has been very marked . In 1901 the operating expenses of all railroads of the United States considered as one system were $1.12 , and operating revenue $1.72 for each train operated one mile . At the close of the past fiscal year these figures were $1.59 and 82.30 , respectively . The gain in gross revenues , therefore , during the period 1901 ? 1912 had been sufficient to produce an increase in net revenue of ten cents per revenue train mile . In other words , although operating costs per revenue train mile had increased , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in operation , and net operating revenue for all the railroads of the  | country had advanced from 47 cents per revenue train mile in 1901 to 57 cents in the fiscal year 1912 . The gains thus made by the railroads east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers have been even greater than those for the country as a whole . During this period of ten years there was a net gain in operating revenue in Eastern territory of 13 cents per revenue train mile . Out of this gain in net revenue there must be paid , of course , a fair return upon the capital invested in additions and improvements to the road-bed and equipment which have contributed so largely to the gains in productive efficiency . Any rewards for increased efficiency of transportation , labor , or in managerial ability should be included in operating expenses . The final test of the financial status of the transportation companies and of the profitableness of recent progress in improvements and efficiency is whether or not the gains in net operating revenue , due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return upon the additional capital invested in increased facilities . Unfortunately , proper information is not at hand upon which to decide this point satisfactorily . If the railroads devoted the proceeds secured from the sale of their securities exclusively to the establishment of better transportation facilities , the task would be easy . But stocks and bonds have been extensively issued in exchange for the securities of other railroads in order to build up large transportation systems . It is impossible , because of the present form of the reports of the railroads to the Interstate Commerce Commission , to separate these transactions and to state explicitly what proportion of the total amount of stock issued at a given time was for additions and betterments to roadway , structures , and equipment , and what proportion was used for other purposes . The physical valuation of railroad property as reported by the railroads to the Interstate Commerce Commission is also misleading . In many eases the cost of road and equipment has been automatically increased with each issue of securities upon the unwarranted assumption that the proceeds arising therefrom have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , a considerable portion of railroad earnings has been expended for additions and betterments which have added to the value or earning capacity of the properties and which should properly be capitalized.  | This has been accomplished largely through charges to operating expenses or by direct appropriations from net income . The cost of road-bed , structures , and equipment , however , as shown by the reports of the railroads to the Interstate Commerce Commission can not be said to underestimate the amount of capital upon which a return must be earned . In fact , as a basis of calculation , it affords every advantage to the railroads . Noting this tendency to overvaluation , an examination of the reports of forty-four representative Eastern roads indicates an investment in road-bed and equipment of $7,38 per revenue train mile in 1912 as compared with $6.04 in 1902 . The additional capital commitment for extensions and improvements and additions to road-bed , structures , and equipment during the eleven years 1902 ? 1912 , for these forty-four leading railroads , was , therefore , $1.34 per revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . is 6 4-5 cents . It has been shown above that during this same period these railroads effected a gain in operating revenue of 13 cents for each revenue train mile . Deducting the annual increase of 6 4-5 cents in interest charges for new capital invested , there would still remain a net profit from operation , in excess of operating costs and interest on new capital invested , of slightly more than 6 cents per revenue train mile . This amount would be abundantly sufficient to meet taxes , make necessary improvements and extensions , and to increase dividend disbursements to stockholders . The showing of individual railroads does not alter this conclusion . No statistics are available for a conclusive demonstration , but those at hand seem to warrant the inference that railroad operations which have been properly promoted and managed have , as a rule , been sufficiently prosperous to provide a fair return upon the capital actually invested in transportation facilities . The payment of returns upon the capital obligations issued by the transportation companies is another question . During the decade 1901 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States was increased $7,728,000,000 , or 57.6 per cent . In 1910 , 82 per cent . more railroad stock , to the par value of $2,435,000,000 , was receiving dividends than in 1900 . Furthermore , the average return on dividendpaying railroad stocks in 1910 was 7 1-2 per cent . as against 5 1-4 per cent . in 1901 . The total dividend disbursements  | in 1910 were $159,000,000 greater than in 1900 , and 66 per cent . of all stock outstanding received dividends as against 51 per cent . in 1901 . The dividends paid by the railroads during the past fiscal year exceeded $400,000,000 , and the average rate was slightly more than 7 per cent . Interest requirements were also met by the railroads on all funded debt outstanding except about 7 1-2 per cent . of the total . This situation on its surface would indicate that the financial condition of the railroads is good and their demand for increased freight rates unjustifiable . Railroad officials claim , however , that expenses are steadily increasing and net operating revenues declining ; that present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without some relief the credit of the railroads will soon be so impaired that it will be impossible to secure additional capital for much-needed improvements . If the assumption of these officials , that the financial management of their properties has been proper and their capitalization legitimate , is accepted their assertion as to the condition of railroad finances , despite the superb operating performance of the carriers within recent years , seems to be true . The weakness in the argument of the railroads , however , lies in their assumption that the financial management of their properties in past years has been of such character as to merit assistance at the present time . An examination of the facts relative to this phase of the problem shows clearly that the financial administration of the railroads has been much less creditable than the operating management , and leads to the conclusion that if the financial managers had shown a degree of efficiency approximating that of the operating officials the transportation industry would be yielding enormous profits to stockholders , and any advance in freight charges would be unnecessary . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist in other leading commercial and industrial nations is to use part of their current revenues for the purpose of making permanent improvements to their properties . During the ten years 1902 ? 1912 the leading railroads in the East expended more than $300.000,000 of surplus income in additions and betterments . Within the past fifteen years , by a conservative calculation , they improved their properties to the extent of $500,000,000 by appropriations from surplus income and charges to operating expenses .  | These facts do not accord with the claim that the railroads of the country are impoverished and should be considered in extending financial assistance to them ; more especially when the property additions so provided are made the basis of stock dividends or designed to place real assets behind fictitious capitalization . As a matter of fact , increases in property values and in earning capacity are frequently made the basis of new securities given to stockholders . A striking example of this is the recent stock dividend of 33 1-3 per cent. , or S20,000 , - 000 , made by the Pennsylvania Company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stock bonuses , or rights granted stockholders to subscribe to new issues of securities at par when they are selling in the market at a premium have been very common . Four of the leading railroads of the East gave away more than $99,000 , - 000 during the period 1900-1910 in bonuses to their stockholders . In the West during the same period , five of the principal railroads authorized stock bonuses amounting to more than $185,000,000 . The aggregate amount of capital stock thus distributed by the railroads of the United States is enormous . This practice means not only unwarranted capitalization , but also a permanent absorption of operating revenues in the payment of dividends thereon . The effect , therefore , is to place a constant burden upon the railroad employee , the shipper , and the consumer . The connection between banking syndicates and railroad security flotation has recently been a matter of public inquiry . A number of large banks have been granted the exclusive right to handle the bonds of certain railroad companies and have been practically without competition in fixing the commission charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative railroads in the East during the period 1900-1910 issued new obligations of the par value of $810,000,000 . The market value of these bonds was $827,300,000 , but the railroads actually received only S787 , - 200,000 . More than $40,100,000 was paid out in underwriting commissions , the greater part of which might have been saved had the transportation companies sold their bonds on the open market . During the same decade , four leading roads in the West in floating $491,000,000 of bonds paid $21,000,000 in underwriting fees . Ordinary stock-watering and manipulation have played an  | even more conspicuous part in adding to the fictitious capitalization of the railroads . It is a matter of official record that when the two railroads which formed the nucleus of one of the largest trunk-lines of the country were combined in 1869 , a stock dividend of 100 per cent. , equal to $44,428,330 in money , was declared . At a recent hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission it was stated that a total of $93,034,026 of stock had been floated by this company during the period 1870-1910 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or earning capacity of the property . A drain of $5,535,000 annually upon the earnings of this system is necessary to pay dividends upon this fictitious capitalization . Another notorious case of stock inflation , which is also in the records of the Interstate Commerce Commission , is that of the Chicago &; Alton Railroad . In 1899 , when the so-called Harriman syndicate acquired control of the old Chicago &; Alton Railroad Company , its capitalization consisted of $22,230,600 o , f stock and $10,779,850 of bonds . Seven years later , when this company and the Chicago &; Alton Railway Company were consolidated as the present Chicago &; Alton Railroad Company , the new company began its existence with a capitalization of almost $114,600 , - 000 . The only tangible asset which the new company acquired in addition to the old Chicago &; Alton Railroad property was a line of railroad fifty-seven miles in length which had cost the syndicate $1,350,000 . The invested capital of the original companies at the time of the consolidation was by a liberal estimate only about $52,000,000 . The sum of $62,600,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriman syndicate without a single dollar of consideration . Numerous cases might also be cited to show how the capitalization of our railroads has been inflated under reorganizations or as the outcome of expansions made for the purpose of securing monopoly control . Recent official investigations have shown that the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad , in a reckless attempt to monopolize the transportation facilities of New England , has , within the space of twenty-five years , issued excess capitalization to the extent of $75,000,000 and has acquired and capitalized steam railroads , trolleys , and steamship lines with such disregard of their actual value and earning capacity that it is  | estimated that more than $8,000,000 of the operating revenues of the New Haven Railroad itself are absorbed each year by losses on these unwise investments . A large railroad company of the Middle West , by an unwise policy of expansion , has within the last ten years lost approximately $32,000,000 . Another leading Western railroad which passed through a reorganization in 1909 had its securities inflated to the extent of $59,420,000 , for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity of the property . In the reorganization of another leading Western railroad in 1895 , fictitious capitalization was issued to the amount of $166 , - 096,184 in preferred and common stock . The earnings of this railroad have up to the present time been used to pay dividends aggregating $112,000,000 upon this watered capitalization , and the absorption of operating revenues annually by dividend payments upon these unwarranted stock issues is $9,167,000 . These illustrations and others which can not be mentioned in detail clearly demonstrate the fact that the financial direction of our railroads in the past has been as indefensible as the management of actual operations of the transportation companies has been efficient and praiseworthy . It is clear that at the bottom of the present difficulties of the railroads is to be found improper or misguided financial management . The gains made in the operating efficiency of the carriers have been consumed in the payment of dividends and interest charges upon fictitious securities . An economic crime has been perpetrated by the capitalization of the actual and potential earnings arising from increased productive efficiency . Higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad materials and supplies have only served to bring to a head the more fundamental evils arising from over-capitalization . It is for this reason that the railroads after several generations of increase in earning power are no better off than they were before . Year by year the growth in earning power of the transportation companies has been capitalized in one way or another , and the development of the country has been steadily anticipated or discounted by the issue of new securities . Capitalization has been made to keep pace with profits . This policy would have gone on indefinitely had Congress not vested the Interstate Commerce Commission with the authority to regulate freight rates . Charges for  | transportation services would have been automatically advanced to meet the requirements of higher operating costs and increased capital requirements . But now , without the power to exact more for their services , the railroads , in the face of a growth in the cost of operation , find it more and more difficult to pay dividends and secure much-needed capital . The question , therefore , which the Interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public will ultimately render a decision , is whether the transportation companies should be granted financial assistance through permission to charge more for transporting commodities . Despite the indefensible causes of the present plight of the railroads , the answer to this question should be in the affirmative . The sins of the past can not be rectified . Very little can be properly done at the present time to recall the capital which in former years has been given away to stockholders and underwriters . Something may be done to correct the waste of resource and the excess capitalization arising from past mergers , consolidations , and reorganization . As a rule , however , the fictitious securities already issued have passed from the hands of the underwriters and other original holders and are now in the possession of investors who had no part or profit in their flotation . To attempt to legislate , therefore , relative to railroad capitalization as it is at present would bring injury to many innocent persons . The burden which has been permanently placed upon the consumer and the railroad employee and stockholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be largely accepted . What can be done is to prevent similar financial practices in the future , and to make sure that no further handicaps to industrial progress , and to the economic well-being of the general public are added to those already existing . Due profits and liberal returns should be assured to the elements of risk and foresight in the development of transportation facilities . Legitimate rewards , however large , should be guaranteed to managerial ability and to invested capital . But railroad executives and operating officials should not be required to devote their time and talents to the earning of dividends and interest charges on fictitious capitalization . The railroad employee should not have to be confronted with the statement that an increase in wages would result in the impairment of a  | vested interest by interfering with dividend and interest payments , when , as a matter of fact , this vested interest originally consisted of watered capitalization which has been unloaded by promoters , reorganizers , or underwriting syndicates upon the unsuspecting public . The consumer should not be compelled to bear the burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in other words , an increase in cost of living , arising from the same causes . The permission to the railroads to advance their freight charges should , therefore , while safeguarding the present holders of railroad securities , be accompanied by legislation which would protect investors , consumers , and railroad employees . Along with the grant of higher freight rates should go the regulation of the financial management of the railroads . This is not only necessary because of past financial excesses , but is an inevitable and logical outcome of rate regulation itself . Legislation which would assure the proper use of railroad capital and safeguard the interests of employees and the public should have to do with , first , the issues of new stocks and bonds , and , second , reorganizations and consolidations . It is not necessary , as it is often claimed , to give the Interstate Commerce Commission power to regulate the issue of new securities . All that should be required would be for Congress to direct the Commission to investigate carefully new issues of stocks and bonds by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketed , what amount of cash was realized , and what was done with the cash proceeds . The Commission would then be in a position to know whether the securities had been properly floated and could take these facts under consideration in future rate cases . Publicity given to these investigations by the Commission would also force the railroads to market their securities properly . Otherwise , market values would slump and investors would have no confidence in the management . Bonuses to stockholders and large fees to underwriting syndicates would also be impossible without discovery and full publicity by the Commission . A policy of expansion and dissipation of resources for the purpose of obtaining monopoly advantages as exemplified by the recent history of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad , could not be successfully carried out if the Interstate Commerce Commission should be instructed to investigate and  | publish all the facts bearing upon the issue of new securities . Another possibility of financial evil and over-capitalization would be obviated if Congress would direct that all schemes of reorganization and consolidation of railroad property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interstate Commerce Commission . Reorganizations and consolidations in the past have been two of the principal sources of stock inflation and manipulation . Five years ago the Commission forbade the railroads to continue the general practice of charging additions and betterments to the operating expenses of their properties . A similar prohibition should now be made against the payments from net income or surplus for permanent improvements , or , in other words , for capital which adds to the value and earning capacity of their properties . In order that the total assets or resources of the railroads should be known , the transportation companies should also be required to show the existing market value of securities of other railroads which they hold in their treasuries . The present practice of a considerable number of railroads in carrying such holdings at nominal book values tends to conceal their real resources and to make secret reserves possible . With these regulations as to accounting methods and with the investigation of security issues and reorganizations by the Interstate Commerce Commission , the railroads should be permitted to advance their freight charges for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , it may safely be predicted that future increases in charges would not be necessary , but that reductions in the cost of distribution could be expected , for the reason that with proper financial management the earnings of the railroads would greatly increase on the basis of each dollar invested . If the Interstate Commerce Commission , without legislation looking to the financial control of the railroads , should sanction an increase in freight rates , their action would be tantamount to placing the stamp of approval upon past financial excesses and mismanagement and leaving the way open for similar practices in the future .
