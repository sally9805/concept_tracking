 | UNQUESTIONABLY , the telephone is the greatest industrial and commercial achievement of the American people . Our accomplishments in railroads , steel , oil , agriculture , and general manufacture loom large in our imagination ; these , however , when measured by originality , daring , resourcefulness , energy , and courage , are almost insignificant compared with what we have done with the telephone . Even from the standpoint of commercial morality , the telephone is a credit to America . We can not point to a single " swollen " fortune that the telephone has made . Congressman Lewis , the leader in the fight for government ownership , and a severe critic of the @#  | Bell Company , freely acknowledges that that corporation has no watered stock . According to - Arnold Bennett , the telephone expresses the American spirit more completely than any other material thing . " What strikes and frightens the backward European in the United States , " he writes , " is the efficiency and fearful universality of the telephone . . . . For me it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American people . " The American telephone system is not only the greatest of our industrial accomplishments : it is also the most modern . In any real comprehensive sense , its usefulness dates from the year 1900 . Until that time the telephone was a luxury ? the privilege of a social and commercial aristocracy . About 1900 , however , the Bell Company started a campaign , unparalleled in its energy , persistence , and success , to democratize this instrument ? to make it part of the daily life of every man , woman , and child . Statistics prove how this campaign has succeeded . In 1900 there were only 650,000 telephones in the United States . There are now 10,000,000 . We put in more new telephones every year now than we had in the whole country fourteen years ago . More than any other fact , these figures emblazon the progress the American people have made in material prosperity , enlightenment , and in all the social virtues . No Telephone in the Bank of England Nothing so distinguishes the every-day American from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly arrange their telephone figures in two classes : the United States and ? the rest of the world . This country contains nearly all of the telephones in existence ; to be exact , about seventy per cent . We have , as already said , 10,000,000 telephones ; Canada , Central America , South America , Great Britain , Europe , Asia , and Africa all combined have only about 4,000 , - 000 . In order to make an impressive showing , however , we need not include the backward peoples ; a comparison with the most  | enlightened nations emphasizes the same point . Thus New York City has more telephones than six European countries taken together ? Austria-Hungary , Belgium , Norway , Denmark , I tale , and the Netherlands . Chicago , with a population of 2,000,000 , has more telephones than the whole of France , with a population of 40,000,000 . Philadelphia , with 1,500,000 people , has more than the Russian Empire with 166,000 , - 000 . Boston has more telephones than Austria-Hungary ; Los Angeles more than the Netherlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and hotels in New York City have more instruments than the Kingdom of Greece or Bulgaria . The whole of Great Britain and Ireland has about 650,000 telephones ? about 200,000 more than the City of New York . This modern necessity has not yet penetrated some of its most venerable institutions . There is not a solitary telephone in the Bank of England ! Only a few English hotels have instruments in all the rooms ; one still pushes buttons for water , valets , and maids . Natural conditions largely explain the fact that the United States has a greater railroad mileage than European countries ; they do not explain our greater number of telephones . The countries with the densest populations should naturally have the greatest telephone equipment , for this is the ideal method of communication over short distances . On all natural grounds , therefore , Europe should have more telephones than we . Wretched Telephone Service of Europe Mere numbers , however , tell only half the story . It is when we compare service that American superiority stands most manifest . We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our facts ; Europeans , whatever their opinion of most things American , constantly praise our telephone service . Take up almost any London newspaper at the present moment ; it is filled with complaints of the wretched English service . The London Times , which . when the telephone was first introduced . denounced it as " the latest American hum-  | bug , " and said that it was far inferior to " the well established system of speakingtubes , " is now conducting a crusade for the introduction of American telephone methods . It daily publishes letters abusing and ridiculing the English system . These communications give a striking picture of telephone inefficiency . If they describe things accurately , there is apparently no telephone vexation that the Englishman does not have to endure . Delays in getting connections are apparently chronic . The operators constantly make mistakes ? give wrong numbers , cut off , and make evasive excuses . At times it seems impossible to get connections at all , especially from four to five in the afternoon ? when the operators are taking tea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds , average half an hour in London . Many of the smaller cities have no night service . The badness of the telephone service , indeed , has become a national scandal . At the moment these lines are written . a lively debate is taking place in Parliament on the English telephone system . It is chiefly useful , one speaker declares , " as a source of profitable revenue to the nerve specialist . " The burden of all the speeches is the splendid service in the United States . The newspapers have recently given considerable space to Lloyd-George 's attempt to get a trunk connection . After waiting an hour , he gave it up in despair and disgust . An American thinks nothing of putting in a telephone ; he notifies his company and in a few days the instrument is installed . We take a thing like this for granted . But there are places where a mere telephone subscription , the privilege of having an instrument installed , is a property right of considerable value , where the telephone service has a " waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , 40,000 people are at present clamoring for telephones and can not get them ; about 3,000 are added to the list every month . One can sell a telephone privilege at a good price ; its value is day quoted on the stock exchange . In France the installation of a telephone , while not so long drawn out , is a rather harrowing proceeding . The subscriber has to buy his  | own instrument ? taking his pick from a variegated assortment , some specimens resembling the affair Alexander Bell exhibited in Philadelphia in 1876 . He pays in advance for calls and telegrams , since the French government , which controls the system , never encourages trade by extending credit . When , after six or eight weeks , the connection is finally made , the subscriber 's troubles have only begun . Chambers of Commerce in several French cities have investigated conditions and aired their grievances in lengthy reports . In many places the exchanges close for lunch at the noon hour . In case of fire or sudden illness at night , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven o'clock ; an allnight service is unknown . In order to get such a night service , the merchants of Limoges recently had to pass the hat and pay for it themselves . In particular , the French complain of the long-distance service . Calling up a friend seventy-five or a hundred miles away is apparently a ceremonious proceeding . The subscriber has to notify the exchange a considerable time in advance . The operator puts down the name at the foot of a list , and makes an appointment usually several hours ahead ? sometimes for the succeeding day . Particularly energetic Frenchmen , planning a long-distance call , get up bright and early in the morning , so as to obtain a favored position , much as we get in line early for opera tickets . When he gets his " party , " he can talk for only three minutes . This rule is inexorable . When the three minutes have expired , the operator cuts him off in the middle of a sentence . If he wishes to continue the conversation , he takes his place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his turn . Efficient Germany complains of similar shortcomings . I could quote from the reports of many Chambers of Commerce specifying conditions that have no counterpart here . The Englishman Writes ? the American Telephones Americans , however , by constantly using the telephone , have developed what maybe  | called a sixth sense . They can project their personalities over an almost unlimited area . In the United States the telephone has become the one all-prevailing method of communication . The European writes or telegraphs ; the American more frequently telephones . In this country the telephone penetrates to places which even the mails never reach . The Rural Free Delivery and other forms of the mail service extend to 58,000 communities ; our 10,000,000 telephones encompass 70,000 communities . We use this instrument for all the varied experiences of life , domestic , social , commercial . There are residences in New York City that have private branch exchanges , like a bank or a newspaper office . Hostesses are more and more falling into the habit of telephoning invitations for dinner and other diversions ; the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained instantaneously . Indeed , nearly all the invitations to the latest ? White House wedding were sent via telephone . This unobtrusive instrument is making all kinds of changes in commercial life . Some one once told Edward H. Harriman that he was a slave to the telephone . " Not at all , " he answered ; " it is a slave to me . " A Railroad Saved from Bankruptcy by Telephone If his history could be written , telephonic conversations would unquestionably furnish most of the material . Mr. Harriman once dramatically saved the Erie Railroad from bankruptcy by timely use of a bedside telephone . Many people find telephone conversations more convenient than personal interviews ; it is every day displacing the stenographer and the traveling salesman . It is sometimes a simple thing to get a man 's ear at the telephone , when a business card , sent in obsequiously , is ignored . A Chicago man tells the story of taking the train to New York in order to give a certain business transaction his " personal attention . " Arriving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment . His  | friend at once plunged into a discussion of the matter at hand , and in a few seconds everything was settled . The trip from Chicago had been wasted . Another Chicagoan tells of coming to New York on a similar errand . The man he sought was so busy , however , that he could not see him . He returned to Chicago , called him up by telephone , and transacted his business in a few minutes . The use of the telephone as a selling agent is increasing every day . Practically all big stores have a telephone order department . Some have salesmen who practically never see their customers ? they call them up and offer goods over the wire . These salesmen have a list of " telephone prospects . " As soon as new stock arrives , they examine it , decide what particular customers it will appeal to , call these customers up , and discuss the matter in detail . Things like these are commonplaces ; what is not so generally understood is the extent to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural telephones are almost unknown ; here they are found everywhere . I n the United States one third of all our telephone stations are in country districts . The farmer does not depend upon the mails ; like the city man , he telephones . This instrument is thus the greatest civilizing force that we have ; for civilization is very largely a matter of intercommunication . Indeed , the telephone and other similar agencies , such as the parcel post , the rural free delivery , better roads and the automobile , are rapidly transforming rural life in this country . In several regions , especially in the Mississippi Valley , a farmer who has no telephone is in a class by himself , like one who has no mowing-machine or reaper . Thus the last returns from Iowa , taken by the census as far back as 1907 , showed that seventy-three per cent of all the farms ? 16o,000 out of 220,000 ? had telephones ; the proportion is unquestionably greater now . Abolishing the Loneliness of American Farms The telephone has removed half the terrors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife or daughter , on the approach of a suspicious-looking character , has rushed to the telephone and called up the neighbors ; so that now tramps notoriously avoid houses that shelter the protecting wires . In remote sections , insanity , especially among women , is frequently the result of loneliness . The telephone is doing much to mitigate this . Its social usefulness shows to particular advantage in the country . Women pay calls in this way . " Hogging the wire , " a common enough vice on party lines in the city , is a crying scandal on the farms . Eavesdropping is so common that it arouses practically no resentment . Some farmers ' wives sit with their ears glued to the receiver all the long , dreary afternoon , taking in all their neighbors ' secrets . In some places it is commonly remarked that one must do his talking quickly if he wishes to do it at all . If the conversation is prolonged , the voices become feebler and feebler . as one after another of the neighbors takes down his receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very literal sense . In connection with the parcel post , the telephone makes the rural family practically a part of the city . The farmer 's wife can now call up the nearest town , order hats , dress goods , and other articles of merchandise , and have them arrive the next morning by mail . Farmers Now Sell Their Products by Telephone Most important , perhaps , is the part that the telephone plays in the business of the farm . It is making the agriculturist more independent every day . It is protecting him against that great object of his detestation , the middleman . For example : this obnoxious character made his appearance the other day at an apple orchard in Vermont . After the usual preliminary skirmish , he offered the farmer $1.5o a barrel . The latter , excusing himself , called up the nearest market , and found that his apples  | were bringing two dollars . As he had five hundred barrels , this one telephone conversation netted him 1250 . This sort of thing is taking place all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . In the old days the Kansas farmer used to carry his grain into market by wagon . He would usually hang about all day , dickering with middlemen . These agile gentlemen always had him at a disadvantage . Unless he disposed of his load that day , he either had to carry it back to the farm , or stay in town , sometimes for several days , until he had disposed of it . Now he sells his product by wire , and carts it to market only when sold . In certain farming communities , at a prearranged signal ? say , three rings ? everybody on the line takes down his receiver . The man at Central reads the latest news . In one section of Idaho , a year or two ago , Central , on such an occasion as this , gave a few hours ' warning of an approaching frost . The area covered was used for growing prunes . The farmers immediately rushed out , lighted their smudge-pots , and thus saved their whole crop from freezing . Whatever attitude one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounding fact : that there is one telephone in the United States to every nine persons ; that every other farm-house from the Atlantic to the Pacific contains at least one instrument . As a masterpiece of engineering , . inventive skill , and corporate management , the world has nothing comparable with this achievement . Everywhere , twenty years ago , the crudest methods of telephone construction prevailed . Like the telegraph , the telephone economically used only one wire ? the circuit was completed by the ground . This " grounded circuit " produced maddening complications . It picked up not only the human voice , but all the murmurs , squeaks , and rumblings that go on in the earth . Now there are two separate wires in every circuit , and all the extraneous noises have disappeared .  | The switchboard then would scarcely know its successor of to-day . For nearly thirty years the Bell Company has been scrapping switchboards . The engineers have designed improvements in such rapid succession that one contrivance seemed to follow another into oblivion almost before the varnish was dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subscriber in touch with 9,600 circuits without leaving her seat , seems almost the final word ; the Bell Company has invested $20,000,000 in it . A Penniless Serb Who Became a Great Telephone Inventor One other invention has done almost as much as the switchboard in extending the telephone . This has had as romantic a life as its discoverer . The newspapers to-day are filled with the fiery excoriations of a distinguished Servian patriot ? Michael I. Pupin . Most newspaper readers know this man only as the Honorary Consul of Servia at New York , as the supposed instigator of plots against the Hapsburg dynasty , as one of the numerous exiles whose appearance on Austrian soil would unquestionably mean his immediate arrest . Probably most people wonder why the Austrian government treats Mr. Pupin with such respect , why the Austrian ambassador finds it necessary to reply to almost every Pupin interview . The reason is this : Mr. Pupin , a professor at Columbia University , is one of the greatest of American scientists and inventors . He is the man chiefly responsible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York-Denver and the New York-San Francisco line could never have been built . A single Pupin invention has made possible our modern longdistance service . And Michael Idvorsky Pupin splendidly illustrates what American opportunities can do for a European immigrant . As a boy , he arrived at Castle Garden merely a friendless member of the " horde " then beginning to pour in from southeastern Europe . He was a Serb of Hungary ? a scion of a " backward and inferior race " ? a representative of those Slavic peoples which , we have been told , can add nothing to American civilization . In his early days , according to tradition , Mr. Pupin obtained employment as a rubber in a Turkish bath . But the American educational system transformed him . He was graduated from Columbia in 1883 , and afterward studied extensively in Germany . The new subject of electro-mechanics absorbed him . In particular , he became interested in a telephone problem that had bothered the greatest experts for years . One thing had prevented the extension of the telephone ; that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 1900 , demanded wire about an eighth of an inch thick ? as thick as a fair-sized lead-pencil . The New York-Chicago line , built in 1893 , consumed 87o,000 pounds of copper wire of this size . The enormous expense stood in the way of any extended development . The same thickness also interfered with cable extension . Wires placed under the ground lose an enormous amount of their energy ; the same wire strung overhead will carry about a hundred miles to one mile if placed underground . In the early cables , therefore , the underground wires had to be very thick . Only about a hundred wires could be squeezed into one cable , against the eighteen hundred now compressed in the same area . About 1900 telephone progress was marking time , awaiting the arrival of a thin wire that would do the work of a thick one . The importance of the problem is shown by the fact that one fourth of all the capital invested in the telephone has been spent in copper . Professor Pupin , by solving this problem in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize in modern telephonic art . His researches resulted in the famous " Pupin coil , " in the expedient now known as " loading . " When the scientists attempt to explain this , they have to use all kinds of mathematical formulas and curves ? in fact , they usually get to quarreling among themselves over the points involved . What Professor Pupin has apparently done has been to free the wire from those miscellaneous disturbances known as " induction . " All kinds of influences are warring upon the electric current to deprive it of its strength . Under his system , coils , placed at regular intervals along the wires , absorb this induction , and leave the wire free to do its work . A piece of copper a sixteenth of an inch thick , therefore , does as much as the monster that was formerly required . This invention has resulted in economies that amount to tens of millions of dollars . Among its other advantages , it has made Pupin a millionaire and given him plenty of leisure to devote to is favorite pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spent on Advance Equipment These and other engineering triumphs largely explain the widespread use of the telephone in the United States . Even more , perhaps , does the policy of the Bell Company account for it . This corporation has always been militant , aggressive . It has its salesmen everywhere , pushing its business in all the large cities and in the country districts . While , in Europe , there seems to be an almost conscious attempt to discourage telephone users , the Bell Company spends millions every year advertising its wares . In one respect , the corporation has an unparalleled history ; that is in the way it prepares for the future . Our railroads are usually behind in equipment ; an enormous increase in crops and business commonly finds them seriously handicapped for handling it . But the telephone company is building years ahead . Its engineers are always anticipating future demand . At the present time , for example , the telephone business takes about 400,000 new poles a year . It has no particular difficulty in getting this material now ; twenty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted . Already , in anticipation of a possible famine , the engineers are experimenting with concrete and other substitutes . Again , the American Telephone and Telegraph Company this year has opened a new underground line extending from Boston to Washington . This represents an investment of $5,000,000 ; but it can not possibly yield any return for several years . There was already excellent overhead communication between these two points . Once in five or six years , however , a blizzard destroys the overhead line and shuts off New York from Washington . The new Washington cable protects these points from isolation-at any time . Commercially , the great expense of building it has no justification ; it represents merely an attempt at perfecting service . Similarly , no one pretends that the New York-San Francisco line will immediately " pay . " Very few people , under present conditions , could talk between these two distant points . But here again , as always , the telephone service precedes the actual use . Inevitably these new facilities will stimulate the demand . The public will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to learn to use the telephone at all . Half the cable ducts in New York , Chicago , and other large cities are at present empty . They are lying there fallow , waiting for new customers . These cities , and virtually all the rest of the country , are telephonically equipped for new business nearly twenty years ahead . The Bell corporations spend about 860,000,000 a year anticipating their future ? at least half of it from current revenue . Predicting Population Twenty Years Ahead Perhaps the most interesting telephone department is that which concerns itself with " fundamental studies . " It employs a staff of statisticians and engineers whose business it is to survey the field and determine the probable telephone demand through a series of years . This staff considers everything : the records of traffic already handled , its annual increase , the growth in population , its character , wealth , and so on . Take , for example , the hardest telephone problem of all ? the city of New York . The " fundamental studies " department has gone over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It examines the birth rate , death rate , immigration statistics , and other details ; and so appraises in general the population of 1930 . I t must also determine in what direction this population will grow : what will be the large residential , tenement , and business districts ; where will be located the great hotels , apartment-houses , and office buildings . According to these Bell " fundamental studies , " New York will have a population of 8,000,000 in 1930 . It will need 2,142,000 telephone stations ? nearly four times what it has now ? and 109 central offices . Moreover , the statisticians have decided , within the limits of human fallibility , where they will have these stations . They have selected the sites for the new central offices , plotted the new subways and cables , and have even estimated the size of the proposed switchboards . The company constructs for the future , year by year , according to these forecasts . It has tens of millions invested in equipment laid down in anticipation of the demand and immense capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains why American facilities , unlike those of other countries , are always " ready to serve .
