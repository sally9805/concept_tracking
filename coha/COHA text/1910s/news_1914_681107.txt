The man , whools 71 years old , nodded his head loosely when the judgment was announced and chuckled softly . " Why do n't you make it higher ? " he asked . " The more the merrier . " And , still laughing to himself , he was led out to the Tombs to await action by the . Grand Jury . It is more than likely , however , that the criminal proceedings against Mahoney will go no further than the filing of an indictment on Tuesday .

I was simultaneous with Detective Neun , " replied the Commissioner . - Well. all I can say is that you do n't look like the gentleman who first got me , " said the old man . He seemed satisfied with his efforts as a legal cross-examiner , and said he had no further questions to ask the witness . Deputy Police Commissioner Robert Rubin was then called . He told of his examination of Mahoney on the previous afternoon , and of the old man 's explanation of why he shot at Mayor Mitchel . Mahoney had no questions to ask this time .

Mahoney chuckled , and said : " Why do n't you make it higher . The more the merrier . " He was then led to the Tenths . After a careful investigation the police announced that they had found not the slightest corroboration of the rumor that Mahoney had acted in concert with two other men in carrying out the attempt on the life of the Mayor . Mahoney himself assured Capt . Tun/ley , whom he had made his best confidant at Police Headquarters . that there " was nothing in that at all , " and that he had acted alone . The Socialist and I. W.

Commissioner Katharine B. Davis of the Department of Correction , one of those ridiculed by Mahoney in his letter to the Mayor , told yesterday what she thought should be done with such persons as he . " We are not suffering with a lack of knowledge of what ought to be done with people like Mahoney " she said . " Some of the kind-hearted and some of those bent on vengeance , only block the way . Weak-minded men like Mahoney are easily discoverable . They ought to be locked up until we know they are ready to take their place in society as men . Mental Tests for Suspects . " We could easily extend our medical examination of school children to include a real mental test , as has been recommended . A careful mental and physical test made in our almshouses , cheap boarding houses , jails , reformatories and police stations would discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially those who should be held in safe keeping . " The cost of such procedure would be considerable , but not prohibitive . Certainly no one would begrudge millions to save our public men from assassination , and our weaklings from the commission of crime . It will even be I cheaper than present police departments , criminal courts and jails . Crime must be prevented and punishment must be made to fit the individual , not the clinic . " Those bent upon vengeance have had their way for thousands of years , except as they have ' been hindered by the kind-hearted . They have not succeeded . It is time to give those who know what to do a chance to do it . " Borough President Marks urged yesterday that the city engage nurses and a physician who might he kept within easy reach of the City Hall , and that a sort of hospital be established in the Municipal Building , from which medical aid could be summoned immdeiately .

" On reaching the plaza and learning that no physician had yet arrived to attend the wounded man I went through the crowd asking at the top of my voice if there was a physician or a surgeon present . I suppose there must have been 5,000 people around the City Hall and not a medical man among them . " Had the life of the Corporation Counsel depended upon immediate treatment by a surpeon he would have died . Asode from what happened yesterday , there Is great need of a doctor and a nurse who can be summoned immediately . We have at least 5,000 employes in the Municipal Building alone and many hundreds more in the courts and City Hall nearby . There is also between 15,000 and 20,000 people passing through the Municipal Building every day . For these reasons there ought to be a doctor and a nurse right on the ! spot when they are needed .

Brann , letters came from Pittsburgh signed David Rose , asking for remittances of money . The last 590 was sent in a certified check . but as far as Mgr . Brann could learn from his bank the check had never been cashed . The earlier ones , too , caused considerable querying from the Pittsburgh banks as to the right of Rose to collect money for Mahoney . A number of messages was received ' yesterday at the City Hall congratulating the Mayor on his narrow escape . The first one came from President Wilson .

He particularly mentioned a policeman on duty at Sixth Avenue and Forty-second Street , and he gave his number as 0,400 . Mr. Loble wrote that he had asked this policeman to direct him to a place of amusement . and he added that the policeman had taken the trouble to write down a number of such places and gave him instructions how to get to them . " I have traveled all around the world . " wrote Mr. Loble , " but never have I received such courtesy from any policeman , and for that reason my wife and I wish to , thank you .
