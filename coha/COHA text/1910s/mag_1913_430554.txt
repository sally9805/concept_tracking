 | I am near white ; that is , one of my grandfathers was altogether white , and various other ancestors on the maternal side were generously besprinkled with the blood of the salt of the earth . Consequently , I might be white if I wanted to be . And therein lies the anomaly which to the uninitiated seems strange beyond belief . It seems preposterous , in these days of race antipathy and deep-seated prejudice , that a man would willingly continue to submit to the limitations which the stigma of his race connection gives him in certain sections , when he could , if he desired , avoid them . Nevertheless there are a million or more of human beings in this great America , some as fair of face and as perfect in feature and form as the highest AngloSaxon type , who , of their own free will , submit to the restrictions which a knowledge of their race identity brings forth . I was born in the heart of the South , in a town of some two thousand , about evenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a minimum . I remember that my sister and myself used often to go and spend the night with neighboring white children of our own ages , and they , in turn , visited us on the terms of most intimate friendliness . We were the only colored children on the street for several blocks , and our family was in about the same financial circumstances as those of our neighbors . Color prejudice was unknown to us , for the primary reason , I suppose , that there was not enough color in the entire crowd to discern any difference . But the time did come when I awoke to the realization that my sister and I were different . A strange family moved into our neighborhood , a family in which there was one boy much larger and older than any of our crowd . The first evening that all the children came out on the street to play he joined us , and in our childish way we gave him a welcome . He was all right the first part of the evening , but just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all came into the crowd . Some one suggested that we have just one more game and include the girls . He stopped a moment and then said : " I do n't want to play . It 's bad enough to play with a little nigger boy , but I draw the line at playing with a little nigger girl . " And he turned and pointed at my sister . " If you leave her out I 'll play , " he said . Before he knew what had happened I struck him in the face and began to pummel him with my little fists . When he recovered from the shock , he knocked me down , and but for the other boys , who took my part , he would have beaten me badly . That broke up the evening meetings among the children and made association on the same plane of intimacy impossible thereafter . And there entered into my life the specter of race discrimination and color prejudice that never can be wholly obliterated . It is that sense that I am different , impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years went by , that keeps me here even now within the confines of a heartless discrimination , when the broad fields of opportunity in every line of endeavor beckon to me to come and lose myself across the line . And therein lies the tragedy . Therein is the reason that in America today there are one million of people who are neither white nor black and yet who are accepting , almost without protest , the ruthless discrimination laid down for those who are black . The white man is a close student of psychology and he has framed discriminating laws and Jim Crow measures in such a way as to make the individual continually declare himself to be black , no matter how white he may seem to be . In most of the Southern cities the Jim Crow street car law is effective . This law says that " white people shall seat themselves from the front end of the car and colored people from the rear . " I board a car and it becomes necessary immediately to declare voluntarily that I am a negro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing is drilled into one day after day , every way that he turns , the effect is to make it almost impossible for him ever wholly to forget that he is expected to declare himself wherever he goes , and the selfconsciousness that he has not done so  | will make him so apparently uncomfortable that every one notices and begins to wonder why . After he has gone thru this experience once or twice in endeavoring to overstep the line he makes up his mind to bear the discrimination rather than to live thru such hours of agony again . And yet there are some of us who do for a while successfully cross the line . My father 's father had left him in fairly good circumstances , and I was able to enter school early . Then , too , there is some of the pride of name and race in my makeup and I wanted to uphold my family tradition . One of my white ancestors had been a governor of Virginia , another was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature that in the county in which I was born only once in fifty years had the representative been other than a member of our white family . Consequently I applied myself diligently , and at the age of nineteen I was graduated from one of the best colleges for negroes in the South . In my freshman year my father 's death threatened for a while to hinder my plans . He had been in poor health for several years , and when they began to wind up his estate it became apparent that there would be little left for us . That summer I went East with a crowd of my fellows who worked in summer hotels as bellboys , and made enough to take them thru school the following year . The experience was new to me , this being a servant to somebody else , being at the beck and call of every coarse and vulgar nobody who had been lucky enough to be born white and get money . The first fellow that called me " George " after the fashion of the average hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my name was not George , and if he did n't feel like using my right name to leave the name off . He reported me to the head bellman , who came to me with the complaint . " Look here , " he said , " you are acting the fool . Cut this high-toned business out . If you stay here you 've got to take some of their insolence and keep your mouth shut . You wait on a man as if he was being honored by your service . Grin at him , kow-tow and be a nigger and you 'll get the money . I do n't like it myself , but 1 have to do it . " For two whole days I tried it ; I was the most menial of menials . As a matter of fact I did get the money , but the donor almost invariably flung it at me , and accompanied it with a kind of sneer that went so deep into me that at the end of two days I gave up the job . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires a young man for a few months to act as traveling companion . " I applied for the job , dressed in my best clothes , neatly groomed , and strange to say , gat the job . The old fellow seemed to take a liking to me from the start , and I made myself valuable to him in many little ways . I found out that he gave liberally to Tuskegee and to Claflin , and upon two occasions had given money to my own school . I wrote a letter to my former president , for him , expressing his high regard for the work of ? University in particular , and a deep interest in the work of negro education , in general . A few days after returning to New York we were planning a trip South . The itinerary included a stop at several of these schools and then a long stay in Florida . After I thought the matter over I decided to quit , and upon some pretense I notified him . He objected strenuously , raised my pay on the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . That encouraged me and I decided after a day or two to make a clean breast of it , tell the whole story , color and all , feeling sure that after the first disappointment he would retain me and keep my secret . Timorously broaching the subject of my nativity , I finally explained to him that I was what was ordinarily termed a negro , asserting that I had kept it secret for purely economic reasons , and had no intention nor desire to deceive him . My ! but he was furious . Before I had finished speaking , I saw his color come and go and his underlip twitch . I knew that he was greatly excited . Suddenly arising from his seat he snatched my hat from my hands and deliberately kicked it out of the window . " Now you follow that hat , " he said , " and do n't you ever put foot in here again . " He laid stress on the " ever " and it took me no long time to obey .  | It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy to me . One was the superintendent of schools in a certain eastern city . He tried to persuade me to stay North , offering to secure work for me in his system . The other was a physician who tried to show me the futility of always being colored . " You stay out here , boy , " he said , " and become a white man . " His argument was strong and the temptation great , but the training of my missionary school prevailed and I went South again . My experience in public places where the line is drawn has been interesting . One morning I ate breakfast in a Seventh avenue restaurant in New York . That afternoon , in company with some darker friends , I again sought the restaurant , whose service and prices had appealed to me . Waiter after waiter sailed past us unnoticing , until , at length , when I urged them to serve us , I was met with smiling excuses , " Busy now , " " Just a minute , " " These ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat and watched and saw others come in , get served and go out , but never did we get ours . I have been served in white soda fountains in the South , traveled in sleeping cars and stopped at some of the best hotels in one southern state , not because I craved the so-called equality they gave , but because they were convenient and comfortable and I had the money to pay my way . I have never been challenged , altho upon one occasion I was conscious of my being discust . I would take a chance with a white man where I would not dare do so with a colored man . Inevitably a colored man knows but usually keeps his mouth shut , aided by a generous tip . But a white man fears to insult another in the South , and when in doubt , he lets you alone . As witness this case : I entered the registration office , together with my business associate who was very colored. to register , shortly before election time . On the stub , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored ) , on my certificate he placed " W " ( white ) . The man had really been afraid to ask my color for fear of offending me . For a long time I bought my morning and evening cigar from the druggist on the corner near my house . I was always neatly and quietly dressed , I bought a fairly good brand of cigars , and he assumed that I was white . One day as I took some papers out of my purse he caught sight of my name . Ever after that he would speak pleasantly to me , addressing me as Mr. Blank , and seemed to endeavor to cultivate my acquaintance . I did n't encourage his advances , but at the same time treated him courteously , and we got along well together . When I went in one day he did n't come to wait on me , but sent his clerk . Instinctively I knew something was wrong . I continued to buy my cigars there , and his grinning clerk continued to wait on me . One day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I pointed to my brand in silence , handed over my money and walked toward the door . Hearing a peculiar noise behind me I turned and found him following me stammering out my name . " Well ? " I said . He stopped , confused . " Er ? er ? I wanted to say , that er ? I did n't know you were a n ? , or that you were not a white man until a few days ago . I 've known you for a long time , and I 've appreciated your patronage . You have always been a gentleman , and I have always thought of you as Mr. Blank . Since I found that out I tried to dissociate you from that term , and I ca n't do it . I do n't think that I could ever call you anything else . I wish you would buy your cigars somewhere else , for I shall be obliged to wait on you sometimes , and I might sometime call you Mister . " It is amusing whenever they assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somehow , despite the fact that there is such a large number of " fair colored people " the majority of white people never get accustomed to it . I board the street car and take a seat in the rear , and unless I have been on that particular line often before , the conductor steps up and touches me on the arm , informs me that this end is for " niggers " and I will have to move up front . Or perhaps it is some member of my own race , who begins to mutter , wondering " why he does n't go up front where he belongs . " We are between two fires , the sneers and jibes of our own people , who take pleasure in saying " Oh , he looks white , but he 's a nigger just like I am , " and the sneer of the white man  | when he finds that he is mistaken and says , " I did n't know that you were a nigger . " There is only one thing that saves me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun out of it . My sense of humor has helped me many a time . And now I have somehow come to enjoy the experience of being anything I wish whenever I wish . I am a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . I can ride in Pullman cars in the heart of the South , have my lunch in the best restaurant on my route , and stop for the night , as I have done , at the Piedmont Hotel , or the Desoto , or the Hermitage , and then when I am tired of being among strange folks I can go down on Auburn avenue , in Atlanta , or Lawton avenue , in St. Louis , and be a negro just as long as I choose . Sometime I shall possibly decide to be one or the other for all time , but just now the game is too interesting . There is only one privilege which is now denied to me . I can not accompany many of the girls of my set in the various places where I find my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a large number of them are not able to " pass " successfully . One of the most humiliating experiences that ever befell me was in the company of a very estimable young lady of whom I thought a great deal , and who was of the complexion known as brown . I had called to see her one afternoon in midsummer , and we went for a car ride . Returning we had transferred at one of the most crowded corners in the city . As we crost the street to get our car , I noted the eyes of many people upon us . When we stopped on the other side of the street it became apparent to us both that we were being deliberately stared at . I tried to relieve the embarrassment by beginning a conversation . " I told you he was with her . " I heard someone say . " Aw well , s'pose he is , he 's a nigger , " was the reply . At which the other sniggled . " Well , if he is , he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel where I work , " was the answer . " Any way that girl is the most brazen one I 've seen in many a day , and she belongs to one of our best families . " I never found that young lady " at home " after that afternoon . That incident taught me a lesson that I have never been able fully to forget . Consequently I have denied myself since then the pleasure of escorting an unmistakably colored young lady out anywhere unless there is a party of three or four . It is n't just to the girl . In Chicago , New York , St. Louis , and elsewhere , I have friends whom I know no more , who are really dead to me and to my friends , for they have crost over to the " other side . " We see them and we see them not , for we understand . Some of them arise to great prominence in their work , and achieve a degree of success that they could not attain if their race were known . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who is now a high official in a corporation that controls its line of business and that is generally referred to as the " Trust . " Yet sometimes we hear that one has lost his or her job because somebody " turned them up . " It is a great risk , and they live in almost daily fear of exposure . But on the other hand there is usually some special advantage which they seek that leads them to this course , or some internal pressure that drives . But the majority of us live out our lives in the ordinary way , mixing with the fellows of our kind , passing on to them the advantages which we occasionally receive , and serving as a bulwark and as a barrier of protection to them . Occasionally we cross the line , but the call of the blood , the inherent love for the weak , and the sympathy for the under dog draws us back . Then , too , our life is not lonely . It does not mean solitude nor dreariness to be a negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find companionship and good cheer , room to labor and to love . But for the occasional outbreaks against the race , and the inconveniences of travel , I had rather be a negro here in the dawn of the future of his rise than to be at the pinnacle and the summit of a splendid glory . For you there is no problem , no work , no future greatness , your glory is now , and behind you ; our goal , our hope , our glory is of that which is to be , and which we can now but faintly see .
