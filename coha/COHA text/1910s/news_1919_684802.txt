txt The Attorney General announces that the Government will not prosecute appeals from the decrees recently entered in favor of defendants in the cases brought by the United States against the Southern Pacific and others to set aside patents to lands in California on the ground that the lands were known to contain oil when the patents were procured . The principal case , known as Civil No. 46 , was commenced in 1912 . The other cases were subsequently commenced . All of the cases were consolidated for trial and a vast amount of evidence , in which there were many conflicts , was taken on the issue whether the company officials had knowledge of the mineral character of the lands at the time patents were issued . The trial court found squarely against the contention of the Government on the facts , and it is believed by the Attorney General that this finding would not be disturbed on appeal . The Elk Hills case recently decided by the Supreme Court in favor of the Government involved facts which differed widely from those presented in these cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. District Court at Los Angeles rendered a decision in favor of the defendant companies in August last . Thy suit , a consolidation of six original actions , involved title to about 161,000 acres of land , of which about 26,000 acres have been disposed of by the Southern Pacif$ , leaving about 135,000 acres as the property of the Southern Pacific or subsidiaries . Under the rules of procedure in the Federal courts , the Government would have until March 1 to file its appeal . The Washington announcement does not make clear whether the Attorney General purposes to file a declaration with the court of his intention not to appeal , or will merely allow the time for an appeal to elapse without acting .
