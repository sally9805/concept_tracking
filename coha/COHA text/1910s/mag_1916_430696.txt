 |p505  I. CONDITIONS OF GERMAN SUCCESS RARELY in the course of the war has vthere been a prompter or more completely successful answer to a hostile combination than that by which Germany in October restored the balance in the Balkans and made her newest enemy , Rumania , feel the weight of her sword . Not since the campaign through Serbia , a year ago , has Germany been able to score a triumph as impressive as that won in Transylvania , although the later success still falls far short of the Serbian achievement . The conditions of German action were plain . The sudden intervention of Rumania had not alone opened a new front , extended greatly the lines of the Central Powers , required new armies and new arrangements , it had raised political questions of the gravest sort . Most important of these was the Hungarian problem . Of a sudden the Magyars found their own lands invaded , Transylvania , their dearest province , overrun , the integrity of the Hungarian kingdom threatened . This condition provoked bitter outcry at Budapest , and instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Hungary had demanded of Germany that the Russians be thrown back across the Carpathian passes in the first days of 1915 , she now demanded that a new German effort be made to clear Transylvania . And the complaints and demands of Budapest made a loud noise in Berlin . The one race in all the Austro-Hungarian nationalities , whose soldiers had won German approval , whose loyalty and sacrifices had been beyond cavil , was able to draw on a balance in the German capital , accumulated over the years of the war . But it was not alone Hungary that clamored ; the Bulgarian situation was even more critical , for the very existence of Bulgaria , caught between the millstones of Rumanian armies on the north and Allied armies at Salonica , was at stake . There was a real peril for Germany in the opening hours of the Rumanian crisis , lest Bulgaria take the proffered bribes of the enemies of Germany and change sides . Turkey , too , moved restlessly in the presence of a possible isolation from her great allies . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike at once , and to strike a blow that should relieve the Hungarians , by clearing Transylvania . It was necessary to reassure and re-enthuse the Bulgarians by removing an immediate danger and providing new causes for national satisfaction over the German alliance . It was further incumbent upon Germany to insure the safety of the life-line that bound Constantinople to Vienna and to Berlin . This was the German problem . This was the problem that her enemies believed beyond her resources . She had to create , or at the least , provide , new armies . She had to undertake suddenly a very considerable campaign , and pending the moment when she could get new armies into the field and at the danger point , she had to use the meager resources at hand in such fashion as to delay Rumanian and Russian advance , prevent its achieving any decisive success that could not be abolished when at last Germany had organized her counterstroke . All this was accomplished in shining fashion . It was accomplished without any apparent weakening of the German lines in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at a slow and practically unaccelerated pace . Further , it was accomplished without offering to Russia any new chance to attack along the wide front from the Baltic to the Carpathians ; without weakening the armies before Sarrail in Macedonia ; without crippling the armies which faced Cadorna from the Lago di Garda to the Carso Plateau . For what Germany accomplished before her new enemies could deal a fatal blow , even if , as is by no means certain , her counterblow has now , on October 20 , reached its maxi/ mum , no praise can be too high . On the other hand , it is necessary to note that once more there were signs of a fatal lack of coordination in Allied general staffs . II . IN THE DOBRUDJA When I closed my review last month , the first step in the German countermove was just becoming plain . Between the Danube and the Black Sea , in the Southern Dobrudja , the region taken from Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War , Mackensen was striking north . His objective was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the Danube , but this was highly doubtful , given the military obstacle of the broad river . It seemed more likely that his objective was the Bucharest-Constanza railroad , which crosses the Danube by the famous Cernavoda Bridge , the only bridge spanning the river between the Black Sea and Belgrade . His purpose seemed to be to reach this railroad line , seize this bridge , and cut off Rumania from the sea . Back of this local purpose , as I pointed out a month ago , was the larger strategic purpose of compelling the Rumanians to draw out of Transylvania the mass of their armies , which had rushed into their " lost province " as the French had piled over into Alsace and Lorraine in the first days of the war . Success in this venture would at one time restore a province to Hungary and regain for the Bulgarians a district lost by them in the fatal conflict of 1913 . Mackensen did not reach the BucharestConstanza railroad . At the moment when these lines are written he is materially south of the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did realize his larger purpose . Rumanian troops were hurried south out of Transylvania , and the invasion of the Hungarian lands was delayed and thrown into confusion . At the same time , the conquest of the Dobrudja served to fire Bulgarian enthusiasm anew and promptly destroy all possible chance that Bulgaria would desert the Central Powers , who had now aided Ferdinand to regain , not merely all that had been lost in the Second Balkan War , but Monastir , and the Macedonian districts , which had never been occupied by Bulgarian troops in the recent war with Turkey . In examining this exploit we touch upon the first of the several obscure details , which are already arousing speculation and criticism in Allied quarters . It is asserted , with some show of authority , that the Rumanian adventure into Transylvania was in direct conflict with the advice of the Allies . It is asserted that at the final moment , after long hesitation , Rumania acted so precipitately that Russia was unable to get her troops up in time to support Rumania in the Dobrudja . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moment , but , it is also asserted , that conditions existed there which were fatal to prompt and effective cooperation between Sarrail 's army and other armies now operating in the Balkans . Conceivably the Rumanians were led into Transylvania by sentiment . Certainly sound strategy would seem to have demanded that they first deal with the Teuto-Turk-Bulgar  |p507  army in the Dobrudja , the single army in being at the moment . Defeat here would have been fatal to Bulgaria , would have isolated Turkey , and opened the way for communication between Salonica and Bucharest across Bulgaria and a redeemed Serbia . In the larger strategy of the war this would have far outweighed any spectacular success in Transylvania . But the Rumanians went into Transylvania . Mackensen gathered up the six or seven divisions of troops at hand , mainly Bulgarian , with a division or two of Turks and a complement of German and Austrian heavy artillery , pushed up and took Turtukan , and Silistria , gathered up several Black Sea towns , came within an ace of getting across the vital railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when Rumanian troops were recalled from Transylvania and Russian divisions began at last to arrive . At the outset , moreover , there seem to have been only two Rumanian divisions before his seven , and one of these was captured in Turtukan , the other routed about Silistria . By the first days of October , Mackensen had done his work and was entrenching far within Rumanian territory between the sea and the Danube . III . IN TRANSYLVANIA Meantime , the Rumanians , having at the outset of the war ( before the declaration , the Germans assert ) flowed over into Transylvania , had cut deep into the semicircle of that province , which is held in the embrace of the two Rumanian provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia . A line drawn straight from the point where Bukovina , Transylvania , and Rumania meet to the town of Orsova on the Danube will show approximately the extent of the Rumanian advance . Kronstadt , Hermannstadt , and a score of less important towns had fallen ; at its high-water mark the Rumanian invasion had swept in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dobrudja attack began to draw off Rumanian troops . The invasion failed to reach the line of the made stretch of the Maros river , to gain control of the strategic points necessary to the defense of the conquered territory . Now , at last , a new force intervened . Falkenhayn , former chief of the German Great General Staff , appeared in Transylvania with a great German army , and signalized his entrance as a field general by winning a great victory about Hermannstadt , which freed this city from Rumanian forces and opened the collapse of Rumanian invasion . We do not know from what direction Falkenhayn drew his forces . Yet information reaching me from Germany points to the probability that he was placed in command of a great army which had been prepared to deal a counterstroke against the Russians in Galicia . Apparently the Germans had been accumulating munitions and organizing army corps to strike back in the field where the Russians had won their great triumph in the early summer , abolish the menace to Lemberg and , in some measure at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At all events , in a period of time that seems now incredibly short , Falkenhayn appeared with his great army , struck the Rumanians , already weakened by the drafts sent off to face Mackensen , defeated them and pushed them south through the Red Tower Pass , and later through the Predeal Pass south of Kronstadt right across the Rumanian frontier . German official reports announced the rout of two Rumanian armies , and the capture of vast supplies and many guns , but of surprisingly few prisoners . By October 15 the Rumanian invasion had gone the way of the French dash into Lorraine in August , 1915 . The question that remained to be decided , and is still open when these lines are written , is whether Rumania can stay the invasion at the frontier as the French halted the Germans who had won the Battle of Metz on the eastern side of Nancy . Look at the map and you will see that Falkenhayn south of Hermannstadt and Kronstadt , Mackensen southwest of Bucharest and in the Dobrudja , are little more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rumanian province of Wallachia ; and if they should march toward each other , they might hope to meet at Bucharest , the Rumanian capital . Such a victorious thrust ? double thrust , it would be ? would , in addition to taking the Rumanian capital , cut the Rumanian kingdom in half , isolate and doom to capture all the Rumanian troops west of the capital , and put the Central Powers in possession of at least half of the whole country . As I write these lines the world has just read with amazement the appeal of King Ferdinand of Rumania to his allies to save Rumania from the fate of Belgium ; and Russian troops and French generals are reported  |p508  as rushing to Rumanian aid . We can see the greatness of the peril that threatens this easternmost of the Latin states , but we can not measure the gravity of the situation because we do not know the actual condition of the Rumanian armies . If they have not lost their morale , they should be able to hold the mountain passes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed , we shall soon see the Germans approach Bucharest , as they have approached and occupied Brussels and Belgrade . As it stands , Rumania has lost the glittering prize for which she risked war . Assuredly there never was a more dramatic change in a single month nor a more complete revenge than that of the Germans . IV . SARRAIL 'S DIFFICULTIES When Rumania entered the war it was generally believed that the Allied army before Salonica would take advantage of the opportunity to press north into Macedonia and to strike for the Berlin-Constantinople railroad , which crosses Serbia . It was supposed that Sarrail had a vast army equipped and ready for the auspicious moment which had now arrived . To the amazement of the world , there was no considerable activity in Macedonia . The Serbs were pushed up toward Monastir and almost reached this town . The British got across the Struma and approached Seres . The Italians began to advance from Valona across Northern Epirus , ousting Greek garrisons as they passed . But there was no sudden , heavy , successful northward push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of it . Indeed , the coming of winter seems destined to close the Balkan passes before Sarrail can now hope to cross them and reach Uskub and Nish . What is the explanation of this new failure ? The most satisfactory answer I can give is found in the bitter words of Dr. Dillon , the best informed of writers in English upon the Balkans . In the October number of the Fortnightly Review he says : Everyone knows how unwilling certain powers were to provide him ( Sarrail ) with the wherewithal for the offensive . Only quite recently Great Britain consented to the proposal that the indispensable supplies should be transported , and ' very few people are cognizant of the heterogeneous army there to-day , from the point of view of munitions , health , and means of locomotion . Sarrail 's critics are numerous and severe , but whatever strictures the present state of things , including his inactivity , may seem to call for , should be directed to those who , despite reiterated appeals , telling arguments , and friendly suasion , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surrounded by covert enemies and paid spies . When the history of the Salonica Expedition is written it may wreck the writer 's reputation for veracity , so incredible are the denseness , obstinacy , and scorn of logic and common sense which it will reveal . Here , as I read it , is a very frank statement that the responsibility for the failure of Sarrail to act at the decisive moment , when action might have repaired the whole Balkan mess of a year ago , rests with the British and flows from a refusal to give Sarrail the proper resources to enable him to make the best of a golden opportunity . Apparently there is no limit to the capacity of the British to blunder in the Near East . British stupidity cost Serbia her liberty ; the unspeakable folly of British field command lost all the great chances to win in Gallipoli ; Sir Edward Grey 's handling of the Balkan situation completed the ruin of Serbia , and in/ sured the disaffection of Greece . As for Kut-el-Amara and the Mesopotamian mess , the-truth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has amounted to a national scandal . I have a very well-informed correspondent who from time to time writes to me to say : " I am afraid of Sarrail ; he is a political general . He will make a great blunder yet . " All the evidence at hand seems to point to a blunder . There has been , so far , a great failure ? this is clear , even if the situation shall be repaired presently . But the blame , up to date , seems to rest with the British , with those responsible for transport , rather than with Sarrail . The Serbian successes about Monastir have made considerable noise in the press , but they are really of small consequence . The Serbs have just got their feet on their own soil , that is all . They have fought well , but the main thrust in the Balkans , if there is a main thrust , will not be made by Serbians ; and its chances of success this year grow smaller as each week brings winter closer to the Balkans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A month ago even the Greek King seemed on the point of following the example of his brother sovereign of Rumania . But the fortunate moment , for the Allies , passed , and Constantine promptly sat back again upon the fence of neutrality , from which he had almost been lifted down . His conviction that Germany would win the war had a new confirmation , and his neutrality was fortified by Rumanian misfortunes . Thereupon Venizelos left Athens , joined the pro-Allied leaders in that New Greece which he had won for his sovereign , proclaimed a rival government to which Crete , the islands of Egean and Greek Macedonia declared their adhesion , and proceeded to Salonica to organize a Greek force to participate in the war . Promptly thereafter the Allied commander in Greece took drastic steps to dispose of the peril of a pro-German rising in his rear . An ultimatum was delivered to the Athens government demanding the surrender of all Greek warships , the control of Greek railroads and telegraphs . The ports of Greece , notably the Piraeus , the port of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers undertook the operation of the railroad going from Athens to the old Greek frontier above Larissa and destined shortly to bind Salonica to the capital . The single explanation of this drastic action was found in the hint that Constantine had prepared to withdraw from Athens up the Larissa railroad , entrench himself , with such troops as remained loyal , and await a German relief force coming south from Monastir . At all events , it is clear that the Allies , long suspicious of the Hellenic monarch , were at last convinced that there was no possibility of enlisting him as an ally , and proceeded to render him innocuous as a possible foe .  |p510  To all suggestions coming from the Greek King as to possible rewards for Greek participation , the Allies remained deaf as they equally declined to recognize or deal with Constantine 's ministers . Unmistakably they are preparing to deal with Venizelos as the real ruler of Greece . But even to him it is doubtful if the Allies will now offer anything beyond a guarantee of the integrity of the Greek state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways Greece has suffered or is suffering almost as much through neutrality as Serbia and Belgium have suffered through participation in the war . A Bulgarian invasion has laid waste to one province and Bulgars remain in occupation . The Germans have kidnapped one army corps , and the Italians have ousted the Greek troops guarding that Northern Epirus that Greece has hoped to annex with the consent of the great powers . To all intents and purposes , most of Greece is now actually under military rule , mainly the rule of the Allies ; but Kavala and Drama are in Bulgar hands . Her fleet has been dismantled and Allied support of Venizelos threatens a civil war . As for parliamentary government , this was abolished by the King himself , long ago , as a detail in his frantic campaign to keep his country out of war , either through fear or love of Germany . As to the future , it is clear that if Rumaniasuffers a Serbian fate , the King 's hold upon his people will be strengthened ; but failing this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not difficult to see that Venizelos will presently gain control of the capital , as he now has control of the islands and the Macedonian districts , and in such an event there is every reason to believe that Constantine will lose his throne and that his people will make him a scapegoat , seeking to propitiate Allied anger by throwing over the monarch mainly responsible for the direction Greek policy has followed during the war . VI . THE LOST CHANCE In sum , then , the Allies seem to have lost the greatest chance that the war has yet offered them to settle the Eastern Question after their own plans by isolating Turkey from her greater allies . Conceivably the tide will turn in the next weeks , and the opportunity once missed may return . But , barring this contingency , it must be recognized that the Allies have suffered a very considerable defeat , which has already had unhappy consequences in Athens and may bear even bitterer fruit at Bucharest . Equally necessary is it to recognize that Germany has given a crushing answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the limit of her resources . For a new peril she has found fresh- defenses . Against a new enemy she has sent fresh troops who have won great successes , and may yet dispose of this enemy as Serbia and Belgium ' were disposed of in 1914 and 1915 . Yet in all this it is essential not to overlook the other side of the picture . Germany certainly had a great army in reserve . But the army was designed to restore the situation in the East , not in Transylvania ; and victories won along the Transylvanian Alps do not take the place of prospective victories in Galicia . Germany has met and halted a new enemy . She may presently dispose of this new enemy 's military power . But in doing this she has used up one more army , in part at least . It may well be that , in inviting German wrath , Rumania has taken a blow designed for Russia ; but if this be the case Russia has escaped and the situation for Germany has to this extent worsened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , successful as it has been . And even the conquest of Rumania would still leave Germany worse off than two months ago , for there will still have been opened a new front , from Bukovina to the Black Sea , which would have to be defended by German and Austrian troops against Russia , if not against Rumania . Germany is engaged in an endurance test with a coalition of nations collectively far stronger than herself and those states which are standing with her . German success , now , is predicated upon a victorious resistance to superior numbers and a continued occupation of the territories which she took early in the war . Outnumbered , she must make the cost of advance so heavy for her Russian , French , British , and Italian foes that they will presently find that they can not pay the price . But , when Germany has to send troops against Rumania and incur new casualties and use up more ammunition against this new foe , she is weakened with regard to her other enemies . A campaign against Rumania that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army into Russia or even annihilated the military force of Rumania . would not be a gain for Germany over her GERMANY STRIKES RUMANIA AND SAVES THE BALKANS 511 of the Somme offensive and October 1 , British official reports acknowledge casualty lists amounting to materially more than 300,000 . With the great struggle in Picardy continuing and apparently destined to continue , the British must foresee a continued loss of above 100,000 a month . In the face of this Lloyd George 's words take on a new meaning . Parliament met under the influence of the words of Lloyd George and they were echoed by the Prime Minister himself , who appeared for the first time since the death of his own son , killed on the field of battle . That the present British determination is to fight to a finish can not be mistaken . As for France , she has never wavered and those who return from Paris tell me that a conviction that victory is now within reach , if still far in the future , dominates French thought and explains French opinion . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no new offer of peace , no reassertion of peace terms , based upon that " map of Europe , " mentioned some months ago . But if one Socialist member attracted world-wide attention by declaring that the French censor prevented the French people from knowing that they could have peace on the basis of the map of 1914 , on the basis of before-thewar conditions , this view found ready denial from all the really influential groups and nowhere in the utterances that marked the first sessions of the Reichstag was there any real hint that Germany , that the men who control Germany , were prepared to offer the evacuation of conquered territories as a basis for peace negotiations . On the contrary , the Rumanian victories and the continued failure of the French and British to pierce the German lines seemed to have inspired new confidence and new hope , if not of the victorious peace expected in 1915 , at least of a peace in which Germany would find herself in some measure remunerated for her vast sacrifices . The simple truth seems to be that Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truce or ask for an end of the war on unfavorable terms , while her foes are sufficiently encouraged by the events of the summer to be prepared to continue through another year a war , a struggle , the end of which they are now satisfied will be a complete triumph and a peace which will guarantee the things for which they believe that they are fighting . Actually the prospects of peace have not seemed darker at any situation while Rumania was neutral , but a loss , measured by exactly the number of men and the amount of ammunition expended in this triumph , because in these respects she would be weakened in her combat against her main foes . In a war of attrition , such as the present conflict has become , it is the death-lists that count ; and Rumania , even though the cost may be terrific to her , has weakened Germany by opening a new death-list . German victories against Rumania will doubtless do much to encourage the German and Austrian , as well as the Hungarian , Bulgarian , and Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just being offered to the people . But unless they discourage France , Russia , Italy , or Britain sufficiently to lead one of these nations to leave the fight , they do not permanently strengthen Germany , but , rather , they weaken her by exactly the amount they cost her . For this the chastisement of Rumania is no recompense , however it may gratify German indignation and Austrian wrath . VII . PROSPECTS OF PEACE And that recent events have given any sign of a desire for peace on conditions now attainable in any Allied nation , I do not think will be asserted anywhere . On the contrary there has recently come from Lloyd George a memorable interview , setting forth the new determination of the British people to go forward and expressing that sentiment which is generally recognized to have become predominant in Great Britain recently . In this interview Lloyd George made use of those sporting similes that are familiar to the simplest of Britons and in the words of the prize-ring described Britain as a contestant , who had suffered long through inferior preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many marks , having avoided . the knockout when it threatened , was now convinced that victory was attainable and determined to seek a decision and a knockout , was resolved to fight a " finish fight . " No public utterance since the war began , not even the eloquent words of the French Premier on several occasions , has carried such instant and complete conviction . Even in Germany , as I am informed by one lately returned from Berlin , the interview made a sensation because it carried conviction and banished fond hopes . In the three months between the opening  |p512  moment since the war broke out than they appear in the twenty-seventh month of conflict . VIII . ON THE SOMME It remains now to discuss briefly the progress of the Allied offensive on the Somme . Since I last wrote there has been material progress , more than has been made in any other four weeks since the July drive which opened the battle . Were the British to advance as far in the next four weeks as they advanced in the last they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French are already east of Peronne along the Bethune highway north of that town . In one great joint attack the British and French together took Combles , the British at last seized Thiepval , which had so long held them up , and the French made progress eastward to and across the Bethune highway about Rancourt . Five thousand prisoners were taken in this single venture and a number of guns , many of them of large caliber . We may say , then , that the Somme offensive , now in its fourth month , is being pressed with greater vigor and more success than in the period following the first days . This is in strong contrast to the Verdun operation of the Germans , which never showed any great driving power after the first great rush in the last week of February . As it stands , the Somme drive has resulted in a gain of twice as much ground and , the capture of twice as many prisoners and more than twice as many guns ( 500 , to quote official figures ) as the Verdun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it equals the Lorraine contest in time . In the past month many assertions , patently extravagant , have been put forth on both sides to prove the cost of the Somme battle . The Germans allege that the cost to the Allies has been a round million . French and British figures claimed a total German loss of around 600,000 , including nearly 100,000 prisoners . Now we know that the French concede a loss of 250,000 at Verdun , while the Germans admit to a casualty-list a little larger , and about half that mentioned in French official estimates of German loss at Verdun . Finally the British officially admit a loss in three months of fighting , mainly at the Somme , of above 300,000 . If the French and German losses were equal at Verdun , then there is no reason why , in a similar operation on the Somme , there should be any striking difference between the cost of attack and defense . But there is no escape from the conclusion that the Germans have underestimated their Verdun losses , and neutral observers agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 500,000 , or at a ratio of two to one , compared with the French . Accepting this estimate as a basis of computation , it is reasonable to conclude that the Germans have not lost more than half as many men as the Allies at the Somme . As the British have lost 300,000 on their own statement , in three months , they will hardly have lost less than 400,000 at the end of this month . The French loss has been very much smaller , probably not more than 100,000 . As against this the German loss has been , at the very least , 250,000 . If the capture of Germans continues at its present rate to the end of the month , there will be a total bag of above 80,000 , or more than twice as many as the Germans took at Verdun . Conceivably , therefore , the German loss at the end of the month will be around 300,000 , as contrasted with a British loss of 400,000 and a French loss of more than 100,000 . Now , putting the Somme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the West the Germans have lost in the two chief engagements between 750,000 and 800,000 men ; that the British have lost 400,000 , and the French between 350,000 and 400,000 . But the noteworthy thing . is that while the total losses on either side have been approximately equal , which might be expected , the whole loss on one side has been borne by the Germans , while it has been about equally divided on the other . And allowing for German losses in the East , where the fighting has been very severe , it is hard to see how the total losses of Germany in - the present year can be figured at less than 1,000,000 . If you say that while the British have been losing 400,000 men , the French 400,000 men , the Russians something less than 400,000-that is , the Russian armies fighting Germans ? the Germans have alone lost a million , you will say what the Allied critics are saying , when they talk about the effect of a war of attrition upon Germany . Now , turning to Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners , almost all Austrian , have been taken in the East , while the Italians announce 30,000 prisoners since they began their Gorizia drive , all of them Austrian ; and even the Rumanians count 15,000 prisoners , chiefly Austrian . We may say that Austria has lost 350,000 men by capture , her Trentino and Gorizia defeats cost her at  |p513  page deleted  |p514  German score , we may put the remaining 600,000 against the Austrian . Italian losses in the same time must have been at least 150,000 . The losses of Austria in battle with the Italians and Russians was thus 750,000 , and the losses of the Russians and Italians combined equally large , but divided between two nations . Now if you look at the population of Russia , France , Britain ; and Italy on the one hand , and of Germany and Austria on the other , you can easily discover why the loss of 1,750,000 to the latter alliance is more serious than the loss of a large number divided as we have divided it ? 400,000 British , 400,000 French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing alliance . And the Austro-German alliance has suffered a greater permanent loss , because of its casualties nearly one-third , 550,000 to be exact , have been in prisoners , while the Allied loss in prisoners has not been more than a quarter as large , including the first Verdun bag . IX . POUNDING The Somme operation is essentially a pounding operation . It has for its main object to kill Germans rather than to retake French territory . It is founded upon the conviction of the Allies that the Germans are beginning to lack numerical strength and that they will not permanently be able to hold lines as extended as they now occupy . Incidentally , the Allies are gaining small particles of French territory , and they may soon be able to force the Germans to shorten their lines materially . Even from German statements it is plain that the eventual surrender of both Bapaume and Peronne is now recognized as probable ; but these withdrawals may have little meaning , beyond the relinquishment of small areas terribly devastated . The true measure of Allied success must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reserves of the two alliances . If the Germans are compelled to fight Russian , French , and British armies at one time and thus suffer casualties from all three fights , casualties borne by Germans alone , while those of the enemies are divided , then , although the total German casualties may be smaller , the drain on German resources of man-power will be far greater , and the hour of exhaustion will be reached much earlier . And when the Rumanians came in they added one more strain on German manpower . Unless all signs fail , this pounding is going to be continued right through the winter and through the following summer . The cost to the Germans will rather mount than diminish as the Allied armies increase in numbers and munitionment , as they are likely to increase in the case of the Russians and the British ; the French will not increase in numbers , but only in artillery strength . We are likely to see the British losses increase and the French diminish , for the British have so far lost not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a materially larger male population . We shall probably see the British take over a new section of the western front before many months . Henceforth the main burden on the west must be borne by the British , and the heavier losses will fall to their share , for the French have done more than their part . If you think of Germany in terms of a contestant in a relay race , with her rivals putting in a fresh runner at each heat ? now French , now Russian , and last of all British ? while the German runner has to make the whole course alone , you will exactly catch the idea that is in the Allied mind and the basic principle of Allied strategy . We do not know the present state of German man-power . We do not know what reserves remain ; but we have just seen in the Rumanian case that Germany has been able to put in a new army without weakening her other fronts visibly . This would seem to indicate that German exhaustion has not become absolute , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know that Germany had less men to start with than her enemies ; that her losses by comparison with those of Russia or of Britain have been disproportionately high , regard being had for the total of available man-power , while they have been about equal ? equal in percentage , I mean ? to the French . As for Austria , her losses as compared with Italian have been enormous , and her existing resources can not be larger than those of Italy alone , without regard to Russia . We may have a whole year of pounding before there is any real evidence of exhaustion ; conceivably more , although this is unlikely , but the inexorable logic of a war of attrition must not be mistaken , and the attention of observers should not be distracted from this sordid detail by any brilliant strategic combination which wins a local triumph against a new foe at the cost of another set of casualties , which must hasten the day of ultimate exhaustion .                @ @ @ @ @
