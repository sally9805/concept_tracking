txt The plan of the Ford Motor Company to distribute $10.000,000 of profits among its 26,000 employes during the current year and the failure of the City of Chicago to receive any contractor 's bid for the construction of its $131,000,000 subway were among the news announcements made in yesterday 's TIMES , and , it happened , in adjoining columns . The difference between vate industrial freedom and the bondage of public regulation could not be more impressively presented . The Ford Company , a private corporation . is making z.o much money that it fairly shovels its gains out in largess to employes , while the City of Chicago . by imposing conditions which compel the contractor to recover his entire investment out of excess profits over and above interest and other charges in a twentyyear period of oper. tion including the four or five years spent in construction , effectually scares away all bidders . Of these two policies , the public and the private . it may be said . that one has failed already , and that the other is almost certainly foredoomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Company is distinctly utopian and runs dead against all experience . The movement for the bettering of society need not be universal , in their opinion , " we think that one concern can " make a start and create an " example for other employers . That " is our chief object . " They make the pace hard for " other employers , " for there are mighty few industries in the country that can make up a payroll upon the basis of $5 a day as a minimum wage , even if that minimum be paid to the man who sweeps the floor . The manufacturing industries of the country can not follow an example which requires an eight-hour day and . a standard of wages that from the scant outlines of the Ford Motor Company 's plan seems to be approximately double the prevailing rate . ' Under the operation of general laws trade seeks its level almost as certainly as water . The exceptions , ' the " peaks " here and there , are rare , artificially maintained , and the invariable tendency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law was seen yes- terday when 10,000 men struggled or actually fought around the works of the Ford Company at Detroit , clamoring for jobs . The man who offers extravagant prices for goods gets all the goods , at least more than he can take . Serious disturbances in the automobile industry labor market will , of course , follow . The Ford Company can not hire all the men , yet there will be unrest and dissatisfaction in the shops of other companies . Strikes are likely enough , and conditions of peace can not be looked for until the equilibrium is somehow restored . The theory of the company as to its own ' favored employes is tinged with the utopian quality . The men are to receive their share , - of the profits in semi-monthly payments , but efficiency Istol-pe. , insisted and .. the " 1 , nartment- " , of the company will keep an eye on the men , and " any who are found " using the extra money in a way " considered improper for right liv " ing will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it is at that point that the plan will break down . Elimination will be resisted , for the injury to one will as certainly he the concern of all in this fortunate body of men as it is in organized labor unions . Profitsharing does not ch : . nge human nature . Nor is there the least probability that the company 's plan of ordering any needed shutdown of its works during the harvest season . so that the men may seek employment with farmers , will be attended With success . Mechanics paid at these extravagant rates during most of the year will not spend their enforced vacations in farm labor . It is natural that a company so blessed as to have $10,000,000 of annual profits over and above , the modest demands of the shareholders should be optimistic . Therefore the plan is based on the theory of continuous sunshine . In hard times and lean years the $10,000.000 available for this bounty would shrink appallingly . The bnposin : - , of such conditions upon itself by this company is , moreover , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away millions in profit-sharing is a heavy handicap to carry in the industrial race . The cars made by the company are sold at a low price , but the criticism will be ' inevitable that instead of an extravagant distribution of earnings the just and wise course would have been either to improve quality or reduce price . Some of the trusts have adopted that policy . The Interstate Commerce Commission told the railroads it could not consent to their increasing rates merely to provide high wages for employes . But aside from its economic aspects this announcement by the Ford Company is an evidence of the wonderful development and success of the automobile industry in this country . The annual automobile exhibitions in this city , one of which is now going on , have served as repeated proofs of not only the astonishing prosperity and volume of the automobile business , but of the business genius and progressive spirit of those engaged in it . The advance in the mechanical quality , strength , endurance , and trustworthiness of the .

Possibly an industry that has reached au enormous business expansion in so short a time may be exceptional to a degree which . will permit the working out of the Ford Company 's profit-sharing plan withotit accidents or setbacks . If so , it will be something new in manufacturing experience . We think the weight of opinion will decidedly incline to the side of doubt or to prophecies of certain failure for an experiment so manifestly based upon a vision of universal human uplift through a single venture in the field of beneficence.
