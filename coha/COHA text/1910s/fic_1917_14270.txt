This is only a quarter of a play . Its faults are many . Come , glory in them with us . You are a little boy once more lying on your rounded belly on the cool , damp sands beside the beautiful river . You are still young enough to see the wonder that everywhere touches the world ; and men are in the world  --  all sorts of men . But you can still look upon them with the shining eyes of brotherhood . You can still feel the mystery that is true understanding . Everywhere about you men and things are reaching for the infinite , each in his own way , be it big or little , be it the moon or a medicine show ; and you yourself are not yet decided whether to reach for the stars or go a-fishing . Brother ! Lut'er enters or rather oozes in . He is a tall , expressionless , uncordinated person who might be called filthy were it not for the fact that the dirt on his skin and on his clothes seems an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  what there is of it  --  is not displeasing . Strangely enough , his face is always smooth-shaven . He carries a fishing pole made from a tree twig and equipped with a thread knotted frequently and a bent pin for hook . Lut'er looks about and his eyes light on the stone . He attempts to move it with his bare foot to the water 's edge , but it is too heavy for him . Next he looks at the log , raises his foot to move it , then abandons the attempt because his eyes rest on the lighter soap box . This he puts in position , never deigning to touch it with his hands . Then he sits calmly and drawing a fishing worm from the pocket of his shirt fastens it on the pin-hook and casts his line into the water . Thereafter he takes no apparent interest in fishing . p. 3 After a moment Giz enters . Giz is somewhat dirtier than Lut'er but the dirt is less assimilated and consequently less to be condoned . Besides he is fuzzy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaved some Saturdays ago  --  but quite ago . Giz does n't speak to Lut'er and Lut'er does n't speak to Giz , but Lut'er suggests life by continued chewing and he acknowledges the proximity of Giz by spitting and wiping his lips with his hand . Giz having tried the log and the rock finally chooses the rock and acknowledges Lut'er 's salivary greeting by spitting also ; but he wipes his mouth on his sleeve . After a moment he reaches forward with his bare foot and touches the water. @x Lut'er , not to be wholly unresponsive , spits . A fresh silence falls upon them . GIZ ' S Hattie Brown came in ? Lut'er spits and almost shakes his head negatively . She 's a mighty good little steam-boat . LUT'ER She 's water-logged . GIZ She ai n't water-logged . LUT'ER She is . GIZ She ai n't . LUT'ER She is . GIZ She ai n't . The argument dies of malnutrition . After a moment of silence Giz speaks . GIZ ' S river raisin ' ? LUT'ER Nup ! Silence . GIZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LUT'ER Uh ! The conversation might continue if Giz did not catch a mosquito on his leg . GIZ Gosh ! A galler-nipper at noonday ! Lut'er scratches back of his ear warily. p. 5 GIZ An ' look at the whelp ! Giz scratches actively , examines the wound and anoints it with tobacco juice . The Play would be ended at this moment for lack of varied action if Dr. Stev'n Vandexter did not enter . He is an eager , healthy-looking man with a whitish beard that long washing in Ohio River water has turned yellowish . He wears spectacles and his clothes and general appearance are somewhat an improvement upon Lut'er and Giz . Furthermore he wears what were shoes and both supports of his suspenders are fairly intact . He is whittling a piece of white pine with a large jack-knife . Seeing Lut'er and Giz he draws the log between them and sits . After a moment in which three cuds are audibly chewed , Dr. Stev'n speaks . DOCTOR What gits me is how they done it . For the first time Lut'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Giz looks up with a dawn of interest under his beard . Silence . DOCTOR I traded a two-pound catfish for a box of that salve : an ' I do n't see how they done it . Lut'er having turned his head keeps it turned . Evidently Dr. Stev'n always has something of interest to say . GIZ Kickapoo ? p. 6 DOCTOR Ye ' . Kickapoo Indian Salve . I do n't think no Indian never seen it . He looks at Giz for acquiescence . GIZ Y'ai n't never sure about nothin ' these days . Dr. Stev'n looks at Lut'er for acquiescence also , and Lut'er approving turns his head forward and spits assent . DOCTOR I smelled it an ' it smelled like ker'sene . I biled it an ' it biled over an ' burnt up like ker'sene. I do n't think it was nothin ' but ker'sene an ' lard . GIZ Reckon ' t wuz common ker'sene ? DOCTOR I do n't know whether ' t wuz common ker'sene but I know ' t wuz ker'sene. An ' I bet ker'sene 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GIZ That air doctor said the salve ud cure most anything . LUT'ER as though a voice from the grave , long forgotten . Which doctor ? GIZ The man doctor  --  him with the p'inted musstash . LUT'ER I seen him take a egg outer Jimmie Weldon 's ear  --  an ' Jimmie swore he did n't have no hen in his head . DOCTOR But the lady doctor said it war n't so good  --  effie-cacious she called it  --  withouten you took two bottles o ' the buildin ' up medicine , a box o ' the liver pills an ' a bottle o ' the hair fluid . p. 7 GIZ She knowed a lot . She told me just how I felt an ' she said she hated to trouble me but I had a internal ailment . An ' she said I needed all their medicine jus ' like the Indians used it . But I told her I did n't have no money so she said maybe the box o ' liver pills would do if I 'd bring ' em some corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills ? GIZ Uh-huh . LUT'ER Took any ? GIZ Nup , I 'm savin ' ' em . LUT'ER What fur ? GIZ Till I 'm feelin ' sicker'n I am now . DOCTOR Where are they ? GIZ In m ' pocket . They chew in silence for a minute . DOCTOR Yes , sir ! It smelled like ker'sene ter me  --  and ker'sene ' t wuz. Ker'sene 'll cure heaps o ' things if you use it right . He punctuates his talk with covert glances at Giz . His thoughts are on the pills . DOCTOR Which pocket yer pills in , Giz ? GIZ discouragingly . M ' hip pocket . Again they chew. p. 8 DOCTOR The Family Medicine Book where I learned ter be a doctor said camphor an ' ker'sene an ' lard rubbed on flannel an ' put on the chest ' ud cure tizic , maybe . He looks at Giz . DOCTOR An ' what ud cure tizic ought ter cure anything , I think. I 'd ' a ' cured m ' second wife if the winder had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Atter that she jus ' wheezed until she could n't wheeze no longer . An ' so when I went courtin ' m ' third wife , I took a stitch in time an ' told her about the camphor an ' ker'sene an ' lard . Ruefully . She 's a tur'ble healthy woman . His feelings and his curiosity having overcome his tact , he blurts out . Giz , why'n th ' hell do n't yer show us yer pills ! GIZ Well  --  if yer wanner see ' em  --  here they air . He takes the dirty , mashed box out of his hip pocket and hands it to the Doctor . The Doctor opens the box and smells the pills . DOCTOR Ker'sene. Smell ' em , Lut'er . He holds the box close to Luter 's nose . LUT'ER with the least possible expenditure of energy . Uh ! DOCTOR Ker'sene ! Well , I guess it 's good for the liver , too. Gim me one , Giz ? p. 9 GIZ I ai n't got so many I can be givin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Giz . GIZ She said I ought ter take ' em all fer a cure . LUT'ER What yer got , Giz ? Calling a man by name is a great effort for Lut'er . GIZ Mostly a tired feelin ' an ' sometimes a crick in th ' back . Lut'er displays a sympathy undreamed of . LUT'ER Gim me one , Giz . GIZ Gosh ! You want th ' whole box , do n't yer ? LUT'ER Keep yer pills . He spits . DOCTOR What 's ailin ' you , Lut'r ? LUT'ER Oh , a tired feelin ' There is a long moment of suspended animation , but the Doctor knows that the mills of the gods grind slowly  --  and he waits for Lut'er to continue . An ' a crick in m ' back . DOCTOR I 'll cure yer , Lut'er . Lut'er just looks . If that Kickapoo doctor with the p'inted muss-tash kin cure yer , I guess I can . GIZ who has been thinking pretty hard . Got any terbaccer , Doc ? p. 10 DOCTOR Yep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He and the Doctor rise . Giz takes a pill out of the box and the Doctor takes his tobacco from his pocket , reaches out his hand for the pill and holds out the tobacco , placing his thumb definitely on the plug so that Giz can bite off so much and no more . Giz bites and the Doctor takes over the pill . Lut'er not to be outdone takes a battered plug of tobacco from his pocket and bites off an unlimited " chaw . " The Doctor takes his knife from his pocket and cuts the pill , smelling it . DOCTOR Ker'sene ! He tastes it . Ker'sene ! Now I been thinkin ' things over , Lut'er and Giz He tastes the pill again . Ker'sene , sure ! He sits down on the log once more , spits carefully and crosses his legs . I got a business proposition to make . Silence . Lut'er spits and crosses his legs , and Giz just spits . DOCTOR There ai n't enough home industry here in Rock Springs . We got a canning fact'ry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ioway  --  a Kickapoo Indian Medicine Show from Ioway ! Now  --  what we need in Rock Springs is a medicine show ! He waits for the effect upon his audience. p. 11 LUT'ER after a pause . How yer goin ' ter git it ? DOCTOR Well , here 's my proposition . Ai n't we got as much horse sense as them Ioway Indians ? LUT'ER A damn sight more . That is the evident answer to the Doctor , but Lut'er develops a further idea . We got the country from the Indians . GIZ after a moment of accumulating admiration . By Golly , Lut'er , yer right . DOCTOR Now , I got some medicine science . I 'd ' a ' cured my second wife if it had n't been for that busted winder . GIZ Yeh , but what come o ' yer first wife ? DOCTOR I could ' a ' cured her , too , only I had n't found the Family Medicine Book then . LUT'ER Well , what I wanter know is  --  what 's yer proposition I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hattie Brown and the whistle of the steam-mill indicate noon . Lut'er takes in the line  --  removes the fishing worm and puts it in his pocket . DOCTOR Well , I 'll make the salve an ' do the talkin ' ; Giz 'll sort o ' whoop things up a bit and Lut'er 'll git cured . p. 12 LUT'ER What 'll I get cured of ? DOCTOR Oh , lumbago an ' tired feelin ' crick in the back and tizic . LUT'ER But who 'll take a egg out o ' somebody 's ear ? DOCTOR Giz 'll learn that . LUT'ER with a wan smile that memory illuminates . An ' who 'll play the pianny ? DOCTOR Besteena , my daughter . LUT'ER Where we goin ' ? DOCTOR We 'll go ter Lavanny first . LUT'ER How 'll we git there ? DOCTOR Walk  --  unless somebody give us a tote . GIZ We kin go in my John-boat . LUT'ER Who 'll row ? There is fear in his voice . GIZ We 'll take turns . Lut'er looks with terror upon Giz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a half mile. Will you go , Lut'er ? LUT'ER evidently thinking deeply . How fur is it ? p. 13 GIZ Three an ' a half mile . DOCTOR Will yer go , Lut'er ? LUT'ER Uh-h . DOCTOR Huh ? GIZ He said , uh-huh . Lut'er chews in silence . DOCTOR I thought he said uh-uh . GIZ He said uh-huh . DOCTOR He did n't say nothin ' o ' the sort  --  he said uh-uh . They turn to Lut'er questioningly . He is chewing intensely . LUT'ER after a pause . How fur did yer say it wuz ? DOCTOR Three an ' a half mile . Silence . GIZ We 'll each take a oar . Silence . A stentorian voice is heard calling " Stee'vun . " The Doctor rises , hastily . DOCTOR What d'yer say , Lut'er ? LUT'ER It 's three an ' a half mile ter Lavanny  --  an ' three an ' a half mile back. Pretty fur . DOCTOR We kin come back on the current . LUT'ER Three an ' a half mile air three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again the masterful female voice calls " Stee'vun . " There is no mistaking its meaning . The Doctor is torn between home and business . Lut'er takes up his rod , rebaits the hook with the fishing-worm from his pocket and casts his line into the river. p. 14 LUT'ER I 'll think it over but I ai n't givin ' yuh no hope Three an ' a half mile one way air pretty fur but two ways  --  it 's turruble . DOCTOR Come on , Giz . We 'll talk it over . The Doctor and Giz leave Lut'er to his problem . Lut'er is undecided . He is at a crisis in his life . He spits thoughtfully and looks after the retreating Doctor and Giz . LUT'ER Three an ' a half mile He takes in his line and removes the fishing-worm . He rises and looks again after the Doctor and Giz . He hesitates. two ways He starts in the opposite direction , as he justifies himself to his inner self . Rock Springs is fur enough fur me ! When he disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
