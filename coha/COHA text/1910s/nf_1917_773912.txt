txt // panies , each being an " independent " divisionary corps of infantry . October , 1789 , our companies were again in line , this time to receive and escort the President of the United States , George Washington . In October , 1793 , a sadder duty summoned them forth . John Hancock , patriot , signer of the declaration of independence , Governor of Massachusetts , and President of the Continental Congress , had finished his long and noble career and gone to his rest . Boston loved and honored its chief citizen ; the funeral parade , in which our companies participated , was an expression of heart-felt grief . The companies were again called out on July 4th , 1795 , to help lay the corner-stone of the new State-house , the famous " Bulfinch front . " War clouds began to darken the political sky in 1794 , war clouds generated by the titanic struggle between the French and their enemies thruout Europe . Controversies had been going on between us and both parties to the great European conflict ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most Americans had sympathized with the French in their revolutionary struggle , had worn tri-colored cockades and clamored for a French alliance , now French colors disappeared from view , men wore black , and " Hail Columbia , " with " independence " for its " boast , " became the popular song . As soon as America found itself involved in the threatened storm , Congress began to take measures for defence and turned its attention to the militia . It is only in war-time that Congress can be induced to notice the citizen-soldiers . A law was passed May 9 , 1794 , directing the states to organize active regiments of militia and to prepare for eventualities . No action seems to have resulted from this first legislation ; and as the foreign danger intensified , a second act was passed in 1797 , // aiming to render the former law effective . Following the classical preferences of the times , the U. S. army had been rechristened , in 1792 , the " legion . " Each state must now organize a " legion " of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of this force ; and it is significant of Massachusetts ' relative standing that the Commonwealth was directed to furnish 11,885 of the total ? more than any other state . Massachusetts , on June 6 , 1794 , directed commanders of train-band divisions to draft men from their brigades who should hold themselves in instant readiness for service , as the " minute-men " of 1775 had been selected and organized . The great prestige of George Washington , for he had consented to waive his seniority and to serve as Lieut. - General under Pres. Adams , helped to render this revival of the minute-men popular , and the fashionable designation of " legion " did not detract from its popularity . On August 22 , 1797 , a supplementary order was issued , directing that a special regiment of such " legionaries " should be formed from the militia of each divison . The number of divisions having increased to ten , this called for ten regiments of active troops in Massachusetts and Maine . While the order ostensibly affected the entire Commonwealth , in point of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Gen . John Winslow , a soldier of energy and ability , in civil life a hardware dealer , was commissioned to command the " legionary brigade " of Boston , and during the ten years of his incumbency the legion was so vital a factor in the city 's military life that it became a fixture . Winslow 's legionary brigade was organized in 1799 , just as the war scare subsided . It consisted of legionary cavalry ( one troop ) , a sub-legion of light infantry made up of two independent companies ( the Fusiliers and the Bos22 The Old First ton Light Infantry ) , and a sub-legion of artillery made up of the Boston and Columbian companies , now fully organized as a battalion under Maj. Daniel Wild . The Roxbury and Dorchester companies did not join the legion , and now completed a battalion organization under Maj. James Robinson and were designated the " Battalion of Artillery , 1st Brigade , 1st Division . " These two battalions , one within and the other without the legion , represent a splitting up of the 1789 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalions , numbered 1st ( the legionary ) and 2d ( the old 1st Brigade battalion ) were to consolidate in the 5th Regiment of Artillery . The legionary brigade lasted as long as Gen. Winslow continued in command . Its cavalry , light infantry and artillery sections continued to thrive ; and in 1802 , under the energetic leadership of Lt. Col. Robert Gardner , succeeded in 1804 by Thomas Badger , a regiment , consisting of three sub-legions of infantry , each commanded by a major , came into existence . In the artillery sub-legion , Maj. Wild was succeeded by Maj. John Bray in 1803 , and by Maj. O. Johonnot in 1805 . Meanwhile the 1st Brigade battalion of artillery was commanded by Maj. Robinson . In 1808 Gen. Winslow retired ; and in 1809 the legionary brigade was redesignated " 3d Brigade , 1st Division . " Its three sub-legions of infantry became three infantry regiments , and these , as we shall see , contained companies destined later to form part of the Coast Artillery . The sub-legion of artillery became known as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maj. Johonnot , in 1812 by Maj. Nathan Parker , and in 1813 by Maj. William Harris . Maj. James Robinson was succeeded as commander of the 1st Brigade battalion by Maj. John Robinson in 1812 , and the latter in 1814 by Maj. Isaac Gale , formerly Captain of the Roxbury // Artillery . The 3d Brigade rendered one distinguished service to the city of Boston ? it brought out and maintained Asa Fillebrown as leader of the brigade band . The 3d Brigade continued to be the most prominent element in Boston 's militia until the reorganization of 184o . No doubt the French war-scare and the formation of the legionary brigade stimulated militia development in Massachusetts . The Columbian Artillery , the 6th Company , was organized June 17 , 1798 ; and the Washington Artillery , the 7th Company , on May 29 , 181o . Happily the war clouds dissolved without doing serious damage to America . Meanwhile the two battalions of artillery turned out to greet and receive President John Adams on the occasion of his visit to Boston . Between the years of 1810 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain a curious entry , " The Soul of the Soldiery . " While one could scarcely guess the fact , this was a predecessor of the modern " training school " for officers , and was maintained by the noncommissioned officers of all companies connected with the Legionary or 3d Brigade . No wonder that the Massachusetts militia excelled the corresponding force in other states , with such a spirit stirring the breasts of the enlisted men . By 1812 America did find itself involved in actual war . Statesmen had been laboring , and laboring successfully , for nearly a score of years to keep us at peace with France . Meanwhile circumstances conspired to stir up hostilities with France 's great enemy ; and almost before men could realize the possibility of such a thing , we were engaged in the second war with England . This is no place to discuss the cause of the struggle ; Boston 's artillery companies shared the sentiment of their section and regretted the condition of affairs . The war was // unpopular in New England . But the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why " and did put themselves into an attitude of preparedness . Weeks ensued which men would be glad to forget . Regiments of regulars were enlisted in Boston and transported to the Canadian frontier as part of the successive invading forces . After the lapse of months word came back of American defeat , of the incompetence displayed by untrained American officers , of hundreds of British putting to flight thousands of Americans . Boston itself lay open to hostile attack , with fortifications mostly in ruins , and such as there were , ungarrisoned . Then came the naval victories won by our gallant frigates , and Massachusetts breathed more freely . The enthusiasm which was craving an opportunity for expression found vent in ovations to victorious sailors . During the first two years of hostilities no attack was made against the New England coast , and we now know that England deliberately refrained because of the friendly sentiments of the New England people . The year 1814 brought a great change in the situation . England had downed Napoleon , and was at liberty to employ her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was part of America , and more particularly because its harbors served as a base of operations for the American navy , was to feel the consequences of war . Invasion commenced in Maine and threatened to roll southward down the coast ; immunity was at an end ; and an attack was actually made on Gloucester . Gov . Caleb Strong waited as long as he dared , expecting the Federal Government to take the steps necessary for defending our coast . When it finally became evident that Washington had its hands full elsewhere and could do nothing for Boston , Gov . Strong acted . // As the service was to be guard duty and the erecting of fortifications , and was likely to continue thru an indefinite number of months , larger units of the militia were not called out as such . No regiment went as a whole . It seemed better to draft companies , platoons , and even squads . A guard was maintained at Chelsea bridge to keep off raiding parties . After Sept. 8 , 1814 , all militia organizations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the British fleet finally sailed away , every member of the five artillery companies gave some weeks to active service . Fort Independence on Castle Island and Fort Warren on Governor 's Island , small works of brick and earth , constituted Boston 's principal defences ; these were garrisoned , and put in repair . How tremendously modern ordnance out-ranges that of a century ago ! The present Fort Warren , on Georges Island , erected in 185o , is today not nearly far enough from the city it defends , not far enough out at sea ; neither is its armament as long-ranged as it should be . Yet contrasted with the earlier Fort Warren , it is very remote from Boston , and is armed with guns able to do execution at almost infinite distance . The Commonwealth added to the defences of the harbor ; land was purchased on Jeffries Point , East Boston , and another fort erected to support Independence and Warren . The legislature , out of compliment to the Governor , named the new work Fort Strong . Here too one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the same name today on Long Island . Historians agree in pronouncing the militia a failure in the second war with England . It must be confessed that there is much ground for such a verdict ; in fact , the regular army was also , for the most part , a sad failure in the same war . But in all fairness an exception should be made // of the Massachusetts militia which manned the coast defences of Boston and kept the British fleet outside the harbors of the state . The Roxbury Artillerymen and their comrades in sister companies were prompt in responding , efficient in " digging " and other military labor , and entirely vigilant in guard duty . Their service in 1814 goes far to render the name of militia honorable . One moment of relaxation came during the war when the battalions paraded in Boston as escort to President James Madison . The year 1815 marked a turning point in American military history , and the artillery companies of Boston felt its influence . Danger from foreign foes was at an end ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer to be a serious menace . America felt free to enter upon a career of peaceful conquest ? and to get rich . It is fair to note that England also began a similar stage at the same time ; perhaps there was some reflex influence exerted by the mother country . The first symptom of the change was the decay of the train-band . Whereas militia service had hitherto been regarded seriously , as the most important duty of citizenship , now men laughed at it . We begin to find reference to the " corn-stalk " militia . Decay was gnawing at the vitals of the train-band system . Ridiculous cartoons may be seen in the museum of the A. &; H. Art . Co . ( Matthews ' " Militia Folk " and others ) showing what a farce the institution had become . Men attended muster in outrageously improper clothing , armed with sticks , pitchforks , or nothing at all , and obviously treated this aspect of their patriotic duty as a gigantic bit of buffoonery . Quarterly training or muster-day became an occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilling done . Early temperance societies recognized this // state of affairs by including in their abstinence pledges an exception in favor of muster-day ; it was not " intemperate " to be drunk then . In our forefathers ' opinion this gradual abandonment of compulsory universal military service was regarded as a mark of social progress . Will such be the ultimate verdict of history ? Increased importance attached to the Roxbury Artillery and other volunteer companies as the train-band became increasingly inactive . Let us inspect them , bearing in mind that they are now the chief military reliance of the Commonwealth . Discipline , judged by modern standards , may not have been strict . Men came and went pretty much at will . But they had some discipline , while their fellow-citizens did not know what the word meant . No " basic course for officers " as yet existed , and it is a fact that the higher officers were apt to be chosen more for political than military reasons . As the rank increased , the military attainments were apt to diminish ; but amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uniform fashions had been modified by the recent war ? now companies wore the shako on the head , at first of leather and later of bearskin , the high buttoned swallow-tail coat , white webbing cross-belts with brass breast-plates , and long trousers . Each company had a distinctive uniform of its own , as different as possible from all others ; and this diversity persisted even down until after the Civil War . It was a column of companies , and judging from appearances , of extremely " separate " companies , that paraded to escort and welcome Lafayette in April and again on August 30 , 1824 ; and to lay the corner-stone of Bunker Hill monument in 1825 ; and to inter President John Adams in July , 1826 ; and for the funeral of Gov . William Eustis . An enthusiastic reception was accorded by these companies to President Andrew // Jackson , June 24 , 1833 . These soldiers may not have been as efficient as modern troops must be ; but they made a splendid appearance on parade ; and beyond question were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own times . An attempt was made to increase efficiency by issuing books of drill regulations available for all , instead of depending upon oral instruction . In the earliest days drill was regulated by Prussian and French systems of tactics . The first book of tactics ever prepared in English for general popular issue was written and published in 1813 by Gen. Isaac Maltby of the Massachusetts militia , for the use of Massachusetts troops . The necessity for conciseness and speed was not then recognized . For a battalion to pass from line to close column , the drill regulations of 1911 indicate commands as follows : " Close on first company , March , Second company , Squads right , column half right , March . " Under Maltby 's system this was heard : " Battalions will form close column of platoons on the right , in rear of the first platoon , Shoulder arms , Battalion , Form close column of platoons in rear of the right , Right face , March . " Scott 's famous tactics were adopted in 1834 . Maj. Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalion of artillery in 1817 , Maj. Thomas J. Lobnell in 1823 , Maj. Samuel Lynes in 1826 , Maj. Aaron Andrews in 1830 , and Maj. Horace Bacon of Cambridge in 1832 . By June 29 , 1834 , the battalion had grown to four companies , and was for a year elevated to the dignity of a regiment . John L. White , the popular proprietor of the Union House ( 29 Union St. ) , was made Colonel , and thus became the first man ever to hold that rank in the Coast Artillery . Col. White 's military career had been meteoric ; in 1831 he was elected Cornet ( 2d Lt. ) of Light Dragoons in r. * ... . s l  --  . i- .. // the 3d Brigade ; 1832 saw him Major of the 1st Infantry in the same brigade ; in 1834 he became Colonel of that regiment ; and ten weeks later , on the date given above , he transferred and was commissioned Colonel of the new artillery regiment . However the time was not yet ripe for regimental dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston and resigned his command , the organization was allowed to slip back and again become a battalion . Maj. John Hoppen commanded in 1836 . On April 24 , 1840 , the battalion was awarded the number " 1st . " In 1841 William B. Perkins was elected Major , the last man to command it as a separate organization . Meanwhile the 1st Brigade battalion was commanded by the following Majors : 1818 Joseph Hastings of Roxbury , 1822 Robert Stetson of Dorchester ( an ex-Captain of the 1st Company ) , 1825 John Parks of Dorchester , and 1829 Jonathan White , Jr. , of Weymouth . In 1831 the strength of the battalion was reduced from three to two companies , and these were temporarily attached to an infantry regiment ( the 1st of the 1st Brigade ) . On June 26 , 1834 , the battalion organization was restored , a new company having been formed , with John Webber , an ex-Captain of the 1st Company as Major . Maj. John W. Loud of Weymouth was elected to command in 1836 , and Maj. Webber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battalion was numbered " 2d . " In 1841 Samuel F. Train of Roxbury was elected Major , the last man to command the battalion as a separate organization . Capt . John Webber was succeeded as commander of the 1st Company by Andrew Chase , Jr. , a man destined to become first Colonel of the new regiment . That year the battalions paraded in celebration of the completion of Boston 's new railroad . All the companies were called out June I I , 1837 , to main30 The Old First tain public order at the time of the Broad Street riot . The outbreak arose from a clash between a funeral procession and a fire-engine company . Which ought to have the right of way ? Unfortunately racial jealousy was present to embitter the rivalry , so that blows were exchanged and a general fire-alarm " rung in " and disorder became widespread . First honors on this occasion belong to the newly organized National Lancers , whose horses terrified the rioters ; infantry and artillery companies acted as reserve , and subsequently policed the district . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on March 24 , 1840 , the legislature voted a general reorganization of the militia , and in particular disbanded the ancient train-band . In theory , the members of the artillery battalions had been excused from the compulsory drill done by every able-bodied man in their districts on the ground that they were rendering more than the prescribed military service in their volunteer organizations . In fact , the district companies and regiments of the train-band had long since ceased to do any true drilling and were little more than a mere name . Courage is required to abate a long-standing abuse . New York continued to endure the train-band system until 1862 , well into the Civil War . Massachusetts faced the condition with greater determination , and abolished the system in 1840 . On March 24 the law was enacted , and on April 17 the necessary orders issued . Thereafter the volunteer companies were the only military force existing in the Commonwealth . CHAPTER III 1840-1861 Gen. William Henry Harrison had been elected President in 1840 at the conclusion of one of the most exciting political contests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in April , 1841 , he suddenly died . Public feeling which had been so stirred over the election , now reacted ; and men everywhere vied with one another in expressing heart-felt sorrow . Amidst circumstances of deep gloom , intensified by bad weather , the battalions , in the very midst of the confusion attendant upon their reorganization , made a funeral parade notable for its sadness . It was not until July , 1862 , that the regiment again came in touch with Harrison ; then they were stationed at his birthplace , Harrison 's Landing on the James River , Virginia . And greatly did they enjoy their days of rest after the torture of the Chickahominy swamp , and the opportunity to use plenty of clean , fresh water for bathing ; possibly some of the older soldiers remembered the obsequies of April 22 , 1841 . June , 1843 , was a red-letter period in Boston history . Bunker Hill monument was at last completed after eighteen years building , and a vast concourse of people assembled for its dedication . The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battalion , " arrived on the 16th , and was received and entertained by the Fusiliers . Indeed troops were present from four outside states ? Maine , New Hampshire , Rhode Island and New York . That same day the artillery battalions met President John Tyler at Roxbury Crossing , and escorted him to the Tremont // House , the parade taking place amidst a drenching rainstorm . The morning of the 17th was clear , cool , and delightful . At an early hour , the military part of the procession , which consisted of four grand divisions , was formed on Boston Common . As the procession moved toward Bunker Hill , the enthusiasm which was produced by the admirable appearance of the troops was only equalled by that which greeted the distinguished Webster , the gifted orator of the day ; while President Tyler , in melancholy contrast , was received with ominous silence and coolness . Arriving at Bunker Hill , the orator of the day and the guests and officials passed into the already crowded square . While Webster was speaking , the soldiers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were entertained by " a bountiful collation , " which the hospitable authorities of Boston had prepared . After the ceremonies , oratorical and gustatory , the procession returned to Boston , and the troops were reviewed by the President at the State House . At a dinner the same evening in Faneuil Hall , President Tyler gave the following toast : ? " The Union , ? a union of purpose , a union of feeling , the Union established by our fathers . " A few years later , he was an active enemy of that Union , which he had complimented in the most solemn manner within the sacred walls of the Cradle of Liberty . Boston 's division of the force , thereafter to be known as the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia , paraded in two brigades , with a total strength of 2,500 men . Incidentally we might note that there were two other such divisions in the state . Under the circumstances the 1st and 2d Battalions of Artillery added to their already creditable reputation and presented a fine appearance . There were five companies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two lieutenants , four sergeants , four corporals , six gunners , six // bombardiers , one drummer , one fifer , and sixty four privates or " matrosses . " Part of each company was armed , equipped and drilled as infantry ; but each company proudly exhibited two bronze six-pounder cannon with limbers , and a single caisson . The ordnance had increased in caliber since 1784 , the change being made in 1840 . The state prescribed by law what manner of uniform the artillery companies should wear . Inasmuch however as the members had to purchase their own clothing without state assistance , and since they were mostly interested in the glory of their own companies , they were pardonable for regarding the regulation state uniform as merely a point of departure from which fancy might soar in devising distinctive costumes for the company units . Caps , short jackets , and frock coats , soon to become popularized as a result of the Mexican War , were beginning to be in vogue . The year 1844 marked a still more important step in the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been organized into regiments , and the regiment was conceded to be the fundamental unit in importance . It was the tactical unit , that is , the troops maneuvered as regiments when in the presence of an enemy . It was also the administrative unit , in the sense that all records and reports centered at regimental headquarters . In drill regulations , the regiment was called a battalion ; but no battalion could claim to be a regiment unless it had approximately ten companies , and was commanded by a colonel ; one thousand was the membership standard . In other words the regiment was the only complete battalion . When the train-band ceased to be , the battalions of artillery began to aspire after regimental dignity in the Volunteer Militia . The 1st Battalion had actually been a regiment for a few months , ten years previously . Nor was it forgotten // that the two battalions were originally one , that the regimental consolidation to be was really a reunion of those who , forty-six years before , had been a single body . On June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 5th Regiment of Artillery came into being . With the promotion on June 24 of Andrew Chase , Jr. , to the colonelcy the new organization was completed . Economy reigned in the Adjutant General 's office of that day , and the state did not feel that it could afford much expenditure for printing . Our earliest rosters come from 1858 , and we are unable to name many of the distinguished men who made up the 5th Regiment at its inception . It contained five companies : 1st , the Roxbury Artillery ; 4th , the Dorchester Artillery ; 6th , the Columbian Artillery ; 7th , the Washington Artillery ; and 8th , the Boston Artillery . Since all excepting the Dorchester company were strong organizations with established reputations , the regiment , from the very beginning , became the most distinguished military body in the city and state . In recognition of this fact Col. Chase was promoted to the brigadier-generalship Aug. 28 , 1847 . Military affairs were stimulated by the Mexican war in 1846 . While no militia organization went from Massachusetts , individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single regiment sent out by the state ; and tales of American valor in the southwest served to arouse all to do better work . Mexican veterans afterward organized a company in our command ; and became the recognized custodians of the 1st Volunteers ' Mexican battleflag . Regimental responsibility was too much for the Dorchester Artillery , and it was disbanded in 1845 . Only four companies remained in the 5th Regiment . In fact there // was too much disbanding for the good of the militia . The state authorities seemed to think that it was cheaper to disband a company which had fallen into " hard luck " than it was to cure the difficulty by paying a little money for the restoration and support of the sufferer . This was a false economy . Of the one hundred forty-two companies which existed in 1840 in the new Volunteer Militia , seventy-eight were disbanded within the first seven years , and one hundred two passed out of existence within twenty-five years . With so many surgical operations , it is marvelous that any militia survived at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 5th Regiment who paraded as an escort to President Polk June 29 , 1847 , and who welcomed Daniel Webster upon his return to Boston , gave evidence of increased efficiency . The legislature was making more liberal appropriations ? was indeed spending each year ( 1844-1852 ) all of $6 per man on the militia ; even this moderate expenditure was far better than nothing . The state authorities were very well satisfied with themselves and with their handiwork , reporting to inquirers that the Massachusetts system " met every need . " A fairly liberal allowance of ammunition was made to each artillery company ? forty round shot , forty canister , and one hundred pounds of powder every year . William B. Perkins became Colonel Sept. lo , 1847 . Altho he did not enjoy good physical health , and died in office November 16 , 1849 , his administration was signalized by several important events . On March to , 1848 , occurred the funeral of Ex-President John Quincy Adams . The regiment , or part of it , paraded on Oct. 25 of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . On Aug. 8 and 9 , 1849 , the regiment participated in its first state camp , at Neponset , continuing two and one36 The Old First half days . A curious old print of this encampment ha come down to us showing how the 1st Brigade of the 1s Division looked at the time . The 5th Artillery was present four companies strong , clad conspicuously in bearskin and other towering shakos ; the balance of the brigade con sisted of the National Lancers in their uhlan costumes , a at present , which had been adopted four years before , and the 1st Light Infantry , wearing distinctive company uni forms . The Lancers were at that time attached to the 1s Light Infantry , and were the only cavalry command in th state . Was any prophet present in Neponset on those Au gust days gifted with ability to read the future ? Did anyon even guess that twenty-nine years later the 5th Artiller and the remnant of the 1st Light Infantry were to consoli date in a new 1st Regiment ? While a two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents , escorting visitors , engaging in those social festivitie which are " absolutely essential " on all military occasions and then taking down the tents , there is no doubt that th men acquired much real military knowledge in between times , and that the new custom registered a long ste forward . Col. Asa Law commanded the regiment from Jan. 4 t July io , 1850 . July 26 , 1850 , witnessed another change in the colonelcy Robert Cowdin assuming command of the regiment . Col Cowdin , in his peaceful moments , was a Boston lumber dealer ; but members of the regiment will always remembe him as a soldier , except when they recall some more intimat contact with the man whom they loved ; then they speak o him as " father . " It makes a great deal of difference tha he commanded them during the year of fearful hardshi and sanguinary strife on the Virginia Peninsula ; but eve // before that he had endeared himself to his men , while he was merely a militia commander . He had been Captain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1849 ; and came into the artillery as Major . It is hardly over-stating it , to say that Col. Cowdin is the man who made the regiment great . What he assumed command over was actually four splendid artillery companies , loosely yoked together in the 5th Regiment . The conception was nine-tenths " company " and only one-tenth " regiment . " Inter-company rivalry had prevented the development of real regimental spirit . The new colonel was determined to command a true regiment ; and since he was a man of masterly force and boundless enthusiasm , he speedily had his way . Distinctive company costumes yielded place to a regimental uniform , and thereafter the company was a subordinate unit . The obsequies of ExPresident Taylor were the last occasion on which intercompany diversity appeared ; and that was in the very month of Col. Cowdin 's accession . In all his reforms he was ably seconded by Capt . Moses H. Webber of Roxbury , commanding the 1st Company . In 1851 percussion muskets displaced the flint-locks . The same year a new 4th Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the 9th Company , the Webster Artillery , and in 1853 by the 3d Company or Bay State Artillery and the 5th Company or Shields Artillery . The regiment thus had eight companies . That year Isaac S. Burrell became Captain of the 1st Company . Col. Cowdin 's first camp was held at Medford , and drew warm compliments from the Adjutant General . Neponset was occupied as a camp-ground for the second time in 1851 ; Boston Common in 1852 ; and the regiment participated in divisional camp at North Abington in 1853 . In 1854 the division was at Quincy . How conditions have changed with q-4 ' + ' " 4'w'Rd ' " ' att31 ' . r3 ? : . , ; ; , ; y // the increase of Massachusetts population ! Who would think of these places as suitable camp-sites today , least of all , Boston Common ? Col.

It came to be a custom at this time for Boston military critics and newspaper reporters to accord chief praise , after a parade , to the 5th Regiment . Anthony Burns ' name is associated with the next important event in the regiment 's history , the most unpleasant event with which it ever had anything to do . No more painful duty can confront the militiaman than the task of maintaining public order , for no American likes to have part in coercing his fellow citizens . And on June 2 , 1854 , the regiment was called upon to enforce the most unpopular statute ever enacted by Congress , the " Fugitive Slave " law . Burns had escaped from his owner in Virginia , and found employment with a Boston clothing-dealer . Massachusetts was called upon to render him up under the terms of the new statute , and the U. S. Marshal arrested him on May 25 . Public sympathy was strongly with the colored man , funeral draperies appeared upon the fronts of private residences , many threatened mob violence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , May 27 , addressed by Wendell Phillips and other prominent anti-slavery men , to protest against this humiliation to which Massachusetts was about to submit . The speakers even counseled a rescue by force . Under the U. S. law , a man " held to service " in another state , could be extradited and transported to that state for trial . The trouble was , that in the case of a fugitive slave , extradition involved the entire question ? if Burns should be car- // ried back to Virginia , his chance of liberty would be gone ; and Boston believed in liberty . An attempt was made to take him from jail , but this proved unsuccessful . Col .. Cowdin 's 5th Regiment , Col. Holbrook 's 1st Regiment , the 3d Battalion , the Cadets and the Lancers were ordered out to assist the police in enforcing the law . Guards were posted along the streets leading from the court-house to the " T Wharf , " where a steamer lay in readiness ; and the Lancers , with a strong detachment of police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was on June 2 that the U.

Red pepper and acid were thrown at the troops , clubs and stones were used , a Lancer 's horse was stabbed ; but the display of force proved too strong for the rioters . Both Col. Cowdin and Col. Holbrook later proved the genuineness of their devotion to freedom 's cause by commanding regiments in the Civil War . What they and their commands did on June 2 , 1854 , was entirely distasteful to them ; but the call came to them as soldiers . Like true soldiers they performed their duty ; and Burns went back to the south . His fidelity to duty was eight years later to be instrumental in preventing the confirmation of Col. Cowdin 's appointment as Brigadier General . Happily , with the modern increase in police efficiency occasions for such service grow less and less frequent . Our professional police officers are now capable of handling all but the most severe crises without military assistance . Another state-wide reorganization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1855 ; and in some ways this was the most unfortunate of them all . It was primarily caused by racial and sectarian jealousy , a spirit which has no rightful place whatever in American life . The // principles of the " Know Nothing " party were regnant that year . No less a man than Thomas Cass was forced to resign his military commission ? today his statue stands in honor in the Public Gardens . It almost seemed that the dominant faction were determined to prove themselves in the military and other diverse fields , as well as in the field of partizan politics , to be " know nothings . " The 5th Regiment , Boston 's best , was ordered disbanded ; but the State House authorities did not really mean this . They only reorganized the command , with the intention that the resultant " 2d Regiment of Infantry " should continue its service record . The 6th Company , the old Columbian Artillery commanded by Cass , together with the Webster Artillery and Shields Artillery of the 5th , were actually disbanded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apparently for political reasons . Capt . Cass 's company continued its existence as the " Columbian Association , " and in 1861 developed into the 9th Infantry . Moses H. Webber was commissioned Colonel of the new 2d Infantry on April 18 , 1855 , and continued in office until Dec. 19 of that year . It consequently fell to his lot to adapt the regiment to its new conditions . Since the regiment had been drilling more and more as infantry and less and less as artillery , the change from one branch of the service to the other was less abrupt than it appeared to be . And be it noted that the regiment never lost interest in its native artillery ? until in 1897 it re-entered the artillery branch . Col. Webber had four companies from the 5th , three of them old and strong ones . Two companies were transferred from the 1st Regiment , the 6th and 9th , of which both were already distinguished under their names , the " Union Guards " and the " National Guards . " The artillery companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // Roxbury Artillery becoming the Roxbury City Guard , the Washington Artillery the Washington Light Guard , and the Boston Artillery the Boston Phalanx . The regiment , so reorganized , was paraded by Col. Webber as escort to President Franklin Pierce , when the latter visited Boston . As the Civil War approached , Massachusetts grew more liberal in providing for her soldiers . In 1852 the expenditure per man was increased to $6.5o a year , in 1857 to $9.00 , and in 1858 the expenditure was fixed at $7.50 and remained there until 1869 . The New York 7th Regiment visited Boston and participated in the Bunker Hill celebration of June 17 , 1857 . Their ease and precision of movement , their evident regimental spirit , their large numbers , and their serviceable yet dressy gray uniform , worn uninterruptedly since 1824 , - all made a deep impression upon Boston military men . As the 7th had stopped to suppress an incipient riot on its way to the boat in New York the night before , its practical efficiency added force to the impression . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the visiting troops , came most strongly under this spell . An impulse was given to the movement for improving the 2d . In 1859 the regiment adopted a gray uniform closely patterned after the dress of the 7th , and continued the new bill of dress until July , 1861 . Again after the war the same gray uniform was in use between 1869 and 1880 . Col. William W. Bullock commanded the regiment from Jan. 11 , 1856 , until April 14 , 1858 , when he was promoted to be Brigadier General . Camp was held at Quincy in 1856 ; at Chelsea in 1857 ; and the latter occasion was notable because Robert Cowdin then rejoined his old command , accepting the rank of Lieutenant Colonel . In 1858 ( May 11 ) Col. Cowdin was again in command ; // and continued in office until the second year of the war , when on Sept. 26 , 1862 , he was advanced to the rank of Brigadier General . In connection with the regimental camp at North Bridgewater , 1858 , the regiment received its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the old 1st Regiment , that it finally seemed best to disband that organization altogether . By contrast with the 5th-2d , its regimental spirit had grown weaker and weaker with each passing year until Boston 's oldest regiment was nothing but a loosely connected group of separate companies . So on March 1 , 1859 , four of its companies , the Washington Guards , the Independent Boston Fusiliers , the Pulaski Guards and the Mechanic Rifles , were transferred to Col. Cowdin 's regiment , where they took place as the 2d , 3d , 4th and 5th Companies respectively . As separate companies these already possessed proud records ; and in their new regimental connection the 3d and 4th immediately found a vigorous new life . The Mechanic Rifles soon disbanded , and most of the members joined the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company . Later on , we shall follow the adventures of the three remaining companies of the old 1st . Meanwhile Massachusetts was getting ready for the approaching war and putting her military forces in condition for active service . Sept. 7 to 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp at Concord , winning highest praise for the numbers and skill of his men . This was a notable occasion in Massachusetts military history , and as it later proved , in U. S. history . Had not the Bay State been more ready for war than her sisters , there would have been no " minute-men of ' 61 " available to rush southward , and save the National capital . The Concord encampment for the entire Volunteer Militia , three divisions with a total // membership of 7,500 men , was the pet project of Gov . Nathaniel Banks . While other executives of the state had regarded their office of commander-in-chief as a somewhat perfunctory affair , Gov . Banks took it exceedingly seriously ; and even went so far as to uniform himself in clothing appropriate to his military office . Surely he " came to the kingdom for such a time as this . " While the pacifist governors of many northern states were ridiculing the very idea of war , Gov . Banks put his state in an attitude of preparedness ? and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued only three days , it was mainly occupied with making and breaking camp , and escorting distinguished official visitors . But some little time was squeezed out for studying the new Hardee 's tactics , which were just supplanting Scott 's . Great enthusiasm was aroused by the presence of Gen. John E. Wool , the " hero of Buena Vista , " who reviewed the troops . But the great day of all came when Gov . Banks and the members of the legislature reviewed the campers . A famous lithograph of this scene exists ; and does more than anything else to make the regiment of those days seem real to us . Numbers were small , as we reckon numbers today ; but the finest spirit of determined patriotism was manifest . A slight change in organization took place under Hardee 's tactics ; instead of four lieutenants to a company , there were only two . Consequently few new men were elected to fill vacancies until the regiment had adjusted itself to the new regime . The officers of the regiment at the great Concord encampment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaac S. Burrell ( postmaster of Roxbury , and later City Marshal ) ; Major , Isaac F. Shephard . The captains commanding companies were : 1st , Thomas L. D. Perkins ( proprietor of a smoke-house ) ; 3d , Henry A. Snow ( trea44 The Old First surer of a bleachery ) ; 6th , Edward Pearl ; 7th , Walter S. Sampson ( a mason and builder ) ; 8th , Clark B. Baldwin ( a merchant ) ; 9th , Arthur Dexter ; and loth , Joshua Jenkins . With the Civil War less than two years off , it is well to look ahead and see how many of these militiamen rendered service in the hour of their country 's need . Of the Colonel we have already spoken . The Lieutenant Colonel commanded the 42d Regiment in 1862 , and again in 1864 , as we shall see . The Major presently removed to Missouri for business reasons , where he served with Nathaniel Lyon , and ultimately commanded the 51st U. S. Colored Infantry , and was promoted to be Brigadier General . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snow and Pearl served three months each at the beginning of the regiment 's three years of service , and then received their discharges . Capt . Sampson took his company into the 6th Regiment , and led them thru Baltimore on April 19 , 1862 , under deadly fire from the rioters . Later he served as Captain in the 22d Infantry during the Peninsular campaign , commanding that regiment at Gaines Mill . Capt . Baldwin remained in Col. Cowdin 's regiment when his company transferred themselves to the new 4th Battalion of Rifles and ultimately to the 13th Regiment ; and became commander of a new 4th Company , and from 1862 to 1864 was Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment . Baldwin was a most profane man , and during the ensuing campaign stragglers could identify their regiment from a distance by the sound of his swearing . When Baldwin was made prisoner at the Wilderness , his captors marvelled at his vocabulary ; and came up to his tent in successive reliefs to listen . Once a youthful fifer who had been caught by the then Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his shoulder as he marched . This lad has put on record , that regulations provided for " a field // officer at the head of a regiment and a mule at the rear " ; and that Col. Baldwin was deemed well-qualified for either end of the column . But the testimony is confessedly biassed . Boston Common was the site of the 186o camp , the last camp before the war . Military interest was then at fever heat , and the very air seemed electric with the coming struggle . In the midst of the warlike preparation occurred a peaceful ceremony which gained in interest from its very contrast with its surroundings ; the youthful Prince of Wales , afterward Edward VII of Great Britain , visited Boston and was accorded military honors . A member of the regiment has recorded of him that he was " a really handsome youth with a pleasant blue eye , plump cheeks , and skin of great fairness . " On January 24 , 1861 , the 2d Regiment was redesignated , receiving the number , " 1st , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1859 . Since six companies of the old 1st ( as well as Col. Cowdin himself ) had previously been added to what now became the " Civil War " 1st , there was an obvious fitness in allowing the number to be transferred also . Moreover the future held in store that all remaining of the old 1st personnel should , in 1878 , be consolidated with their quondam comrades in a new 1st Regiment . CHAPTER IV RESPONDING TO THE PRESIDENT 'S CALL April , 1861 , ended the suspense . Sumpter was fired upon April 12 . Lincoln 's first call for troops was issued April 15 , supplemented by a personal appeal from Senator Henry Wilson ? " Send on 1,500 men at once . " The militia mobilized with marvelous rapidity on April 16 , and started south under command of Gen. Benjamin F. Butler the following day , for three months ' service . Those were days of tense feeling . A shipmaster who displayed a southern flag was in danger of losing both his life and his vessel ; and ended by issuing profuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the regiments ; indeed everyone seemed ready to give whatever he had . All one needed to do was to appear in uniform in order to be accounted a hero ? much to the discomfort of many genuinely modest men . And thruout these opening days the 1st Regiment was subjected to the very hardest test , in that nothing whatever happened to them . They could not take comfort in the knowledge that the 3d Regiment , one of the very earliest to go , would by and by become consolidated with them , and so share the honors which they were earning . All that the members of the 1st could do was to hope , and growl , and wonder why the Governor should select them for homeguard purposes while he allowed others to go to war . Then something actually did happen , which only served to aggravate . Captain Sampson discovered a vacancy in the 6th Regiment , and with Col. Cowdin 's approval promptly b // secured the transfer of his 7th Company , the Washington Light Guard , one of the three strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regimental history ; so that the 6th had a Co . K of which to be proud , and the 1st Regiment had nothing . Co . K of the 6th , as was to be expected , covered itself with glory during the streetfight in Baltimore on April 19 . Capt . David K. Wardwell , whose company had suffered disbandment a few months before , profited by his consequent independence and organized a new company , with Col. Cowdin presiding at the election of officers ; and then took the new organization off with the 5th Regiment as Co . F. " Wardwell 's Tigers " shared in the laurels won by their regiment at Annapolis and Washington , and three months later at Bull Run found themselves fighting in the same army with the old 1st Regiment . Meanwhile their success in getting into active service did not make it any easier for the 1st Regiment to endure the masterly inactivity of those April days . Finally on April 27 , the 1st Regiment was ordered to prepare itself ? as if it had not been prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . But , alas , instructions came from the War Department that no more three-months men were desired , and after fifteen days ' service by the regiment , the order was , on May 7 , revoked . Forty-two years later the legislature passed a resolve according official recognition to the 1st Regiment as having volunteered with the other minute men ; " but this was no comfort whatever to the eager young soldiers of 1861 , who were told to lay down their weapons and go home . Col. Cowdin and his men were in high favor at the Boston City Hall ; but owing to their services at the Burns riot , and for other political reasons , they were frowned on by Gov . Andrew and the Senators . // On second thought Col. Cowdin decided that he and his men were going to get into active service in spite of all difficulties . It had just become known that the Government desired three-year regiments , and this opened a door of possibility . The 1st would go to war for three years . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war should not last three years ? would the troops be kept in service anyway ? Moreover , there had never been any threeyear volunteers in the United States , during any previous war ; and it requires courage to set a precedent . But Col. Cowdin and his men made the necessary readjustments demanded by the prospect of prolonged absence from home , and volunteered as a three-year regiment . Owing to their promptness , they were able to win an honor greater even than came to the " minute-men ; " for they became the very first long-term volunteer regiment to enter U. S. service anywhere in the country , the first not only of the Civil War but of any war . Their adventures , and the battles they fought , are " another story " ; and will be told in a later chapter . One of the three old original artillery companies having been lost to the 6th , another was destined to go with ? no , the correct expression is , to " become " ? the 13th Regiment . Late in 186o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became interested in organizing a " crack " battalion or regiment for Boston . They were already members of the best regiment in the Commonwealth , but they were not satisfied with that . Capt . Baldwin did not share in this new ambition and declined to have anything to ' do with it . In civil life he was a merchant and wholly practical in his tastes ; as a soldier he was a plain , blunt man , " full of strange oaths , " " who loved his friends . " The new departure did not appeal to him . So Capt . Baldwin transferred // to the 4th Company , the Pulaski Guards , and remained with his old regiment ; while the Boston Artillery chose Gen. Samuel H. Leonard , recently of Worcester , as their captain . Under Capt . Leonard the Boston Artillery absorbed what survived of the disbanded Columbian Greys or City Guards of the old 1st , and proceeded to expand into the 4th Battalion of Rifles . It was on Dec. 15 , 186o , that the new battalion was formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do much toward developing their ideal of a " crack " regiment , they found themselves upon the threshold of the great war . On May 25 , 1861 , they volunteered to garrison Ft . Independence for one month ; and almost before the month had expired , the 4th Battalion of Rifles had expanded once more and become the 13th Regiment , and on July 16 they were mustered in for three years ' service . Col. Cowdin 's men felt that they could well afford to lose their grand old 8th Company , when their loss resulted in the addition of an entire regiment to the Union army . The 13th served as part of the first corps in the army of Virginia , and later the army of the Potomac . Their regimental monument stands on the field of their hardest fight , that of the first day at Gettysburg , where they lost their gallant corps commander , Gen. John F. Reynolds . And on the second day of that battle , toward evening , they were sent to reinforce Sickles on the left , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Artillery and the Roxbury Artillery were serving side by side . On May 18 , 1861 , just one week before the 1st was mustered into Federal service , it lost another company . Capt . Joseph H. Barnes had organized a new 7th Company to fill the place made vacant by Capt . Sampson 's withdrawal . But the example of his predecessor proved contagious ; so that presently the new company followed the old one . Capt . 5o The Old First Barnes ' command joined the 4th Mass . Infantry at Fort Monroe , and so found active work immediately . When , however , the 4th presently came home , its new Co . K was left behind , and became incorporated in the 29th Regiment , with which it served three years . In 1862 the 29th was with the army of the Potomac , in 1863 in Mississippi and Tennessee , and again with the army of the Potomac in 1864 . Capt . Gardner Walker 's North End True Blues eventually went with Col. Cowdin as the 7th Company . Lieutenant Colonel Isaac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three-years ' service . Remaining in Boston with a few other members who were similarly situated , he maintained a skeleton organization of the old militia regiment . And because the new number , 1st , was borne by Col. Cowdin , Col. Burrell had to hunt another designation for his command . The fourteen officers and two hundred sixteen men , in seven companies , who were engaged in this home-guard duty were by no means satisfied with their position . Their hearts were in Maryland and Virginia with their former comrades . In the spring of 1862 Banks was driven from the Shenandoah valley and the north began to fear for the safety of Washington . On May 26 , in response to requests from the Secretary of War , Massachusetts and other northern states mobilized their militia , recruiting the regiments up as nearly as possible to full strength . This alarm subsided presently . But Pope 's defeat at second Bull Run , August 30 , left the capital in genuine peril , and caused a hasty call for 300,000 more troops , to serve nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was immediate need for reinforcements . Col. Burrell was in militia camp at Medford with his regiment when the call came ; and at once volunteered . Indeed this was just the chance for which // they had been waiting ? active duty but for a period not so extended as three years . Recruits were needed in order to bring the regiment up to war strength . By some singular perversity , as soon as recruiting began , a situation developed which threatened to destroy the regiment entirely . Col. Burrell and Lt. Col. Thomas L. D. Perkins were both graduates of the 1st Company , Perkins having succeeded Burrell as captain . A bitter jealousy had grown up in Perkins ' mind which made him incapable of rendering loyal support to his chief . Maj. George W. Beach shared Lt. Col. Perkins ' feeling and cooperated in his insubordination . Needless to say , Col. Burrell gave no real ground whatever for this feeling . After the deadlock had continued for more than a month , during which the regiment made little progress in filling its ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take strenuous measures . Another command , the 54th of Worcester county , was similarly in need of men . The men already belonging to the 42d ( as Burrell 's command became known , possibly with some reference to the proud record made by the 42d or Black Watch Highlanders in the British army ) were consolidated into the 1st and 3d Companies ; new 7th and loth Companies were formed in Boston and Dorchester ; 2d and 9th Companies were drawn from the 54th , while Boston , Medway and Weymouth provided units for the four vacancies . Capt . George Sherive commanded the 1st Company , Capt . George P. Davis the 2d ( or Ware Company ) , Capt . Alfred N. Proctor ( a photographer , and one of the indistinguishable " Proctor twins " ) the 3d , Capt . Charles A. Pratt the 4th , Capt . David W. Bailey the 5th , Capt . Ira B. Cook the 6th ( from Medway ) , Capt . Orville W. Leonard ( who had been a private in the 6th Regiment during the ninety-days service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 8th ( from Weymouth ) , Capt . John D. Coggswell the 9th ( of Leicester ) , and Capt . Cyrus Savage the loth or Dorchester Company . All the newer elements proved to be congenial , the Worcester county men being especially good soldiers , with the exception however of the 5th Company . This unit was gathered in too much of a hurry , contained a " tough " element , and was a constant cause of discord . No one could then foresee that the regimental number , 54th , released by the consolidation of companies in the 42d , would presently be immortalized by Col. Robert Gould Shaw 's heroic black men . In accordance with law , the company officers proceeded to elect regimental officers , and bestowed the chief honor upon Col. Burrell . Perkins and Beach tried hard to prevent this , but in vain ; the electors were seeking the best soldier , and cared nothing whatever for old jealousies . They proceeded to select Joseph Stedman as Lt. Col. and Frederick G. Stiles of Worcester as Major , thus retiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand of colors was presented to the command ; and on Oct. 14 , the 42d was finally mustered in . Nothing out of the ordinary marked the railroad journey to New York . But progress thereafter , which was by boat , proved to be highly uncomfortable . The transports were small , and not too seaworthy . And worse yet for " landlubbers , " the sea was rough . It is said that the man establishing his claim to possessing the strongest stomach was the man whose digestive organ would throw the farthest . As however all things have an end , the sufferers finally arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi , and once more became habitants of terra firma . From the streets of Boston and the hills of Worcester county to the canebrakes and swamps of Mississippi and // Louisiana is a violent transition , which nothing less tough than the human system could endure . Yet the 42d Regiment survived its journey to the department of the Gulf and may almost be said to have flourished in its new environment . Of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human life . The companies were separated , and were assigned to provost and engineering duty at different stations . Hard-tack and salt beef and pork are not luxurious fare , muddy coffee ( which means usually coffee made with muddy water ) is far from being a dainty beverage , digging is a most unromantic occupation , and even staying awake nights to watch while others sleep does not arouse the finer emotions as much in fact as when set forth by poets . Yet these are the staple elements of a soldier 's life ; and these the 42d enjoyed in abundant profusion . Sensational details were lacking in this experience ; but the service is not the less a thing of which to be proud . Col. Burrell with three of his Boston companies , the 1st , 3d , and loth , were detached to garrison the port of Galveston , Texas , and to co-operate with the Navy there . Of all the 42d Regiment , these companies alone chanced to find themselves " in the limelight . " The Galveston wharf was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy was to shelter the garrison under the protection of its guns . Witnesses disagree as to just how well the latter work was performed . On Jan. 1 , 1863 , the Confederates attacked in overwhelming numbers at a moment when , for some reason , the warships had been withdrawn . Col. Burrell and his men defended themselves heroically and took heavy toll from the attackers . But with five thousand Confederates against three hundred Union soldiers , the result was inevitable . After the Confederates had brought thirtyone pieces of artillery into action , Col. Burrell and his men // surrendered themselves prisoners of war . Highly respected because of their stubborn bravery , the men were soon exchanged ; and upon returning to the Union lines were accorded an ovation . The officers were retained in captivity longer ; and Col. Burrell finally secured release just in season to assume command of his old regiment during its next tour of duty , that of the one hundred days . Other companies of the 42d were in action at Port Hudson , Lafourche Crossing , and Brashear City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going by boat thru Long Island Sound , one of the transports , the " Commodore , " struck a rock off Point Judith , and threatened to founder . The troops had to be taken off in small boats at much discomfort and no little peril , and finished their journey in another craft . On August 2o , 1863 , the men were finally mustered out , their nine months having extended itself into almost a full year . Now , returning , the 42d kept its place in the line of the militia . Meanwhile unattached companies began to exist , which in certain cases aimed to act as reserve or " depot " companies for units of the 1st-42d . This was notably true of the 2d , 3d , 5th , and 6th Companies . The 1st Regiment was treading its bloody path of glory and approaching the time when it would return to Massachusetts and home . It disbanded upon its muster-out of the U. S. service , May 28 , 1864 ; and many of its members were glad to join these reserve companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need became urgent for more troops . Gen. Grant , the new Lieut . Gen. and Commander-in-chief , had assembled all available men for the reinforcement of his mobile army in April , 1864 , withdrawing so many of the defenders of Washington as to leave the national capital exposed to attack . In July such a raid was actually made // under the vigorous leadership of Gen. Jubal A. Early ; and came uncomfortably near to succeeding . So a call was issued for short-term volunteers who should garrison fortified posts , and release the long-term men for active service . All the " hurrah " spirit had gone out of the war by 1864 ? indeed men were too weary to feel enthusiasm of any kind . There is therefore something all the finer in the grim way in which the 42d and the unattached companies responded to this call . Remarkable as it may seem , eight of the companies which served during the nine months ' tour had retained their organization sufficiently to respond a second time . As one of those missing in 1864 was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , not Chelsea ) the task of recruiting the needed units was not altogether an unwelcome one . Samuel A. Waterman commanded the 1st Company , Benjamin R. Wales the 2d , Alanson H. Ward ( later a captain in the 61st Inf. ) the 3d , Augustus Ford ( who had been 1st Sergeant and 1st Lt. during the previous year ) the 4th , George M. Stewart the new 5th Company , Benjamin C. Tinkham ( sergeant during the nine-months ' service ) the 6th , Isaac B. White ( 1st Lt. the year previous ) the 7th , Warren French the new 8th , Samuel S. Eddy ( a 2d Lt. in the 51st during its nine months in North Carolina ) the 9th , and James T. Stevens ( 1st Lt. in the 4th Reg. during its three months in 1861 ) the loth . The same field officers were in command . The happiest rivalry existed between the Boston companies and those from Worcester county , in their attempt each to bring the largest numbers and finest personnel forward in response to the new call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the revived regiment . Entering Federal service on July 20 , the regiment was assigned to the defences of Washington , and stationed at Alexandria , // Virginia . Here they formed part of the " outer picket " of the capital , and in addition furnished train-guards to protect railroad transportation from Washington to the Shenandoah Valley , the men detailed to service on the freight-cars being the only members of the 42d coming under Confederate fire during the present tour of duty . Col. Burrell came back from his southern prison just in season to rejoin his command at Alexandria . While the regiment had enlisted for one hundred days , its service continued thirteen days over time , and the men were mustered out Nov. i 1 . There seemed to be unlimited reserves of vitality in the 1st and 3d Companies ? indeed one is reminded of the way bees swarm from a hive as one notes how these wonderful organizations made contribution after contribution to the army and yet remained as vigorous as ever . All honor to the old Roxbury Artillery and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three-year regiment , in the 42d on its first tour , and again on its second service . The Fusiliers did even more . Besides these three " bits , " they sent the 7th Unattached Company , on May 4 , 1864 , for ninety days ' duty on Gallop 's Island , Boston , under command of Capt . Albert E. Proctor , who in civil life was well known as a popular Boston clothier , and was the other indistinguishable " twin . " Again on Aug. 18 of that year they made up Co . I ( of the 4th Mass . Heavy Artillery for ten months ' service in Washington , D. C. , under the same Capt . Proctor . Meanwhile they maintained their " depot " company in a state of efficiency . Certainly they justified the sentiment of their ancient motto , Aut vincere aut mori , with all emphasis on the " victory " and never a thought of " death .

And the " 4th Unattached Company " which garrisoned the fort later to be known as " Rodman , " in New Bedford harbor for ninety days from May 3 , later became the 5th Company in the regiment . Likewise the " 9th Unattached Company , " which was to become the 6th Company in the regiment two years later , on May to , 1864 , began a ninety days ' tour of garrison duty on Gallop 's Island , Boston Harbor . How the units of the regiment kept coming back to the artillery branch thruout the war ! The regiment had originally been artillery ; and the virus seemed to be in the regimental blood . The old cannon were not returned to the state until 1861 . The three-year command served as artillery for three weeks of 1861 in Washington , and for two weeks of 1863 in New York . Co .

Well may the 1st-42d Regiment feel interest in Edward Simmons ' splendid mural painting in the State House , the " Return of the Colors . " For on the day of that ceremony , Dec. 22 , 1865 , color-bearers of both regiments were present ; and both are given place in the picture . The war was over . These symbols of patriotism for which brave men had sacrificed life were returning to the custody of the Commonwealth who gave them . Was ever Forefathers ' day more sacred than that ? The " land of the Pilgrim 's pride " had now become the " land where " and for which " our fathers died . " CHAPTER V THE FIGHTING FIRST W. F. Fox , in his " Regimental Losses , " published in 1889 , includes a chapter entitled " The three hundred fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a semi-official roll-of-honor . Of the more than two thousand regiments on the Union side during the Civil War he found three hundred which lost over one hundred thirty each , killed or died of wounds . While the number of casualties might not always indicate fighting ability , or even fighting experience , still in the long run the blood-marked trail of killed and wounded does surely lead to where the battle was most severe . Amongst the three hundred fighting regiments stands the 1st Mass . Vol . Inf. , three-year troops , another name for the Coast Artillery . Of our various companies who went out during the three wars in which we have participated , all losses by killed or died of wounds were confined to those in the Civil War . No such casualties occurred in 1814 or in 1898 . The 3d Reg. lost 2 , the one company in the 4th 1 , the one company in the 13th 10 , the single company in the 4th and 29th 5 , the company in the 5th 4 , the 42d 4 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regiments officered by us , the 24th lost 92 , and the 44th 10 ; but it is not fair to reckon these as our casualties . In contrast with the total of 29 , the 1st Mass . Vol . Inf. lost 144 , besides 643 discharged for disease or wounds . There can be no question but that our companies constituting the 1st Mass . Inf. , the threeyear regiment , deserve the appellation , " the Fighting First . " // As soon as the regiment found that their services would not be accepted for three months , they set to work preparing for a three-year enlistment . Lt. Col. Burrell and others who could not go for the long term organized themselves into a reserve or " depot " regiment . New companies which had been added in April with a view to entering the three months ' service brought the total up to ten ; and these all gladly entered into the three-year enlistment . The Chadwick Light Infantry , named for Hon. Joseph H. Chadwick of Roxbury , a liberal contributor toward the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulaski Guards , newcomers in the regiment , shifted from 9th to 4th place . Members of the Chelsea Light Infantry , a 7th Regiment command which had just been disbanded because of the disobedience of its captain , resented the false position in which they were placed ; and hastened in a body , on April 19 , to the State House where , with Gov . Andrew himself presiding , they reorganized and forthwith received a charter as the " Chelsea Volunteers . " This accomplished , the new unit at once became the 5th Company in the 1st Regiment . While there had been two 7th Companies within a month , both had gone off with other regiments ; and the vacant number was now filled by the North End True Blues . The True Blues consisted of caulkers , gravers and riggers from the ship-yards . They had begun their history many years previously as a fire-engine company , and in 1832 had taken up military training . But it was not until April , 1861 , that they regularly connected themselves with the militia . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacant by the transfer of the Boston Artillery . The National Guards , newcomers in the regiment but with a history running back to the Mexican war , assumed the 9th number . And the Schouler Guards , named after the popuThe // lar Adjutant General of Massachusetts , became the loth Company . Col. Cowdin remained in command , and speedily demonstrated that he was as capable a leader in actual warfare as he had been during the years of peace . One notable and somewhat unusual trait was discovered by his associates ? he never , under any circumstances , would permit a drop of alcoholic liquor to pass his lips . George D. Wells , judge of the Boston municipal court , went as Lieutenant Colonel , and soon gained the reputation of excelling even his chief as a tactician . He afterward became colonel of the 34th Mass . Inf. , and was killed at Cedar Creek in 1864 . Charles P. Chandler of the new 8th Company was chosen Major ; and was destined to die in battle a year later , at Glendale in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ebenezer W. Stone , Jr. ; 2d , Abiel G. Chamberlain , afterwards a colonel of colored troops ; 3d , Henry A. Snow , commander of the company as far back as 1849 ; 4th , Clark B. Baldwin , afterwards Lt. Col. ; 5th , Sumner Carruth , later Colonel of the 35th Mass . Inf. ; 6th , Edward Pearl ; 7th , Gardner Walker , who was to succeed Chandler as Major ; 8th , Edward A. Wild , later a Major of the 32d Mass . Inf. ; 9th , Alfred W. Adams ; and loth , Charles E. Rand . The loth was the only company destined to lose its commander in action , Capt . Rand being killed at Chancellorsville , and by a singular fatality , his successor , Capt . Moses H. Warren at Spotsylvania . In consequence of the regiment 's prompt decision , they were able to be mustered in as volunteers on May 25 , 1861 , ? the first three-year organization in the entire United States . The regiment journeyed by rail from Boston and reached Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Passing thru Baltimore they were very cautious , having in mind the experience of their comrades less than two months before . But the city was then actually under complete Federal control . Blackburn 's Ford , the preliminary skirmish of Bull Run , on July 18 , 1861 , first brought the regiment under fire . Lieut . Albert S. Austin lost his revolver at this time , ; ? judge of his pleasant surprise when , in 1896 , receiving a package from a Confederate veteran , he opened it and discovered the long-missing weapon . This revolver may now be seen in the collection of the A. &; H. Art . Co . Part of an army all of whose members were inexperienced , it is greatly to their credit that they were chosen as rear-guard of the retreating Federals after the main battle of Bull Run , July 21 . Perhaps it was because of the reputation gained here that the 1st came to be frequently detailed to the responsible rearguard position . They served in this capacity during the change of base on the Peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They covered the retreat of the army after Fredericksburg . But it is safe to say that they were never more valuable as rear-guard than when at Bull Run they steadily held their place behind the torrent of panic-stricken fugitives and prevented the victors from pressing the pursuit . This transpired during their first battle , when they had been less than three months in the service . Their gray militia uniforms in which the regiment went to war cost them dearly at Blackburn 's Ford and Bull Run . Facing troops similarly attired , Lieut . W. H. B. Smith of the 3d Company called out that he and his men were from Massachusetts , thinking that he was talking to other northern soldiers . But his words were greeted with a volley by which the lieutenant lost his life . Later in the action a 6o The Old First // similar explanation by Capt . Carruth of the 5th Company barely prevented a Michigan regiment from firing on the First . Immediately after the battle new blue uniforms were issued . Three weeks of garrison duty at Fort Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiment was drilled in the use of heavy artillery . August 13 , they were transferred to Bladensburg on the other side of Washington , where they first came under the command , as part of the brigade , of Gen. Hooker . Serving with him in succession as brigade , division , corps and army commander , they always felt especially devoted to their chief . It is no accident that Capt . Isaac P. Gragg of ours wrote in 1900 a book affectionately tracing the careers and homes of Hooker 's ancestors . The same veteran and his comrades bore a leading part in securing the Hooker statue on the State House grounds , dedicated in 1903 . In March , 1862 , the regiment received their " white diamond " badges , of which they were always so proud , the // Army of the Potomac then being organized into four corps , and they forming part of the second division ( Hooker 's ) of the third corps . They were engaged in provost or garrison duty in Maryland during the winter of ' 61- ' 62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budd 's Ferry . From Yorktown to Spotsylvania , during two entire years , the regiment bore the white flag of Massachusetts and had an honorable part in all the battles of the Army of the Potomac , with the exception of South Mountain and Antietam , which occurred while they were recuperating at Washington . They were heavily engaged at Williamsburg , May 5 , 1862 , where Hooker won the soubriquet , " Fighting Joe , " of which he was never proud . Here also Col. Cowdin earned the brigadier-generalship , which was tentatively awarded him Sept. 26 , and of which he was eventually deprived for political reasons . Col. Cowdin had the misfortune to be antagonized by the Republican Governor of Massachusetts , and by the U. S. Senators from the Commonwealth ; the Senate refused to confirm his appointment . The sword carried by Col. Cowdin at Williamsburg is today in the Faneuil Hall armory of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company . The regiment lost heavily at Fair Oakes , June 25 , and Glendale , June 30 , when Major Charles P. Chandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aug. 29 , and Chantilly , Sept. 1 , their effective numbers were reduced to less than six hundred . It is a pointed testimony to the high cost of military unpreparedness that many of the brave men were incapacitated , not by wounds , but by preventable disease . While Gen. George B. McClellan 's ability has been a subject of prolonged controversy , the general never lacked for loyal and devoted support from the members of the First . // Yorktown is historic ground . Going by water from Budd 's Ferry , the regiment landed upon the same shore which Washington 's Continentals had trodden eighty years earlier . Their progress thru the fields of yellow broom was over ground rendered memorable by the Revolutionary heroes . Near the present beautiful National cemetery and in sight of the present charming Yorktown battle-monument stood a Confederate intrenchment which occasioned annoyance to McClellan 's army . It had withstood two assaults , and was in the way of the army 's advance . Lt. Col. Wells offered to take the work ; and his offer was accepted . Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony " Wayne achieved immortality ; the appeal now would be to cold steel . About 2 A. M. the 5th , 8th and loth companies were quietly awakened , the 5th to make the attack , and the others to serve as supports . The men formed their line amid the silence of the woods ; and , at earliest dawn , heard their commander whisper , " This is McClellan 's first order . The honor of Massachusetts is in your keeping . Charge ! " Across four hundred yards of miry , uneven ground they advanced in the face of Confederate rifle fire . Arriving at the redoubt , with a shout for old Massachusetts , they fired a single volley ; and completed their task with the bayonet . Just ten minutes after Col. Wells ' command , the intrenchment was in Union hands . An old lithograph of this action is to be seen in the museum of the Cadet Armory , Boston . Four members of the 5th Company were here killed . April 26 was the date of the assault ; four days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were received with a magnificent demonstration of honor in Chelsea . One of the dead , Private Allen A. Kingsbury of Medfield , // was specially honored by the publication of a memorial biography . The battle of Williamsburg was almost a private affair with Hooker 's division . Williamsburg , the " cradle of the republic " and birthplace of the American revolution , had once been a proud capital . It is today , and always has been , noted for the warm-hearted hospitality of its citizens . It was there that Washington earned his degree as civil engineer , and there he wooed and won his bride . There Patrick Henry thundered forth the brave words , " If that be treason , make the most of it . " And there today the two sons of President John Tyler reside , one serving as county judge and the other as president of " William and Mary College . " But so early as 1862 the glory had departed , and the shabbiness which accompanies slavery was dominant . There on May 5 , 1862 , amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnston halted his retreat and engaged in a rear-guard action . His entrenchments were shallow ; but the pursuing Federal troops were few ? only a single division . Hence the fighting was severe . When finally the 1st Regiment marched thru the town and up " Duke of Gloucester " St. in pursuit of the broken Confederate column , they felt that they had fully earned their laurels . While most of the Union army went up the York river by boat , the 1st Regiment made the journey on land . Altho the country was naturally fertile and the climate of the best , a general seediness and " run down " condition prevailed , so that it was like a desert to the weary , hungry marchers . Finally the Williamsburg road brought the troops to Seven Pines ? the spot from whose tree-tops could be seen the spires of Richmond , six miles away . Doubtless everyone has passed thru some experience so terrible that it comes // back in his moments of nightmare . Seven Pines and Savage 's Station fill that role for veterans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a National cemetery , a veritable God 's acre , sacred to the memory of the dead , melodious with the voice of cat-bird and mocking-bird and the graceful killdeer . There the magnolia grows to perfection and the luscious fig matures in the summer sunshine . But this district , usually so dry and substantial , is at the edge of the Chickahominy or White Oak Swamp . From May 31 to June 25 , 1862 , unusually severe rains swelled the Chickahominy and inundated the surrounding country . Fortunately there are islands in the swamp , places of partial refuge , to which our men resorted . McClellan 's plan called for a junction with the army of Irvin McDowell about June 1 , and for a grand assault by the combined forces upon the Confederate Johnston . For reasons which seemed adequate to the authorities in Washington , notwithstanding the serious results for McClellan and his army , McDowell was forbidden to march south and keep his appointment . While McClellan waited , and while the floods refused to abate , the Army of the Potomac was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's successor , attacked nearly every day . Mosquitoes bit , and the result thereof was malaria . Finally the ground was dug over and fought over so constantly that there was time neither to care for the wounded nor bury the dead ; and a condition of horror ensued which surpasses all power of description . Men actually had to sleep side by side with their dead comrades , ? comrades who had been dead for days . It is very easy to understand why the Peninsular campaign developed into a retreat ; a month of such fighting was all that flesh and blood could endure . Not even the issue of a whiskey ration , which commenced at this time , could sufficiently blunt the soldiers ' senses ? altho it did acThe // complish vast moral damage . So when McClellan became convinced that he would not have McDowell 's co-operation , he turned back ; he could do nothing else . It was easier in the north to organize new regiments with their numerous openings for the appointment of officers , and with the enlisted men starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterans and others as " rookies . " Nevertheless this system resulted in depleting the older and more experienced regiments , and cost the government millions of dollars in unnecessary expense . Massachusetts , by contrast with other states , did recruit up her three-year regiments , and endeavored to keep their ranks filled , even tho the later accessions had to be given the privilege of taking discharges with their regiments at the end of less than three years . Sept. 5 , 1862 , a large number of recruits arrived , who had been enlisted by officers of the 1st in Massachusetts , and who brought the companies once more up to one hundred each . About the same time there was an exchange of prisoners , and the men who returned from their unwilling residence in southern cities had many interesting experiences to relate . After the Peninsular campaign , as regiments became reduced in size to not more than five hundred men , the government decided to economize by dismissing the regimental bands , and substituting brigade bands . The First bade regretful farewell to their musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake . Much of the hard fighting done by the 1st Regiment took place within a very limited area . Fredericksburg , Chancellorsville , the Wilderness and Spotsylvania all lie within a few square miles , and all can be visited by automobile within half a day . Moreover a visitor can not fail to be impressed with the fact that these battle-fields seem to have // been selected so as to destroy the least possible amount of private property . Outside of the actual city of Fredericksburg , the country is little better than pine-barren , and contains few houses and not even much cultivated land . Since we now know pines to be health-giving , and well-drained sandy soil to be freest from disease germs , we can see how this choice of battle-fields by the Army of the Potomac doubtless saved lives as well as property . The climate too is free from extremes . But the men of 1863 and 1864 did not appreciate these things ; all that they had time to notice were the dust and drought and heat and hunger and hard fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly south toward Richmond , crossing the Rappahannock on pontoon bridges . It was a winter battle ? the date was Dec. 13 , 1862 ? with great discomfort and a fair chance that wounded men would freeze to death . Fifer Bardeen tells that one captain , Walker , trembled as he entered the battle ? and Capt . Walker was the bravest of the brave . Lee had every advantage of position ; the resulting disaster was inevitable . About two months after Col. Cowdin 's promotion , as the regiment were covering the retreat of the army from Fredericksburg , they were introduced to their new colonel . Napoleon B. McLoughlin , in spite of his French-Irish name , was a Vermont Yankee . He had entered the regular army from the New York 7th , and at the time of his appointment to the Colonelcy was a captain in the 6th U. S. Cavalry . He was respected and well liked ; but he always suffered from the fact that the men felt him somewhat of an interloper . Capt . Baldwin of the 4th Company had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made Colonel . However Col. McLoughlin held the esteem of his // men , and made an honorable record . His regular army strictness was beneficial to his new command . On Feb. 9 , 1863 , two months after the arrival of the new colonel , the regiment was subjected to an extremely rigid inspection ; and was pronounced one of the eleven best disciplined and most efficient regiments of the one hundred fifty constituting the Army of the Potomac . Chancellorsville , May 2 and 3 , 1863 , was the next great battle . Gen. J. Hooker crossed the Rappahannock several miles above Fredericksburg and tried to turn Lee 's left flank . Hooker unexpectedly came into collision with Stonewall Jackson 's troops and instead of hurting Lee , almost suffered the humiliation of seeing his own right flank crumpled up . At the most critical moment of the Chancellorsville fight , Hooker was wounded and the army left without a head . When O. O. Howard 's 11th corps broke and ran ( " started for Germany " ) , it was only the 1st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union army from destruction . Their promptness in entering the breach in the lines , and their stubborn courage in remaining there hour after hour , were all that checked the on-rushing Confederates . At Chancellorsville the regiment was for the first time serving under both of its best-loved commanders , Gens . Hooker and Sickles . On the night following Howard 's break , according to common belief amongst the men , it fell to their fate to be the slayers of Gen. " Stonewall " Jackson , one of the severest blows to the Confederate cause during the entire war . The 6th and loth Companies were on outpost when a party of Confederate horsemen rode down the Plank Road toward their lines . As a result of the volley then fired , Gen Jackson fell , the identification being made complete by Sergt. Charles F. Ferguson of the loth Company , who was a // prisoner-of-war for a few minutes , and happened to be close to the mounted officers when the fire was received . Ferguson made his escape in the ensuing confusion . This event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While others claim to have been the agents of Jackson 's removal , and altho the Southerners say that their own men fired the fatal shots , still there is no good reason for rejecting the contention of the 1st Regiment , ? in fact the evidence seems conclusive that our claim is valid . The plain shaft which marks the spot where Jackson fell is a painful reminder to men of the 1st . Returning a year later , at the opening of the battle of the Wilderness , May 5 and 6 , 1864 , they were stationed upon the very ground over which they had fought in ' 63 . And when , during a lull in the fighting , they inspected their surroundings , they found human bones and fragments of clothing sufficient to identify some of their own regimental dead . The bodies of those slain at Chancellorsville had never been buried . No wonder that men shuddered as they saw the " buzzards " soaring over head . Deep was the discouragement preceding Gettysburg . The failure at Chancellorsville had been due to no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever meet Lee on favorable terms . They were not fond of Meade . Their march thru Maryland and into Pennsylvania was the most trying of the entire war . On June 25 , 1863 , after following the muddy tow-path of the C. &; O. Canal all day , only two footmen were able to keep with the mounted officers until night-fall . Stragglers kept coming in during the entire night . Then , at Gettysburg , on the July days of 1863 , July 1 , 2 , and 3 , the tide finally turned , and the rebellion began to ebb away . Historians differ concerning the relative importance of // the second and third days at Gettysburg . Gen. Sheridan in 1880 , and Gen. Longstreet in 1902 , and Capt . J. Long in his " Sixteenth Decisive Battle of the World , " published in 1906 , took the ground that the battle was won on the second day , by Sickles and the third corps . Gen. Sickles had been posted on low ground to the north of " Little Round Top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumple up the Union left flank , just as Jackson had crushed the Union right at Chancellorsville , he determined to prevent such a disaster by moving his corps forward to the higher ground , running north from the Peach Orchard along the Emmetsburg road . The 1st Mass . Inf. , at the " Peter Rogers house , " held the most advanced position of the entire army . As a consequence Longstreet had no more than started when he unexpectedly came upon Sickles ' men , where he found plenty to keep him busy and was unable to crush anyone . At the day 's close the Union regiments were compelled to fall back to Round Top . But meanwhile , by Longstreet 's own admission , the Confederate plans had failed entirely and Lee had been defeated . The gallant charge of the Virginians on the third day was only a desperate final attempt by a beaten arrny , before commencing its retreat . Near the Peter Rogers house , in 1886 , was erected the regimental monument of the First , a granite " white diamond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1863 , from 11 A. M. t0 6.30 P. M. , the First Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , Lieut. - Col . Clark B. Baldwin commanding , occupied this spot in support of its skirmish line Soo ft. in advance . The Regiment subsequently took position in the brigade line and was engaged until the close of the action . Casualties : Killed , 18 ; Died of wounds , 9 ; Wounded , 8o ; Prisoners , 15 ; Total , 122 . " ' But for Sickles ' advanced stand with the third corps on July 2 , there would not have been a third day at // Gettysburg . A model of the regimental monument may be seen at the museum of the Loyal Legion in the Cadet Armory , Boston . Corporal Nathaniel M. Allen of the 6th Company was later awarded the Congressional medal of honor for here bringing off the regimental colors at the greatest personal risk , after the color sergeant had fallen . Col. Baldwin and Adjutant Mudge were wounded . It was on this same day that Lieut . James Doherty of the loth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle fire , by calmly exercising them in the manual of arms . Doherty was a character . A most gallant officer , he had risen from the ranks and never lost his fellow feeling for the enlisted men . An ex-sailor , he had the sailor 's vices . Once , in 1863 , while passing thru Baltimore , he became drunk , and tried to kill an officer of another regiment . Had not Col. Baldwin seized a musket and clubbed Doherty over the head , murder would have been done . In New York he was placed under charges for telling his commanding general that he " lied . " But the charges were never pressed ; perhaps the accusation was true . At Chancellorsville he was wounded in the finger by a bullet which managed to wind itself about the bone . Doherty roundly cursed the enemy for using defective lead . The brave lieutenant finally died in battle . A well-loved member of the regiment , Corp . Albert A. Farnham of the 4th Company , was taken prisoner at Gettysburg , and died in Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to dysentery caused by insufficient and unsuitable food . His soldier 's hymn-book is in the museum of the A. &; H. Art . Co . July 3o to Oct. 7 , the regiment was one of four on provost duty in New York City , guarding against further draf triots , and preventing conscripts from deserting . Here they // resumed heavy artillery drill ; and incidentally became rested after the Gettysburg campaign . A new commander directed the army in the Wilderness , Lieutenant General U. S. Grant . The difference of men showed itself in the different result . Altho the 1st , now under Gen. W. S. Hancock , and the other Union regiments were handled as roughly in 1864 as they had been in 1863 , when they left the field of battle , it was to march southward past Lee 's flank rather than northward toward security . Scrub oak and pine have obliterated practically all traces of the great fight . But men can never forget that the Wilderness proved that the tide had turned , and marked a long step toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wilderness with the fighting increased , if possible , in ferocity . On May 12 , the culminating day at the " bloody angle , " the 1st Regiment was heavily engaged for the last time in its career . During the morning it acted as provost guard immediately behind the firing line , with orders to permit no one to pass to the rear excepting wounded men . In the afternoon it was advanced into the very thickest of the conflict and assigned the task of covering part of the Confederate line with a curtain of fire . Here both armies intrenched , and charged each other 's earthworks . The fighting was amid tangled underbrush wherein one could see only a few feet ahead ; at such short range the bullet gave way to the bayonet and even to the clubbed rifle . When the combat continued after darkness had fallen , the fighting increased in intensity . Someone had to yield ? Lee retreated . The apples which today grow at the bloody angle should be redder and the corn should bear more red ears , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heroes . As they approached the completion of their enlistment // the 1st Regiment were stationed with the reserves . Here , on May 19 , they took part in their last engagement , at Anderson 's Plantation , on the road to Fredericksburg ? and home . R. S. Ewell 's corps of Confederates came around Grant 's right flank and attempted to cut communications with the north and to capture the wagon-trains . A brigade of heavy artillery regiments fresh from the defenses of Washington were acting as convoy ? one of them being the 1st Mass . Heavy Artillery from Salem . Here the Salem men have erected their regimental monument . The heavy artillery had seen but little fighting ; but they now stood up like veterans and drove back an entire corps . Unfortunately the Confederates were taking some of the wagons with them as they drew back ; and it remained for the 1st Inf. and their companions in the brigade , some 1,200 in all , to rush to the rescue and recover the lost train . While both 1st Mass. regiments ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 1st Inf. had learned by long experience to make use of " cover , " to shelter themselves behind trees , stones and earthworks . It was largely this skill that enabled them to stop the panic and save the Union army at Chancellorsville . Now , on this less important field , it saved Grant 's wagons from capture . Then came the welcome order to return to Boston and be mustered out . A great reception awaited the regiment in Boston . Gen. Cowdin was grand marshal of the parade , and all Boston came to extend the hand of welcome . Gen. Cowdin had been honored that year by election as Captain of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company , and of course was loyally supported by this command in all the exercises connected with the reception . Another ex-Colonel of the regiment , Gen. Walter E. Lombard in 1916 , was similarly to be honThe Fighting First 75 , ored by America 's oldest military organization . A grim pathos obtruded itself upon the spirit of the festivities ; for of the 1,651 men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 25 , 1864 , to be mustered out . The command had been in twenty general actions ; and nine of its seventyone officers had been killed . It marched 1,263 miles , travelled by rail 1,325 miles , and on transports 724 . The regiment gave three general officers to the army , and ninety-one other officers to sister regiments . A number of noted clergymen have at times held the office of chaplain of the command . Applying the standards which control the selection of names for the volume , " Who 's Who , " amongst the distinguished chaplains would certainly have to be mentioned Otis A. Skinner , the noted journalist and preacher , 1850- ' 55 ; Thomas B. Thayer , the writer , 1858- ' 61 ; Jacob M. Manning , the lecturer , 1862- ' 63 ; Lewis B. Bates , father of ex-Gov . Bates , 1868- ' 72 ; Alonzo H. Quint , the ecclesiastical statesman , 1872- ' 76 ; William H. H. ( " Adirondack " ) Murray , devotee of horses and woodcraft , 1873- ' 76 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 96 ; and Edward A. Horton , the orator , Chaplain of the Mass . State Senate , 1896-1900 . Preeminent among them stands the name of the war chaplain , Warren H. Cudworth , 1861- ' 72 , ' 76- ' 82 . Chaplain Cudworth possesses the added distinction that he was the historian of the " Fighting First . " Warren H. Cudworth had graduated from Harvard in 185o ; and represented the finest type of American culture . If size of hat indicates mental caliber , his chapeau , sacredly preserved at the Soldiers ' Home , Chelsea , proves him to have been an intellectual giant . For it is number seven and one-half . Since 1852 he had been pastor of the Unitarian " Church of Our Father " in East Boston . A bachelor , and of independent means financially , he was able to prove his // patriotism before receiving appointment as chaplain by announcing to his church that , if he should not secure the appointment , he would give his salary as minister to maintain work among the soldiers . The church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of worship ; this the pastor urged them not to spend as intended , but to devote the money to the welfare of the Union soldiers . When appointed , he gave himself unreservedly to the duties of the office ; and absented himself from his regiment only once , for a single week of Aug. , ' 61 , during the entire three years . While not a " fighting chaplain " as some were , he was in every sense a brave soldier and true gentleman . Believing that the better American one is , the better American soldier he is , Cudworth both preached and exemplified this part of his creed . His Massachusetts pride revealed itself in his comments upon the inferior standards of living and comfort as one progressed southward . His scholarly interest in history and science kept showing thruout all his writings . Bladensburg is noted as the field of the disastrous militia defeat in 1814 ; there is no glossing over the uncomfortable facts . Bladensburg is also the duelling-ground where Commodore Barron killed Decatur in 1820 . A scientific observer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Yorktown the regiment was encamped on historic ground , where Washington 's tents had stood , and Cornwallis surrendered , in 1781 . But he somehow fails to note there the oldest custom-house in America . One is reminded of high-school days to hear him commenting upon McClellan 's bridges over the Chickahominy ? that they were exact reproductions of Caesar 's famous span across the Rhine . Cudworth comments appreciatively upon the notable past of the Fairfax family , so // influential in moulding the career of George Washington ; of the Chancellors ; and even records facts about Prince Frederick , father of George III , after whom Fredericksburg was named . Fossils and other geological remains unearthed by regimental well-diggers on the Peninsula interest him . But his chief interest was in men and their welfare . The degradation which he saw occasioned by slavery brought sorrow to his heart . The untidy appearance of Williamsburg and other Virginia towns ? a consequence of slavery ? impressed him , as it does the visitor today . None rejoiced more than he over the issuance of the emancipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a clear pronouncement for justice and righteousness was more potent than many victories . At Williamsburg he commented on the generous hospitality of the southerners ; he was also amused by quaint epitaphs in the old Bruton parish cemetery . At the close of the Peninsular campaign he manifested his social interest by commenting that the army was then existing in accordance with ideal industrial conditions ? eight hours daily for work , eight for rest , and eight for recreation . When a whiskey ration was instituted in 1862 , he deplored the resultant moral evils . Such a chaplain would do everything possible for the welfare of the men . During the first leisure season in the regiment 's existence , that in 1861 at Budd 's Ferry , he organized a chess club which conducted exciting tournaments ; a literary institute or debating society named after Mayor Frank B. Fay of Chelsea ; and a large temperance society bearing the name of their total-abstinence Colonel , Cowdin , which enrolled nearly two hundred soldiers on its pledge , and had fully one-third of the regiment " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indeed the social center of the camp . // Most important of all was his religious organization . The Y. M. C. A. had not then been introduced ; so the chaplain devised an association , which he termed " The Church of the First Regiment . " Their admirable covenant , by which they existed , " You now solemnly covenant , in the presence of God and these your fellow-soldiers , that you will endeavor , by the help of grace , to walk in all the ordinances of the gospel blameless , adorning your Christian profession by a holy life and a godly conversation , " has received much unsolicited praise ; and has afforded an inspiring model for other military chaplains . Chaplain Cudworth was idolized by the men . They affectionately called him " Holy Jo " ; and he accepted the title as a mark of affection , stipulating however that they must never pervert it into " unholy Jo . " Fifer Bardeen of the 1st Company tells how , in a New York barber-shop , he thrilled the crowd by a narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a boyhood scar on his head . After he had told enough " whoppers " to set himself up as a hero , he glanced into the mirror and was thunderstruck to see " Holy Jo " occupying the next chair but one . The chaplain knew Bardeen well , and also knew just how true the yarn was not . But under the circumstances he showed his real self by utterly failing to recognize or embarrass the youthful hero . No wonder that Bardeen later wrote concerning the chaplain , " He was a good man , a patriot and a Christian , ready to pray with you at the proper time but never obtruding his piety , and always ready to help you in any way . There was no other officer in the regiment who approached him for genuine manhood of the highest type . " Chaplain Cudworth 's passing was in keeping with the rest of his life . His death was that of a Christian soldier . It happened on Thanksgiving day , 1883 , while the Chaplain // was participating in a union observance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maverick Congregational " of East Boston . As he was standing beside the pulpit in the very act of offering public prayer , suddenly he was heard to exclaim in pain , " I can not go on .
