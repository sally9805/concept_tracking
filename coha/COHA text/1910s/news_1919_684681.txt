txt MORE WORK THE REMEDY . Ten Hours a Day Needed Instead of Eight for a Time : The newspapers of the ' United States have never had the opportunity to render a greater service to the whole people than they have today . Let them tell the people in plain English , so all may understand , what is the real cause . of high ' living costs  --  profiteering , continuous in some , but surely not all cases . Extravagance and waste are to be found everywhere , and the term " high living costs " should be changed to the scale of " high living . " If living costs are so very far above the income of the worker , how can we account for the altogether unparalleled volume of business being done in all retail lines , especially those catering to the masses ? Again , railroad traveling in all direo . Lions , amusements , and in many other avenues , money is being expended with a lavishness and recklessness that certainly do not Indicate worry over income . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present living costs . Demand is so far in excess of supply that . either we must all work harder and longer to produce more , or we must exercise certain restraint and thrift and consume less . There can be no permanent relief until production overreaches demand , and all governmental , regulations or legislation notwithstanding will be mere palliatives and not cures . An appeal should be . made to the workers of the country that for a limited period , ' until such ' time as : production somewhat approaches demand , the eighthour work day be set aside for a full ten-hour day , and when conditions become somewhat normal the industrial world will again return to an eight-hour basis .
