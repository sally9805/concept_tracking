txt After prolonged debate , the Assembly to-day voted , OS to 42 , to repeal the law enacted last December which provided ' for a referendum at a special election on April 7 next to determine whether a convention should he called for next Spring to revise the State Constitution , The question came before the Assembly in the form of a bill introduced several . weeks oat ) by John Leo Sullivan , who represents the Second District of Chatauqua . Mr. Sullivan is a Progressive Republican . All of the Progressives , with the exception of Leroy J. Weed of Nassau , voted with the Republicans to repeal the law . Three of the members listed as Independents followed the same course . John P. La Frenz , an Independent Democrat of Kings , voted with the Democratic regulars tobsustain the action of last year 's Tammany-ridden Legislature in passing the law providing for the April election . The Sullivan bill now goes to the Senate for action . That body Is still dominated by the Democratic State machine and , it is generally predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the organization is taking no chances . The party whip will be cracked over the Heads of the Democratic Senators before the Sullivan bill comes up for final action in the upper house . It was admitted to-dE ... e3. , - that the Democratic State Committee at its meeting next Saturday would adopt a resolution reaffirming the party attitude as expressed through the passage of the law providing for the I special election . Gov . Glynn this afternoon declined to Say what his action would he on the ' Sullivan bill , if by any chance it should get through the Senate . " I will state my attitude when the bill is submitted to me for my approval , " said the Governor with a smile . " Bythe-bye , did you read the article contributed to TEE New Toast TIM ES by Francis Lynda Stetson ' : I believe Mr. Stetson is looked upon . as pretty good lawyer . " Mr. Stetson expressed his views in a letter to ' THE TM ES- . published this ' morning . Ile upheld.the constitutionality of the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supported by authorities In a letter to THE TIMES printed yesterday . The Governor 's refer , : - cc ' to what Mr. Stetson had to say on the sub ; . ject was interpreted as indicating that he would veto the Sullivan bill if occasion should arise . quotes Marshall Opinion . Assemblyman Sullivan , in debating his his  --  bill , pointed out that never in the tory of the State had the question of whether a constitutional convention should be called been passed upon at a special election . He emphasized the point raised by Mr , Marshall in his letter to THE TIMES that , under the provision made for registration in conneeton with the April election , Section 4 of Article 2 In the Constitution had been violated in that ten full days would not elapse between the registration and the election . In the law passed last December Saturday , March 27 was set aside as the date for registration , while the election will occur on A'PrIl 7 . " This is one of the biggest questions to come before the Legislature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with the organic law of the State . It the Legislature makes a mistake in passing laws , that mistake can be corrected by subsequent Legislatures , but I the Constitution . the fundamental law of the State , can not be changed so easily . " The enactment of the law providing ' for this special election was one of the political crimes of last year 's session . It was . a crime against the taxpayers , for it entails a needless expense of 51,000.000 . The political pirates who sat in that Legislature did not hesitate to prey on the taxpayers for partisan advantages . No good reason was advanced for the enactment of this law , and no good reason can be advanced for retaining it on the statute books . In fact , I think the courts would have it in their power to issue a restraining order against this proposed special election on the - round that it involves a theft of $3,0 ' 00,000 of the taxpayers ' . money . " The opponents of my measure fall back conveniently on their party platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the audacity to pledge itself in its platform to the determination of this important question at a special election . Had the Democrats done so the act would have been repudiated by the voters even more emphatically than Tammany was repudiated in New York City last Fall , if such a thing were possible . " " There are three good reasons why ' this bill should pass , " said William Sulzer , who took his stand with the Republicans on this measure , as he had on other measures creating a direct ! Issue with Tammany . " First , the question ? of whether a Constitutional Convention should be ? held is always submitted : if a general election . If a special election is to be held at all in connection with such a ? convention it should be for the election of delegates . " Second , the repeal of this law will save upward of $1,000,000 . to the tax- , payers . " Third , because there are defects in the law passed during the expiring days ' of last year 's extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts and defeat the ' honest purpose of those who sincerely believe that there should be ' an early and thorough revision of the Constitution . I am opposed to playing polittes with the fundamental law of the State For ways that are dark and tricks that are vain the Tammany tiger is peculiar . Everybody can see Tammany 's motive for last year 's legislation on this subject unless he is so blind that he can not see the holes : n it ladder . " Mr. Sulzer said that Tammany was merely intent upon injecting foreign issues into the Gubernatorial fight this Fall . hence the legislation of last December . Speaks for Progressives . Assemblyman Michael Schaap , leader of the Progressives , said he felt the Progressive Party should go on record emphatically as opposed to the special election , because it had been devised with a view of bring-lug about a purely ' partisan election of delegates . " The day has passed , " said Mr. Schaap , " when the great majority of voters Want to be considered - either Progressives , Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // damental laws . When they do that they want to be known simply as Americans . If we could elect our delegates at a special election I would be inclined to favor it . because such an election would be free from political bias . But such a course would be clearly unconstitutional . " Ex-Speaker Alfred E. Smith , Democratic leader in the Assembly , at this point took up the defense of last year 's law . He expressed the belief that the Republisans were opposing the special election and trying to call off the Constitutional Convention next year for fear that the convention would hasten the day when such large communities as New York City would get a fair representation in the law-making body by the elimination of the constitutional provisions now unduly limiting that representation . " I am credibly informed , " said Mr. Smith , " that the distinguished gentleman from New York . ( Mr. Sulzer , ) who has spoken in favor of repealing this law , when as Governor he visited the inauguration of President Wilson , discussed this question with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passed last year and vetoed by him . So we will amend the touching little poem about the ' Heathen Chinee ' by cutting Tammany out of it altogether and making it read like this : ' For political ways that are dark and political tricks that are vain the gentleman from New York has both the Tammany tiger and the heathen Chinee tied the post . ' " Harold J. Hinman , the majority leader . in closing the debate said that last S'car 's law provided a defective method for electing the delegates in that the Legislature , while enacting a Massachusetts ballot law for general elections , had provided the old column ballot for the election or delegates to the Constitutional Convention . He pointed out that the constitutional amendment Making compulsory a Workmen 's Compensation act already had been passed . that the woman suffrage amendment and the short ballot amendment were under way , and that less necessity for a Constitutional Convention existed now than in many years . " We are passing through an era of experimentation , " said Mr. Hinman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that we do not proceed so hastily in taking up the work of revising our Constitution , but that we pause and bide a time when there should be less unrest in the public mind .
