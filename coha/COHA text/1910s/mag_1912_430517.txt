 | SHAKESPEARE was in no sense precocious , fortunately for him ; as Margaret Fuller once said , " for precocity some great price is always demanded sooner or later in life . " He had begun modestly by editing and by imitating ; and only as he advanced in technical dexterity had he clearly discerned where his real strength lay . He had come to the drama when it was in a period of marvellous expansion and when it had not arrived at any general recognition either of its possibilities or of the best method for their attainment . At first his art as a playwright was inexperienced and experimental . It was a little unlucky for Shakespeare himself ? and it was very unlucky for the dramatists who had to follow him ? that he arrived upon the scene before definite types of tragedy and of comedy had been established . There is advantage for every author in finding a fit formula ready to his hand , since he is then free to express himself as best he can in accord with a pattern which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the framework of Aeschylus as Racine accepted that of Corneille ; they both modified the tradition they derived from these immediate predecessors ; but by it they were relieved from tentative vagueness of effort . Shakespeare was not aided by any strong tradition which he could receive unhesitatingly , although he learned much as a poet from Marlowe and as a playwright from Kyd . He had to blaze his own trail ; and it is no wonder that he sometimes wandered in a circle . As Huxley says , it is when a man can do as he pleases that his troubles begin . In many of the earlier plays we can dis- cover evidences of his groping darkly for a pattern fitted for his immediate purpose . Yet he had already finished his apprenticeship , and mastered the needful technicalities of construction . He had learned the difficult art of exposition ; he had acquired control of contrast ; he had taught himself how to build up an action , intensifying in interest as it rose scene by scene to its culmination ; and he had discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet Shakespeare was by the gift of God ; a psychologist he became by observation and by intuition ; a philosopher he had risen to be as the result of insight and of meditation ; and a playwright he had made himself by hard work , by the absorption of every available trick of the trade which his predecessors and contemporaries had devised , and also by constant and adroit experimenting of his own . He had proved his mastery by tragedies as different as " Romeo and Juliet " and " Hamlet . " It is very strange , therefore , that he should ever have written three plays so comparatively empty of dramatic power as " All 's Well that Ends Well , " " Measure for Measure , " and " Troilus and Cressida . " It is still stranger that he should have written these plays at this period of his development as a dramatist . They contain single scenes that only Shakespeare could have handled , and occasional passages that only he could have phrased ; but none the less are they among his poorest productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferiority of these three pieces is disqualified from a full appreciation of the towering superiority of " Hamlet " and " Romeo and Juliet , " of the " Merchant of Venice " and " As You Like It . " In considering no other group of his pieces is the lack of an ascertained chronology more annoying than in dealing with these sombre plays , two of them comedy-dramas and the third a bitter and ribald satire devoid of the gaiety of true comedy . All the evidence tends to prove that these three pieces were composed in the same brief space of years in  | which he was also composing " Julius Cesar " and " Hamlet , " " Othello " and " Macbeth . " Now three of these four are well made plays on worthy themes ; and they certify to Shakespeare 's attainment of a high degree of technical dexterity , merely as a playwright . Why then should he have at this time written three pieces , " All 's Well , " " Measure for Measure , " and " Troilus and Cressida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , and repugnant in temper ? The current explanation is that these were hurried work , thrown off hastily while his mind was focussed on the more important and more interesting plays which he was producing in the same period . That Shakespeare often worked under pressure is very likely , since he had a hand in some forty pieces in about twenty years , from 1591 to 1611 , from his twenty-seventh year to his forty-seventh . This averages about two plays a year , which is also the measure of Moliere 's productivity , some thirty pieces in the last fifteen years of his life , from 1658 to 1673 , from his thirty-sixth year to his fifty-first . And haste might account , more or less , for the slovenliness of the plot-making in these three pieces , since structural symmetry can be achieved only by taking thought . But haste alone is an inadequate explanation for the artistic lapses of these three pieces . It does not supply any justification for the themes themselves or for the harsh tone which characterizes them . It does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drama which ought to have become almost second nature to Shakespeare at this time and by which he was being guided in the composition of " Hamlet " and " Othello . " And yet haste on the one side , and on the other his absorption in more interesting work , are the only excuses that have been urged for the reckless composition of these plays , while their unlovely atmosphere has been credited , more or less fancifully , to some personal experience of his own at about  | that time . This last suggestion may have a certain validity , although it is not borne out by the facts of literary biography , which tend to show that the most humorous books have flowered out of their author 's melancholy in periods of depression . Whatever the explanation may be , the fact remains that Shakespeare did descend to the writing of these three ignoble pieces in the same years that he was composing his noblest plays . " All 's Well that Ends Well " is the feeblest of the lot , dramaturgically and psychologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , it is the weakest . The story is offensive ; the plotting is casual ; the characterdrawing is unconvincing and inconsistent ; and the humor is inexpensive . The method throughout is immature , as if in sympathy with the puerility of the subject . The story which he borrowed from Boccaccio is absurd and unpleasant . At bottom it may not be more mediaeval and impossible than that of the " Merchant of Venice " ; but it is less capable of effective dramatic development . And while the story of the " Merchant of Venice " may be impossible when tested by the facts of life , it is sweet and pleasant , whereas the story of " All 's Well , " perhaps not absolutely impossible in itself , is odious and offensive . The story of the " Merchant of Venice " Shakespeare built up into a compact plot , rising scene by scene to its climax and declining at last into a lovely vision of young love delighting in its triumph ; but the story of " All 's Well " he leaves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably the theme could not have been made dramatically attractive ; and certainly Shakespeare does not make it either attractive or dramatic . Apparently it was the ingrained belief of Shakespeare ( founded it may be on his own experience ) , that woman is not only willing to meet her wooer halfway , as Juliet and Rosalind do , but often to make advances , as Olivia and Phoebe and Desdemona do , ? and also the Venus of " Venus  | and Adonis . " This belief is pushed to its uttermost extreme in " All 's Well , " where we see Helena forcing the unwilling Bertram into a distasteful marriage and then winning him by the most despicable of tricks , a device as indelicate as it is crude . That the heroine is capable of descending to such a low contrivance , with all that it implies , robs her at once of any claim to sympathy . And in the desire to force the contrast between her and the man she takes captive , Shakespeare deliberately blackens him and makes him so contemptible a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much by the mere fact that she pursues such a cad as by the abhorrent contrivance which makes him hers at last . We do not even pity her in her success ; rather do we despise them both . The situation in which the original tale forces her to place herself is , as Mr. Lang put it sharply , " at once hideous and wholly out of keeping with Helena 's character as it appears in her conversations " with Bertram 's mother . But it is not out of keeping with her earlier conversation with Parolles , in which she bandies words about her own virginity , ? a conversation reeking with vulgarity and quite impossible to a modest-minded girl , however frank and plainspoken she might be . Almost as degrading are the speeches in which she challenges one lord after another to marry her , before she unexpectedly claims the unsuspecting Bertram , a scene needless in itself , and needlessly gross , made worse by the smutty comments of La Feu . Mr. Henry James once asserted that George Sand had no taste morally ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare ; but here in these two scenes , is evidence that he was not unwilling to descend to tickle the groundlings of the Globe with the quibbling indecency they avidly relished . Shakespeare 's great plays are for all time ; but " All 's Well " and its fellows are only for Tudor days . Shakespeare has padded out the main narrative with irrelevant humor . The theme itself did not suggest or call  | for comic characters ; and these which Shakespeare has inserted remain extraneous to the central story . He returns to the low comedian sent on the stage at intervals merely to be funny without the aid of an assumed character . In " All 's Well " this low-comedy part is actually nameless ; he is frankly designated as the " clown . " This clown has conversation with the countess and with La Feu , empty of significance but bristling with verbal quibbles and often with obscene innuendo . These dialogues are lacking of any flavor of character ; they are on the level of the " sidewalk conversations " of our modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he calls the frivolities of the clown " coarse and stupid , even beyond the ordinary stupidity of Elizabethan horse-play . " Although the clown is the least comic of all alleged comic characters , the other figures supposed to be amusing are only a little more vital . The old lord , La Feu ( intended obviously for the actor who had played Polonius and who was to play Pandarus ) , is a traditional type , frequent in other Elizabethan pieces and not here sharply individualized . The cowardly soldier , Parolles ( designed probably for the performer of Sir Andrew Aguecheek ) , is only a variant of the braggart , which English comedy had taken over from the Greek and the Latin , the Italian and the French . He is a diminished replica of Falstaff , done without gusto or unction . The episodes in which he appears lack spontaneity ; they suggest fatigue of invention ; and such humor as they have is largely mechanical and often perfunctory . The protracted scene in which Parolles is convicted of cowardice has flashes of fun , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most primitive form of humor , the practical joke . Deficient as " All 's Well " is in dramatic vigor and in psychologic veracity , it is deficient also in poetry . Passages there are in which we find the true Shakespearean fire ; but they are few and far between . Even in style , which rarely  | forsakes Shakespeare , we find a sad falling off . There are long speeches and dialogues in rhyme , stuffed with classical allusions , even when the situation cried aloud for the large simplicity of blank verse . Helena 's letter is in sonnetform ; and her final soliloquy is in rhyme , as though the arbitrariness of the theme had compelled artificiality of treatment . There is an unreality of thought and a stiff mannerism of expression far removed from the noble fluidity of the speeches in " Hamlet . " In fact , if we knew Shakespeare only as the author of " All 's Well , " we should rank him with the outer throng of his contemporaries , and not higher than the average of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he composed " All 's Well " he was worn and weary , distracted by some personal sufferings we can only guess at . Yet there is this to be said , that his effort seems to have been always in direct proportion to the attraction exerted upon him by the subject he is at work on . When his theme is inspiring he puts forth all his power , and stands revealed as the accomplished playwright and the incomparable poet . But he is often careless in the selection of his subject , taking whatever trifling tale chanced to be nearest to his hand and descending to stories wholly unworthy of his genius . Then his ambition is not roused and his endeavor is relaxed . He moves along the line of least resistance ; and he is concerned chiefly to supply the groundlings with what they will enjoy . Fortunately for us it was not often that he let himself sink to this low level , and " Measure for Measure , " open as it is to much of the same adverse criticism which has been here bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better piece of work . Its theme is repugnant , but it is not uninteresting . The most conscientious of playwrights could not have made a really good play on the subject of " All 's Well , " whereas it is possible that the subject of " Measure for Measure " might have been worked up into  | a fairly coherent plot , even if Shakespeare himself failed to ( lo this . Even as he has treated the theme there are at least three scenes of genuine dramatic value , which he handles with secure mastery . These are , first , the discovery by Angelo that he lusts after Isabella , then the scene in which he proposes his evil bargain to her , and finally the scene in which she tells her brother of the fearful price she would have to pay for his life and in which Claudio 's courage deliquesces in the immanent fear of death . These episodes are rendered with Shakespeare 's customary power ; they are rich in poetry and in psychology ; they grip the interest of the spectator with unfailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its construction ; it is again only a narrative cut into dialogue and not compactly built up into a logical structure , rising scene by scene to its climax . His method is here no better than that of the writers of the chronicle-plays who held the stage when he first came up to London ; and this method called for the inclusion of needless episodes of mere buffoonery . The play is as mediaeval in manner as it is in substance . The theme is not so obnoxious as that of " All 's Well , " and it has dramatic possibilities , even if Shakespeare neglected to make the most of them . It demands that nocturnal substitution of one woman for another which Shakespeare had already used in " All 's Well " and which the elder Dumas was to employ in " Mlle. de Belle-Isle . " This unseemly artifice is not quite so forced in " Measure for Measure " as it is in " All 's Well , " since the volunteering of Mariana of the later play may have a justification wholly lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artifice itself is unlovely and it can not be made acceptable . in employing it , Shakespeare is invading the territory of Beaumont and Fletcher and Massinger to whom it seems more naturally to belong . We feel that Shakespeare ought to be above unreal and insincere trickery of that sort . There may be much of the same make-believe in the " Mer- chant of Venice , " but there at least the characters are vital ; Shylock rings true ; Portia and Jessica and Nerissa are human and womanly and feminine ; whereas in " Measure for Measure " all the characters are more or less wooden . Even Isabella is open to this criticism at times ; her appeal to the Duke in the last act is eloquent , but not heart-felt ; it is essentially rhetorical at a moment when rhetoric is out of place . The rest of the persons in the piece are little better than puppets . Claudio is the best of them , although he is only sketched in . Angelo admits that he is a sensualist , but he displays rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truly passionate nature . The Duke is absurd in his solemn disguises , put on and put off for purely theatrical effect . The scenes which follow the Duke 's return are merely plot for the sake of plot itself ; they evince a Scribe-like complexity without Scribe 's ingenuity . Mr. Walkley was voicing the opinion of every honest critic when he declared that " we do not like these people , and we do not like many of the sentiments by which they are governed . " The comic characters are not quite so dreary as those in " All 's Well . " Lucio ( obviously composed for the actor who had played Mercutio and Gratiano ) has a flippant briskness which is at least less wearisome than the dull fooling of the " clown . " Mrs. Overdone ( obviously impersonated by the performer of Mrs. Quickly and of the Nurse in " Romeo and Juliet " ) is set before us with full appreciation of her type . Escalus ( possibly undertaken by Shakespeare himself ) has a dignified simplicity . Elbow is plainly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same actor , probably Arnim ) . But Elbow lacks the spontaneity of Dogberry ; his garrulity is tedious , and he has an ineffectiveness which is likely to be the result of a mechanical attempt to repeat an earlier hit . As a group the avowedly comic characters contribute very little to the gaiety of nations .  | Whatever appeal the play may have is due wholly to Isabella ; and she is not quite equal to the burden laid on her shoulders . She does not rise to the possible heights of the situation ; she is a little deficient both in feeling and in intelligence . That , resolved as she was to enter a nunnery , she should pair off with the Duke at the end of the play , so that the so-called comedy may end with three weddings , leaves her in our memory as a figure sadly diminished from the heroic . The Duke has not wooed her , and apparently he has never given her a thought as a possible consort . She has shown no liking for him ; and yet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had refused to sell herself to save her brother 's life . This is all of a piece with the huddled confusion of the final act and with the topsy-turvy morality which underlies its conclusion . Even the villain Angelo is spared and dismissed to matrimony ? a matrimony which has slight promise of bliss for the injured Mariana . But as Mariana also is devoid of interest this matters little . The play has many fine lines , passages such as only Shakespeare could pen . It contains certain of his most significant ethical judgments on sin and mercy and death . But it is as painful as it is ill-shapen ; and at the core of it is a distasteful device . What lingers in the memory after its performance is the figure of Isabella , nobly projected even if inconsistently presented . And it is due solely to the histrionic opportunities on the part of Isabella that the piece is still seen at rare intervals on the stage from which " All 's Well " and " Troilus and Cressida " have long been banished . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but brief , for it gives the playgoer neither the purging pleasure of true tragedy nor the sparkling joy of genuine comedy . " It is a comedy where Death holds the place of Love , " so Mr. Lang has declared ; " there is no beautiful shape of Love in the whole of it , and the very mirth is miserable . "  | If it is difficult to explain why Shakespeare happened to write these two tragi-comedies , it is impossible to understand his reason for writing the third . " Troilus and Cressida " is frankly the most obscure and the most baffling of all his pieces . His purpose in composing it is inexplicable ; and we can not even declare with certainty whether he meant to make it tragic or comic . It has no central theme and the three strands of story which are intertwined are left at loose ends . It is entitled " Troilus and Cressida , " and yet Cressida appears only four times in all , once to deny herself to Troilus and then eagerly to accept his unlawful love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she parts sorrowfully from Troilus ; and when we last see her she is dallying with Diomed to whom she is about to surrender herself in mere wantonness . In more than half of the piece the love-story is allowed to drop out of sight , while we are distracted by a gallimaufry of debates and battles . The play is a patchwork of amorous intrigues , of wrangling oratory , and of gladiatorial contests ; the final battle-scene is puerile , not to call it infantile , and it belongs to a very primitive period of dramatic art . The play is an incoherent and fragmentary jumble , with no unity of action , no continuity of interest , no dominating figure on which to focus our attention . Uninteresting as a whole , it is infrequently interesting in any of its episodes . Dramaturgically it is the least successful of all the plays accredited to Shakespeare ; and this is the reason why it long ago vanished from the stage . It lacks even the impelling self-will which lent a certain sort of interest to the pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of motive combine to make the drama dull in any actual performance . That the story should have been thrown together loosely in this helter-skelter fashion supplies us a reason for doubting whether Shakespeare was here availing himself of the earlier piece on the same subject , which we know to have  | existed . He seems to have drawn his material direct from a mediaeval Troy tale , vigorously Englished by Caxton and utilized earlier by Chaucer . But from Chaucer Shakespeare took over at most the character of Pandarus , while in Chapman 's translation of Homer he found only the suggestion of the character of Thersites . The major part of his story , in so far as the piece can be said to have any story , he borrowed from Caxton 's translation , as he was to borrow the major part of the stories of " Julius Caesar " and " Antony and Cleopatra " from North 's translation of Plutarch . But in deriving matter from Plutarch he went to a worthy source , and he bettered what he borrowed , whereas in going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he debased what he derived from it . In the plays taken from Plutarch he is superior to his material , fine as that is ; and in the play taken from Caxton he is inferior to his material , tawdry as that is . Puzzling as is Shakespeare 's dramaturgic feebleness here , even more puzzling is his desire to debase the heroic figures he dimly glimpsed . He has no mercy on any of the stalwart warriors of Greece ; and he pitilessly exposes them to corroding ridicule . To him all these heroes are fundamentally unheroic . To him Achilles and Agamemnon and Ajax are a lot of dull brutes and boastful cowards . He seizes upon every possible pettiness and sets it in the forefront . He puts them under the microscope of his disintegrating irony and dissects them with a merciless scalpel . In this assault upon consecrated renown Shakespeare goes far beyond the mild iconoclasm of Mr. Bernard Shaw in his " Cesar and Cleopatra . " He almost anticipates the opera-bouffe derision of the " Belle Helene " of Meilhac and Halevy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not far removed from the bouillant Achille of the two clever French wits , and his Agamemnon is not unlike their mari de la reine . That Shakespeare , who had so noble an appreciation of the loftily heroic , could descend  | thus to cheapen the heroes of Homer , must remain an unsolvable enigma . It might be suggested that he prepared the play specially for the actors , providing them with an endless succession of sonorous speeches , often weighty with wisdom and often wealthy with poetry , ? that he was giving his fellow-performers a chance to take part in a prize-debate , each in his turn having occasion to spout loud-sounding oratory , " speeches that you can sink your teeth in " ( to employ the apt phrase of the old-school actor in Sir Arthur Pinero 's play ) . But this suggestion , alluring as it may be at first glance , does not approve itself on further consideration . If this was Shakespeare 's intent he plainly over-reached himself , since the speechmaking is so excessive that it must have been fatiguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were for grandiloquent rhetoric . And after all is said , a debate , or a sequence of debates , can never be acceptable as a substitute for a drama ; and no one would discover this more swiftly than the actors who took part in the long-drawn discussions . Although the play is without any possible popularity on the stage , it is not without qualities which demand consideration in the study . It is unworthy of Shakespeare as playwright , but it sometimes heightens our opinion of him as a poet and as a philosopher . Even more does it disclose his power as a psychologist . He has here given us a group of unheroic and unlovely characters , marvellously etched , bitten into the plate by the acid of his satire . Never in any of his plays did he create a character more evil than Thersites , and hardly ever did he create a character more consistent and more convincing . Thersites is incessant in railing ; he is full of all manner of uncharitableness , boiling over with envy , hatred , and malice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man ; he is mean and malignant , voiding his venom on humanity at large . This vituperative and vitriolic personality is alive in every utterance ,  | with an appalling vitality ; and his temper is an anticipation of that which we find more than once in Swift , whom Shakespeare here anticipates , as he anticipated so many other of the authors who were to come after him . With these three pieces Shakespeare bids farewell to comedy , ? for the " Tempest " can be called a comedy only by granting a large inclusiveness to the word . If the approximate date which is generally given to " Troilus and Cressida " is fairly exact , then that is the last of his comedies , of the plays in which there is any large proportion of wit and humor . Evidently thereafter the comic aspects of life were becoming less inspiring to him . His mind was engaged with larger and graver themes . In no one of his later plays , various as they are in substance and in style , have we anything which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have very little which reminds us of the joyous gaiety of Rosalind and Beatrice . Now and again , in an occasional episode and in a casual character we may catch a glimpse of the exuberance which charmed us in the earlier romantic comedies ; but the tone of the later plays is almost unfailingly serious . Even if there is sporadic humor here and there , it is generally employed only as a temporary relief for the stress of tragic emotion . Such is the brief appearance of the Porter in " Macbeth . " Not a few of these later plays are almost without any lighter passages . The three incongruous pieces which have been discussed here are not true comedies ; they may be called comedydramas or tragi-comedies ; but in fact they belong to a group for which we have no satisfactory name . In Shakespeare 's works they are usually classed with his comedies , perhaps mainly because they could not fairly be classed either with the tragedies or with the histories . Assuredly they are far from being comic in their intent or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mirth . They are evidence that Shakespeare , who had already attained to true tragedy , had not found the formula for comedy . And a  | perfectly adequate and completely satisfactory formula for comedy he never did attain , however much he may have delighted us with humorous dramas in which he disclosed his keen insight into the pettinesses and the frivolities of humanity . There is an exalted type of comedy corresponding to an exalted type of tragedy , a lively play of contemporary life and manner , in which the sustaining story is the direct result of the clash of character on character , ? in which the plot is what it is because the characters are what they are . This exalted type of comedy conforms to Cicero 's definition ; it is " an imitation of life , a mirror of custom , an image of truth " ; and it approximates to Ben Jonson 's comment on Cicero 's phrase , in that it is " a thing throughout pleasant and ridiculous , and accommodated to the correction of manners . " It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very likely . It was certainly attained by Moliere , perhaps most successfully in the " Femmes Savantes " ; and the comic dramatists who have come after Moliere found his formula ready to their hands , ? Congreve in the " Way of the World , " Sheridan in the " School for Scandal , " Beaumarchais in the " Barber of Seville , " Augier and Sandeau in the " Gendre de M. Poirier . " This was a formula that Shakespeare could not foresee ; and that the condition of the drama in England and in his time did not prompt him to discover for himself . He has left us farces of sundry kinds , sometimes almost lifted to the level of this high-comedy , ? if we may so call the type Moliere perfected . He has made us his eternal debtors for the delight we have taken in his romantic-comedies , wherein the adventures of the more amusing characters are set in a framework of dark plotting and of Machiavellian machination . He saw fit later to compose the less worthy and less pleasant comedydramas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has done ought not to close our eyes to what he has not done ; it must not make us blind to the fact that he did not write any play which belongs strictly to the purest  | type of high-comedy , ? the comedy uncontaminated by the arbitrariness of farce or by the stringency of drama . It may sound like a paradox to say that comedy is more difficult than tragedy ; but there would be at least a suggestion of truth in the daring assertion . Comedy of any of the lower types is common enough and easy enough ; but highcomedy , in the narrow meaning of the term , is very rare in all literatures , far rarer than tragedy . In Greece there is only the doubtful Menander to set over against Aeschylus and Sophocles and Euripides ; and in France there is only Moliere to fellowship with Corneille and Racine . That success in one form of art is less frequent than success in another form of art may be taken as evidence that the former is at least more difficult than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult , it has been able to develop itself only after tragedy is solidly established and has come to a consciousness of its methods . Menander , so it is believed , was deeply influenced by Euripides in the form as well as in the temper of his comedies ; and Moliere in his greater comedies had before his eyes the severe simplicity of Corneille . Here perhaps is a hint for the explanation of Shakespeare 's inability to bestow upon his comedies the self-sufficient unity which he gave to his tragedies . By the time that Shakespeare had been able to find for himself a fit formula for tragedy and to prove the value of this formula in " Othello " and " Macbeth , " he had already lost his interest in comedy and was ready to abandon it . There is matter for speculation whether Shakespeare 's best comedies might not have been composed in compliance with a very different pattern if they had followed instead of preceding his best tragedies . Had this happened there is at least a possibility that Shakespeare might have anticipated Moliere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's definition .
