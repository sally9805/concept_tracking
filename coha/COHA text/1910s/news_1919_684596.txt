txt Mr. Clernenceau has called the Treaty* og Versailles " a good peace . " It is a good peace . It is designed to end the " state of war " with Germany and facilitate dealing with her accomplices ? Austria , Turkey , and Bulgaria . It will open the way to reviving that state of industry upon which depends the life of Europe and the health of the world . It is a good peace because it promises to hold the allied and associated powers interlocked in a reasonable unity during the perilous periad of readjustment , becase it strikes hard at vengeful Germans , Bolshevik ' , and malcontents in every land who hoped , who still hope , that dissensions among the powers may plunge Europe into a chance-medley wherein each mischievous group might find opportunity . Accredited representatives of the powers having made the treaty with Germany , it is now submitted for ewhetever ratification their several laws and polides may prescribe .

Milder critics even shy at the word " amendment , " for this suggests that reopening of the conference they sincerely wish to avoid and , I believe , are determined to prevent . " Reservations , " " explanations , " " understandings " are the favorite tags to the treaty . As many as they please , if none shall induce our brothers in arms either to execute the treaty leaving the United States to make its own terms with Germany or , in weariness of spirit , to reconvene the Conference in order to consider the Senate 's objections  --  and also the flood of proposals from all parts of the globe , including Germany . If I remember aright , the Knox resolue tion recited that " the treaty could be easily so drawn " as to meet the Senate 's objections .

" Mr. Cleveland 's phrase , " we are confronted by a condition , not a theory , " counsels us to lay our course by the realities . Instead of dwelling on the idea that some day the council might drag the United States into a foreign quarrel to its hurt , let us mark the greatest of our immediate obligations under the Treaty of Versailles .

The United States , conceding this concern to its friends in Europe , can not honorably or safely deny concern for itself . Indeed ; some of the more critical frontiers are those of the new States which America has so greatly encouraged . Holding the treaty . boundaries intact through the time of readjustment , the allied and associated powers may in a season of comparative security effectuate their urgent responsibilities at home and abroad .

Of all the intemperate objections to the League none implies such fear or contempt for any compact looking to a better order in the world as the charge that withdrawal may be lawfully forbidden by whatever the League may be pleased to call " unfulfilled obligations .

Of course , there will be several men in - Congress who will think it their duty to save the world from itself . To men thee Senators Johnson and Reed harmony of nations is out of the question .

Those men who would make the League a matter of party politics - will be guilty of a crowning political blunder . " Perhaps if President Wilson had taken Senators Johnson and Reed to Versailles his road might have been easier . We started out to be of service to the , world , and we must be of service now .

New York , June 28 , 1919 . Lodge Quoted for Lodge . To the Editor of The New York Times : It must be a matter of sincere regret to all those who are ' disinterestedly anxious to see the United States take its proper place among the nations which have fought autocratic Germany and her allies to a standstill , to watch the proceedings of certain Republican Senators during the last few months . Mr. Lodge was formally selected Republican Senate leader when the present Congress was called in extraordinary session , and he therefore must be held largely responsible for Republican displays of partisanship toward the Peace Treaty and the covenant of the League . There are faults which can be found with the treaty and with the covenant of the League , and if this were not so , it would be truly surprising , even though Mr. Lodge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political acumen and accumulated knowledge of the affairs of state , had themselves been appointed sole constructors oC the treaty . No one understands better than Mr. Lodge the enormous difficulties in the way of making a treaty which must harmonize the very divergent views of so many parties , and no one knows better than he how any treaty under the circumstances must be a compromise , for did he not extoll the greatness of Washington for smothering his own criticisms of the Constitution of the United States , in order that the document as it emerged from the Constitutional ? Convention might be adopted ? Let Mr. Lodge testify in his own words , quoted from his " Life of Washington , " Vol . II. , Page Washington had written to Governor Randolph as follows : There are some things ? in the new form of the Constitution I will readily acknowledge which never did , and I am persuaded never will , obtain my cordial approbation , but I did then conceive and do now most firmly believe that in the aggregate it is the best Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this or a dissolution of the Union awaits our choice , and is the only alternative before us . Thus believing , I had not , nor have I now any hesitancy in deciding on which to lean . And then Mr. Lodge goes on to comment as follows : Thus the few letters to a few friends extended to many letters to many friends , and traveled into every State . They all urged the necessity of adopting the Constitution as the best that could be obtained . What Washington 's precise objections , to the Constitution were Is not clear . In a general way it was not energetic enough to come up to his ideal , but he never particularized in his criticisms . He may have admitted the existence of defects in order ' simply to disarm opposition , and doubtless he , like most of the framers , was by no means completely satisfied with his work . But he brushed ail faults aside , and drove steadily forward to the great end in view . He was as far removed as possible front that highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support anything that is not perfect , and who generally contrive to do more harm than all the avowed enemies of sound government . Washington did not stop to worry- over and argue about details , but sought steadily to bring to pass the main object at which he aimed . Mr. Lodge might do worse than to emulate the great example he so keenly appreciated and so greatly admired . Mr. Borah is a negligible quantity , beeause he has so successfully contrived ' to be on the wrong side so often . Mr. Knox might ponder Withprofit the foregoing ? description of Washington 's - attitude . L. K. COMSTOCK. - New York , July 3 , 1919 . Faith in the League . To the Editor of The New York Times : . In the confusion of events now happening , ? let us not forget that our country was drawn into the world war because our entire people appreciated the unpleasant fact that there was in 1917 a very fair chance of the Kaiser 's - overpowering Europe , and then , in a very short time , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Conquest . So when the Kaiser committed acts of brutal hostility , which he thought we were unable to resent , the United States joined the Allies and so . ' saved the liberties of all nations . Our country , with the most stupendous effort known in history , within twelve months , mustered , armed and equipped an adequate force , and what was , if possible , still more wonderful , landed 2,000,000 fighters in France . This could only have been accomplished by the united and universal work of the hands and brains of the people of our country . The war , as it progressed , developed on the part of both contestants , vast improvements in the art of killing our fellowman , and its culmination was reached , just at the time of the cessation of hostilities , by the United States manufacturing a poisonous gas which could be dropped from airplanes , not to ' kill individuals , not hundreds , but wipe . out an enemy 's entire population . Consider , Please , what ' this meant . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil ) had produced the theorist by Which the entire population Of this planet could be obliterated . Hence , to preserve the human race , this poisonous gas must never be utilised  --  there must be no more . war , Peace and- brotherly lOve between all the people on earth becomes an absolute necessity for the preservation of mankind on ' this planet . This is not chimerical , but an undoubted fact . ? The Peace Cengress was not primarily assembled to meet such conditions , ' but gradually the great truth forced itself upon the delegates and it became their imperative duty , not so ninth to make peace with the Central Powers , but ? to prevent , if they possibly could , the recurrence of wars . The strongest minds of each of the great nations of the world Allies had gathered in Paris , and after necessary I months of most careful research and deepest consideration , have formed the ' League of Nations , to guarantee that peace and to stimulate that brotherly love which Is positively required to preserve humanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this League is not perfeet . Perfection could not , by hymen agencies , be reached at a single step . But if such an aggregation of aistinguished men , such as never before assembled , can not produce a basis of mutual agreement to secure the peace of the world , who can ? If it can not be done ; alas for humanity ! Three greater minds than those of Wilson , Clemenceau , and Lloyd George never have before worked together for the world 's good . Never before was the auxiliary wisdom of the three groat nations brought to the aid of such great ' eiders , wisely to settle the destinies of nations . Never before was there gathered a more brilliant or learned galaxy , from all parts of the world , to assist a Peace Conference in fairly and justly deciding the many difficult questions which faced them . If these master minds , assisted hythe wisdom of all the allied nations , can not frame a unions which will prevent future wars and lay the foundations for justice and peace in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the human race risks being wiped from the face of the earth . Let ' it be further noted that not a single statesman in the entire world has suggested a better or even any kind of a practical league . Let us then accept that made as the best which man 's mind can conceive and in good faith endeavor to carry it out . Thne and experience , not the foresight of man , can demonstrate its practicability . There is but one way ' ? try it honestly , and use its powers of amendment to shape it to suit conditions . The acceptance of the League of Nations is not a party measure of a very small fraction of the world 's people , it is not the political act of a political leader , but it is a means , and it appears the only means , by which the actual lives of the people of the world can be preserved . Its adoption should not be a matter of politics , ' but of the absolute safety of mankind . It is sincerely hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world will appreciate the gravity of the situation , rise above petty jealousies and act as men . C. IRVINE WALKER . Charleston , S. C. , July 2 , 1919 . PETER MAKUSHIN . The Kind of Man the New Russia Looks To for Salvation . To the Editor of The New York . Times : Permit me to tell your readers about my friend Peter Makushin of Tomsk , Siberia , who passed safely through all ? troubles of the Czarist regime , who is now struggling against the Bolshevist tyranny , and who personifies the future Russia , free , enlightened , immortal . Peter Makushin has ambition to be a public benefactor . He owns the largest printing house in Siberia and keeps a store of all things necessary for schools , from pencil to piano . All his profits he . applies to establishing schools , reading rooms , and libraries all over Siberia . " Every Siberian village must have a library , " ho said , " and I will see to it that there shall be money for it . " He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them trustees of the capital which he deposits and which his heirs shall continue to pay till there will be 1,000,000 rubles , ( $500 , - 000 . ) Then the capital shall be applied to establishing libraries in all villages of Siberia , and the surplus , if any , shall be used for pensions to teachers . Imperial authorities , did not approve of Peter Makushin 's activity . et'hen at Tomsk the Black Hundred decided to make away with big anti-monarchists , Makushin was on the list of victims , There was a terrible pogrom : many prominent men were killed , burned alive , or imprisoned . Makushin escaped be ' cause his friends warned him in due time and he hid himself in the woods . " The . House . of Sciences Founded by Peter Makushin , " so reads the sign , ( " My ? epitaph , " said he , ) on a large building erected by Makushin at Tomsk , where it is proposed to open courses of all sciences for men and women who could not study in regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the imperial authorities withheld their permission to open the Courses . The Czar is gone , but the old tyranny remained and largely increased under the Bolshevist misrule . Makushin was several times arrested , his money conflucated , and he was treated as a suspected enemy to the Soviet authoritieg . " We want your capital . Where have you hidden it ? " asked a Bolshevist emissary , not satisfied ? with the cash money found . in Makushin 's house . I " Ye$ , my capital is hidden in hundreds of vilio.ges , in schools and libraries , and in pensions to the teachers . All the men around you , provided they are not illiterate , were taught in my schools and were reading my books . That is where my capital is hidden , " replied Makushin . And the Bolsheviks were ashamed to maltreat such a man . He was permitted to leave the prison . " Thank you for freedom , " he said . " I have a ' House of . Sciences ' and I promise you to build an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it known to his children that , according- to his will , they will receive Only their salary , and all profits will go as heretofore to schools and libraries and pensions to teachers . Russia will not perish as long as there are public-spirited men like , Makushin , and there are such men and women who are working with the single object in their lives to make.Russia free , enlightened , and prosperous .
