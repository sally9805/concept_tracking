What size must the box be in order to contain the requisite amount of water ? " etc . The problem of adjusting means to end in such cases may become problematic at a variety of points , according to the extent of one 's previous experiences . When the thinking process is involved at any one of these points there is nothing artificial or formal about its use . Yet this process is called forth frequently and gets abundant exercise . ( 5 ) Appropriateness of manual training for early exercise of thinking . Manual training is especially suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier stages of its development . All our present-day psychology is emphasizing the fact that motor processes are more primary than thought processes . Thought processes intervene to modify and perfect modes of reaction . The needs of the individual are thus better met . In manual training we are taking our start at the point which biology and psychology both emphasize as the right point of departure . The thought processes when they appear come in their natural setting . They are strictly relevant to a motor process which is to meet some need or satisfy some impulse . In these motor processes of manual training , process and product of activity are quite closely related . Means and end can be easily grasped and thought processes involved in making adjustment can be very simple . From simpler situations the transition is easily made to more and more complex situations , thus providing for progressive training in thinking up through the various stages of mental development . // The value of starting with the simple and concrete problems of manual training will be shown from another angle when we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the power of thinking . Suffice it to emphasize the thought at this point that the first problems of thought are most naturally those which spring from problems of action of some sort , and that only later does the thought process become so specialized as to grasp and wrestle with intellectual problems in more or less isolation from an immediately practical situation . Manual training , while furnishing an abundance of concrete problems for the exercise of the thinking function in concrete terms , should , however , also serve as the matrix out of which distinctly intellectual problems should later grow . ( 6 ) Criticism of dictation ; fallacy of ideal of finished product . Do we realize fully enough in our schools the value of manual training from the point of view of its use in developing the power to think ? It is sometimes conducted as if its sole value were thought to be in the manual dexterity or the finished products which it yielded . No problems are conceived by the children , and there is no process of conscious adjustment of means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end and process . The process is broken up into a series of steps . One step is dictated . When this step is completed , then another is taken in which the teacher determines just what is to be done and how it is to be done . The child needs to see for himself practically nothing of the relevancy of what he is doing , he needs to make no conscious adjustments . He has only to go through certain definite motor processes . There can be in this no training in thinking . All that the child can get is a certain amount of manual dexterity . Of course , he may secure a better finished product for the time being . It is doubtless the fetich of the finished product which footnote ' See Chapter XIV . // the teacher has been taught to worship blindly that has been responsible for her whole abnormal mode of procedure . I say " taught to worship " advisedly ; for when her work is put on exhibition is it not the most finished products which are expected to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual achievements of the pupils from day to day or week to week ? In our anxiety for results which are immediate , tangible , and visible , we bow down to the golden calf of the finished product , substituting an unholy idolatry for the true worship of real training . Of course stimulation , guidance , and direction on the part of the teacher are necessary . Sometimes even more direct help must be given , but surely this need not be carried so far as to amount to practical dictation at every point . ( q ) Increased motor efficiency from training in vital thinking . Some scope for the exercise of the thinking powers according to the stage of their development may be left in every manual training exercise . This should be done not alone for the sake of the training in thinking but also for the increased efficiency which accrues to the manual training activity itself from the cultivation of the thinking process . A teacher in a prominent school for the professional training of teachers of manual training said in conversation with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses in manual training in the university , who could make every kind of joint that might be involved in any part of their work , but who were lamentably deficient in working out the problems involved in the execution of a rather simple concrete piece of work in which they had to determine for themselves what kind of joint should be used . They had evidently been drilled in technique first instead of starting with concrete situations relatively simple and working out technique in connection with the solution of problems . Their thinking and their technique were out // of relation to each other . The training of thinking in the actual manual training activities gives more varied and more perfect control over the manual arts themselves . 4 . MATHEMATICS . ( r ) Recognized value of mathematics . The place of mathematics in the process of training to think need not be elaborated very fully . It is an older subject in the history of the curriculum than manual training , and the methods of handling it , have been more definitely worked out and put to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school subject adapted to the training of thinking processes . There is no question that on the side of conditions the mathematical branches satisfy the demand of furnishing abundant problematic situations . ( 2 ) Danger of formalism and lack of motivation . The possibilities of mathematics in the matter of furnishing problems we shall not need to discuss . But there are other phases which need careful consideration . There is the question of adequate motivation . Are we handling the mathematical branches in such a way that the thinking process is called forth under normal and dynamic conditions , that is , in situations where it comes in to play a real and vital part in a larger whole of activity ? Mathematics involves a remarkably large amount and variety of technique . Are we making too much of the technique in advance of any felt need for it in the thinking process ? While we are accustomed to think of mathematics as preeminently a thought subject , is there actually any other subject in which it is possible to do so much manipulation of symbols and forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( 3 ) Vital training of thinking in mathematics . Is there any way of making mathematics , particularly in the earlier stages , more dynamic and real and less a matter of formal drill ? Yes , if it can be made to grow out of certain forms of activity in which the child is already interI24 The Psychology or Thinking ested . All forms of mathematical thought , if they have any function at all , have their justification in the added control which they give us over our activities . Arithmetical , algebraic , and geometrical formulations should , then , have a basis in activities of some sort to which they are immediately relevant , and this connection between the mathematical mode of thought and the active process to which it is relevant should be maintained until the development of mathematics as a science has impressed the mind as itself worth while for the sake of the values which inhere in the subject . If the boy is already interested in making boxes , sleds , etc. , he finds that he has to measure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foot , yard , and various combinations of these , need to be known . It is a serious matter in the making of his sled if the runners are not equidistant throughout . And the corners of his box have to be square , and the wheels of his cart or his bicycle have to be perfect circles . Thus we might go on and enumerate hosts of elementary facts and principles of arithmetic , algebra , and geometry which are bound up with the manual training activity . This fact of their connection with the satisfaction of the constructive impulse makes them relevant and vital . There is motive for learning them , even to getting right down to the task of drilling upon them . There are some who assert that no number combination should be taught to the child until he has actually run up against a situation which has made him feel the need of it . This application of the principle seems to be extreme ; but it certainly is feasible to withhold the drill upon number combinations until the child has had forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need of these number combinations sufficiently that the teaching of a new combination does not become a wholly arbitrary process . So with those processes which belong more particularly to thinking and reasoning in mathematics . Problems in buyTraining // ing and selling , in laying of carpets and floors , in papering , painting , etc. , if brought right clown to the familiar setting of the child 's everyday life , furnish situations in which means have to be adjusted to ends tinder conditions which make the thinking process involved and the elements of technique required seem very vital . Definite and accurate forms of analysis and of demonstration , which follow , instead of preceding , actual thinking processes to which they are relevant , are seen to be valuable acquisitions for more perfect control of the thinking process and are studied with greater relish and appreciation . The laboratory method of teaching mathematics , if it could be extended more widely , would do much to bring about more real and vital and intelligent thinking in mathematics . 5 . HISTORY . ( r ) Illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is comparatively easy to develop concrete situations in which problematic elements stand forth clearly and definitely . For example , all the facts of llraddock 's campaign in the French and Indian War can be made to center about the problem of the control of the Mississippi valley . Let the children be presented with an abundance of concrete facts relative to the life of the times , so that they can put themselves back in thought right into the midst of the problem . Let them see clearly the colonists pushing westward over the mountains . What would be one of the easiest routes ? They will see that it will be by the valleys of the rivers that converge to form the Ohio . Let them see clearly the line of French explorers and traders crowding into the Mississippi valley from the north . In process of time they will completely shut off the American colonists from westward expansion . What will they do about it ? Where will the conflict of races be likely first to occur ? Why ? If you were one of the leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard as // your strategic point in the campaign ? And what would your plan of campaign be ? Suppose you were a leader among the French . Think the same thing through from their point of view . Without carrying this illustration out further , we may suggest that if children can get a situation clearly before them , viewing it from the inside , as it were , they need not merely follow the record of events , but they may anticipate them in large part as the outcomes of circumstances and conditions which are adequate to their explanation . Thus there is abundant opportunity for the exercise of the function of thinking . As a consequence of this mode of procedure the facts learned are also fixed more firmly in the mind . The work of the great Constitutional Convention may be taken up with older pupils in such a way as to make them conceive the problem and to forecast in some measure fundamental aspects of its solution . This will require the study of an abundance of details as to the difficulties involved in the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become states . Only through the study of an abundance of details can the problem be made to stand out sharply . Also the pupils must have considerable familiarity with the chief types of government in the various separate colonies . Knowing what forms of governmental procedure the members of the Convention were familiar with , it will be possible for the pupils to suggest certain principles that are likely to be embodied in the constitution of the closer Union . Familiarity with the excellencies and the defects of the Articles of Confederation will furnish additional data relevant to the solution of the problem . Students may judge for themselves what ideas would impress the members of the Convention as of most relevancy and of most worth . Also a detailed knowledge of the variety and nature of the conflicting interests represented would make it possible for the pupils to forecast some of the compromises which are responsible for certain features // of the Constitution , for example , the provision for equal representation of the states in the Senate and proportional representation in the House of Representatives ; or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) Value of emphasis on the concrete problem . In so far as the study of history can be made to center about concrete problems which give meaning to the collection of masses of details and which call for the exercise of the pupil 's constructive and interpretative powers in construing facts and events in terms of social and political movements , in so far is the child getting splendid training in thinking through his study of history . We are too prone to think of history in terms of record of fact . It is in reality not one half so much record of fact as it is interpretation of fact . It is a weighing , judging , and sifting of facts , leading to some reorganization which throws light upon social and political movements and makes them intelligible . I n the concrete body of historical facts there lie imbedded social and political laws and principles which have meaning and significance only as they are seen in their setting . We might give the pupil outright an organized system of historical facts closely knit and bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this gives him neither a just appreciation of the facts nor of the principles involved . He has not thought them through for himself in a way that makes them forever his own , a body of working capital for further study and interpretation of social and political problems in his own time and generation . May not the pupil within certain limits be encouraged to go through the facts for himself , judging and sifting them from the point of view of some problem , making his own interpretations and discovering principles for himself , and only later bringing his interpretations and conclusions to the test of their comparison with the views of the expert historian ? This would throw a decided emphasis upon thinking and would cultivate an independence // of thought which can never be secured by the process of always following and trying to understand the thoughts of others . We already have too many graduates of our schools , and even of our colleges , of the " It says " type . We ought to he developing more of those who speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves and of that clear thinking through of problems which enables one to give a reason for the statement which he makes . 6 . GEOGRAPHY . Geography furnishes hosts of problems that can be treated in such a way as to provide the conditions for vital thinking . We need suggest only a few by way of illustration , without working out the method of treating them . Why is the climate of England warmer than that of Labrador ? Why are the lands just east of the Rocky Mountains arid ? Why is the United States cutting a canal through the Isthmus of Panama ? What are the conditions that have operated to make New York , Chicago , and St. Louis such large cities ? It is easy to supply the data necessary to the solution of such problems . Why should not the children be left to work out the solutions for themselves so far as possible instead of being told the whole thing ? Almost all of the vital truths of geography can be brought out through the study of typical problems . The pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of themselves ; even mountains , lakes , and valleys he may come to think of in terms of conditions and causes , in terms of processes which are going on all the time , now as well as in the past , in terms of complex relationships between means and ends . Thus he not only gets abundant practice in thinking , but he is also building up the habit of thinking , of looking for principles in accordance with which to explain the simplest phenomena which to another might be taken for granted as mere brute facts . // It would be interesting to work out suggestions for the teaching of language , reading , and some of the physical and biological sciences with special reference to the fulfilment of the conditions of thinking . But enough has been done to illustrate the principle which we wish to make clear , and to emphasize the value and the possibility of doing more in the way of training pupils in elementary and high schools to think . It is evident from the preceding discussions that the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selection of a particular body of subject matter as it is upon the attitude taken toward that subject matter . No teacher can be so thoroughly circumscribed and limited by the nature of the subject matter or by the directions of supervisors as to exclude the possibility within certain limits of leading children to conceive problems and to use their own powers of mind in the struggle for their solution . CHAPTER XI THE ACTIVITY OF THE IMAGINATION IN THINKING I. THINKING IN TERMS OF ITS CONTENT . ( 1 ) Distinction between imagination and thinking . If we look into our minds when a thinking process is going on we find a stream of imagery . Images are the content , or mental stuff , of the thinking process . But thinking differs from other processes in which past experience functions to determine action not so much in terms of content as it does in terms of the organization of the imagery and its conscious direction toward ends . Imagination and thinking are not two separate and distinct processes . Images are involved in both cases . Our attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas are embodied , with their explanation in terms of past experience and in the light of present conditions , with the laws of connection and sequence of images , etc . When we are dealing with problems of this sort , we are apt to use the term imagination . But when we think of the stream of images as organized in such a way as to perform the function of consciously adjusting means to ends , then we call the activity of imagination a thinking process . ( a ) Constructive imagination and thinking . When it comes to a case of constructive imagination the line between it and a thinking process is very shadowy indeed . From one point of view they are absolutely identical . In so far as we can distinguish them at all , it is only with reference to the aspect on which attention is fixed , whether that of content or that of function . If we are considering the mental content and the facts and laws of its 130 // organization as related to the process of getting new mental forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the function of this reorganization and reconstruction of the elements of past experience and their embodiment in new forms , we call the process thinking . 2 . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE OF IMAGINATION IN THE THINKING PROCESS . In thinking , imagination gets its fullest significance and meaning . The power of imaging things or events does not exist for its own sake but to make past experience the more effective in processes of adjustment . In thinking , the image process rises to the level of meeting the needs of the organism in new and problematic situations . ( z ) Necessity of imagination in conception of ends . Thinking is teleological . It has at its bottom a practical basis . It is a process that goes on with reference to ends . It always involves some kind of forward reference . It presupposes that there is something not in your present experience which you seek to bring into it . There is an end unrealized , still in the future . As it does not exist now in terms of reality , it exists only as a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of an image . In no other way can it be presented to consciousness . It would be possible , of course , without imagination to set up motor activities , to make things happen , but we could not determine in advance what should happen . The process would be blind and random experimentation , involving no individual control whatever . The conception of an end toward which activity is directed necessarily involves imagination . ( 2 ) Necessity of imagination in conscious use of past experience . Reference to the future is meaningless except in terms of past experience . All conceptions of ends are projections of some sort out of past experience . They may involve // reconstruction of past experience to assume new forms that have never been as such any part of past experience . But these forms can have no meaning except in terms of elements of past experience . This bringing of past experience into consciousness is an act of imagination . Without imagination we would be literally tied down to the present moment . The whole span of life would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summed up in the fleeting moment . Neither past nor future could enter into this moment of consciousness . To be sure , past experience might possibly modify present activity , but not with any awareness of the fact or any intention on the part of the individual . It would have to come about through organic modifications which would be completely summed up in automatic sense perception on the one side and reaction processes on the other absolutely determined by neural habit . Past experience could not function consciously in present experience and be brought to bear upon activity to modify , direct , or control that activity with reference to ends . ( 3 ) Necessity of imagination in determining modes of procedure . But thinking may center not alone in the determination of ends . It is concerned with the process of working out more or less in advance of action the method , or mode of procedure , by which ends are to be realized . This mode of procedure , if it is to be highly controlled , must take the form of a definite series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that , then another , etc. , until , as the result of the series of reactions , the end foreseen is realized . Now , if we could clearly conceive ends which we wish to realize , but if we were at the same time limited to the use of motor processes the results of which we could not foresee or anticipate , the whole process of realizing those ends would be blindly experimental . Many of the activities would be absolutely irrelevant , and if any were relevant it would be a matter of pure chance or accident . // Roth the acts and their results must be clearly imaged in order to determine a series of reactions which shall be highly controlled in the process of realizing ends . In thinking , we anticipate on the basis of our past experience what would be the results of certain activities , and while they are still held in the imagination we judge of their probable relevancy or irrelevancy to our needs in this process of adjustment . On the basis of these judgments we reject some acts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite series of steps . In this way we may in imagination work out a definite mode of procedure by which we shall realize our end wholly in advance of the actual undertaking of the motor processes . We can not say , however , that there is no thinking in those cases in which the whole mode of procedure is not worked out in terms of the imagination in advance of its execution . In many cases the thinking and the experimental activity go hand in hand and are continually modifying each other . But this does not give the high degree of control that is realized in the other type of thinking process . 3 . RESTATEMENT IN TERMS OF ADVANTAGE OF IMAGINATION . We might restate the discussion just concluded and get the point more definitely before us by pointing out some of the advantages which accrue from the fact that the imagination functions as it does in the thinking process . If we could not anticipate what the results of any motor process were going to be before they actually took place , but had to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the activities by the time they had taken place would have produced results which changed the situation which we were trying to control and made it forever impossible to realize our ends . We could not go back over our series of acts and alter and reconstruct them ; the activities have already taken place and produced results which are past recall . If , how134 The Psychology of Thinking ever , we work things out in terms of the imagination first , delaying all action in the meantime until we see in anticipation just what the result of each act in the series is going to be , we can avoid undesirable results by discarding those steps which would lead to them , and we can start all over again without any harm having been done . The possibility of controlling the mode of reaction at every point and making it move in a straight course toward the realization of our end still remains so long as we keep the whole process in terms of the imagination until it is perfected . We can work out the steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making as many corrections , eliminations , simplifications , or reconstructions as we please . And this can all be done in advance of the motor processes . In so far as our experience is rich and wide enough to enable us to do this successfully , we can get the method of reaction worked out to the finest detail , so that , when it is put over into motor terms , our end is attained without friction , loss , or inadequacy , and all with the highest degree of directness , precision , and skill . The experimentation has all been done in terms of the intellectual process of imagination in advance of action , and the process of adjustment is one that is directed and controlled by consciousness functioning in the form of thinking . 4 . GENERAL RELATION BETWEEN ASSOCIATION AND IMAGINATION IN THINKING . ( z ) Imagination and the laws of association . The stream of images which is constantly flowing in the thinking process moves in accordance with the laws of association . But it has been one of the functions of imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the mind from much of their original setting , or context , and to make of them movable elements which shall be free to enter into new associative combinations . Thus , one 's image tree need not necessarily carry with it the // thought of the particular place where the tree grew , the fact that it was in blossom , or that there was a swing under the tree , although all of these may have been parts of one original perceptual whole . Not only can the image tree be taken out of this setting and given a new context , but even the order and arrangement of its own parts can be changed at will . Constructive activity of the imagination necessary to a real thinking process presupposes fluidity of imagery , or the freedom of elements to be moved to and fro at will and to enter into new combinations . Yet these elements must themselves appear in consciousness for use in harmony with the laws of association . ( 2 ) Accidental and logical ties of connection . If there is any mental activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought into consciousness through the connections which have previously been established , ? connections of time and place which were accidental in their origin or connections of inherent relationship within a system , which were logical or necessary in character . It may be that my Uncle John was in San Francisco at the time of the earthquake . As a consequence of this , whenever I think of my Uncle John , I think also of earthquake and San Francisco ; and whenever I think of San Francisco , I think also of earthquake and my Uncle John . One element of the whole group suggests all the others . But the additional items which are suggested come as the result of associations which may be regarded as accidental rather than as necessary . The tie of connection between San Francisco , earthquake , and my Uncle John is not one that is inherent in the nature of these things . It is an accident of time and place that binds together these various elements into one whole such that now any one of them is likely to suggest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of football , then of roundness , and then of moon , the associative process operating in suggesting this series is determined not by accidental but by inherent ties // of connection . Roundness is an inherent characteristic of both the football and the moon and serves to connect them in thought independently of the accidents of circumstance . In a mathematical thinking process , I may have need of the rule for finding the area of a triangle . I know that a triangle is equivalent to one half of a parallelogram with the same base and altitude . I know that the area of a parallelogram is equal to the product of its base and altitude . Then the area of a triangle is found by taking one half the product of its base and altitude . The associative process by means of which I recalled the rule for the area of a triangle depended upon inherent ties of connection , ties of connection which are logical , necessary , and universal . ( 3 ) Superiority of logical ties of connection . In thinking , ties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be taken advantage of for the purpose of bringing before the mind the elements of past experience necessary for the solution of the problem . But it is evident that the organization of knowledge , so far as possible , on the basis of inherent , or logical , ties of connection makes it more permanently and more universally available for use in a thinking process . The pedagogical implications of this are quite obvious , and we shall leave this point , for the present at least , and develop at greater length an aspect of the relation between association and imagination in the thinking process which is more likely to be overlooked . ( 4 ) Question of control over the associative mechanism in thinking . We talk a great deal about the laws of association , and we often forget how little control , after all , we have over the associative process as it operates in thinking . The suggestions which we need in thinking through a problem can not be forced . They must ultimately come spontaneously through ties of connection , accidental or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we ais // want . A great deal depends upon the existence and the character of those ties of connection . There is no guarantee that the mechanism of association as it operates in recall will bring just exactly the elements that we need and no others , or that it will bring the elements in the order in which we shall want to use them . In fact , we know of no way whereby we can absolutely control the process so as to be certain of securing at all those elements that we need . If we take the simple case of trying to recall a name which we have forgotten , we can see that all we can do is simply to take advantage of all the possible lines of association and follow them up in the hope that what we need may finally be suggested . Out of a superabundance of material we must select that which is relevant and reject that which is irrelevant . 5 . ILLUSTRATIONS . An illustration or two at this point may clarify the line of thought which is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first illustration will be one given by a pupil in one of the author 's classes . It is the result of introspection of an actual case of thinking in the attempt to deal with a concrete practical problem . " I am asked to play a piece of music at a recital . Various ends suggest themselves , ? training in memorizing the selection , increased knowledge of music , an addition to my repertoire , cultural value , pleasure of my friends , and my own pleasure . " I direct my attention to the field of musical thought . Various questions arise in my mind . Must the selection be short or long ? Considering the nature of the program and the great expectations ( ? ) of the audience a rather long composition must be chosen or else two shorter numbers , an A ' and a B ' . Why not learn something really worth having , even if long ? A short number may be learned at odd moments and without so much effort . It is // to be one long number then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole will help me to decide the sort of music most acceptable . " The composition must be classical in nature , but not too technical , as the audience is not composed entirely of musical students . The music must be either one of two varieties ? either the brilliant , showy style or a more subdued and dreamy sort , but if the latter it must have a clear ringing melody throughout . With this present end in view , I make two selections : Rhapsodie Hongroise , No. 12 , by Liszt and a Beethoven Sonata . Which shall it be ? " The Liszt number will require a longer time to learn , as it is more difficult ; the Sonata is a longer composition . I play them over and time the rendition . Not much difference , the Sonata taking about five minutes longer . Both selections have a variety of movements , from an andante to a vivace . However , the changes of time and movement are more sudden in the Liszt number , keeping one on the alert ; while in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues for some time . You rather settle yourself and wait some time for any variation , thus taking away some of the surprises of a Liszt number . " The Liszt number has a brilliant ending of chromatic octaves , the Sonata ends with big chords . The ending must be striking . A brilliant ending to anything will often cause an audience to be more lenient with a faulty beginning and middle . " Then , too , the Liszt Rhapsodie will be a good thing to memorize because it is different from most of the pieces which I have already memorized , while the Sonata is very much like many others which I already know . " After many such rejections and selections , a decision is made in favor of the Rhapsodie , with the immediate end of rendering it to suit an immediate occasion and the more remote ends of training , added knowledge , and pleasure . " // The second illustration will attempt to reinstate a form of thinking which is quite common in geometry . figure Let us take the familiar proposition : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle are equal . " Given the isosceles triangle ABC , in which AB equals AC ; to prove angle x equals angle y . Now , if the proposition is attacked as an original exercise , and is not a mere reproduction of something learned from a book , a course of thinking something like the following is often that which takes place : " I will draw a line AD perpendicular to BC . Then I have two triangles , I and II . I wonder if I can prove them equal . If I can , then all their homologous parts will be equal , and I can show that angle x equals angle y . " I know that AB of I equals AC of II , by definition of isosceles triangle ; and that AD of I equals AD of II , by identity . Now , if I could only show that angle m equals angle n , I would have two sides and the included angle of one triangle equal respectively to two sides and the included angle of the other , and triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again on new lines of attack , etc. , is even more active than can possibly be described in detail . ( 2 ) Relation of organized system of knowledge to control . While the control over the associative activity in thinking is limited , yet we do know that elements belonging to the same organized system of knowledge are most likely to be reinstated . When the problem is mathematical in character , the ideas which arise in consciousness are apt to be mathematical ; when the problem is historical , the ideas suggested are apt to fall within the field of our knowledge of history ; when the problem is one of conduct or practical life , ideas are apt to arise that belong to the particular setting of that problem . Taking advantage of this principle , we can focus our attention upon the particular field of relevancy ; and the more we do this the more is the imagery likely to be limited to that field . But even then the stream of imagery in any vital thinking process , dealing with a real problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideas which represents the final solution . More elements of past experience have to be thrown up in the associative process than can actually be used in the final adjustment of means to ends . Many of these elements have , however , had a function to perform , they have served as intermediate points of contact for the unwinding of the skein of connections until we have come ultimately to some idea relevant to our solution ; others seem to be absolutely irrelevant , like so much driftwood thrown upon the shore by the current . ( 3 ) Conclusion as to control . Our control over the material of the thinking process is largely a matter of limitation of the field of association through the activity of attention , of selection and rejection of elements given spontaneously through connections set up in previous experiences , and of organizing and reorganizing elements that are felt to be relevant into new wholes or in new orders of arrangement . From this point of view // the voluntary element in thinking is identical with the voluntary element in motor activities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starts out with an excess of movements already possible . Of these superabundant movements some are found to be relevant and others irrelevant . Gradually the irrelevant are dropped out and the relevant are selected and organized into a definite mode of procedure which realizes our end . Without the excess , or superabundance , of movements , voluntary action would be impossible ; without the superabundance of ideas furnished by the mechanism of association , thinking would be impossible . 7 . SUMMARY OF THE THINKING PROCESS IN TERMS OF THE IMAGINATION . The activity of thinking seems to consist in doing the following things , though not necessarily separately and in order . When the mind is confronted with a problem , attention is focused upon a certain field of experience relevant to that problem . The associative process works within that field , throwing up spontaneously certain suggestions relevant and irrelevant . There is tentative judgment and evaluation of the elements presented . Those which are felt to be irrelevant are rejected and those which seem to be relevant are selected . There is further focusing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity of the associative process in these directions . There is again evaluation and selection , and so on . There results finally a series of images that are held more or less definitely before the mind , which have been constructed to represent a series of steps , or order of processes , to be gone through with in order to realize our end . 8 . INADEQUACY FOR PEDAGOGY OF THE OLDER ACCOUNTS OF THINKING . ( I ) Psychology of formal thinking not ( ( rital . Most of the older accounts of the thinking process are zoo The Psychology of Thinking II . Is angle m equal to angle n ? I do n't see any way of showing it . " Can I prove the two triangles equal in any other way ? Two triangles are equal if they have a side and two adjacent angles of the one equal respectively to a side and two adjacent angles of the other . I look at my figure . Same trouble with angles as before . Two triangles are equal if the three sides of the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , maybe I can get along without those troublesome angles . Let me see . I had two sides of the one equal respectively to two sides of the other . I must show that DB is equal to DC . Stuck again . They do look equal , but there is nothing in my hypothesis or my construction that makes them so . " What shall I do ? Could I make them equal ? Oh , yes , I might draw AD to the middle point of BC . Why then , it is all done . I will have the three sides of one triangle equal respectively to the three sides of the other . The two triangles will be equal ; and angle x must be equal to angle Y. When the results of the above thinking process are thrown into the form of a logical demonstration , the whole procedure will be condensed into the following brief compass : Draw AD to the middle point of BC . Now in triangles I and II , AB of I equals AC of II , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of II , by identity . DB of I equals DC of II , by construction . Therefore triangle I equals triangle II . ( Two triangles are equal if the three sides of the one are equal respectively to the three sides of the other . ) Therefore angle x equals angle y . ( Homologous angles of equal triangles are equal . ) Q. E. D. // Our study of the thinking processes as they actually take place in attempts to solve vital problems will serve to emphasize several things which are to be stated and developed explicitly in the series of topics which will constitute the remainder of this chapter . The reader is asked to keep these illustrations in mind as he continues . 6 . FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONTROL OF ASSOCIATION IN THINKING . ( I ) Limitations of control . Our illustrations have made it evident that there can be , at best , only a limited amount of control over the associative process as it operates in thinking . This is equally true whether the problem which provokes thought be practical or theoretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely limited and circumscribed , we see that the absolutely essential ideas do not come on demand , and when they do come it is not in their perfect order of relationship . There are abundant suggestions thrown up on the basis of past associations . All that the associative mechanism can do is to give forth what has been committed to it in harmony with the nature of the ties of connection which have been set up . These suggestions have to be judged , evaluated for present purposes , and selected or rejected . Finally , the results of the whole process may be thrown into the form of a demonstration , in which the essential elements are organized into a definite series of steps in which the relationship of means to end is clearly exhibited and made apparent . In practical problems of conduct and in theoretic problems of economics and science , the essential elements of problems are not usually so sharply defined and contained within narrow and closed limits as in mathematics . Consequently the control over the associative activity in the attempt to get relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groping for suggestions , feeling for their Ito The Psychology of Thinking choose ? Shall it be hard wood or soft wood ? Which will best stand the changes that are involved in alternate soakings and dryings ? Shall I use nails or screws ? Is the wood which I have selected likely to split or crack where I drive in the nails ? How shall I give every piece just the right dimensions so that it will fit exactly into its place and leave no chance for the water to get through ? What size must the box be in order to contain the requisite amount of water ? " etc . The problem of adjusting means to end in such cases may become problematic at a variety of points , according to the extent of one 's previous experiences . When the thinking process is involved at any one of these points there is nothing artificial or formal about its use . Yet this process is called forth frequently and gets abundant exercise . ( 5 ) Appropriateness of manual training for early exercise of thinking . Manual training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process in the earlier stages of its development . All our present-day psychology is emphasizing the fact that motor processes are more primary than thought processes . Thought processes intervene to modify and perfect modes of reaction . The needs of the individual are thus better met . In manual training we are taking our start at the point which biology and psychology both emphasize as the right point of departure . The thought processes when they appear come in their natural setting . They are strictly relevant to a motor process which is to meet some need or satisfy some impulse . In these motor processes of manual training , process and product of activity are quite closely related . Means and end can be easily grasped and thought processes involved in making adjustment can be very simple . From simpler situations the transition is easily made to more and more complex situations , thus providing for progressive training in thinking up through the various stages of mental development . // The value of starting with the simple and concrete problems of manual training will be shown from another angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination in relation to the power of thinking . Suffice it to emphasize the thought at this point that the first problems of thought are most naturally those which spring from problems of action of some sort , and that only later does the thought process become so specialized as to grasp and wrestle with intellectual problems in more or less isolation from an immediately practical situation . Manual training , while furnishing an abundance of concrete problems for the exercise of the thinking function in concrete terms , should , however , also serve as the matrix out of which distinctly intellectual problems should later grow . ( 6 ) Criticism of dictation ; fallacy of ideal of finished product . Do we realize fully enough in our schools the value of manual training from the point of view of its use in developing the power to think ? It is sometimes conducted as if its sole value were thought to be in the manual dexterity or the finished products which it yielded . No problems are conceived by the children , and there is no process of conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher dictates both end and process . The process is broken up into a series of steps . One step is dictated . When this step is completed , then another is taken in which the teacher determines just what is to be done and how it is to be done . The child needs to see for himself practically nothing of the relevancy of what he is doing , he needs to make no conscious adjustments . He has only to go through certain definite motor processes . There can be in this no training in thinking . All that the child can get is a certain amount of manual dexterity . Of course , he may secure a better finished product for the time being . It is doubtless the fetich of the finished product which ' See Chapter XIV . // the teacher has been taught to worship blindly that has been responsible for her whole abnormal mode of procedure . I say " taught to worship " advisedly ; for when her work is put on exhibition is it not the most finished products which are expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress in the actual achievements of the pupils from day to day or week to week ? In our anxiety for results which are immediate , tangible , and visible , we bow down to the golden calf of the finished product , substituting an unholy idolatry for the true worship of real training . Of course stimulation , guidance , and direction on the part of the teacher are necessary . Sometimes even more direct help must be given , but surely this need not be carried so far as to amount to practical dictation at every point . ( q ) Increased motor efficiency from training in vital thinking . Some scope for the exercise of the thinking powers according to the stage of their development may be left in every manual training exercise . This should be done not alone for the sake of the training in thinking but also for the increased efficiency which accrues to the manual training activity itself from the cultivation of the thinking process . A teacher in a prominent school for the professional training of teachers of manual training said in conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through technical courses in manual training in the university , who could make every kind of joint that might be involved in any part of their work , but who were lamentably deficient in working out the problems involved in the execution of a rather simple concrete piece of work in which they had to determine for themselves what kind of joint should be used . They had evidently been drilled in technique first instead of starting with concrete situations relatively simple and working out technique in connection with the solution of problems . Their thinking and their technique were out // of relation to each other . The training of thinking in the actual manual training activities gives more varied and more perfect control over the manual arts themselves . 4 . MATHEMATICS . ( r ) Recognized value of mathematics . The place of mathematics in the process of training to think need not be elaborated very fully . It is an older subject in the history of the curriculum than manual training , and the methods of handling it , have been more definitely worked out and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par excellence the school subject adapted to the training of thinking processes . There is no question that on the side of conditions the mathematical branches satisfy the demand of furnishing abundant problematic situations . ( 2 ) Danger of formalism and lack of motivation . The possibilities of mathematics in the matter of furnishing problems we shall not need to discuss . But there are other phases which need careful consideration . There is the question of adequate motivation . Are we handling the mathematical branches in such a way that the thinking process is called forth under normal and dynamic conditions , that is , in situations where it comes in to play a real and vital part in a larger whole of activity ? Mathematics involves a remarkably large amount and variety of technique . Are we making too much of the technique in advance of any felt need for it in the thinking process ? While we are accustomed to think of mathematics as preeminently a thought subject , is there actually any other subject in which it is possible to do so much manipulation of symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real thinking ? ( 3 ) Vital training of thinking in mathematics . Is there any way of making mathematics , particularly in the earlier stages , more dynamic and real and less a matter of formal drill ? Yes , if it can be made to grow out of certain forms of activity in which the child is already interI24 The Psychology or Thinking ested . All forms of mathematical thought , if they have any function at all , have their justification in the added control which they give us over our activities . Arithmetical , algebraic , and geometrical formulations should , then , have a basis in activities of some sort to which they are immediately relevant , and this connection between the mathematical mode of thought and the active process to which it is relevant should be maintained until the development of mathematics as a science has impressed the mind as itself worth while for the sake of the values which inhere in the subject . If the boy is already interested in making boxes , sleds , etc. , he finds that he has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inch , foot , yard , and various combinations of these , need to be known . It is a serious matter in the making of his sled if the runners are not equidistant throughout . And the corners of his box have to be square , and the wheels of his cart or his bicycle have to be perfect circles . Thus we might go on and enumerate hosts of elementary facts and principles of arithmetic , algebra , and geometry which are bound up with the manual training activity . This fact of their connection with the satisfaction of the constructive impulse makes them relevant and vital . There is motive for learning them , even to getting right down to the task of drilling upon them . There are some who assert that no number combination should be taught to the child until he has actually run up against a situation which has made him feel the need of it . This application of the principle seems to be extreme ; but it certainly is feasible to withhold the drill upon number combinations until the child has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel the need of these number combinations sufficiently that the teaching of a new combination does not become a wholly arbitrary process . So with those processes which belong more particularly to thinking and reasoning in mathematics . Problems in buyTraining // ing and selling , in laying of carpets and floors , in papering , painting , etc. , if brought right clown to the familiar setting of the child 's everyday life , furnish situations in which means have to be adjusted to ends tinder conditions which make the thinking process involved and the elements of technique required seem very vital . Definite and accurate forms of analysis and of demonstration , which follow , instead of preceding , actual thinking processes to which they are relevant , are seen to be valuable acquisitions for more perfect control of the thinking process and are studied with greater relish and appreciation . The laboratory method of teaching mathematics , if it could be extended more widely , would do much to bring about more real and vital and intelligent thinking in mathematics . 5 . HISTORY . ( r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history it is comparatively easy to develop concrete situations in which problematic elements stand forth clearly and definitely . For example , all the facts of llraddock 's campaign in the French and Indian War can be made to center about the problem of the control of the Mississippi valley . Let the children be presented with an abundance of concrete facts relative to the life of the times , so that they can put themselves back in thought right into the midst of the problem . Let them see clearly the colonists pushing westward over the mountains . What would be one of the easiest routes ? They will see that it will be by the valleys of the rivers that converge to form the Ohio . Let them see clearly the line of French explorers and traders crowding into the Mississippi valley from the north . In process of time they will completely shut off the American colonists from westward expansion . What will they do about it ? Where will the conflict of races be likely first to occur ? Why ? If you were one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you regard as // your strategic point in the campaign ? And what would your plan of campaign be ? Suppose you were a leader among the French . Think the same thing through from their point of view . Without carrying this illustration out further , we may suggest that if children can get a situation clearly before them , viewing it from the inside , as it were , they need not merely follow the record of events , but they may anticipate them in large part as the outcomes of circumstances and conditions which are adequate to their explanation . Thus there is abundant opportunity for the exercise of the function of thinking . As a consequence of this mode of procedure the facts learned are also fixed more firmly in the mind . The work of the great Constitutional Convention may be taken up with older pupils in such a way as to make them conceive the problem and to forecast in some measure fundamental aspects of its solution . This will require the study of an abundance of details as to the difficulties involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now become states . Only through the study of an abundance of details can the problem be made to stand out sharply . Also the pupils must have considerable familiarity with the chief types of government in the various separate colonies . Knowing what forms of governmental procedure the members of the Convention were familiar with , it will be possible for the pupils to suggest certain principles that are likely to be embodied in the constitution of the closer Union . Familiarity with the excellencies and the defects of the Articles of Confederation will furnish additional data relevant to the solution of the problem . Students may judge for themselves what ideas would impress the members of the Convention as of most relevancy and of most worth . Also a detailed knowledge of the variety and nature of the conflicting interests represented would make it possible for the pupils to forecast some of the compromises which are responsible for certain features // of the Constitution , for example , the provision for equal representation of the states in the Senate and proportional representation in the House of Representatives ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1808. ( 2 ) Value of emphasis on the concrete problem . In so far as the study of history can be made to center about concrete problems which give meaning to the collection of masses of details and which call for the exercise of the pupil 's constructive and interpretative powers in construing facts and events in terms of social and political movements , in so far is the child getting splendid training in thinking through his study of history . We are too prone to think of history in terms of record of fact . It is in reality not one half so much record of fact as it is interpretation of fact . It is a weighing , judging , and sifting of facts , leading to some reorganization which throws light upon social and political movements and makes them intelligible . I n the concrete body of historical facts there lie imbedded social and political laws and principles which have meaning and significance only as they are seen in their setting . We might give the pupil outright an organized system of historical facts closely knit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the science . But this gives him neither a just appreciation of the facts nor of the principles involved . He has not thought them through for himself in a way that makes them forever his own , a body of working capital for further study and interpretation of social and political problems in his own time and generation . May not the pupil within certain limits be encouraged to go through the facts for himself , judging and sifting them from the point of view of some problem , making his own interpretations and discovering principles for himself , and only later bringing his interpretations and conclusions to the test of their comparison with the views of the expert historian ? This would throw a decided emphasis upon thinking and would cultivate an independence // of thought which can never be secured by the process of always following and trying to understand the thoughts of others . We already have too many graduates of our schools , and even of our colleges , of the " It says " type . We ought to he developing more of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close investigation for themselves and of that clear thinking through of problems which enables one to give a reason for the statement which he makes . 6 . GEOGRAPHY . Geography furnishes hosts of problems that can be treated in such a way as to provide the conditions for vital thinking . We need suggest only a few by way of illustration , without working out the method of treating them . Why is the climate of England warmer than that of Labrador ? Why are the lands just east of the Rocky Mountains arid ? Why is the United States cutting a canal through the Isthmus of Panama ? What are the conditions that have operated to make New York , Chicago , and St. Louis such large cities ? It is easy to supply the data necessary to the solution of such problems . Why should not the children be left to work out the solutions for themselves so far as possible instead of being told the whole thing ? Almost all of the vital truths of geography can be brought out through the study of typical problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely in terms of themselves ; even mountains , lakes , and valleys he may come to think of in terms of conditions and causes , in terms of processes which are going on all the time , now as well as in the past , in terms of complex relationships between means and ends . Thus he not only gets abundant practice in thinking , but he is also building up the habit of thinking , of looking for principles in accordance with which to explain the simplest phenomena which to another might be taken for granted as mere brute facts . // It would be interesting to work out suggestions for the teaching of language , reading , and some of the physical and biological sciences with special reference to the fulfilment of the conditions of thinking . But enough has been done to illustrate the principle which we wish to make clear , and to emphasize the value and the possibility of doing more in the way of training pupils in elementary and high schools to think . It is evident from the preceding discussions that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent upon the selection of a particular body of subject matter as it is upon the attitude taken toward that subject matter . No teacher can be so thoroughly circumscribed and limited by the nature of the subject matter or by the directions of supervisors as to exclude the possibility within certain limits of leading children to conceive problems and to use their own powers of mind in the struggle for their solution . CHAPTER XI THE ACTIVITY OF THE IMAGINATION IN THINKING I. THINKING IN TERMS OF ITS CONTENT . ( 1 ) Distinction between imagination and thinking . If we look into our minds when a thinking process is going on we find a stream of imagery . Images are the content , or mental stuff , of the thinking process . But thinking differs from other processes in which past experience functions to determine action not so much in terms of content as it does in terms of the organization of the imagery and its conscious direction toward ends . Imagination and thinking are not two separate and distinct processes . Images are involved in both cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which ideas are embodied , with their explanation in terms of past experience and in the light of present conditions , with the laws of connection and sequence of images , etc . When we are dealing with problems of this sort , we are apt to use the term imagination . But when we think of the stream of images as organized in such a way as to perform the function of consciously adjusting means to ends , then we call the activity of imagination a thinking process . ( a ) Constructive imagination and thinking . When it comes to a case of constructive imagination the line between it and a thinking process is very shadowy indeed . From one point of view they are absolutely identical . In so far as we can distinguish them at all , it is only with reference to the aspect on which attention is fixed , whether that of content or that of function . If we are considering the mental content and the facts and laws of its 130 // organization as related to the process of getting new mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are considering the function of this reorganization and reconstruction of the elements of past experience and their embodiment in new forms , we call the process thinking . 2 . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE OF IMAGINATION IN THE THINKING PROCESS . In thinking , imagination gets its fullest significance and meaning . The power of imaging things or events does not exist for its own sake but to make past experience the more effective in processes of adjustment . In thinking , the image process rises to the level of meeting the needs of the organism in new and problematic situations . ( z ) Necessity of imagination in conception of ends . Thinking is teleological . It has at its bottom a practical basis . It is a process that goes on with reference to ends . It always involves some kind of forward reference . It presupposes that there is something not in your present experience which you seek to bring into it . There is an end unrealized , still in the future . As it does not exist now in terms of reality , it exists only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is embodied in the form of an image . In no other way can it be presented to consciousness . It would be possible , of course , without imagination to set up motor activities , to make things happen , but we could not determine in advance what should happen . The process would be blind and random experimentation , involving no individual control whatever . The conception of an end toward which activity is directed necessarily involves imagination . ( 2 ) Necessity of imagination in conscious use of past experience . Reference to the future is meaningless except in terms of past experience . All conceptions of ends are projections of some sort out of past experience . They may involve // reconstruction of past experience to assume new forms that have never been as such any part of past experience . But these forms can have no meaning except in terms of elements of past experience . This bringing of past experience into consciousness is an act of imagination . Without imagination we would be literally tied down to the present moment . The whole span of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be summed up in the fleeting moment . Neither past nor future could enter into this moment of consciousness . To be sure , past experience might possibly modify present activity , but not with any awareness of the fact or any intention on the part of the individual . It would have to come about through organic modifications which would be completely summed up in automatic sense perception on the one side and reaction processes on the other absolutely determined by neural habit . Past experience could not function consciously in present experience and be brought to bear upon activity to modify , direct , or control that activity with reference to ends . ( 3 ) Necessity of imagination in determining modes of procedure . But thinking may center not alone in the determination of ends . It is concerned with the process of working out more or less in advance of action the method , or mode of procedure , by which ends are to be realized . This mode of procedure , if it is to be highly controlled , must take the form of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction , then that , then another , etc. , until , as the result of the series of reactions , the end foreseen is realized . Now , if we could clearly conceive ends which we wish to realize , but if we were at the same time limited to the use of motor processes the results of which we could not foresee or anticipate , the whole process of realizing those ends would be blindly experimental . Many of the activities would be absolutely irrelevant , and if any were relevant it would be a matter of pure chance or accident . // Roth the acts and their results must be clearly imaged in order to determine a series of reactions which shall be highly controlled in the process of realizing ends . In thinking , we anticipate on the basis of our past experience what would be the results of certain activities , and while they are still held in the imagination we judge of their probable relevancy or irrelevancy to our needs in this process of adjustment . On the basis of these judgments we reject some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a definite series of steps . In this way we may in imagination work out a definite mode of procedure by which we shall realize our end wholly in advance of the actual undertaking of the motor processes . We can not say , however , that there is no thinking in those cases in which the whole mode of procedure is not worked out in terms of the imagination in advance of its execution . In many cases the thinking and the experimental activity go hand in hand and are continually modifying each other . But this does not give the high degree of control that is realized in the other type of thinking process . 3 . RESTATEMENT IN TERMS OF ADVANTAGE OF IMAGINATION . We might restate the discussion just concluded and get the point more definitely before us by pointing out some of the advantages which accrue from the fact that the imagination functions as it does in the thinking process . If we could not anticipate what the results of any motor process were going to be before they actually took place , but had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , the activities by the time they had taken place would have produced results which changed the situation which we were trying to control and made it forever impossible to realize our ends . We could not go back over our series of acts and alter and reconstruct them ; the activities have already taken place and produced results which are past recall . If , how134 The Psychology of Thinking ever , we work things out in terms of the imagination first , delaying all action in the meantime until we see in anticipation just what the result of each act in the series is going to be , we can avoid undesirable results by discarding those steps which would lead to them , and we can start all over again without any harm having been done . The possibility of controlling the mode of reaction at every point and making it move in a straight course toward the realization of our end still remains so long as we keep the whole process in terms of the imagination until it is perfected . We can work out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , making as many corrections , eliminations , simplifications , or reconstructions as we please . And this can all be done in advance of the motor processes . In so far as our experience is rich and wide enough to enable us to do this successfully , we can get the method of reaction worked out to the finest detail , so that , when it is put over into motor terms , our end is attained without friction , loss , or inadequacy , and all with the highest degree of directness , precision , and skill . The experimentation has all been done in terms of the intellectual process of imagination in advance of action , and the process of adjustment is one that is directed and controlled by consciousness functioning in the form of thinking . 4 . GENERAL RELATION BETWEEN ASSOCIATION AND IMAGINATION IN THINKING . ( z ) Imagination and the laws of association . The stream of images which is constantly flowing in the thinking process moves in accordance with the laws of association . But it has been one of the functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are brought before the mind from much of their original setting , or context , and to make of them movable elements which shall be free to enter into new associative combinations . Thus , one 's image tree need not necessarily carry with it the // thought of the particular place where the tree grew , the fact that it was in blossom , or that there was a swing under the tree , although all of these may have been parts of one original perceptual whole . Not only can the image tree be taken out of this setting and given a new context , but even the order and arrangement of its own parts can be changed at will . Constructive activity of the imagination necessary to a real thinking process presupposes fluidity of imagery , or the freedom of elements to be moved to and fro at will and to enter into new combinations . Yet these elements must themselves appear in consciousness for use in harmony with the laws of association . ( 2 ) Accidental and logical ties of connection . If there is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience are brought into consciousness through the connections which have previously been established , ? connections of time and place which were accidental in their origin or connections of inherent relationship within a system , which were logical or necessary in character . It may be that my Uncle John was in San Francisco at the time of the earthquake . As a consequence of this , whenever I think of my Uncle John , I think also of earthquake and San Francisco ; and whenever I think of San Francisco , I think also of earthquake and my Uncle John . One element of the whole group suggests all the others . But the additional items which are suggested come as the result of associations which may be regarded as accidental rather than as necessary . The tie of connection between San Francisco , earthquake , and my Uncle John is not one that is inherent in the nature of these things . It is an accident of time and place that binds together these various elements into one whole such that now any one of them is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I think of football , then of roundness , and then of moon , the associative process operating in suggesting this series is determined not by accidental but by inherent ties // of connection . Roundness is an inherent characteristic of both the football and the moon and serves to connect them in thought independently of the accidents of circumstance . In a mathematical thinking process , I may have need of the rule for finding the area of a triangle . I know that a triangle is equivalent to one half of a parallelogram with the same base and altitude . I know that the area of a parallelogram is equal to the product of its base and altitude . Then the area of a triangle is found by taking one half the product of its base and altitude . The associative process by means of which I recalled the rule for the area of a triangle depended upon inherent ties of connection , ties of connection which are logical , necessary , and universal . ( 3 ) Superiority of logical ties of connection . In thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inherent , may be taken advantage of for the purpose of bringing before the mind the elements of past experience necessary for the solution of the problem . But it is evident that the organization of knowledge , so far as possible , on the basis of inherent , or logical , ties of connection makes it more permanently and more universally available for use in a thinking process . The pedagogical implications of this are quite obvious , and we shall leave this point , for the present at least , and develop at greater length an aspect of the relation between association and imagination in the thinking process which is more likely to be overlooked . ( 4 ) Question of control over the associative mechanism in thinking . We talk a great deal about the laws of association , and we often forget how little control , after all , we have over the associative process as it operates in thinking . The suggestions which we need in thinking through a problem can not be forced . They must ultimately come spontaneously through ties of connection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have and what we ais // want . A great deal depends upon the existence and the character of those ties of connection . There is no guarantee that the mechanism of association as it operates in recall will bring just exactly the elements that we need and no others , or that it will bring the elements in the order in which we shall want to use them . In fact , we know of no way whereby we can absolutely control the process so as to be certain of securing at all those elements that we need . If we take the simple case of trying to recall a name which we have forgotten , we can see that all we can do is simply to take advantage of all the possible lines of association and follow them up in the hope that what we need may finally be suggested . Out of a superabundance of material we must select that which is relevant and reject that which is irrelevant . 5 . ILLUSTRATIONS . An illustration or two at this point may clarify the line of thought which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first illustration will be one given by a pupil in one of the author 's classes . It is the result of introspection of an actual case of thinking in the attempt to deal with a concrete practical problem . " I am asked to play a piece of music at a recital . Various ends suggest themselves , ? training in memorizing the selection , increased knowledge of music , an addition to my repertoire , cultural value , pleasure of my friends , and my own pleasure . " I direct my attention to the field of musical thought . Various questions arise in my mind . Must the selection be short or long ? Considering the nature of the program and the great expectations ( ? ) of the audience a rather long composition must be chosen or else two shorter numbers , an A ' and a B ' . Why not learn something really worth having , even if long ? A short number may be learned at odd moments and without so much effort . It is // to be one long number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience as a whole will help me to decide the sort of music most acceptable . " The composition must be classical in nature , but not too technical , as the audience is not composed entirely of musical students . The music must be either one of two varieties ? either the brilliant , showy style or a more subdued and dreamy sort , but if the latter it must have a clear ringing melody throughout . With this present end in view , I make two selections : Rhapsodie Hongroise , No. 12 , by Liszt and a Beethoven Sonata . Which shall it be ? " The Liszt number will require a longer time to learn , as it is more difficult ; the Sonata is a longer composition . I play them over and time the rendition . Not much difference , the Sonata taking about five minutes longer . Both selections have a variety of movements , from an andante to a vivace . However , the changes of time and movement are more sudden in the Liszt number , keeping one on the alert ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once started continues for some time . You rather settle yourself and wait some time for any variation , thus taking away some of the surprises of a Liszt number . " The Liszt number has a brilliant ending of chromatic octaves , the Sonata ends with big chords . The ending must be striking . A brilliant ending to anything will often cause an audience to be more lenient with a faulty beginning and middle . " Then , too , the Liszt Rhapsodie will be a good thing to memorize because it is different from most of the pieces which I have already memorized , while the Sonata is very much like many others which I already know . " After many such rejections and selections , a decision is made in favor of the Rhapsodie , with the immediate end of rendering it to suit an immediate occasion and the more remote ends of training , added knowledge , and pleasure . " // The second illustration will attempt to reinstate a form of thinking which is quite common in geometry . Let us take the familiar proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isosceles triangle are equal . " Given the isosceles triangle ABC , in which AB equals AC ; to prove angle x equals angle y . Now , if the proposition is attacked as an original exercise , and is not a mere reproduction of something learned from a book , a course of thinking something like the following is often that which takes place : " I will draw a line AD perpendicular to BC . Then I have two triangles , I and II . I wonder if I can prove them equal . If I can , then all their homologous parts will be equal , and I can show that angle x equals angle y . " I know that AB of I equals AC of II , by definition of isosceles triangle ; and that AD of I equals AD of II , by identity . Now , if I could only show that angle m equals angle n , I would have two sides and the included angle of one triangle equal respectively to two sides and the included angle of the other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thinking II . Is angle m equal to angle n ? I do n't see any way of showing it . " Can I prove the two triangles equal in any other way ? Two triangles are equal if they have a side and two adjacent angles of the one equal respectively to a side and two adjacent angles of the other . I look at my figure . Same trouble with angles as before . Two triangles are equal if the three sides of the one are equal respectively to the three sides of the other . Now , maybe I can get along without those troublesome angles . Let me see . I had two sides of the one equal respectively to two sides of the other . I must show that DB is equal to DC . Stuck again . They do look equal , but there is nothing in my hypothesis or my construction that makes them so . " What shall I do ? Could I make them equal ? Oh , yes , I might draw AD to the middle point of BC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the three sides of one triangle equal respectively to the three sides of the other . The two triangles will be equal ; and angle x must be equal to angle Y. When the results of the above thinking process are thrown into the form of a logical demonstration , the whole procedure will be condensed into the following brief compass : Draw AD to the middle point of BC . Now in triangles I and II , AB of I equals AC of II , by definition of isosceles triangle . AD of I equals AD of II , by identity . DB of I equals DC of II , by construction . Therefore triangle I equals triangle II . ( Two triangles are equal if the three sides of the one are equal respectively to the three sides of the other . ) Therefore angle x equals angle y . ( Homologous angles of equal triangles are equal . ) Q. E. D. // the voluntary element in thinking is identical with the voluntary element in motor activities . The organization of any new voluntary act , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Of these superabundant movements some are found to be relevant and others irrelevant . Gradually the irrelevant are dropped out and the relevant are selected and organized into a definite mode of procedure which realizes our end . Without the excess , or superabundance , of movements , voluntary action would be impossible ; without the superabundance of ideas furnished by the mechanism of association , thinking would be impossible . 7 . SUMMARY OF THE THINKING PROCESS IN TERMS OF THE IMAGINATION . The activity of thinking seems to consist in doing the following things , though not necessarily separately and in order . When the mind is confronted with a problem , attention is focused upon a certain field of experience relevant to that problem . The associative process works within that field , throwing up spontaneously certain suggestions relevant and irrelevant . There is tentative judgment and evaluation of the elements presented . Those which are felt to be irrelevant are rejected and those which seem to be relevant are selected . There is further focusing of attention upon the elements selected for consideration , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is again evaluation and selection , and so on . There results finally a series of images that are held more or less definitely before the mind , which have been constructed to represent a series of steps , or order of processes , to be gone through with in order to realize our end . 8 . INADEQUACY FOR PEDAGOGY OF THE OLDER ACCOUNTS OF THINKING . ( I ) Psychology of formal thinking not ( ( rital . Most of the older accounts of the thinking process are // cast too much in logical terms . They are the result of analysis of adult thinking processes , nay more than that , of the highly wrought thinking processes of the trained reasoner when the results of his thinking process are put into their most finished form . The syllogism is analyzed as a finished product and found to involve a definitely related series of propositions . The proposition is considered identical with a judgment . The judgment is analyzed and found to involve a comparison of two concepts , and so on . Descriptive psychology has paid too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that series which represents the solution of a problem and too little attention to the mental processes which led up to the attainment of those ideas and their organization and incorporation into a movement of thought which attained the solution . It is evident from the illustrations which we have given , particularly the one from geometry , that a psychology of the thinking process worked out in terms of an analysis of the finished product ( for example , in terms of the series of steps involved in the completed demonstration ) ignores the dynamic aspect of this process and does violence to the true psychology of vital thinking as it actually occurs in experience . The analysis of the finished product , of the ideal and perfect organization of the thinking process dominated by the use of the most perfect technique of control , ? such an analysis reveals none of the groping of the mind for relevant associations , none of the intensity of the process of evaluation , or judgment , of the ideas that arise before the mind in the associative process , none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle involved in organization and reorganization of material into a definite series of steps which shall represent an organized mode of procedure . And are not these the important characteristics which we found in the actual solution of the problem in geometry ? If there is this intensity of struggle in the case of mathematical problems , all of whose elements // lie within such definite and narrowly confined limits , how much more is this tension of mind characteristic of practical problems of ethics and business and politics ! The mind which follows through the series of steps involved in the finished product of thinking , as for example , in the formal demonstration in geometry , has its thinking function reduced to a process of mere assent to the connection of ideas worked out by another . The one who made the demonstration did all the vital thinking . The most vital part of all was that which preceded the formal demonstration . Any one who has worked " originals " in geometry can testify to that . The one who follows the steps of the finished product does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of means . That would involve making connections for one 's self , actually working out the relation between means and end and constructing the series of steps which should realize the end . In all this discussion of the associative process in thinking , this point certainly ought to stand out by this time very vividly and clearly , namely , that the most vital part of ordinary thinking can not be described in terms of the syllogism nor in terms of any other highly wrought and ideally perfect mode of procedure that can be analyzed out of completed solutions of problems either inductive or deductive . Educational method and educational practice have suffered enough already from the attempt to base methods for growing minds struggling with real problems upon the psychology of the finished product of the thinking process . No analysis of the goal can ever alone supply us with the data for method , but only the analysis of the methods by which minds actually reach that goal is sufficient for this purpose . Thinking as a process controlled and directed by the use of highly wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal of a long process of training . And even when it is attained , it is exceedingly doubtful if there is any one who ever thinks through new to // problems in such a highly technical fashion as the syllogism represents . ( 2 ) Logical power not attained through formal training alone . The illustration given from geometry is only typical of what is equally true in many other school subjects . The logical , highly organized , system of thought is given directly to the pupil . We then wonder why he can not make use of the facts learned to think out a problem which arises elsewhere to which this material would be relevant . The truth is that the pupil has not acquired any additional logical power in merely following through and assenting to the logically arranged material . It is pedagogically most vicious to suppose that logical power of thinking can be developed except as the mind goes through for itself the whole process of solving problems . This includes the active functioning of the associative process already described , with all its tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though models of finished thinking of course have their value , the power to think can not be acquired by any monkey-like process of imitation . Dictation of the order of ideas and of their organization into a system , or a mode of procedure , is just as bad in manual training , in geography , in history , in science , or any other subect as it has proved to be in geometry . Some leeway for the more fluid processes of the pupil 's mind must be left , if he is to receive any vital training in thinking . Just how much responsibility is to be thrown upon the pupil is a practical question that must ' ) e answered according to the exigencies of the particular teaching situation . No absolute rule can be laid down in a theoretical treatise . ( 3 ) An objection answered . Some objection may be raised to the preceding argument on the ground that when geometry was taught by the old method of starting with fixed logical concepts and following // through demonstrations alt worked out in the text-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of this subject . This is true , but it was not due to the method . Simply these minds were not satisfied to be juggled with ; they felt when they accepted a proposition stated by another , and he then made another statement to Which they were then obliged to assent , until a conclusion was reached in the attainment of which they had no other part than assent , that somehow or other they had been toyed with , that they had been unfairly driven into a corner . Their minds rebelled and they went out on excursions into the field of their own associative processes and worked out things for themselves , often to the great annoyance of their teachers , be it said . Here again geometry furnishes a type of what has been true of other subjects in a less marked and apparent way . Students have gone back of the logical formulations of the text-books ; they have rummaged around in the depths of their own experience until they have brought to light facts by means of which they could interpret those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have not merely followed the thoughts of another , but they have gotten hold of problems and struggled over those problems for themselves , if they have really mastered the subject matter . Fortunately , the mind does sometimes refuse to be wholly tied down to the dictation either of textbook or of teacher . Also fortunately , there have always been some teachers who have never been satisfied with mere reproductions of logical formulations of text-books . One of the strong tendencies of modern pedagogy is to emphasize in a variety of ways to all teachers the absolute futility of trying to teach logical organizations of subject matter without first psychologizing them . They must be prepared for by taking advantage of the whole apperceptive possibilities of the child . What this book is emphasizing , also in a variety of ways , is the futility for purposes of training // in thinking of applying bodily to the child 's mind the modes of thinking characteristic of the trained man and supposing that the child is getting training in the thinking process . The technique of the highly finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve problems . The psychology of this struggle is at least equally important with the psychology of the finished product . 9 . THINKING POWER NOT SEPARABLE FROM POSSESSION OF A FUND OF KNOWLEDGE . The power of thinking can not be trained in the abstract , or in isolation from the process of acquisition of knowledge . In both of the illustrations which we have worked through in detail , it is noticeable that the possession of knowledge within the specific field , ? one that of music , the other that of geometry , ? was a most inevitable corollary of the part which association plays in vital thinking . Success in finding the relevant associates , the elements necessary to the solution of the problem in thought , is contingent upon their number and their organization . Also one 's stock of definite and well-organized knowledge within the field of the problem is an essential factor in the judgment of what is relevant and what is irrelevant to the solution . Taking the problem in geometry for example , past knowledge is continually functioning . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constantly drawing . We may go further than this , and say that probably no one fully acquainted with the subject of geometry , say a teacher of mathematics , would be likely to go at the demonstration of the theorem in so indirect and roundabout fashion . He would get at the essential elements of the solution and organize it into its final form with less waste , less irrelevant thinking . He has well-defined modes of attack and a more highly specialized technique to apply in his methods of investigation in geometry . This last point suggests a very important truth in the // psychology of thinking . Who is most likely to think most successfully in mathematics ? In general , the man who knows the most mathematics and who is trained in its special technique . Who is the most likely to be successful in thinking through problems in economics , in history , in biology , in psychology , in engineering , etc. ? The men who know the most about these subjects and who are trained in the technique characteristic of each . Thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to be applied equally well in all sorts of situations . It is rather a function of some larger whole , varying with the degree of development of that larger whole . That larger whole includes special knowledge of fact and special training in the technique of the subject . The good thinker in mathematics may be a very poor thinker in economics or sociology , and vice versa . The habit of care in the examination of data , in the analysis of a situation , etc. , may be carried over from one department to the other , but the special knowledge and the training in the special technique of one may he of little or no use in the other . The thinking process falls within systems of organized fact , as well as being a factor in the organization of material . . If these things are so , we delude ourselves when we think of such a thing as training children to think apart from the process of building up a body of knowledge . Again , there may be subjects of study which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially adapted to the training of the child to think . But if the stock of ideas in which this subject deals is one which will seldom or never be drawn upon in his thinking in any other connection than as a subject of study , of what value does this training in thinking become to him ? If we are to train children of any age to think , one of the factors in this process is the building up of a system of definite and exact knowledge of facts within the sphere in which the problems of thought are to arise . This body of fact must be organized on the basis of // its inner and inherent ties of connection , so far as this is consistent with the nature of the materials and with the stage of development of the child . A large part of what Mr. James has termed " sagacity " ' as a factor in reasoning , though not the whole of it , is reducible to the factor of knowledge which is immediately available . The author had occasion to note in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain students to think through a problem in that subject very frequently could not be ascribed to a fundamental difference in mental or thought power so much as it could to the fact that the successful reasoner had thoroughly mastered all the definitions and previously proved theorems , so that they were immediately available for use . He does not in the least doubt that the same principle holds true in every school subject . A great deal of loose teaching which does not show results in the definite knowledge of important facts and truths mastered by the pupils is unjustifiably excused on the ground that the chief stress has been put upon the ability to think . The fact is there is no ability to think in geometry without knowing the facts of geometry , in geography without knowing the facts of geography , etc . In pleading for a larger recognition of the vital thought processes of children in the schoolroom , we are not pleading for any diminution of interest in the process of acquiring facts , but rather for methods which make the acquisition of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand made upon him for the exercise of his thinking power in their acquisition and organization . If this is done he will become more fluent and facile in the use of them in further situations demanding thinking . The free and flexible use of facts in the thinking process depends largely on the ties of logical connection which have previously been set up , on the inherent relationships that have been discovered in the past . Facts which are woven together by the intimate ties of connection involved in thinking during // the process of their acquisition are thus more likely to be at any subsequent time many-sided in character and to suggest more of the fundamental relevancies needed in the solution of new thought problems .

CHAPTER XII THE IMAGE AS AN ELEMENT OF TECHNIQUE IN THINKING I. GENERAL PRINCIPLE . In the earlier stages in the development of thinking , the imagery is all concrete ; in the later stages and in its higher forms , a large amount of abstract imagery is used . The substitution of abstract for concrete images in the thinking process is a decided advance in the direction of the development of a superior technique . 2 . OUR USE OF THE TERMS CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT IMAGE . By concrete images we shall mean those that are quite faithful reproductions of sense-perceptions , whether visual , auditory , motor , or those relevant to any other sense . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictorial in character . While all images are more or less symbolic in character , yet there are wider divergencies in their symbolic function from the image which is primarily re-presentative to that which is arbitrarily symbolic . There are correspondingly different degrees of abstractness of images . The term abstract is not used to mark off a class of images that are sharply differentiated from the concrete , but rather a departure from the reproductive and re-presentative character of the image in the direction of greater symbolism . The visual image house might be called concrete , if it were a reproduction , a more or less detailed mental picture , of some particular house ; it might be called abstract to a certain degree if I52 // the image were only schematic , like this , ? Such an image is certainly not lacking in concrete character , yet it certainly represents a movement of the mind away from reproductive detail toward greater symbolism . In so far as this is true the image is abstract . The image house would be still more abstract if it were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of the word spoken . In these cases , the re-presentative character of the image is entirely lacking , and the symbol is arbitrary . Any other word-symbol would do just as well , provided we agreed upon it . There can be no doubt that the thinking of trained adults goes on very largely in terms of word-images or some other form of arbitrary symbols . Mathematics affords us a striking illustration of a field in which as you go from the lower to the higher and more advanced lines of investigation you necessarily employ more and more compact arbitrary symbols in order to carry on the thought process effectively . The more precise significance of the use of abstract images can be seen to better advantage if we postpone the discussion until we have worked out something on the nature and genesis of meaning . 3 . THE NATURE AND GENESIS OF MEANING . ( z ) Genesis of meaning . For an illustration let us take a case of the development of meaning in perception . Suppose the child has never seen sugar . He now sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cube can have no more meaning to him than any other white cube . But the child has a natural impulse to reach for the object which he sees . Vague perception is followed by reaction . As a result of the reaction process he ultimately gets hold of the lump of sugar . He gets new sensory experiences different from those which come from the smooth cubes of wood with which he has played . Perhaps he likes the new sensations . If so , they make a more vivid // impression and with repeated experiences get closely associated with the visual appearance of the cube . According to the laws of association , if either of these associates occurs alone it tends to suggest the other . Consequently , if the child gets the characteristic visual appearance , the mind now supplies , without his going through the reaction process of reaching , the characteristic quality of roughness which would result from reaching and touching . In this case the visual appearance has operated as a symbol to suggest something not given . That which is suggested is meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given and the mind supplies , without the child 's going through the reaction of looking , the characteristic color and form ; then the touch sensation has operated as a symbol and the color and form are elements of meaning . If the child has gone through play reactions with the cube of sugar , its sight or its touch may suggest these play experiences again . If the play experiences are anticipated on the basis of the data given , then they become a part of the meaning for him . Through still other reactions having their origin in a deepseated impulse the child will almost inevitably put the piece of sugar in his mouth and thus get a new group of sensations , those of taste , which will become associated with the others . If , when the piece of sugar is seen , the visual qualities suggest the sweet taste , then this anticipation in advance of the reaction which would bring it , is a case of meaning of sugar for the child . The genesis of meaning is , then , to be explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the senses results in further sensory experience in terms of the same and of other senses . In process of time , as experiences of this sort repeat themselves in the activity of the individual , such a firm association of the various related phases of the total experience is set up that when one of them occurs // alone it suggests one or more of the further possible developments of the experience . The data given to consciousness on the basis of which the mind responds in terms of meaning may be either senseperception data or images . If I see a stream of water and this perception suggests to me boating , quenching my thirst , going in bathing , in all of these cases I have meanings attached to water . My mind runs on beyond the percept water as something which affects my vision in certain characteristic ways to further results which could be secured from reactions to this thing in certain specific ways . These anticipations are meanings . This is equally true in the case that the water is not actually present to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either concrete or abstract . If these anticipations follow upon the emergence of the image , then they are elements of meaning of which the image is the symbol . ( 2 ) Definition of meaning . From the point of view just developed we may formulate in functional terms a definition of meaning somewhat as follows : Meaning is the mental anticipation of the outcome , or result , of reactions not yet made , but which might be made , in response to data immediately given to sense or to images arising in the mind . ( 3 ) Correlativity of meaning and symbol . We can easily see now that meaning and symbol must be correlative . Each involves the other necessarily . That which is suggested is meaning , and that which suggests it is the symbol , or carrier , of the meaning . In terms of content , that which is meaning at one time may be symbol at another , and vice versa . The color and form of the object may suggest to the child the sweetness of sugar in advance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lump of sugar is not seen , but is tasted only , the sweetness may suggest color and form in advance of turning the eyes upon the object . In the first case , color and form operate as symbol // to suggest the meaning sweetness ; in the other , sweetness to the taste operates as the symbol to suggest the element of meaning color and form . There is no such thing as absolute symbol and no such thing as absolute meaning . The two , meaning and symbol , are correlative , but not fixed and absolute . In every experience which has meaning for us , analysis is always capable of distinguishing between certain elements which may be regarded as given and as having little or no value in themselves , but only for what they signify , and certain other elements which are supplied by the mind and which are significant . Without meaning there is no symbol ; what we call a symbol is not a real symbol , but only an empty form . It is equally true , but more difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no meaning . If we have any experience which is absolutely contained within itself , suggesting nothing not immediately given , not serving as the basis of any anticipation , ? in other words , to which the mind adds or supplies absolutely nothing , ? this experience may have some sensational and perhaps some feeling value , but it can not be said to have any meaning for the person who has the experience . To connect this thought with the familiar doctrine of apperception , this is an experience of something totally new and it is not apperceived . The element of meaning involved in experiences of recognition seems difficult to bring under our conception and definition . But even here there is undoubtedly some splitting up of the immediate experience into two phases , one of which is symbolic and the other suggested , only here the two phases are so closely related that it is hard to distinguish them from each other . When we have the experience of recognizing our friend Jackson , that is virtually mentally assuming that he is the same person whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply a setting different from that of the present by way of a foil to bring out // the idea of sameness . So we may safely assume that meaning and symbol are strictly correlative . If this is true psychologically , it has pedagogical implications of considerable importance . These we shall try to point out in another place . ( ? ) The functional nature of meaning . Meaning as an aspect of consciousness is functional . l ? ur account of its genesis , as well as our definition , have emphasized this fact . A study of children 's definitions , where you see meaning not yet fossilized , furnishes striking evidence of the truth of our position . Chamberlains has collated definitions from several sources . A few of the most striking ones follow : Kiss is if you hug and kiss somebody . Mast is what holds the sail up top of a ship . Nail is something to put things together . Nut is something with a shell good to eat . Quarrel is if you begin a little fight . Ring is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see something , after you see it you saw it . Vain is if you always look in the glass . A dog is to have by one . A garden is to walk in . Village means one sees everybody pass . Flame is the power of the candle . The truth of the functional view of meaning here presented is still further seen in the fact that meaning is relative to a given situation . When the child is hungry , an apple is something good to eat ; when he is not hungry , but playful , an apple is something to roll or to throw up and down and catch . The meaning is different in the two cases because the individual anticipates from the object the satis ' Chamberlain , The Child , pp. 146-147. // faction of a different need through , or as the result of , a different mode of reaction . There seems to be a good deal of evidence in support of the view that the earlier and cruder meanings are functional , but will it hold true of the technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child a ball is something to roll , the meaning is plainly functional ; but how different the mathematician 's conception ! He would think of a ball as a material sphere , every point of whose surface is equidistant from a point within called the center . But his problem is very different . Because he is meeting through the ball a different need , his meaning for the ball is different from that of the child . It answers his purpose as a mathematican , it fits in with his mathematical experiences more adequately , to attach that meaning to the ball . In both the case of the child and that of the mathematician , what is anticipated is in terms of characteristic experiences that the object has yielded and is capable of yielding again . The same line of thought can be applied to all manner of meanings that get expression in descriptive terms . The writer believes that it holds equally well for the meanings of such abstract terms as justice , honesty , and patriotism also , but he does not wish to prolong this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image and meaning . In his Outline of Psychology , ' Mr. Titchener discusses the manner in which the abstract idea originates . By abstract idea he seems to mean practically what is meant in this discussion by abstract image . He describes a prevalent view of the abstract idea as analogous to the composite photograph , the various percepts of a thing corresponding to the individual pictures which enter into the composite photograph . In the resulting picture the resemblances are emphasized and the differences , not repeating themselves so often on the plate , are blurred and 3 Pp. 294-299 // fainter . " The abstract idea of cat , on this analogy , is a reproduction in which all the cat-resemblances are emphasized , and all the cat-differences left faint and obscure . Now there can be no doubt that the abstract idea might take this form in an all-round ' mind , a mind which was equally well developed in all its sense departments . But it is not the form which the idea does take , as a matter of fact , in the average consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , so to speak , to every detail of the picture before it . The organism , on the contrary , is always biased ; it gives more attention to some constituents of an idea than to others . My abstract idea of a cat , therefore , is a composite photograph only of those cat-attributes which have caught my attention ; it is more like an impressionist sketch of a cat ? the sketch of some particular artist , throwing into relief the particular characteristics which have struck ' him ? than like a composite photograph of some hundred cats . " This long quotation from Mr. Titchener has been introduced at this point largely for the sake of the contrast which he points out between the impartial photographic plate and the bias of the organism . This bias of the organism on which Mr. Titchener comments here incidentally is really made central in functional psychology . The organism is always biased in all its conscious processes . That bias comes from the fact that it is continually being confronted with new situations , involving new problems . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment to the world in which it lives make it impossible for any " all-round " mind to exist . An " all-round " mind would be hopelessly at sea in a world like ours in which a variety of individual needs have to be met by a variety of modes of individual control . No , the only guarantee that any of our conscious processes shall be of service to us is that they be fashioned with reference to the " bias " of the organism ; for the organism can never be otherwise // than biased according to some situation or other . Consequently , while abstract images will be based on perception , none of them can be photographic in character . They are rather mental constructs suited to needs . It is inconceivable that the number of teeth on the upper jaw of a steer is as important a fact to the farmer as the number of horns on its head or the number of pounds in its weight . When the farmer constructs an image to meet the ordinary purposes of his thought , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be made use of . Abstract images are tools of the mind constructed for use . How they shall be constructed , just what elements shall enter into them , depends upon the particular needs of the organism , on its particular " bias . " Abstract images are symbols for the carrying of meaning . Whether they arise out of the background of concrete experiences or whether they are arbitrary inventions , the only thing that can logically be demanded of them is that they be capable of performing their function . 4 . SUPERIORITY OF THE ABSTRACT IMAGE AS AN ELEMENT OF TECHNIQUE IN THINKING . ( r ) Less irrelevancy of suggestion . In a thinking process , concrete images often suggest more than is necessary . They cumber the thinking process with unnecessary details . Consequently , they offer more lines of departure for the thought to run off into irrelevant channels . If , in a thinking process concerned with some problem of lumbering , the image tree arises as a necessity to the movement of thought , and this image comes with all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hill , with a cool spring under its shade , my thought may be easily switched off from its proper movement into the by-paths of reminiscences of my boyhood on the farm . But if the image is more schematic , or if it is the still more abstract word-image , the associates // suggested are more likely to fall within the field of relevancy . However , there are conditions , as will soon be pointed out , under which good thinking demands the use of concrete images . Each kind of image has its own peculiar value and function in the thought process . One superior value of the abstract image as an element of technique iii thinking is certainly to be found in the fact that it affords less irrelevant suggestion for the side-tracking of the movement of thought . ( 2 ) Greater rapidity of movement . This same freedom from a mass of concrete detail brings with it a still further advantage . Abstract imagery flows more easily and rapidly through the mind than concrete imagery . We have only to compare arithmetical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superior freedom , brevity , and compactness of the thought process the more symbolic it can be made . ( 3 ) Superiority in making logical connections . The chief value of the abstract image , a value not separate from those already stated , is that it carries better than the concrete image those meanings which are most recurrent and general and thus makes possible the concept . The abstract image is the more likely to be a center for the correlation of meanings on which depend general and necessary connections of thought rather than those which are accidental and ever-shifting . Such an element of technique as the abstract image thus gives added power in dealing with problems involving complex and far-reaching relations . ( ? ) Increase of power . To many people the term abstract is a synonym for remoteness from reality . It is true that when we get over into the realm of the abstract we are getting away from the immediately real and practical , but this is only for the purpose of coming back at the practical and concrete situation with added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II // appears to be getting away from his practical task when he hunts for a long pole , puts one end of the pole under the stone , places a fulcrum under the pole instead of up on the stone . But as a result of his getting away from the immediacy of his task he has in reality come back to it with a tremendous increment of power . So it is with the abstract element in thought ; it is only a tool for the bringing to bear added power upon the problems of life in their various forms . The whole history of science in its relation to the arts and industries of our day is sufficient evidence of the truth of this statement . 5 . FUNCTIONAL RELATION BETWEEN CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT IMAGERY . ( z ) Meaning of abstract image dependent on translation . Concrete images are fundamental ; they lie at the basis of abstract images . Historically it is probable that the abstract symbols of written language originated in the conventionalizing of picture writing . Those who did the picture writing became accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers themselves , or those who were taught by them , could tell their meaning . From this it is but a short step to the idea of symbols arbitrarily chosen to represent anything we please . ! flit it is evident that no one of these symbols could have any meaning to the person who used it unless he could translate it over into terms of that for which it stood . So it is with all the abstract images which we use in our thinking processes . In the first place , they have their origin for us either in the conventionalizing of the concrete image . arising from our perception processes , or else they have been taught to us out of the stock of arbitrary symbol mostly words , which are now the inheritance of the race that is , they have their basis in the concrete . In the sewn // place , no one of these abstract images , whatever its origin may be , can have any meaning for us except as it is capable of being translated into concrete images of some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know can be so translated into the concrete . ( 2 ) Significance for thinking . It often happens in a thinking process that the abstract image which arises according to the laws of association which are operative fails to suggest a proper connection for the forward movement of thought . Then it becomes necessary to translate this abstract image into terms of the concrete until some meaning is found which is familiar enough to serve as a basis of effecting the necessary transition in thought . In general , the abstract image suffices when it serves the function of making connections . This it does most adequately in the realm of the familiar . In dealing with the unfamiliar we are more likely to need o convert the abstract into its concrete equivalents . When ? to first learns the meaning in geography of isthmus and . f strait , he quite likely has to get some sort of a concrete age in order to distinguish the two . The thinking pross is blocked until the proper meanings are cleared up translating the word images over into more concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffintly perfected as elements of technique in thinking . ? r a while they have to be translated into terms of the crete every time that they occur . But when these terms me thoroughly familiar , thought glides on without h translation . The principle need not be further elaboed here ; for it will he made clearer in the pedagogical ussion which is to follow in the next chapter . CHAPTER XIII EDUCATIONAL APPLICATIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONS I. THE SCHOOL MUST CONCERN ITSELF WITH THE TASK OF SECURING FOR THE CHILD AN ADEQUATE BACKGROUND OF CONCRETE EXPERIENCE . ( z ) The principle in general . Thinking can not be most effective , as we have already seen , except as the power to use abstract images is developed . But these have no meaning unless they can be translated in terms of the concrete . Furthermore , some sort of thinking must go on in terms of the concrete as the starting point for the development of this superior abstract element of technique . It is , then , very important that the child have an adequate background of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious attempt to train him to think . May we assume that he will get this background of concrete experience outside of the school ? If that assumption was ever justifiable in the past , it is no longer so in this age of specialization of industry and of crowding of the population into the cities . It is evident that the school has a duty to perform in seeing that the child gets a richer background of first-hand experience with things . Teachers of science have found the laboratory indispensable not alone for the purpose of conducting investigations with proper instruments , but also as a means of bringing their pupils into direct contact with things which give them the concrete images on which to base the generalizations involved in right thinking . The teachers of the grades are learning the same lesson in ele-164 // military education . Only here the need is even greater . he experience of the child must be enriched through the encies of manual training in all its forms , excursions to e fields and the parks , the use of pictures , stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , morals , and religion , the story element should emphasized more strongly at first . The work of the pool can not be simply that of furnishing ready-made the eat tools of further culture and knowledge , the three s. ( 2 ) Concrete experience must not be in terms of one se only . Psychologists have abundantly proved the variability of ople in their use of concrete imagery . We do not all rely ually upon visual images . With some , auditory images re more prominently employed than the visual ; and with Alters , motor images play a very large part . Still further , iflerent sorts of situations may call for different types of agery . Hence it is not sufficient in building tip the backround of concrete imagery on which higher forms of bought depend to employ modes of instruction which call r visual imagery alone . Forms of instruction must be ? evised which call into play the eye , the ear , and the hand . ? ral instruction , manual training , drawing , and other nstructive arts must go hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to furnish an adequate basis of conrete imagery to support the higher psychical processes . We must be fair to the ear-minded and the motor-minded ( may I say hand-minded ? ) types of people . We must also provide the concrete imagery material for the right understanding of situations for which one kind of imagery is not adequate . Otherwise thought is crippled and goes hobbling along on one foot . // 2 . ATTENTION MUST BE GIVEN TO THE TRANSLATION OF THE ABSTRACT IN TERMS OF THE CONCRETE . ( T ) Such translation is often the determining factor in thinking . We have seen that there is a functional relation between the concrete and the abstract . This relation can never be absolutely broken down after abstract images have been developed . The whole meaning of the abstract is dependent upon the ability to translate it in terms of the concrete . This ability is often the determining element in the solution of a problem of thought . While thinking moves more rapidly and also with greater power in terms of the abstract imagery , yet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to translate inn ) terms of the concrete . This would be another argument for the point made above , namely , the need of a sufficient background of concrete experience . But , to return to the particular point under discussion , we can easily see how a general , working out a plan of campaign , might be stuck at some point while working in terms of the map ; but if he . had some considerable experience with the country in question , the solution of his problem would be simplified by stopping to recall certain characteristics of strategic points . in all the concrete detail of reproductive imagination . Children who fail to solve a certain class of practical problems in arithmetic are often unjustly regarded all stupid or incapable of thinking . Frequently the difficult is not to be traced to any fundamental weakness in thoughpower as such , but rather to inability , or failure , to Iran late the abstract terms of the problem over into concret terms . Such is the case with many children who ha trouble with problems in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute that they get a clear idea o , how strips of carpet look upon the floor , of how bricks 1 ( 4k in a wall , etc. , then the problem becomes quite simple . // The translation of the abstract statement of such problems into terms of the concrete may often be facilitated by requiring the pupil to supplement , or make explicit , his image by means of a drawing . His chief difficulty has been that he actually could not mentally see how carpet looked upon the floor , or paper on the wall , or boards in a fence around a field . From the point of view , however , of training in the power to think through rapidly and skilfully this class of problems , the permanent necessity of translating the abstract formulation into concrete terms would he far from ideal . Ultimately these problems should be quickly and readily analyzed into their essential ele ? eats , their relation to some fundamental principle , or net-al method , seen , and the work done by the appropriate ile . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to translate quickly from the bstract formulation of the problem over into the concrete . any a problem of sociology , of economics , or of practical fe , notably in matters of conduct , can be adequately aspect only by repeated translations into terms of Conte and specific situations . The man who can make se translations with the greatest facility is often the man o arrives most quickly and most certainly at the right ? nclusions. ( 2 ) Practice in translation must be given . In all training to think , the functional relation between ? ncrete and abstract imagery must be kept unbroken . ere must be the adequate background of concrete images rived from abundant first-hand experiences of the right t to serve as the basis of translation of the abstract into e concrete ; and there must be sufficient practice , at the e of training , in the habit of making such translations critical points in the thought process . This habit is an px , rtant asset to thinking power . It often marks the // critical difference in the mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the unsuccessful . ( 3 ) Practice in translation makes abstract images more efficient . A still further reason for giving practice in the translation of abstract terms over into the concrete is to be found in the fact that it makes the abstract images themselves more fluent and facile as tools of thinking . There is a feeling of warmth and relevancy to the concrete images which gradually gets transferred to the abstract . The meaning of the abstract becomes an indissoluble part of it , immediately felt and appreciated , needing not to be consciously and reflectively unfolded in order to perform its function readily , accurately , and adequately . In other words , practice in translation does away with the need of translation through the transformation of the abstract which has been effected by the process . It is doubtful if teachers fully appreciate the value and importance , especially in the early stages of the pursuit of a new subject , of abundant drill in the matter of translating the abstract in terms of the concrete , or of the more abstract in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mathematics where so many important general principles and rules are expressed in terms of formula . These formulae can not become real tools of the mind , fully adapted to the solution of new problems , except as they have been fully appropriated and assimilated and worked over into the very texture of the mind itself . This means that the functional relation between these abstract elements and their concrete equivalents has become so very close that it is immediately felt and appreciated rather than being explicitly thought . Now , every branch of study moves in the direction of more or less abstract formulation of thought . Its formul2e may not be so compact as those of mathematics , but they are often more complex , as in economics , sociology , psychology , // ethics , and religion ; hence flexibility , freedom , and power in their use demand abundant practice in their translation into concrete terms . 3 . TRAINING IN THINKING DEMANDS THAT THE TRANSITION BE EFFECTED FROM THE USE OF CONCRETE IMAGES TO THE USE OF ABSTRACT IMAGES . The preceding paragraphs have emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view of thinking power the abstract image is the more powerful tool of thought . While it is necessary to emphasize the concrete for the sake of giving fullness and richness of meaning to the abstract , yet it is also necessary to pass on to the free and flexible use of the abstract . Along with the development of the habit of translating the abstract in terms of the concrete should go the training of the power to translate and sum up the concrete in terms of the abstract . It may be all right for the child of five to count upon his fingers , but it cramps his mental growth for him to be allowed to continue to do so after this practice has performed its function of getting him started . In the case of the problems already mentioned of papering , plastering , carpet laying , etc. , the teacher would fail in the performance of his full duty if he did not lead the children on beyond the necessity of working out all the problems in the concrete . For the small child it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of law in the concrete terms of the policeman and of God in terms of a big benevolent man ; but growth in the power of intelligent thought along these lines demands the development of the power to think in more and more abstract terms . If we fix the child in the habit of thinking in terms of the concrete by giving him practice in the concrete beyond the necessity of furnishing a sufficient background for the attainment of fullness and richness of meaning for his abstract symbols , we are limiting his possibilities of becoming strong and powerful in // his thought processes . Particularly as the period of adolescence draws near should more attention be given to the cultivation of thought in more abstract terms . 4 . THE CHILD 'S ABILITY TO GIVE FORMAL DEFINITIONS OF THINGS IS NOT A PROPER TEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR MEANING . We have already seen that meaning is primarily functional in nature . The child of the lower grades has not passed over into that stage of development in which meanings take the more structural and descriptive forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands the meanings of words used in his reading lesson or in any other subject , we should be reasonably well satisfied with answers in functional and concrete terms . It is more or less waste of time for the teacher to be too insistent upon definitions in the abstract and descriptive terms which would be required to satisfy the adult mind . 5 . THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT EDUCATION MAY BECOME A PROCESS OF . JUGGLING WITH SYMBOLS . ( z ) Value of learning dependent on grasp of meaning . We have emphasized the fact that symbol and meaning are correlative . When the child is taught in such a way that he gets a symbol without meaning , psychologically it is no symbol for him , even though it be for us . The value of the symbol for the teacher is not the sole basis for teaching it to the child . It is necessary to develop along with it the correlative meaning . If the child is not ready for this , or if it can not be done , then the symbol should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of catechi:ms , of Biblical verses , etc. , is of very doubtful value , unless much attention is given to the problem of developing their meanings in terms comprehensible to the child . The doctrine here laid down is only another phase // of the discussion centering in the functional relation between abstract and concrete imagery . ( 2 ) Application to reading . Fluency in reading , the ability to pronounce hard words and to control the other elements of technique involved in the reading process , ? is no guarantee of the assimilation of thought by the reader . Some children have a fatal facility in the handling of symbols . This facility must not be taken as a measure of the grasp of the meaning , or content , of what is read . It is not safe to assume that children understand without taking some trouble to test . And the verbal test is not always sufficient . Dramatization , drawing , and constructive work are more certain tests where they can be applied . Reading means intellectual death if content is ignored and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of technique . The writer has had opportunity to observe quite widely , and he believes that there is a very real danger that reading may become too much a process of juggling with symbols . ( 3 ) Danger of loss of interest . The process of learning symbols without sufficient attention to meaning leads either to loss of interest or to artificiality . A certain child who had natural facility in reading undertook to read Shakespeare at an early age . He found little difficulty in handling the technique of the reading process and took a certain pride in his achievement . But after a time , the whole thing began to pall upon him because it all seemed such senseless stuff . The result was that he studiously ignored Shakespeare until he became a young man and was required to take up the reading in higher English courses . Another young man said that he thought that he might be able to enjoy Tennyson 's " The Princess , " if he had not been put through such a stiff drill in analysis of the poem . Mastery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of these cases , // and these can be duplicated times without number in actual experience . ( 4 ) Danger of artificiality . Learning processes which begin as juggling with symbols we would naturally expect to die out quickly from lack of motivation . On account of their barrenness , they should normally be the cause of their own cessation . But they are often kept up through the pleasure found in the activity itself . When this is the case the outcome is the most pitiful kind of artificiality , judged from any true standard of the real nature of thinking . The classic illustration of this is to be found in the arguments of the Sophists as they are represented to us in Plato 's Dialogues . But we do not have to go so far away from home as ancient Greece to find abundant illustrations of the same thing . For how many students have algebra and geometry been little more than processes of successful juggling with symbols ! They passed in these subjects , yes , but how much of meaning or significance did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plus and minus signs in algebra , making changes according to the rules , and to come out at the end of long processes of reduction with the answer given in the book . But what of it ? What did it all mean ? And so in geometry it was rather interesting to find that if you drew a line through a figure in a certain way , a lot of statements could be made which would be true and which would lead to a certain conclusion . But why draw the line ? That was arbitrary ; the author said to draw it . How deadening to real vital thought processes to deal with a lot of arbitrary elements when every one of them can be made to carry a rich load of meaning ! The teacher should not rest satisfied until meaning is correlated with symbol . ( 5 ) Extent of this danger . This danger of making instruction a process of mere manipulation of symbols is not confined alone to reading T // and mathematics . It is just as likely to occur in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chemistry , etc . Certainly much of the imagery of adults of the present age who studied geography in their childhood is in terms of dots and lines on maps rather than in terms of anything that is concrete and meaningful regarding places and things . We are doing much to remedy this in present-day education . We . can not do too much in the direction of furnishing a basis in concrete studies for the meanings of the symbols of our more abstract sciences . CHAPTER XIV DEVELOPMENT OF THE IMAGINATION IN RELATION TO THINKING I. STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT . We are familiar with the thought that the life of the child passes through several stages of development the phenomena of which are different enough to attract the attention of the investigator . But the facts of child life are not to be viewed as mere facts , however interesting they may be . If child study is to have any real significance , the body of facts which it studies must receive some consistent interpretation . There must be some standard of their evaluation . The standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . The phenomena of child life must be interpreted in terms of their functional significance in the process of growing control . For convenience of discussion we may divide the period of prolonged human infancy into the following periods : ( I ) early infancy , from birth to about two years or two and a half years of age ; ( 2 ) later infancy , from the end of early infancy until six or seven years of age ; ( 3 ) childhood , from six or seven until twelve or thirteen ; and ( 4 ) adolescence , from the end of childhood until maturity . In the discussion of these stages of development we must not think of them as sharply separated from one another , but as continuous and overlapping . That which is stated as significant of a certain stage of development must be thought of as having its beginnings in the preceding stage and as continuing over into the following one . We are 174 // not going into a full discussion of the characteristics of these stages of development , but shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place and significance of the thinking process in the life of the child . The stress will then fall upon the development of the child 's imagina tion from the point of view of the problem of growing control . 2 . FIRST PERIOD , ? EARLY INFANCY . This is a period preeminently of beginnings . The child is largely concerned with the mastery of the fundamental physical coordinations . The larger muscular movements are brought under control , including the fundamental coordinations involved in walking and talking . Objects are of interest to the child mainly as centers of reaction . Upon them he can exercise his growing power of manipulation and control . They are things to be pushed and thrown . They are the instruments of securing interesting sensations , ? tactual , visual , auditory , muscular , etc . They have immediate and direct value . Activity is interesting in and of itself . It has little of definite aim . The child 's play is more physical than intellectual . The objects upon which it expends itself have an emotional significance as furnishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical control . In the child 's abundant and more or less impulsive and spontaneous activities in this period , he has acquired various experiences which serve as the basis of the dawning imagination . His control over objects and his own acts in relation to these objects has grown in proportion as he has remembered the results of past experiences and utilized them in further manipulation . 3 . SECOND PERIOD , ? LATER INFANCY . ( z ) General characteristics . In later infancy imagination comes into full bloom . The efflorescence of the imagination and its correlative expres176 The Psychology of Thinking sion in spontaneous play is one of the chief characteristics of this period . Both the activity of imagination and the development of play are stimulated by the fact that this is a period of the freer use and control of the larger muscular coordinations effected in the earlier period and also that a beginning is made in the control of finer muscular coordinations . Another of the chief characteristics of later infancy is that it is the period of making the fundamental social adjustments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these fundamental tendencies of child life in this period and the endeavor to guide and direct them to a richer fruition . But our discussion must revert to the imagination , however interesting it might be to follow up other leads . ( 2 ) Activity of the imagination in play . The period of later infancy is the golden era of the imagination . There are many ways in which this is evidenced . One of these is in the play activities of the child . Whereas in the earlier period the child 's play was a more or less direct response to some object which he playfully manipulated , or it exhausted itself in the exuberance of physical activity itself ; in this period play is more the response to images in the mind , and the object is reduced to a subsidiary position . The chair is not pushed to and fro merely for the sake of the pleasure of the exercise of physical control involved in the manipulation ; but it has now come to be a train of cars , a wagon , an engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the image in the child 's mind ; the chair is reduced to a vehicle for the expression of that image . Image and play are correlative . They are related to each other as stimulus to response , or as inner to outer aspects of the same process . The image without movement would be very fleeting and evanescent ; movement helps to define and build up the image . ( 3 ) Significance of rapid development of imagination . If we are to employ our category of growing control , // this rapidly developing imagination is significant from several related points of view . For one thing it marks a movement in the direction of mental as contrasted with purely physical control . However , in this period the image is not felt to be distinct from the act . Image and act are not discriminated , but are aspects of one emotional whole . Again , a part of the wonderful activity of the imagination during this period can be interpreted as the inevitable consequence of the exercise of a new power . There is always pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The activity of the imagination in its early stages of development is its own stimulus and its own reward . ( 4 ) Enlargement of field of control . The activity of the imagination enlarges the field of control . During this period the child is preeminently seeking to enlarge his experience . The present moment is not an isolated fact . Through memory and imagination it becomes a part of a larger whole . The absent features of this larger whole may be supplied to the intense emotional satisfaction of the mind . The common objects of play thus become centers for the condensation of limitless possibilities of experience which the child could not realize in any other way than through play . Time and space become soluble and his sphere of control is indefinitely enlarged . The fact that the fire engine passed an hour ago and is now miles away does not remove it from the sphere of the child 's activities and the exercise of his control . The chair becomes the fire engine and the interesting experience is prolonged and repeated in the absence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii heaven above and earth beneath is brought under the control of the child and is manipulated by him . He is monarch of all he surveys , and time and space furnish no limitations to his empire . There is nothing which the child can not have , if he will , ? drums , stores , soldiers , wild animals from the desert and jungle , etc . There is nothing I2 // that he may not be from the coal man or baker to the king . Everything yields to his control . The world is free and plastic , to be moulded at his will . In imagination he can satisfy to the full the natural impulse for power and control . ( 5 ) Unification of experience through imagination . The nature myth appeals to the child , as to the primitive man , largely for the reason that the interpretation which it gives of the facts of nature brings them within the world of his experience and makes more intelligible to him the sun , the moon , the stars , wind , thunder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cease to confront him in all their mysterious isolation and out-there-ness . Through his imagination they have been brought into his experience and have been made emotionally congruent with the other facts of his experience . By means of the myth gaps in the imagination , as it seeks to grasp related facts as one whole , are filled and the tension of the mind due to these gaps is relieved . Take for example the experience of primitive man with the sun . He sees it rise in the east and set in the west . It then vanishes from his view , reappearing in the east the following morning . But the imagination is not satisfied with this break , or gap , in the experience ; the mind seeks to fill it in . The formation of the myth that the sun is carried around the rim of the disk-shaped earth in a boat from the west to the east fills in that gap and gives unity to the otherwise isolated facts of experience . The myth serves the same function for the child as for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are woven together into a system , and a fundamental impulse toward unity is satisfied through the activity of the rapidly developing imagination . This unity may dissolve again at various points and have to be reconstructed , but it is nevertheless significant that a system of relations has been set up at all . The existence of such systems of relationships , crude and even erroneous though // they may be , is a necessary prelude to the emergence and development of the thinking process . Thinking does not in the first place set up relationships , but it works within a system to define and reconstruct and make explicit relationships within that system and to take advantage of them in consciously determining modes of action in problematic situations . Through play , myth , and fairy story the imagination of the child is called forth and exercised . It is given flexibility and power . It receives practice in the organization and use of imagery , which is important for every phase of the higher psychical processes . The first mental wholes are built up which serve as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends . But the characteristic of the imaginative activity of this period is that it is dominantly a process of enlarging and knitting together the child 's experience through the building up of mental wholes which are more emotional and personal than intellectual . ( 6 ) Lack of reflective element . That the intellectual or reflective element is not characteristic of this period , at least until toward its close , is seen in several phenomena of child life . One of these is the lack of organization in games . The small child , for example , enjoys playing hide-and-seek , but he is scarcely hid before he comes running out to be found . The pleasure of the game is in large part the activity itself and the excitation of the imagination . Some of the so-called lies of children are undoubtedly to be explained on the basis of the lack of the reflective element and the predominance of the emotional in the imagination . The distinction between that which is in the mind and that which corresponds to external reality has not been fully made . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percepts and our images that we rarely go wrong in the matter . But when the imagination is developing very rapidly and its // phenomena are more or less new , untrained , and undisciplined , this distinction may not be so evident . How should the child know anyway in advance of abundant experience that what his eyes give him is more reliable than what his imagination gives him ? As immediate experiences both are equally real , only one stands further tests better than the other . Because of this fact we have become accustomed to note the difference between the two experiences and to distinguish them . And it is all simpler to us than to the child . ( 7 ) Distinction between means and ends felt rather than conceived . In this golden era of the imagination characterized by spontaneous play , the image and its expression are integral parts of a relatively undifferentiated whole . To have the image is practically the same as responding to it . Process and product of activity merge and interpenetrate . There is not a separate value in consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product primary . That is why we call the activity play . The distinction between means and ends is not intellectual , though is may be emotionally felt . Without this distinction there can be no clear recognition of a problem , nor can there be any such thing as conscious adjustment of means to ends . This is not saying that there is no thinking at all in this period of childhood , but merely that the thinking process is not strikingly characteristic . A two-year-aid child lost his ball in the capacious seat of the Morris chair . He tried to reach it from the front of the chair . Then he tried to get it from one side . Failing in both these attempts , he stopped and looked carefully , after which he went directly to the point of nearest approach and seized the ball at once . Was there not a thinking process of some sort involved here ? Did not the child consciously adjust means to an end ? ( 8 ) Thinking not the characteristic type of consciousness . In the abundant play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the conscious adjustment of means to ends . We are more likely to underestimate than to overestimate the amount of thinking that is done by the small child . Yet thinking is not the characteristic type of consciousness in this period . The distinctive thing is the freer , more spontaneous , and emotionally toned imagination Thinking can not receive rapid development without being preceded by a sufficient exercise and development of the imagination to make easy and natural the distinction between means and ends . Much can be done in the plays and occupations of the kindergarten to prepare for and to introduce this distinction . The function of thinking has already begun to be performed in a crude way quite early in the life of the child . In this period of rapid development and efflorescence of the imagination , the forward movement in the development of thinking is in the direction of bringing to consciousness the distinction between means and ends . Yet this should not be unduly hastened . It may be that the stimulation and development of the imagination will be found to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( 1 ) Development of conscious distinction between means and ends . In the second period the child has gotten considerable freedom of control over the larger muscular coordinations . The third period is characterized on the physical side as one in which he is getting control of the finer muscular coordinations . At the close of this period the boy is pretty compact and well knit , with excellent control over his physical powers . In running , leaping , wrestling , climbing , etc. , he is nimble and skilful and flexible . As the child 's power of manipulation and motor control have been increased through bringing into subjection the finer muscles , he has been led in the increased variety and complexity of his reaction processes to distinguish more sharply between // Our study of the thinking processes as they actually take place in attempts to solve vital problems will serve to emphasize several things which are to be stated and developed explicitly in the series of topics which will constitute the remainder of this chapter . The reader is asked to keep these illustrations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CONTROL OF ASSOCIATION IN THINKING . ( I ) Limitations of control . Our illustrations have made it evident that there can be , at best , only a limited amount of control over the associative process as it operates in thinking . This is equally true whether the problem which provokes thought be practical or theoretical . Even in mathematics , where the whole field is definitely limited and circumscribed , we see that the absolutely essential ideas do not come on demand , and when they do come it is not in their perfect order of relationship . There are abundant suggestions thrown up on the basis of past associations . All that the associative mechanism can do is to give forth what has been committed to it in harmony with the nature of the ties of connection which have been set up . These suggestions have to be judged , evaluated for present purposes , and selected or rejected . Finally , the results of the whole process may be thrown into the form of a demonstration , in which the essential elements are organized into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end is clearly exhibited and made apparent . In practical problems of conduct and in theoretic problems of economics and science , the essential elements of problems are not usually so sharply defined and contained within narrow and closed limits as in mathematics . Consequently the control over the associative activity in the attempt to get relevant suggestions is still more limited , and the process of groping for suggestions , feeling for their // relevancy , starting over again on new lines of attack , etc. , is even more active than can possibly be described in detail . ( 2 ) Relation of organized system of knowledge to control . While the control over the associative activity in thinking is limited , yet we do know that elements belonging to the same organized system of knowledge are most likely to be reinstated . When the problem is mathematical in character , the ideas which arise in consciousness are apt to be mathematical ; when the problem is historical , the ideas suggested are apt to fall within the field of our knowledge of history ; when the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to arise that belong to the particular setting of that problem . Taking advantage of this principle , we can focus our attention upon the particular field of relevancy ; and the more we do this the more is the imagery likely to be limited to that field . But even then the stream of imagery in any vital thinking process , dealing with a real problem , is apt to be wider and deeper than that succession of ideas which represents the final solution . More elements of past experience have to be thrown up in the associative process than can actually be used in the final adjustment of means to ends . Many of these elements have , however , had a function to perform , they have served as intermediate points of contact for the unwinding of the skein of connections until we have come ultimately to some idea relevant to our solution ; others seem to be absolutely irrelevant , like so much driftwood thrown upon the shore by the current . ( 3 ) Conclusion as to control .
