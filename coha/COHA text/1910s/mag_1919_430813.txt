IT is related that during the Russo-Japanese War , at a time when the Russian and Japanese armies were in the thick of the most decisive Manchurian wartare , a newspaper correspondent came upon General Kuroki fishing in a stream near Japanese army headquarters . " General ! " exclaimed the correspondent , " you do n't seem to be worrying much about the battle ! " " No , " replied the fisherman upon whose shoulders rested the principal responsibility for the Manchurian campaign , " this battle was fought two years ago in Tokio . " The prophets of the Japanese army had foreseen the Manchurian campaign ; they had planned where and how the enemy should be met . On the day when the general was fishing in the little stream his army machine , made up of thousands of pattern-followers , was following the pattern of the battle . They saw nothing but the enemy guns and soldiers before them and the almost impossible task of overcoming them . They were too close to the pattern and too busy following it to see beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river fishing , saw beyond the pattern : he saw victory . He knew that the pattern of the battle would have to be followed , but , wise general that he was , he avoided getting mixed up in it . Likewise , it is said that General Joffre stopped the Germans at the Marne and saved Paris , not in 1914 , but nearly ten years before that . The prophets of the French army saw the battle of the Marne years in advance and planned their defense for the day when the Germans should strike . The pattern of the battle had to be followed through and the taxicabs of Paris had to be requisitioned , but because the prophets had foreseen the emergency , the pattern - followers , the rank and file of the army , held the enemy and saved Paris . But this is not to be an article about the war . There are prophets and pattern - followers in every - day business , and it is about these that I would write . There are comparatively few prophets . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , following the pattern of the times , the pattern of our business or industry , and until recently the pattern of the war as it affected all other patterns . Our patterns resemble Greek borders ; they are an endless series of advances , sudden stops , drops , back-ups , rises , advances , stops , drops , set-backs , advances , stops . And yet many of us could stretch out our patterns a little more , so that we should not come to such abrupt stops , have such severe set-backs , and start on such rash spurts , only to run up against some stone wall and fall back again far enough to see that the wall ca n't be gone through but has to be climbed over . It is a matter of perspective and method , this stretching out of the pattern to make it a series of undulations instead of a train of jolts . Wherever we find a business that stands solidly in the face of competition , change , panic , and the vicissitudes of life and the world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of it . Only a few years ago a man whom we will call Mr. Bradley devised and patented a new article for household use , and started immediately to manufacture it . Almost instantly it caught on , and in a comparatively short time he was a wealthy man . The inevitable happened : his rapid rise and sudden success attracted attention and other men began to study how they might compete with him . Had he been a pattern-follower his success would have ended very shortly . But he was by nature a prophet , and a wise one , for , while the  | other members of his organization were following the pattern of the business as it climbed up , up , up , picturing to themselves long years of monopoly , Bradley was looking into the future and preparing , or , more strictly speaking , trying to prepare for just the emergency that came . Leaving the conduct of the organization to his associates , so that he should not get caught in the pattern , he kept studying the future . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result ? Competition , inevitably , and keen competition , once others realized the magnitude of the change that his device was bringing into housekeeping . Some one might discover a way to make a similar appliance cheaper than his . He could not see how , but he did not let that blind him to the danger . He became convinced of this one fact : the future of his business hinged upon his ability to make a certain vital part of his appliance , which was manufactured of a certain material of great hardness , even harder ? harder , in fact , than that material had ever been made commercially . If he could do that , even a very low price would not mean ruinous competition . He focused his prophetic eyes upon that one fact and started out . The pattern he had to follow would have discouraged any but a prophet who refused to see the pattern at all , but kept his eyes on his prophecy . The company that was supplying him with the material he was then using laughed at the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought him an alarmist . They were doing a fine business ; the volume of sales was climbing month after month , and they were advertising their product into the public mind . ( The pattern was running smoothly . ) Before any competitor could get around their patent ( which was impossible anyway , they argued ) the article would have become so standard that no one else could have a " look-in . " But Bradley argued that such might be the case , provided no one found a way to make a similar article at a lower price . Getting no sympathy or encouragement from his associates , he went at the problem by himself . He became convinced that it was possible to make on a commercial scale material of the required hardness . With his findings he went to the company that was supplying him with the material , supposing , of course , that they would take his definite order for the harder material at a little advance in price . But here he bumped against a very abrupt stop in his own pattern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the only company equipped to produce this material , and they declined to make it ! The real truth was that they were getting large orders for the material as then used in the appliance , and they were making a very good profit ; to change over and make a material of greater hardness would mean new equipment and new processes ; it would require the investment of a considerable sum of new money . They were satisfied with the orders they were getting and they knew Bradley could not take his business away from them . They again assured him that he had nothing to fear . Why did he continue to look for trouble ? Indeed , the sale of the appliance was shooting up like a sky-rocket and the sales - sheet alone would have been enough to lull any one but a prophet to sleep . But Bradley consistently fought shy of the pattern , for he knew in his prophetic soul that unless he could get the harder material the pattern of that business would some day bump abruptly up against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful drop . He must have the harder material . He begged the company to make it for him ; he threatened them . But they were immovable . Finally , at the end of two years , competing appliances began to appear . Some of them were lower in price , and now Bradley 's associates began to wear long faces as they saw that their competitors were going to make inroads on their business . The pattern was changing . But once again.the prophet of the organization , because he kept his mind " in perspective , " so to speak , saw farther than they , for he foresaw that these competitors would have to go through a period of experimenting and perfecting before they could offer substantial competition , and he had gone far enough  | in his own plans now , after fighting them through for nearly two years , to know what he was going to do . Repeatedly he had threatened to build a factory and produce the harder material himself , but the material manufacturers had never taken him seriously . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose above the foundation , and it never will ; for when the material manufacturers saw the foundation of Bradley 's factory they looked into the big hole in the ground and saw where their profits were going , and they decided that they could equip to make material of the proper hardness to please their customer ! The strategy employed is merely incidental to the point of this narrative . The outstanding fact is that the business was saved by a prophet who refused to be fooled by the pattern of sales curves and dividend checks . That business is still a prosperous and flourishing one to-day , in spite of the keenest kind of competition . I relate the incident at length in order to show clearly the essential difference between the prophet and the pattern-follower . But that incident is an illustration of a prophet seeing ahead and working out only one little prophecy in connection with one business that was relatively of small importance to the general public . Far more interesting are the modern prophets who work almost as a habit five , ten , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needless to say , they do not go around shod in sandals and wearing tunics , like the prophets of old . On the contrary , they are very business-like business men , the only remarkable thing about them being that , instead of getting all mixed up in the pattern of the immediate present , they sit in their offices and dream dreams of the future , and their dreams affect every one of us . The men in the offices all around them may be working in July , 1919 , while they are working in July , 1936 , perhaps , or even in 1950 . Or , on the other hand , the particular matter in hand may be one concerning 1922 . In any event , they work in 1919 only enough to see that the plans they worked out in 1900 or 1910 or 1915 are moving as smoothly as possible through the pattern of the present , and not running into blind alleys in the pattern which would make it necessary for the business to retrace its steps for a new start , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a maze . Among the most interesting of the prophets are the rubber prophets . But , when I accused one of the chief of them , as I sat in his office on the twentieth floor of a great New York officebuilding , of being a prophet , he smiled amusedly . He was no prophet ; he was just a business man . But let me tell you how his organization works and what it is doing , and you may judge for yourself whether the men who guide its development and control its policies are not prophets . Let me begin by relating a little incident about a banquet attended by a group of men engaged in the rubber industry . My friend , who was " just a business man , " was asked to take charge of the table arrangements . He called in the head of the company 's development laboratory and they put their heads together . On the night of the banquet when the diners entered the banquethall they found large bunches of roses on the tables . Some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the laboratory of this rubber company . At each place at the table was a rosebud . Some were products of the bush and some of the laboratory . Yet , so realistic were the rubber flowers that it was a good while before the diners noticed the difference . " But I did n't know you made flowers in rubber , " I ventured , after the prophet had told me of this little incident . " We do n't , " he replied , " excepting in our laboratory . But we are always experimenting on all sorts of things that some day may be made in rubber . One of these days , perhaps many years hence , perhaps not so many , the ladies may be trimming their bonnets with artificial flowers made from rubber ! " It is in the laboratory where these roses were made , and in other similar laboratories , that the prophecies of the rubber prophets are being worked out . This particular rubber company has two such laboratories , one engaged in the development of general commercial applications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men in charge of the laboratories are men of education and imagination , and they are allowed , hired , in fact , to let their imaginations run away with them ? in rubber . They are not asked to work any definite number of hours a day . They are not expected to produce so many ideas per week . Their business is not to produce definite data of a commercial nature for the company 's manufacturing departments ; there are other laboratories for that purpose . These laboratories are the workshops of the prophets . Through them we enter the future . The men at the head of these laboratories think in rubber , three , five , ten , twenty-five years ahead , and then work out their thoughts . There are on the shelves of these laboratories models of some of the articles that will be made in rubber , say , ten years from to-day . There are others that will not be put on the market for perhaps fifteen or twenty years . There are some , unquestionably , that will never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable . The method by which these rubber prophets work is interesting in itself , and ought to be highly suggestive to other business men . Assume , for the purpose of illustration , that one of the rubber prophets were to decide that the time was not very far distant when picture-molding might be made from rubber . ( For , you understand , of course , that the prophets are working in hard and semi-hard rubber , as well as in soft rubber . ) He starts out to work up a suitable composition with rubber as a basis , and finally perfects it and figures out just how much it would cost to manufacture , with crude rubber at the present price and labor paid at the prevailing scale . He makes out a detailed report of formula , method of production , and the material and labor costs . He sees on . the face of it that there is no immediate chance to make or market this rubber molding on a commercial scale , because the cost of the rubber , or the cost to manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop there . He has at hand all the facilities for gathering full information concerning the cost of wood molding and steel molding , and he gets all of these facts and figures , taking in the cost of the raw material , the cost of labor in converting these two materials into molding , the methods of manufacture , the selling price , weight , and so on . These facts and figures , together with the report on rubber molding , are filed away ? put on the shelf , so to speak ? for future reference , and the prophet goes on to something else . But the molding on the shelf is not forgotten . It has been put there to await the day when the price of crude rubber may have dropped so low or the price of steel and wood molding may have risen so high that rubber molding becomes a commercial possibility . Or else some new and considerably cheaper method of working the rubber may be invented , bringing down the labor cost to a point where the rubber molding may have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away with foolish ideas , these rubber prophets. though they do not consider an idea foolish just because it is new or very unusual . All of their work is based on sound facts and figures . It is their business to look into the future and be ready to produce articles , yes , whole classes of products , in rubber as soon as it is commercially practicable to do so . As a practical example of the work of the rubber prophets , we have only to consider the composition shoe soles recently put on the market by at least three large rubber companies . The rubber prophets had known for several years that a rubber composition shoe sole could be made that would successfully compete with leather , once the price of that material reached a certain point , so they went to work to prepare . It is an interesting fact that in this particular case they were not ready as far in advance of the times as they had thought to be , for the war sent the price of leather up to a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of schedule . But , by being ready . the rubber prophets not only did their industry a good turn , but undoubtedly helped to keep the prices of shoes from jumping even higher than they have gone . As an illustration of how carefully and how practically the rubber prophets  | work , I might mention that for many , many months ? indeed , for more than two years ? before the laboratories - pronounced these composition soles ready for the market , pairs of shoes soled with compositions of different formulas were given to policemen and letter-carriers , and other men whose work requires almost constant walking , and a record card was kept in the laboratories for each pair . Some of the articles which the prophets have worked out are being tried out not only for wearing qualities and general practicability , but also for marketability . For it is an interesting handicap which attaches to the work of the prophets that some of the things they think of in projecting their minds into the future are so unusual , and the very idea of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have been following the pattern of the particular trade or industry affected , to stretch their imaginations to accept and to accustom themselves to a given product or article being made in any but the conventional material . So it is that the prophet-s sometimes have to take it upon themselves to introduce to the public a new product , or an old one made in a new material , to demonstrate to some particular trade or industry that it can be marketed . The prophets ' interest may be in selling only the raw or semi-finished material , but their work is not finished until they have sold their vision , their prophecy , to the masses . This done , they turn it over to the pattern-followers and once more plunge into the future . But we shall miss the main point of the work and methods of the rubber prophets if we assume that all of this experimenting and dreaming of dreams is merely for the purpose of bringing out new articles in rubber to beat out their competitors , to work out their own hobbies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to " hog " everything in sight . The latter purpose is far from the minds of the rubber prophets with whom I have talked . They say it would be short-sighted policy , and that when they do bring out a new product in rubber , such as rubber harness , for instance , rather than make it themselves , they would prefer to hand the result of their research and experimenting over to the harness industry , and be content to sell the raw material to that industry . They have no desire to upset an established industry ; their idea is co-operation , not competition , with the industries into whose fields their prophecies lead them . Why all of this dreaming of rubber dreams ? Briefly , to utilize the enormous and growing output of the extensive new rubber plantations in the Far East . The work of the prophets is based on a solid foundation of economic law , the law of supply and demand . They have set themselves the task of finding new uses for rubber to utilize this tremendous supply which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insure the millions of dollars invested in their tremendous plants , and to protect the thousands upon thousands of workers in the rubber industry . The electrical industry also has its prophets who , like the rubber prophets , are working constantly years and years ahead , making experiments to-day on electrical machines , devices , processes , which this generation may never hear of , as well as others which may be in common use ten , fifteen , or twenty years from now . Their problem is twofold : to discover ways and means of producing cheaper electrical current , and to produce new current-consuming appliances and processes to use this cheaper current . Then there are the telephone prophets who have to work fifteen or twenty years ahead , planning to have the telephone ready whenever and wherever the people are going to need it . Their task is very different from the work of the rubber or the electrical prophets . They have to foresee how much a city is going to grow and how the population will be distributed . They must know this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ten years from now , you may not seek for a telephone in some place where you would naturally expect to find one , only to be told that the telephone is not available because ten years before , when planning its lines , the telephone company did not put in large enough cables to take care of the telephone needs of that section . Secondly , they must know how the population is going to be distributed so that they can properly locate  | their exchanges , for the placing of exchanges has considerable bearing upon the profits of a telephone company . Briefly , this is how the telephone prophets go about their work : Taking the present population of the city , and the population for many years back , they plot a population curve , projecting this curve eighteen or twenty years into the future , establishing the population in 1937 , let us say , so far as the past growth of the city can help in estimating the future growth . They then check this up in every way possible , by analyzing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by studying the transportation facilities present and proposed , the labor situation , the real-estate market , the geographical location of the city . When this is done and they have arrived at what they believe the population of the city will be in 19J7 , they proceed to " place " that population , to prophesy- how and where it will distribute itself . This involves a tremendous amount of detail work . There must be a house-to-house count in the residential sections to show just how many families are living in each square block of the city , what percentage of them have telephones , and what class of service they are using . The character and nationalities of the population have to be taken into account , for some nationalities have a tendency to huddle together in great numbers in congested areas , while others show a marked tendency to live in separate little houses , thus spreading out over a larger area . The old settlers in each section must be talked with , as well as real-estate men and other well-informed citizens . When the prophets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted with a different problem , but one that , nevertheless , has to be met ; they have to prepare for new office-buildings , perhaps as yet undreamed of , for hotels and department-stores . It is one thing to determine how a city is going to spread out , and quite another to tell where it is going to shoot up , suddenly demanding telephone cables to take care of from five hundred to a thousand telephone installations , as in a large office-building or hotel , on one little spot . This requires a careful study of existing business conditions and a calculation of the probable future commercial growth which is based primarily on population . If a population of so many thousands supports one hotel , three department - stores , and twenty large office-buildings , there will be a certain ratio of increase in department-stores , office-buildings , and hotel patronage if the population increases , say , fifty per cent . This can be checked up by studying other cities which correspond in population and general characteristics . Hundreds of tables and charts are drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas available for business and residential expansion , maps showing density and character of population , maps and charts showing the relation of the present telephone service to the present population . When this is all done , the prophets study all of this data and from it make a huge map of the city , " placing " the population , locating new office-buildings , apartment - houses , departmentstores , schools , and hotels , and indicating on the map in every square block in the city just how many telephones and how many private branch exchanges will probably be required in 1937 . The prophets do not expect always to strike it right , but they have found that this method of prophesying is safer and more accurate than the " hunch " method of a few years ago . The effectiveness of the system is just beginning to show . In one New England city a department-store was located by the telephone prophets ten years ago less than a block away from where it has recently been built . In another city an office-building was placed very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been erected . Many other instances might be cited if space permitted . I have seen the telephone prophets ' map for the city of New Haven , Connecticut , for 1935 . It was like peeping into the future to look at it . Everywhere there were little circles with figures in them . Blocks which are now vacant lots have their little circles with the number of telephones they will probably support by 1935 . A street I had passed on my way to the telephone company 's office which is being torn up to be paved  | was pointed out to me on the map . " We are putting down our cables for 1935 under that street now . Cities no longer allow their streets to be torn up every few months . We have to watch every street and take advantage of repaving to put down our cables for the future , " said one of the prophets . " Sometimes the cables will not be required for ten years , but they will be ready when they are needed . " Every business that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its organization . And there lies an interesting fact : in nearly every fairly large business there is likely to be a prophet , or , perhaps we might better say , a potential prophet . He may not be the president or the vice-president or the secretary or the treasurer ; perhaps he is not even an executive or department head , but some humble worker . In the latter case he is generally regarded as a dreamer . Many a young man with the making of a prophet in him has been discharged from some small organization , or perhaps has left of his own accord , because he was a failure at the job assigned him and could not keep his mind on his work . The next thing his erstwhile employer hears of him is that he is holding down a big job in the city with some big ; important organization . He has found his place in the watch-tower , where he belongs , instead of staying at some job down in the pattern . Of course , these budding prophets have to be harnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The surest way to harness them is to put them at the chief executive 's elbow where they can see the business from the top . The financing and management of a business have a very sobering effect , a way of fading out mirages , and it is mirages that need most to be feared in the work of the prophets . That is why it will nearly always be found that the successful prophets work against a background of facts and figures . They have to work carefully , investigate carefully , make their final deductions carefully . Some one has well said that " faith deals in greater marvels than fact . " It is true , but it is also true that such a prosaic , practical , and essentially " factful " thing as a steam shovel is a great aid to faith in removing mountains ! It must be admitted that sometimes even the most careful prophets are premature in their prophesying . An old man who runs a store in a little Connecticut town recently exhibited to a group of friends a poster advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large brewery . The men saw nothing remarkable in the poster until the old storekeeper told them that it had been sent him nearly twenty years ago . It seems that the brewers tried to introduce this particular drink back in the ' 90 's , but finally decided that they were too far ahead of the times , so they had put it on the shelf . When time caught up with the brewery prophets , they simply took down the " new " drink and put it on the market . Another illustration of prophesying , a current one , concerns the affairs of a certain well-known company manufacturing food products . Shortly after the start of the war the sale of one of the products put out by this company dropped to about one-fifth its normal volume . The reason was that the price of one of the main ingredients had almost doubled , making the price of the food when made up and sold by this company a luxury above the means of the average family . Had the executives of this company been completely tangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have assumed that , once the war was over , the price of this particular commodity in the raw would drop back to normal again and that their business would once more pick up . But some one in that organization was prophet enough to keep out of the pattern of the present and to project his mind ahead to the time when the war should be over . What he thought he saw was that the price of that food commodity would never again go down to its previous level . It would probably drop somewhat , but not enough to bring the sales ever again up to their previous level . So he started out to get the facts from the Department of Agriculture at Washington , and from every other possible source , and he found that the other prophets agreed with him . That company fortified its business by putting out a new drink . A beverage is rather dif- ferent from the company 's other products , but in itself this selection shows shrewd prophetic vision . As a shining example of a business prophet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shipyards were busy night and day on war materials , and in the face of the fact that some of his companies were building even larger plants and shipyards for turning out still more of the machinery of war , Mr. Schwab was looking far into the future , to a time when the twentyfive parts of his plant should be devoted , four parts to ship-building , twenty parts to commercial work , and only the remaining twenty-fifth part to military products ! If the head of the great steel industry , rushed to the limit with war orders , could keep his perspective and keep himself mentally and physically clear of the pattern of the times and look so far ahead through the period of the recent colossal world upheaval , surely the rest of us can get away from the correspondence-baskets on our desks , and from the orderfiles and the monthly balance-sheets , and all the rest of the details of our jobs , for a little while each day , or at least once or twice a week , and crawl up out of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " said a man at the club the other day , " but we ca n't prophesy very much . So many transformations are taking place . " True , but because it is hard to see clearly on a foggy night on the ocean does not make it any the less necessary to have a lookout on duty on the bridge of a ship . Sometimes things can be heard or " felt " before they can be seen , but it is the lookout up forward - who hears or " feels , " not the man who buries himself down in the engine-room amid the grinding whir of the machinery . " Do the professional prophets never grow weary or discouraged ? " you may ask . Let me answer by relating a little incident that happened during the dark days of the autumn of 1917 . I was sitting one morning in the office of one of the rubber prophets in a big New York office-building . It was a holiday in New York , and the great building was silent and almost deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophet who had just arrived in New York from San Francisco where , just five days before , he had landed from a steamer from the Orient . Five months this prophet had been out of the country , visiting the Far East to see how one of his prophecies of eight years before was progressing ? for this man was none other than one of the two prophets who , in 1910 , saw the need of plantation rubber for the rubber industry of this country . He is one of the men you can thank because you do n't have to pay more today every time you buy an automobiletire . He was weary from his long trip and disappointed to get back and find how little visible progress we , as a country , had made in getting ready for our share in the war . He felt depressed , he said . He dreaded to look ahead . He knew we were coming through all right in the end ? oh yes , he was sure of that . And he knew his company would weather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all had to go through in the mean time . He said that when he was in China they told him a story of a Chinaman who was smitten with some bodily disorder which required an immediate operation . The Chinaman inquired of the doctor whether the operation would make him sick , and the doctor admitted that it would . How long would he be sick ? About six weeks , he was told . And would he be all right at the end of the six weeks ? Would he surely live ? The doctor assured him that he would live and that he would be well again within that time . The Chinaman thought the matter over for some time and then asked , " And how long will I live if I do n't have the operation ? " " Until about three o'clock this afternoon , " was the doctor 's reply . After another period of deep thought the Chinaman announced his decision : he would rather live until three o'clock without the operation than go through that six weeks of sickness , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this modern prophet , one of the two men on whose prevision and optimism a great industry years ago gambled nearly ten million dollars , said he felt like the Chinaman ? he would  | rather die at three o'clock that afternoon . than go through what he saw immediately ahead of us . A simple case of a weary prophet , temporarily caught in the pattern . As we sat in the great quiet officebuilding and looked out over the roofs of New York and across the Hudson to the Palisades , the other prophet spoke : " An optimist resting ! " ( You ca n't get these men to admit that they are prophets . ) " Ca n't you see Elijah sitting there under the juniper-tree , weary from his strenuous experience with the prophets of Baal , whom he had slain the day before , foot-sore after his day 's journey into the wilderness , his tunic torn , his throat parched , his stomach empty , and his courage gone ? And ca n't you hear him say it , Now , O Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all in the day 's work with these prophets occasionally to get to the place where they want to die , when they have been caught in the pattern and realize all which must be gone through before they can reach the vision they see off in the future . But before our friend from the Far East left the office he said that he had decided to live until five o'clock instead of three . And a week later I heard that he was rested and ready to go through whatever might lie ahead . Once more he had climbed up where he could look into the future . You simply ca n't keep a good prophet in the pattern !  |
