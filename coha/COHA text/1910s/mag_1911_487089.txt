Most people find it a good plan not to say everything that comes into their head , especially in public ; and if this is a good rule for ordinary folk , it is a still better one for Presidents of the United States . If Mr. Taft had had it in mind when he made the big opening speech of his reciprocity campaign , he might not have committed the blunder cf talking about " the parting of the ways , " which was made so much of by the Canadian Opposition . And we can not help - thinking that another instance in point is furnished by these remarks in his speech at St. Paul on the Panama Canal : Then there is the question of tolls We have agreed that we will charge equal tolls to all countries and there arose the question how far we may favor our own vessels between coast and coast , as we exclude vessels of any other country from that trade The question is whether if we remit the tolls we are in a sense discriminating against any other country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that trade It may be that it will be held that the rule can apply to them as to others , if so , there is nothing to prevent our voting back to the coastwise vessels the tolls which they would be required to pay . Was ever a proposal to whip the devil round the stump made with such childlike innocence ? Perhaps the rule against discrimination can be got over , says the President , on a special plea ; but if that special plea should be decided to be baseless , then there is nothing to prevent our getting by a trick what we have had to acknowledge we could not get fairly and aboveboard . The delightful simplicity of Mr. William Allen White 's analysis of the Republican Presidential situation must commend it to all devotees of the science of political prophesy . A few bold strokes of insight , and poor Taft 's business is settled . He ca n't be nominated without getting the Southern delegates , and he ca n't get the Southern delegates if Wall street wants to take them away from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it knows he ca n't win . The circle seems quite complete . But let us see . Wall Street hates La Follette like poison , and can not besatisfied to knock Taft out if that should mean the nomination of the Wisconsin Progressive ; so the question arises , who is to be set up against La Follette in place of Taft ? That difficulty may possibly be got over by putting up " some fine , unimpeachable , dignified candidate like Seth Low , President Butler of Columbia , Senator Lodge , or Senator Burton of Ohio . " Thus we have the circle complete again  --  but for one trifling gap . If Wall Street has intelligence enough to know that Taft can not be elected , what sort of intelligence will it be exercising in trying to get a man elected whose nomination would be brought about primarily by its control of Southern delegates through its ownership of Southern railways , and whose candidacy would bear the mark " made in Wall Street " all through- the campaign ? Thus the case is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fighting chance for the nomination in spite of Mr. White 's diagnosis of the condition of Wall Street 's mind . Why go further than Albany for a Democratic candidate for the Presidency ? Here is Gov . Dix telling us  --  as the newsboys would say ? " all about " the Trust question , and surely that is the question of the day . " The great need of the time is to cease ill-considered interference , and , consistent with human rights , give the fullest play possible to the energy and resourcefulness of the American people . " No objection to well-considered interference , please notice ; and a reservation is clearly made for the claims of " human rights . " That is the way to solve the Trust problem , and the wonder is that nobody has thought of it before . Perhaps one reason , however , for this failure has been the neglect of other people , in the pressure of politics and law and business complications , to take a philosophical survey of the fundamental factors in the case . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an unflinching pen . He sees plainly that " capital has a just claim to remuneration commensurate with the hazard and risk of business and financial enterprises , and the compensation of labor should be far above the line of bare subsistence , " and he does not hesitate to say so . Secretary Fisher 's address on " Alaskan Problems , " before the American Mining Congress , is wholly free from controversial or partisan spirit , and is manifestly the result of painstaking inquiry and observation , and of impartial thinking . Upon many aspects of the agitation over the exploiting of Alaska 's resources , Mr. Fisher 's statements throw a milder light than has beaten upon them in the pages of some of the muck-raking magazines ; but upon the central question involved in that agitation his conclusions are as clear and as emphatically expressed as the most determined conservationist can desire . " The time has passed , " says the Secretary , " when the Government should convey an unrestricted title to its coal fields . The day is done in which the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power . " ? On the contrary , Mr. Fisher declares unqualifiedly for the working of the coal lands under a system of leases and royalties , the ownership remaining with the Government . Proof of the practicability of this plan he adduces from experience in this country , in Australia and New Zealand , and in the Yukon territory adjacent to Alaska . So far as the question of delay in the using of the coal is concerned , Secretary Fisher 's statement is that " by making the terms of our leases liberal we can make them even more attractive to capital than if we adopt the policy of an outright sale of the fee " ? provided we understand by " capital " working capital and not speculative capital . As for the objection that it would be impossible to get any , leasing legislation through Congress , this is neatly and completely dispatched by the Secretary in the simple remark that , in his judgment , " Congress is far more likely to pass a rational leasing measure than it is to throw the coal fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is twenty-five years since Archbishop Gibbons of Baltimore was made a member of the College of Cardinals in succession to McCloskey of New York . During that quarter of a century the Catholic population of this country has greatly increased in numbers , in wealth , Church which the remarkable growth of Catholicism in this country long ago justified is sometimes supposed to have been delayed by the conflict of opposing currents within the American Church . Such Controversies are apparently no longer a living issue . At any rate there is handsome compensation for the long-deferred honor in the unexpected number , of American prelates upon whom the distinction has at last been bestowed . The United States will now have four Cardinals out of a total of seventy-three , which is not greatly out of proportion to the number of Catholics in this country . The new creations are indicative , however , of something more than the growth of Catholicism in the United States ; they recognize also the larger place which this . country occupies in the eye of the world . At a time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new appointments are a tribute to the friendly relations between Church and State which are the only ones conceivable in our system . The remarkable personal qualities and the extraordinary career of the late Joseph Pulitzer deserve , such recognition as his sudden death has called forth . His story of struggle upward from the lowliest beginnings is what we like to think typically American . His rise was no accident . He had the mind and will to carve his way anywhere . To an energy which was both restless and untiring , he added a marked intellectual grasp . And the way in which , during the closing years of his life , Mr. Pulitzer kept his intellectual interests alive though in the grip of relentless disease and stricken with blindness , witnessed to an inner spring of vitality in the man , and an indomitable resolution . As a newspaper proprietor and editor , Mr. Pulitzer is to be credited with having championed many of the good causes of his time . Under him , for example , the New York World was earlY a stout advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied sincere conviction on Mr. Pulitzer 's part , for at the time the movement was not popular . Perhaps it was related in his mind to that general fight for the people against privilege in which he thought of himself as engaged  --  the spoils of office being , in this case , the privilege which politicians arrogantlyly- contended . Indeed , it was a part of Mr. Pulitzer 's instinct for polities and sagacity in reading the future in the present that he should have been so often on the right side of important public questions . It is a different matter when we consider the type of journalism which Mr. Pulitzer first fully exemplified in New York . About that , it is notorious that doubts arose in his own mind ! He came t ' ) feel that what he had helped create had somehow become too powerful and had got away . It is known that he often expressed some such idea about his own paper ; what he thought of the imitators who had bettered his instructions , may easily be imagined . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck out boldly for a new kind of " publicity " in journalism . But that word means many things . It covers not only the exposure of political scoundrels , but it denotes , in practice , a kind of constant clamor rising into a shriek , with a daily prying into private affairs as if nothing existed anywhere which should not be dragged into the light of day , and , worse than all , a lurid exploitation of crime and nastiness . Attempt has been made to justify such methods on the plea of " appealing to a wider audtenee , " and acquiring the greatest possible " influence , " But there is always a danger lest influence be confused with circulation  --  meaning profits  --  and the wider audience be only another way of spelling larger dividends At any rat ' , the admittedly evil means remain evil and work evil , even if they are adopted in the hope of attaining good ends . " The Press and Crime " was one of the topics discussed at the meeting of the American Academy of Medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Neurotic Books and Newspapers as Factors in the Mortality of Suicide and Crime " specifically accused the World of having given n lead and a vogue to " prurient and crime-inspiring periodicals . " Mr. Taft , as a consistent advocate of peace , endeavored at the University of Minnesota to show that peace hath not only her victories , but her heroisms as well . Braver deeds may have been done than Mr. Taft 's when he told his college audience that their favorite yells weresenseless and barbaric ; but history has not recorded them . The miracle was that the President 's words were not immediately drowned in a roar of Rah , rah , rah , Ski-U-mah , ? hurrah  --  hurrah ' Varsity ? ' Varsity , ?

Prize as we should the service of the public-spirited citizen , and praise as we may the long labor of the newspaper man , it is the imaginative quality of the poet , and his representative position in our literary history , which are the best claim of the name of Bryant to be commemorated . In an age beset by materialism And sordid tendencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special meaning . It is the protest of the spirit against the things that would quench it . In honoring a poet we somehow record our belief that a man 's life does not consist in the abundance of things which he possesses , and that there is something finer than luxury and nobler than power . Even when we are fallen on prosaic days , and it should seem that the voice of the singer fails and his vision perishes , there is still the invincible hope that a poet will arise , in answer to invocations like that of Clough , to interpret our time truly to us . A statue to Bryant the poet thus becOmes a significant treasure of New York . G. B. Shaw has had to wait some time for an endorsement of his conviction that he could write as well as Shakespeare , and that he had never done anything as poor as " As You Like It . " It has now come , however , and from no less an authority than a Western high school . The literary societies managed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stratford dramatist " licentious , unclean , and objectionable , " and in demanding the withdrawal of his productions from the curriculum in favor of those of Ibsen and Shaw . The strongest point of their indictment is that the " bard of Avon " was " a cheap grand-stand player . " This puts the antithesis between present and former playwrights perfectly . It is the greatest of pities that the Marlowes and the Shakespeares were so shortsighted as to prefer momentary success , however won , to the lofty ideal of writing for posterity , which dominates the immortals of our own time . Had it not been for the factitious importance given to the sensational author of " Hamlet " by prescribing his works for study in our schools , he could not have obtained such a hold upon us . Irresponsible muck-raking appears at its ? worst in an article in the Cosmopoidan , , purporting to describe the " carnival of corruption " in Mississippi culminating in the election of Leroy Percy to the United States Senate in 1910 . The writer seeks to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated in the choice of Senator Percy over Vardaman by a vote of 87 to 82 . The whole case hinged upon the testimony of Bilbo , a State Senator , and one of Vardaman 's henchmen , that he had trapped L. C. Dulaney , Senator Percy 's manager , into bribing him for his vote . Dulaney was indicted and tried , but acquitted , the writer charges , by a packed jury of Percy supporters . As a matter of fact , the jury , of whom eight were Vardaman men , acquitted Dulaney upon the testimony of Bilbo himself , when it had been proved that the banknotes which he swore Were the identical ones handed to him had been issued by a bank in his home town , on a date after that on which the bribery was said to have taken place . Moreover , the Legislature , in joint session , after a complete investigation , exonerated every one concerned save Bilbo  --  and this , not by a partisan Madero 's enemies in Mexico evidently find any kind of stick good enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could venture to say , as Madero is charged with saying , that he should rather govern with the cooperation of the people than with ' the aid of bayonets . Why this should have been construed into an insult to the Mexican army and should have thrown the Chamber of Deputies into a fury of protest , does not appear from the context , the situation , or the record made by the Mexican army against Madero himself . The situation is complicated by the peculiar nature of the charges brought against Madero in connection with the insurrectionary movement led by Gen. Zapata , with whom the President-elect is supposed to be lu connivance . Why Madero should conspire to ruin his own Administration right from the start does not appear . There is a different explanation that suggests itself . Madero , in assuming office , finds this fairly serious revolutionary movement on his hands . He does not want to begin his Presidential career by initiating a civil war , and believes that a policy of conciliation might bring the rebels to terms . Hence the expression about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputies who are his enemies or who do not understand his motives . Those people who have described Italy 's advent into Tripoli as a campaign for civilization , are now in a position to record the first decisive victory scored for civilization  --  namely , the indiscriminate massacre of thousands of non-combatant natives by the panic-stricken Italian soldiery . It is not to be supposed that Italy entered upon her adventure in Tripoli without being pre . pared to pay a heavy price . Putting aside the disastrous experiences in Abyssinia , the Italian General Staff must have been fully aware that campaigning in the tropics is a very expensive bit of business . Even the model German army found that to be the case in East Africa and Southwest Africa . The French Government had to throw nearly fifty thousand troops into Morocco during the campaign that followed must count upon severer opposition than the French encountered . The Turkish army in Tripoli , while unimpressive in point of numbers , nevertheless constitutes a nucleus about which the desert horsemen may be brought into something like military discipline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a kind that the Beduin tribesmen in Morocco were entirely without . That brilliant young officer Enver Bey , one of the pillars of the new regime at Constantinople , is reported to have arrived in Tripoli , or to be on his way there . Ultimately , it is to be supposed , the Italians will make themselves masters of the country . The national honor is now so deeply engaged in the enterprise that any sacrifices necessary to the end will be forthcoming . But Italy will be fortunate if she comes out of the struggle with merely -a heavy loss of men and money . The reaction upon conditions at home is one that the Government must look forward to with no little anxiety . The necessity of saving one 's face , which has always been a cardinal point of Chinese diplomacy , apparently no longer holds , or applies only to dealings with the foreign devils . Certainly the Imperial edict issued at Peking on Monday is one of the most notable examples of eating humble pie on record . It is an extraordinary document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excuse for ignorance , scores his former Ministers and pledges himself to rule henceforth in complete accord with the desires of his people . For a little boy of five the paper is not a bad showing either from the tactical or the stylistic point of view . There should be a great literary career in store for the Emperor Pu-Yi . As for the general situation , the Imperial edict merely puts into immediate effect the promises of earlier years . The exclusion of the Manchu princes from a voice or place in the Constitutional scheme was bound to come as soon as a real Parliament was assembled . If it should turn out that the reported Imperialist victory at Hankow is as complete as it has been reported to be , conditions leave both parties in a fit mood for compromise . And that is the best that can happen to China if her democratic institutions are to have a fair test , unhampered by the interference of the Powers .                  @ @ @
