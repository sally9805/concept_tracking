txt Helen Buchan , a young stenographer , left the Long Island train which brought her to Union Course , near Richmond Hill , at five minutes after midnight yesterday and was hurrying home alone along Shaw Avenue , when three men sprang out of the darkness , seized her , and beat her into insensibility . Before she was struck and before the first hand reached out to close about her throat she gave one scream of terror that rang out clear and far . It was that scream that brought help and frightened away the assailants , hut not before they had stripped her of her muff , her money , and her rings . The girl is at her home , 121 . Second Street , Union Course , suffering from the shock and with her face all but unrecognizable from the marks of the blows she received . Helen Buchan is the twenty-one-Yearold daughter of John Buchan , add lives with her parents . On Saturday evening she went to a theatre in Brooklyn , and , lingering with friends , it was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little station of Union Course . Between the station and her home stretch seven blocks of Shaw Avenue , the prospect of a lonely walk on a night so bitter cold . In the three years that the Buchans have lived at Union Course the girl had seldom found herself obliged to take that walk alone , but she was well wrapped against the wind , with her long fur coat and her sealskin muff . In her mind as she stepped from the platform there was a little uneasiness , based on no real apprehension , but inspired by the darkness and the hour and the solitude of the long street ahead . She glanced all around and noticed , not without a little qualm , that the doors of the glowing bar in the hotel across the tracks swung open , just as the train pulled out of the station , to let a half dozen men or more out into the darkness that swallowed them up . She hesitated for Just a few Moments , and then , making up her mind to go through with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind was whipping ucrcss the - innumerable vacant spaces of Union Ceurse , ' She bent before it , - shielding ' her face with her big muff and all but running in her eagerness to have her own front door locked safely behind her . Time for Just One Scream . She had gone about a block from the station and was on Shaw Avenue , nearing Eighth Street , when something indefinable made her glance behind her . She said afterward that she did not believe she heard anything , but she turned her head just in time to see a tall man at her heels . His arm was reached out toward her and as she saw him he leaped forward . Her frightened glance took in two or three other figures coming out of the darkness . It was then that she screamed , and just in time , for the outstretched hand gripped her throat , and as ' she was forced , choking , to her knees , a big fist was directed in a blow squarely between her eyes . After that she knew nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife had come in on the same train , only , indifferent to the cold and loneliness , they had hurried directly from the station and had reached the veranda of their home on Eighth Street , half way down the side street from Shaw Avenue , but with a view across the open lot to the very spot where the girl was attacked . Mr. Danner , who is a roofer and tinsmith of Union Course , had fished out his key and was putting it in the lock , when he was halted by the girl 's scream . Mr. Danner and his wife hurried down the steps and across the lot . On ' the sidewalk they found the girl . Danner had seen three or four men vanishing into the night as he and his wife ran across the lot . But the first consideration was the girl , and the Danners carried her into their home . There in the light they saw that her face was ' narked as though it had been struck blow after blow . The . silk of her waist was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long fur coat was pulled down off one arm as though an attempt bad been made to tear it from her limp end unresisting body . Over the Danner telephone the first call went to St. Mary 's Hospital and the second to the police station at Ozone Park . In a little while an ambulance was at the door and not long after the police of Ozone Park were on the track . Mugs and Money Gone . The girl recovered consciousness long enough to plead that the ambulance take her to her home , and this was done . The missing glove and the torn hand showed where the fingers had . been stripped of two rings , both of them solitaires , zone her own , one a ring that belonged to Mrs. Buchan . The torn waist told of the brooch that had been plucked from her neck . Her muff was gone and the little aiigator skin handbag that she carried . It is said that she nad $50 in money in the bag , and the sum of her losses is set down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the Buchan household yesterday there was only thankfulness that the footpads had stopped or were stopped at highway robbery . The girl was able to take a lively interest yesterday in what had befallen her , but as for helping the detectives in any way , she was useless . Only the haziest impression ? of her first assailant remained  --  that of a tall , slender man , clean shaven , dark and quite young . The rest were mere shadows . It was with no little distress that she learned yesterday afternoon of the detectives ' orders that a photographer is to visit the Buchan house to-day and get a negative of the bruised , blackened , swollen fa ce of the girl as the footpads left it ? this to go among the records of the case for good use some day if ever the authorities place men on trial for the crime . As yet the police are without a substantial clue as to the identity of the men who beat the girl .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
