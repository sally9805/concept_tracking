NEVER did think that we had been jammed into an already over ? crowded sphere on a personal - benefit plan . If work had been por ? tioned out to me as my job , it was my duty to get it out of the way as soon and as creditably as pos ? sible . The economic aspects of it did not occur to me . It would never have struck me to apologize for the fact that I worked for my living . All of the girls in my town expected to earn their own living . Most of us went to work as soon as we were graduated from college or high school , or from that condensed form of instruction known as the busi ? ness college . In that Middle West town no girl dreamed of remaining at home as a burden to the family support . Sometimes strict necessity urged us forth suddenly from homes that had been a shelter and an inspiration , and sometimes we were only too glad to leave those homes and earn comforts elsewhere . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Who is she ? " We inquired , " What does she do ? " We did not envy the girl who could remain idly at home as much as we did the girl who could procure for herself a good position . Largely , I believe it was the dread of asking the men folks of our family for current expenses and accounting for them later . I believe that is the greatest economic urge that sends women forth to fare for them ? selves . A man is usually more willing to pay any woman outside his family money which he is sure she does not earn than to pay to the women folks of his own family the money he knows they earn . And we , in turn , from being slaves to the men of our household , be ? come the slaves of our jobs . We love to be slaves to something . It is born in us . I suppose the trouble is that for centuries we have been soaccustomed to looking timorously up to our men folks , or contemptuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? selves to looking at them on calmly equal terms . And when we determine that we will no longer be slaves to them , we content ourselves by becoming the slaves of our job . It gives us a sort of pleased and martyred feeling of doing our duty . And as duty has always been interpreted to us as the doing of something disagree- able in a highly unpleasant manner , we rejoice plaintively in our own distress and wonder why people avoid us when we strive to impress it upon them . It was a chance remark at a lecture that waked me up to a realization of the proper values of my job . The lecturer dispensed with oratory , and said , " When the business girl is trained to know the meaning of economic independence , she has made herself the boss of her job . " I thought it was rather a crude form of expression at the time . I always spoke of my work as a " position . " To have a position carried with it a dignity i that savored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages , rather than a salary , who had " jobs . " But gradu ? ally the dynamic force of that sentence got home to my mind and I began to know what " economic independence " was . Not long ago a woman was telling me most pathetically that she had been forced to give up her club work . She was a victim of the old regime when every man was the overlord of his own household . She was thirty years old and unmarried , and she said her father had refused to pay her club dues any longer because the members had invited Emma Goldman , in a fit of broad-minded lib ? erality , to speak before the club on an extremely innocent and unexciting sub ? ject . She regarded me rather dubiously when I told her I thought it served her right for expecting her father , at her age , to pay her club dues . She still feels that she did right in attending the lect ? ure , for she says it broadened her mind considerably to think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma Goldman , even though it was mainly out of curiosity . But she acquiesces meekly in the refusal of her father to continue to pay her club dues . You see , she is a slave to her job of being a daughter and a parasite upon her father 's bounty . There are parasites in business as well as in the home . Personally , I have al ? ways felt it would he more of a disgrace to remain at home and coax my living from my family than it would be to get out and earn it in the open market . But all of us who are in business are not business women . The latter works be ? cause she has ability and likes her work . The woman in business works because she has to , and she cherishes a sullen resentment against the world in general and her job in particular because of it . The only solace she finds in her job is that it affords her a better chance to find a husband than if she had remained at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he most abounds . And often she marries well . Many an intrepid man - hunter has turned out to be a very happy home ? maker . You never can tell . Not long ago I attended a meeting of women who discussed the problems of the working-girl . After the meeting I walked home with a practical woman who ? has been a shop-girl for fifteen years . She studies the real problems of the working-girl . I asked her what she thought of the conference and its grave discussion of the morals of the shop-girl . She had her thoughts ready to offer . " You give any girl a job and a chance to do what 's right with it , and she will be the safest guardian of her own morals , " she said . " If the slushologists who dote on this conference business did not have these meetings to occupy their minds , I suppose they 'd be busying themselves with other things that would not be so good for them . Some day we shop-girls are going to form a society to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we do . It is dreadfully hard on us when they come to the coun ? ter and lift a sadly sympathizing eyewhile we are busy trying to figure out the price of two and six-eighths yards of lace at eighty-nine cents a yard , and making up our minds that we will not let another night pass over our heads without attending to those aching corns , and to have them say , ' Poor girl ! Do n't you get awfully tired of standing all day ? ' They think they 've shown won ? derful consideration for the working-classes when they have done that . " It is merely because we can not get together on our problems , I suppose . We should not be qualified to handle the problems of the wealthy people who want to uplift us ; but we ought to have credit for the fact that we do not at ? tempt it , They do try to settle ours for us . And sometimes they talk a lot of nonsense about the six-dollar-a-week girl . I have always found that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than six dollars a week , that is all she is going to get . When she is worth more than that to herself as well as her employer , she will demand it and get it . But as long as she is a slave to her job , she need expect no more . Business is apt to be a coldly scientific affair of balanced dollars and cents as against accredited labor . And the girl who must be helped all the time is not worth helping at all . If she were , she would help herself at the first oppor ? tunity . The trouble is that there are too many girls working , not because they are equipped for the work , but be ? cause they need the job , and they con ? sider this reason enough to demand skilled wages for unskilled labor . I once heard a woman who sold dogs complain most bitterly of one of her neighbors who is an expert on the care and training of toy dogs , and who has a kennel that is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sufficient income and need not sell dogs for a living , and that she was tak ? ing the bread out of her mouth . I chanced to know that only a week before , the neighbor , sorry for her less successful competitor , had offered her an order that could not be filled from her own kennels just at that time . The con ? dition was that the dogs be ready for inspection the next morning at eight o'clock , as the buyer was leaving . " But I could never get up early enough to have my dogs ready by that time , " protested the complainant . " Could n't the buyer come some other time ? I wanted to go in to town to ? morrow , too . " Yet she blamed an efficient woman , skilled in every branch of her business and commanding the respect of every dog-fancier about , for taking the bread out of her mouth . Seven years ago , during a stringency in business , a corporation advertised for a girl to fill a job paying eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice eventually narrowed to two girls . One was found letter-perfect in the work required , and was given the place . The other girl made considerable fuss about it . She claimed the fortunate girl could live at home and did not need the money . The superintendent was sorry for her and literally made a place for her , but she could not hold it a week . She could not do the work . She in ? sisted on blaming the efficient girl in ? stead of herself . The girl who got the place lived at home , it was true , but she was practi ? cally sending a younger sister through college . Whether or not she needed the place was not of importance to the superintendent . What he wanted was a girl who could do the work . Most em ? ployers feel the same about it , even though from long habit they still accuse us of working because we want extra pin-money . But what reasonable per ? son will believe that a girl will crowd to work every morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin-money that she has no time to spend ? An &; given the choice between a girl who needs a job and a girl who can do the work as it should be done , the employer will in ? evitably give the place to the girl who is best qualified to do it . And so he should , for the sooner the girl who needs a job learns to equip her ? self creditably for it , the sooner she has grasped the real meaning of economic independence and has come to the point where she can " boss her job . " The busi ? ness woman who succeeds seeks for Work because she is qualified for it rather than because she needs the job . And while she is qualifying herself for aplace in the business world she can hardly hope for the salary expected and received by skilled labor . A friend of mine who is fond of sta ? tistics spent considerable time last sum ? mer in tracing this " bread-out-of-our ? mouth " dragon to its lair . The result of her investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work because they must not only earn their own living , but must support , either fully or in part , some other mem ? ber of the family . The human fluffs of the business world make up the other fifteen per cent . Belonging to this class is the girl who works because remaining at home is too monotonous , or because she expects to find a husband in the office . She exploits her sex in the office , consciously or unconsciously . She works cheaper because she is a woman . She wants the window continually up or down ; she hints for candy and flowers and ; heater tickets ; she embroils the entire office in petty politics ; and she clouds the record for the business woman who tackles her work like any other employee in the office and who fails to see why there should be any question of personal privilege in office routine . This fifteen per cent . always reminds me of the fluffs that annoy the house ? keeper so . I suppose we have to have the human fluffs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardwood floors knows what a floor fluff is . No one can explain them , but we all have to contend with them . The worst thing about a fluff is that it hides around in dark corners when you are industriously at work with mop and broom , and only blows airily out into the middle of the floor for public inspection when there is company and you want to put your best foot forward . Even though the company knows she has them in her own house , it casts a doubt in her mind on your housekeeping . It is the human fluff who is always seeking for the " easy job , " and who forgets that the jobs with good salaries carry heavy responsibili ? ties with them . One assumes the salary only with the responsibility . It is n't like getting through with the day 's work and closing your desk and going gaily home , as it was with the six-a-week job . The big-salary jobs mean creative work , and there is nothing that takes it out of your mentality like responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limousine when he goes to lunch , and his tip alone would buy me a good dinner . But I am not envious . I draw my salary regularly and I do not have to lie awake nights to wonder how the shortage in paper will affect the business , or whether or not I can meet the obliga ? tions that will fall due next month , as he must . The lunch and the limousine are merely a part of his job . For there is no sentiment in business . It is like an immense and relentless cur ? rent ? one must sweep with it or be destroyed . We may deplore the fact , we women who were raised on pretty sentiment ; but we can not alter it . The rule was here before we were , and I refuse to kick out my toes at something that will not yield to kicks . I adapt myself to the rule and avoid friction . Every once in a while ? and not so frequently as formerly ? I find a business girl who rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a business girl ; she is only a girl in business . To the real business woman , marriage is getting to be as much of a side-issue as it is to a man . I can remember when there were only two vocations open to a woman : she could teach or she could enter domestic service , or she could marry and combine these occupations . If she did not succeed in marrying by the time she was thirty , she was looked upon indulgently as one who was forced to enter the business world to forget the fact that she had been a drug on the matrimonial market . My business hours are from nine to five ; but , as nearly as I can learn , my married friends keep office hours eighteen hours out of the twenty-four , trying to catch up with their domestic duties . I heard a girl in an elevator the other day discussingwith a sympathizing friend her differences with a floor-walker . " Aw , " she said , " I do n't have to take any more sass ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit here , anyhow . I 'm goin ' to be married . No more work and no more bossing for me . " Any girl of her mental caliber who en ? ters the married state is walking right into the hardest job she can ever holddown in her life , and totally unequipped for her position . Inside of a year , if she is as poor a wife as she has been a shop-girl , there will be another man hanging around the corner saloon trying to forget in a glass of cheap beer the confusion and the bad food in the flat at home . When she gleefully announced that she was going to stop work , the thought of the meals , the cleaning , and the laundry had evidently not occurred to her . And the floor-walker does n't live who can hand out orders like a husband . You have to take them from a husband , too , for you can not quit your job in matri ? mony as easily as you can in a shop . The title of " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ing in the business world these days . Only a few days ago ! met a most charm ? ing young woman who was introduced to me as Miss Brown . She wore no wedding-ring . But none of us were surprised when a very good-looking young man joined the group and was introduced to us as her husband , whose name was something else again . When we meet other interesting women , we are apt to casually inquire , as we would of a man , " Is she married ? " Half the business women I know are married ; but they retain the name by which they made their success . They refuse to re ? linquish what Bobby Burns has called the " blessed privilege of hieing inde ? pendent " I roomed with another girl once in my six-a-week days . We had both dis ? covered that any young man in a new boarding-house is taken at his face value , but a girl must explain herself wherever she goes . She explains herself by her clothes and by her conduct . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant classification and of the class of boarding-house that our six-a-week entitled us to . So we fol ? lowed the will-o ' - the- wisp that sounds so alluring and that leads one so often , not to the end of the rainbow , but to the end of many things ? the art of light housekeeping . The art consists in cooking your meals over the landlady 's gas without her find ? ing it out . And our poor landladies ! Overworked , weary , wary , and accus ? tomed to look upon every boarder as a born enemy intent on cheating them in some way , they were usually very good to us . We tried to put brains into our housekeeping as we did into our jobs . When you hear sad stories about the poor working-girl who subsists on tea and crackers , put her down as lacking considerable gumption ? and gumption is a necessary article in business . Long before what my room-mate called " these food sharps " had expatiated upon the delights of proteins and carbohydrates and other ingredients of food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfying elements of food that we needed . We made cocoa over a gas-plate , and a bottle of milk is food in itself . We hunted for the cheap little places where you could buy for a dime a beef stew , and first take the soup and then eat the beef and potatoes . We ate plenty of whole-wheat bread , and bought bananas and oranges when they were plentiful and cheap . We spoke softly to the landlady , and sometimes let her unburden her tales of woe to us --  -- how they do love a sympa ? thetic listener ! ? and in turn she gave us the privilege of slipping down into the laundry , if we did not tell the other boarders , and ironing out our own shirt ? waists . We made our suits last a long time , and we wore cotton hose and cheap shoes ; but we lived on that six a week and had a lot of fun out of it . We looked upon it as a temporary phase of development and not as a permanent bogging-down place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We called our bed a " sanitary grouch " ? you know the affair that expands so ? ciably into a bed at night and politely pretends to be a couch in the daytime and in the evening when you have callers . My room-mate of those days is bossing a four-thousand-dollar job now , and it took those two years of six-a-week re ? sponsibilities to develop her for the big ? ger job . She knew she had to get up at six in the morning to get to the office on time , but she did not waste any time in moaning over her fate ; she got up and went to work . And she never al ? lowed either of us to slight the wash ? basin . Do you know , keeping clean is a job in itself under those conditions . Soap and water are not as cheap as they are reputed to be by those who know noth ? ing of the temperature of a furnished room at six in the morning of a winter day . Someway , since those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame the very poor for preferring to be dirty . When you have only five cents left and have to choose between a loaf of bread and a cake of soap , you are very apt to select the bread and let the dirt take its comfortable course It takes courage , under some conditions , just to be clean . Likewise it takes courage to ask for a job or to ask for an increase in your salary . I can not agree with the women who are always harping on the fact that men make it difficult for us in the busi ? ness world . I do not believe that they do . I believe that when such a situation does develop in any office it is largely due to the inherent antagonism of sex spirit and resentment toward their job of the women themselves . When women harp on the injustice of an unequal salary system , it is often a mark of their own inefficiency if they accept the lesser salary . When we entered competition with men in the offices we had to accept conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I believe that women are accepted on equal terms in almost every office at the present time . For we have not crowded out the men in the division of labor . There is still plenty of work for them . Only we have made them step lively to keep up with competition . Perhaps you remember the famous " one-day strike " of the suffragists last year . It came about from the argument ? ment of a ponderous politician of the old school that " woman 's place was in the home . " A clever little suffrage leader said the only way to find out where her place lay was to call a one-day strike , in which women would abstain from work of any sort . It was not intended to be taken literally , but the public took it literally . The suf ? fragists were flooded with letters and telegrams from every state in the Union . They were mostly from men , and they feverishly pointed out that the entire economic industry of the country would suffer if this one-day strike were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears , would suffer most . Should we women strike for one day and re ? main " in the home , " our accredited place , the business world would collapse . The home would rock along fairly well , but how business would suffer ! The telephone companies could not operate , the telegraph companies would suffer , the department-stores would have to close , and many a stolid business man would be helpless in his own office in the absence of his staff of women clerks . And the very men who spoke the most tenderly of woman 's place in the home voiced the most emphatic protest against the danger of doing without her in the business world . We have to thank the business world for teaching us many things . We have discarded our petty outlook and we have opened our minds to the contem ? plation of many things besides our neighbors ' affairs . The other day I met a business woman who has a position of great responsibility . She told me that at the close of a large business transac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal chanced to mention his opinion that no woman should be allowed to occupy the position of responsibility she held . It disturbed her until she recognized the fact that in worrying over it she was giving way to a pettiness thar had no place in the life of a successful business woman . So she dismissed it with a smile . She was right ; no business woman can afford to allow personal wor ? ries to interfere with her office work . I remember once when a personal trouble caused a friend of mine to take her despondency to the office with her . Her depression began to affect the office II staff unconsciously . One day her em ? ployer , a wise man who believed in a cheerful atmosphere in the office , called her to his desk . " I am tremendously sorry for you , " he said , kindly . " I know things are breaking badly for you at home just now . But I employ you to do a certain amount of work here for me , and one or the requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cheer ? fulness to bear upon your work . You may not realize it , but your state of mind is actually affecting the work in the office . " " There was only one thing to do , " she told me later ? for , like many an ? other business girl , she had allowed her home worries to undermine her nerves , which should have been kept serene to tackle her office problems . " I had to choose between being a half-way busi ? ness girl and a half-way home girl . I put my family on its own resources and bent every bit of my time and energy to climbing the ladder in my own office . And it did the family good , for they learned to get along by themselves . " It struck me at the time that one of the most valuable adjustments we have to make in business is to give other peo ? ple their own chance to develop , whether it is our family or our washerwoman . Otherwise they are apt to take us at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office cat ? who ought to be glad just of the opportunity to stick around . I used to spend dreary hours in darn ? ing hose and washing out handkerchiefs and sewing on shirt-waists that looked tacky and home-made when I was through ? to save money . When I be ? came boss of my job and discovered that leisure to use my brains and conserve my health meant money to me , I por ? tioned out a fair and just due for such work among the seamstresses and laun ? dresses who were better fitted for it than I was . Washing and ironing and darn ? ing and sewing were their job , and I refused longer to cheat them out of it . That I was claiming my share of eco ? nomic independence was not a valid reason why I should attempt to keep other women from theirs . A girl who sometimes eats luncheon with me recently berated me because I took issue with her concerning the am ? bitions of the girl who works . My friend would be pretty if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is not only a slave to her job , but to her duty . She wears flat-heeled shoes and plain hats and unbecoming gowns , not because she really likes them or feels more comfortable in them , but because it is a matter of principle with her . She believes that business women must sac ? rifice feminine fripperies to the exigen ? cies of the occasion . One of the girls in her department had paid ten dollars for a pair of tan shoes . She thought it wicked in her . I regarded it as a step in the right direction . She said the girl had wanted the shoes so badly that she had asked for a raise in salary ? and had got it . " She deserves them if they gave her the ambition to do better work for a better salary , " I contended . " Some day that girl can afford to wear fourteen-dollar shoes , because she dared to have an ambition for ten-dollar ones . " Spasmodically , society has always taken an interest in the business girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do ; and , finally , because so ? ciety has found that business women are really worth cultivating . But they have tried to help her from the outside in . They have n't known her needs from the inside out . I remember , when I first came to New York , how I used to save on my dinners and ride on the Fifth Avenue ' bus every evening , pretending that I knew my seat-mate very well indeed , but that we did n't care to talk . I was so lonesome that I wanted to be ? long to somebody ; I wanted to have some one make a fuss over me . I could have gone to a club or a church social and been patronized . I wanted to be met on friendly terms as an equal . The women who want to help us , with the best of intentions , do the greatest damage sometimes . What do they know of the all-pervading , soul-searing , bitter loneliness we know ? They estab ? lish for us working girls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions that are only one remove from a charitable institution . They put in for a matron some needy woman who needs a home and who has n't the faint ? est conception of how to make one for the dozens of lonely girls who flock to it . I have lived in these homes . Like the rest , I did not want to be uplifted ; it was as unpleasant for us as it was for the uplifters . We wanted to get ac ? quainted . They mean well , these wom ? en , and perhaps we do them some good . I suppose their interest in us comes at the deadly time of life when they realize that their waist-line will never again be what it was and they find themselves being shifted to the frank ? ly middle-aged crowd at the bridge-tables . But when we have earned the money to buy a ticket to the theater or a con ? cert , we do not relish having humbly to ask permission of a disapproving ma ? tron to remain out after ten-thirty . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit the home and poke around through the closets and our bureau drawers to see if we keep things neat and tidy . We are not all naturally neat and tidy . My upper bureau drawer , like that of every other woman , is generally mingling with its own con ? tents in the most sociable manner . I would not like to live with a woman who kept her upper bureau drawer neat and tidy . I would be afraid of her . We have earned our economic inde ? pendence and our right to keep our upper bureau drawer as we please , we business women . Perhaps we have had to sacrifice a few ideals and perhaps it has been better for us to sacrifice them . For , one by one , as we learn how to boss our own jobs , we are discovering that the first office order to hustle out and earn what bread was needed in the house for the day by the sweat of the brow was about the best thing that ever hap ? pened to Adam ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ com ? missary , was a rather monotonous spot until her job opened up for her and she set forth to conquer it .
