THOUGH he knew that he was going to clic , Marmaduke Follett , as he lay in the hospital on the French coast , had never in his life been so happy . Lntil these last days he had not been able to feel it in its completeness . Of the great engagement where he had fallen he remembered only the overwhelming tmroar , the blood and mud ; and after that , torments , apathies , dim awakenings to the smell of ether and relapses to quieter sleep . Now the last operation had failed , ? or , rather , he had failed to recover from it , ? and there was no more hope for him ; but he hardly suffered and his thoughts were emerging into a world of cleanliness , kindness , and repose . The hospital , before the war , had been a big hotel , and his was one of the bedrooms on the second floor , its windows crossed by two broad blue bands of sea and sky . As an officer , he had a room to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his nurses ? both were pleasant girls , but this was the one who , with a wing of black hair curving under her cap , reminded him of his cousin Victoria  --  had put a glass of daffodils beside his bed ? not garden daffodils , but the wild ones that grow in woods ; and if she made him think of Victoria , how much more they made him think of the woods in spring at Channerley ! He was dying after a gallant deed . It was a fitting death for a Follett , and so little in his life had been at all fittedto that initial privilege : it was only in the manner of his death that his life matched at all those thoughts of Victoria and Channerley . He did not remember much of the manner ; it still remained cloaked in that overwhelming uproar ; but , as he lay there , he seemed to read , in the columns of the London papers , what all the Folletts were so soon to read ? because of him : ' His Majesty the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the under-mentioned officers , non-commissioned officers and men : ' Sec . Lt. Marmaduke Everard Follett . For most conspicuous bravery . He was directed with 50 men to drive the enemy from their trench , and under intense shell and machine-gun fire he personally led three separate parties of bombers against a captured 355 yards of trench ; attacking the machine-gun , shooting the firer with his revolver , and destroying gun and personnel with bombs . This very brave act saved many lives and ensured the success of the attack . In carrying one of his men back to safety , Sec . Lt. Follett was mortally wounded . ' He felt himself smile , as he soberly spaced it out , to remember that the youths at the office used to call him Marmalade . It was curious that he most felt his present , and his present transfigured self , when he thought of Cauldwell 's office , where so many years of his past , had been spent . When he thought of that , of the jocund youths , of the weary hours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he thought of the Folletts and of Channerley , to feel that he matched them ; it was , at last , to feel as if he had come home . What to the grimy , everyday world counted as transfiguration , counted as the normal , the expected , to the world of Channerley . He wondered , lying there and looking out past the daffodils , where Victoria was he had heard that she was nursing , too , somewhere in France ; and again , as he had smiled over the contrast of Sec . Lt. Marmaduke Everard Follett ' and the Marmalade ' of Cauldwell 's office , he smiled in thinking of the difference between Victoria and the nice young nurse who , for all her resembling curve of hair , was also second-rate . It would have been very wonderful to have been nursed by Victoria , and yet Isis thought turned from that . There had never been any sweetness , never even any kindness for him , in Victoria 's clear young gaze : when it came to nursing , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , the dull , submerged cousin ; and the nice though second-rate nurse was very kind . He would rather die under her eyes than under Victoria 's . And he would rather think of Victoria as he had last seen her at the big London dance to which , most unexpectedly , he had found himself asked last spring ? the spring before the war . He had decided , as with nervous fingers he tied his white cravat , ? how rarely disturbed was that neat sheaf lying in his upper drawer ! ? that he must have been confused with some other Follett , for he was so seldom asked anywhere , where he would be likely to meet Victoria . However , it was a delight to see her in her snowy dress , her beautiful hair bound with silver , and to feel , as he watched her dancing , that she belonged , in a sense , to him ; for he , too , was a Follett . How much more did she belong to him now ! And not only Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Folletts of past generations ; and Channerley , centre of all his aching , wistful memories . It had been for him , always , part of the very structure of his nature , that beautiful old house where he had spent his boyhood . Perhaps it was because he had been turned out of the nest so early that he never ceased to miss it . His thought , like a maimed fledgling , had fluttered round and round it , longing , exiled , helpless . If , now , he could have survived , his eldest brother , he felt sure , must have asked him oftener to stay at Channerley . It still gave him a pang , or , rather , the memory of many pangs , to recall that Robert had not asked him for two years , and had seemed to forget all about him after that . They had all seemed to forget about him , ? that was the trouble of it , ? and almost from the very beginning : Robert , who had Channerley ; Austin , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Griselda , married so splendidly up in her northern estate ; and Amy , the artistic bachelor-girl of the family , whom he associated with irony and cigarette-smoke and prolonged absences in Paris . Even cheerful Sylvia , of South Kensington , with her many babies and K.C. husband , whom he always thought of , for all her well-being , as very nearly as submerged as himself , ? even Sylvia saw little of him and asked him only to family dinners , ? Mr. Shilling-ton 's family , not hers , ? at depressingly punctual intervals . But Sylvia , the one nearest him in years , was the one who had forgotten least , and she had , after her fashion , done her best for him . Confused at study , clumsy at games , shy and tongue-tied , he had not in any way distinguished himself at a rather second-rate public school ; and to distinguish himself had been the only hope for him . The Folletts had never had any money to spare , and Eton and Oxford for Robert and Sandhurst for Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons who could not distinguish themselves were concerned . Still , he had always felt that , had his father lived , something better would have been found for him than to be bundled , through the instrumentality of Mr. Shillington , into a solicitor 's office . There he had been bundled , and there he had stuck for all these years , as clumsy , as confused as ever ; a pallid , insignificant little fellow ( oh , he had no illusions about himself ! ) , with the yellow hair and small yellow . moustache which , together with his name , had earned for him his sobriquet . They had not disliked him , those direfully facetious companions of his . Noblesse oblige was an integral part of his conception of himself , however little they might be aware of his unvarying courtesy toward them as its exercise . He suspected that they thought of him as merely inoffensive and rather piteous ; butshynessmightgive that impression ; they could not guess at the quiet aversion that it covered . He was aware sometimes , suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidelong glance at them , he most felt himself a Follett . If his mind , for most practical purposes , was slow and clumsy , it was sharp and swift in its perceptions . He judged the young men in Cauldwell 's office as a Follett must judge them . In the accurate applying of that standard he was as instinctively gifted as any of his race ; and if he knew , from his first look at her , that the nice young nurse was second-rate , how coldly and calmly , for all these years , he had known that the young men who ca.11ed him Marmalade were third-rate . And yet they none of them disliked him , and he wondered whether it was because , when he most felt disdain , he most looked merely timid , or because they recognized in him , all dimly as it might be , the firstrateness that was his inherently and inalienably . Just as the third-rate young men might recognize the first-rate but dimly , he was aware that to the world the Folletts , too , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of centuries of local lustre , to conjure with ; and he liked it all the better because of that . They had never , it was true , distinguished themselves ; but they were people of distinction , and that was , to his quiet , reflective savoring , an even higher state . He sometimes wondered if , in any of them , the centring of family consciousness was as intense as in himself . If they were aloof about third-rate people , it was not because they were really very conscious about themselves . They took themselves for granted , as they took Channerley and the family history ; and only Amy was aware that some of the family portraits were good . The history ? it was not of course accurate to call it that , yet it seemed more spacious and significant than mere annals ? pored over in long evenings , in faded parchments , deeds , and letters , was known in every least detail to him . How the Folletts had begun , very soberly but very decorously , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : rooting more deeply into their pleasant woodlands and meadows ; flowering , down the centuries , now in a type of grace ? that charming Antonia who had married so well at James the First 's court ; and of gallantry ? a Follett had fallen at Naseby , and a Follett had fought at Waterloo ; or of good-humored efficiency , as in the eighteenth-century judge and the nineteenth-century bishop . And he , who was neither graceful nor gallant nor good-humored ( sour and sad he felt himself ) , never could resist the warming , revivifying influence of these recognitions , stretching himself , sighing , smiling happily before his Bloomsbury fire on a winter 's evening , as he laid down the thick pile of yellowed manuscripts to think it all over and feel himself , in spite of everything , a link with it all . Robert had always been very decent about letting him have and keep the documents for as long as he liked . It ' vas strange to think that he was never to sec his Bloomsbury lodgings again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the thought ; for how , for years , he had hated them , place of exile , of relegation , as he had always felt them ! Yet he had come to be fond of his little sitting-room , just because , to his eye , with its mingled comfort and austerity , it was so significant of exile . If a Follett could n't have what he wanted , that was all he would have ? his rack of pipes , his shelves of books , his little collection of mostly marginless mezzotints ranged along the dark , green walls . The room was a refuge and did not pretend to be an achievement , and in that very fact might , to an eye as sharp as his for such significance , suggest the tastes that it relinquished . He had , indeed , all the tastes and none of the satisfactions of Channerley . There it was ; he had come back to it again , as , indeed , he had , in spirit , never left it ? never for a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French coast , with the soft spring sea lapping upon the beach under his window ? he felt himself drop , drop , softly , sweetly , deeply , back to his childhood . From his high nursery-window he saw the dewy tree-tops , ? the old hawthorn that grew so near the house , and the old mulberry , ? and the rooks wheeling on a spring sky so many years ago . The dogs , at that early hour , just released , might be racing over the lawns : idle , jovial Peter , the spaniel , and Jack , the plucky , hot-tempered little Dandy-Dinmont . Below the lawns were the high gray garden walls , and above , rising a little from the flagged rose-garden , were the woods where the daffodils grew , daffodils like those beside him now , tall and small , their pale , bright poetry set in warrior spears of green . Little bands of them ran out upon the lawn from under the great trees , and one saw their gold glimmering far , far among the woodlands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the age and youth , the smile and the security ! How he had always loved it , shambling about the woods and gardens ; creeping rather ? he always saw himself as creeping somehow ? about the dear , gay , faded house ! Always such an awkward , insignificant little boy ; even his dear old Nanna had felt dissatisfied with his appearance ; and he had always known it , when she sent him down with the others to the drawing-room ; and his mother , she had made it very apparent , had found him only that . He shrank from the thought of his mother ; perhaps it was because of her , of her vexed and averted eyes , her silken rustle of indifference as she passed him by , that he saw himself as creeping anywhere where she might come . He only remembered her in glimpses : languidly and ironically smiling at her tea-table ( Amy had her smile ) , the artificial tone of her voice had even then struck his boyish ear ; reading on a summer afternoon , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garden chair in the shade of the mulberry tree ; querulously arguing with his father , who , good-humored and very indifferent , strolled about the hall in his pink coat on a winter morning , waiting for the horses to be brought round ; his mother 's yellow braids shining under her neatly tilted riding-hat , her booted foot held to the blaze of the great log-fire . A hard , selfish , sentimental woman ; and ? was n't it really the only word for what he felt in her ? ? just a little shoddy . He distinguished it from the second-rate nicely : it was a more personal matter ; for his mother , though certainly not a Follett , was of good stock ; he knew , of course , all about her stock . It always grieved him to think that it was from her he had his yellow hair and the pale gray of his eyes ; his stature , too , for she had been a small woman ; 811 the other Folletts were tall ; but she had given him nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was glad of it . It was curious , since he had really had so little to do with him , as little , almost , as with his mother , how blissfully his sense of his father 's presence pervaded his childish memories . He was so kind . The kindest thing he remembered at Channerley , except his dear old Nanna and Peter the spaniel . It used to give him a thrill of purest joy when , meeting him , his father , his hands clasped behind his back after his strolling wont , would stop and bend amused and affectionate eyes upon him ; rather the eyes , to be sure , that he bent upon his dogs ; but Marmaduke always felt of him that he looked upon his children , and upon himself , too , as parts of the pack ; and it was delightful to be one of the pack , with him . Well , old fellow , and how goes the world with you to-day ? ' his father would say . And after that question the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had his father lived , he would never have been so forgotten ; just as he had always believed that his father would never have allowed one of his pack to be bundled into a solicitor 's office . For that he had to thank , he felt sure , not only Sylvia 's negative solicitude , but his mother 's active indifference . Between them both they had done it to him . And he never felt so to the full his dispossession as in thinking of Robert . He had always intensely feared and admired Robert . He did not know what he feared , for Robert was never unkind . But Robert was everything that he was not : tall and gay and competent , and possessing everything needful , from the very beginning , for the perfect fulfilment of his type . The difference between them had been so far more than the ten years that had made of Robert a man when inc was still only a little boy . There had been , after all , a time when they had been a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in between ; yet the link had seemed always to break down after Austin . Robert , in this retrospect , had always the air of strolling away from him ? for Robert , too , was a stroller . Not that he himself had had the air of pursuit ; he had never , he felt sure , from the earliest age , lacked tact ; tact and reticence and self-effacement had been hired into him . But his relationship with Robert had seemed always to consist in standing there , hiding ruefulness , and gazing at Robert 's strolling back . The difference with Austin had perhaps been as great , but it had never hurt so much , for Austin , though with his share of the Follett charm , had never had the charm of Robert . A clear-voiced and clear-eyed , masterful boy , Austin 's main contact with others was in doing things with them , and that sort of contact did not mean congeniality . Austin had made use of him ; had let him hold his ferrets and field for him at cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the time being , bore one . But he had bored Robert always ? that was apparent ; and beautiful Griselda , who was older than either of them , and Amy , who was younger . Griselda had gazed rather sadly over his head ; and Amy had smiled and teased him so that he had seldom ventured on a remark in her presence . Even fat little Sylvia , the baby , had always preferred any of the others to him as she grew up ; had only not been bored because , while she was good-humored , she was also rather dull . And at the bottom of his heart , rueful always , sore , and still patiently surprised , he knew that , while he found them all a little brutal , he could not admire them the less because of it . It was part of the Follett inheritance to be able to be brutal , unconsciously , and therefore with no loss of bloom . And now , at last , he was not to bore them any longer ; at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he not be happy , ? it brought back every blissful thrill of boyhood , his father 's smile , the daffodil woods in spring , heightened to ecstasy , ? when he had at last made of himself one of the Folletts who were remembered ? He would have his place in the history beside the Follett who fell at Naseby . No family but is glad of a V.C. in its pages . They could no longer stroll away . They would be proud of him ; he had done something for all the Folletts forever . The nice young II nurse came in . She closed the door gently , and , with her smile , calm before accustomed death , and always , as it were , a little proud of him , ? that was because they were both English , ? she took his wrist and felt his pulse , holding her watch in the other hand , and asked him , presently , how he felt . Only after that did she say , contemplating him for a moment , ? Marmaduke wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was giving him to live , ' A gentleman has come to see you . You may see him if you like . But I ' ye told him that he is only to stay for half an hour . ' The blood flowed up to Marmaduke 's forehead . He felt it beating hard in his neck and behind his ears , and his heart thumped down there under the neatly drawn bed-clothes . A gentleman ? What 's his name ? ' Was it Robert ? Here is his card , ' said the nurse . She drew it from her pocket and gave it to him . It could n't have been Robert , of course . Robert would only have had to come up . Yet he was dizzy with the disappointment . It was as if he saw Robert strolling away for the last time . He would never see Robert again . Mr. Guy Thorpe was the name . The address was a London club that Marmaduke placed at once as second-rate , and ' The Beeches , Arlington Road , ' in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat scholarly hand : ' May I see you ? We are friends . ' It was difficult for a moment to feel anything but the receding tide of his hope . The next thing that came was a sense of dislike for Mr. Guy Thorpe and for the words that he had written . Friends ? By what right , since he did not know his name ? ' Is he a soldier ? ' he asked . ' How did he come ? I do n't know him . ' You need n't see him unless you want to , ' said the nurse . No ; he 's not a soldier . An elderly man . He 's driving a motor for the French Wounded Emergency Fund , and came on from the Alliance because he heard that you were here . Perhaps he 's some old family friend . He spoke as if he were . ' Marmaduke smiled a little . ' That 's hardly likely . But I 'll see him , yes ; since he came for that . ' When she had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . A flock of sea-gulls flew past ? proud , swift , and leisurely , glittering in the sun . They seemed to embody the splendor and exultation of his thoughts , and , when they had disappeared , he was sorry , almost desolate . Mr. Guy Thorpe . He took up the card again in his feeble hand and looked at it . And now , dimly , it seemed to remind him of something . Steps approached along the passage , the nurse 's light foot-fall and the heavier , careful tread of a man . An oddly polite , almost a deprecating tread . He had gone about a great many hospitals and was cautious not to disturb wounded men . Yet Marmaduke felt again that he did not like Mr. Guy Thorpe , and as they came in , he was conscious of feeling a little frightened . There was nothing to frighten one in Mr. Thorpe 's appearance . He was a tall , thin , ageing man , travel-worn , in civilian clothes , with a dingy Red-Cross badge on the sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to blink toward the bed , and , as if with motoring in the wind , his eyelids were moist and reddened . He sat down , murmuring some words of thanks to the nurse . A very insignificant man , for all his height and his big forehead . Altogether of The Beeches , Arlington Road . Had he turned gray , he might have looked less shabby ; but dark thin locks still clustered above his high crown and behind his long-lobed ears . His eyes were dark , his moustache drooped , and he had a small , straight nose . Marmaduke saw that he was the sort of man who , in youth , might have been considered very handsome . He looked like a seedy poet and some sort of minor civil servant mingled , the civil servant having got the better of the poet . Marmaduke also imagined that he would have a large family and a harassed but ambitious wife , with a genteel accent ? a wife a little below himself . His tie was of a dull red silk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if cautiously , to see if the nurse had closed the door , and then , it was really as if more cautiously still , looked at Marmaduke , slightly moving back his chair . ' I 'm very grateful to you , very grateful indeed , ' he said in a low voice , for seeing me . ' You 've cornea long way , ' said Marmaduke . Yes . A long way . I had heard of your being here . I hoped to get here . I felt that I must see you . We are all proud of you ; more proud than I can say . ' He looked down now at the motoring-cap he held , and Marmaduke became aware that the reddened eyes were still more suffused and that the mouth under the drooping moustache twitched and trembled . He could think of nothing to say , except to murmur something about being very glad ? though he did n't want to say that ; and he supposed , to account for Mr. Thorpo 's emotion , that he must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dying . You don ' t remember my name , I suppose , ' said Mr. Thorpe after a moment , in which he frankly got out his handkerchief and wiped his eyes . ' No , I 'm afraid I do n't , ' said Marmaduke very politely . He was glad to say this . It was the sort of thing he did want to say . Yet I know yours very , very well , ' said Mr. Thorpe , with a curious watery smile . ' I lived at Channerley once . I was tutor there for some time ? to Robert , your brother , and Griselda . Yes , ' Mr. Thorpe nodded , ' I know the Folletts well : and Channerley , the dear old place . ' Now the dim something in memory pressed forward , almost with a physical advance , and revealed itself as sundry words scratched on the schoolroom window-panes and sundry succinct drawings in battered old Greek and Latin grammars . Robert had always been very clever at drawing , catching with equal facility and accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human profile . What returned to Marmaduke now , and as clearly as if he had the fly-leaf before him , was a tiny thumb-nail sketch of such a galloping horse unseating a lank , crouching figure , of whom the main indications were the angles of acute uncertainty taken by the knees and elbows ; and a more elaborate portrait , dashed and dotted as if with a ruthless boyish grin ? such an erect and melancholy head it was , so dark the tossed-back locks , so classical the nose and unclassical the moustache , and a brooding eye indicated in a triangular sweep of shadow . Beneath was written in Robert 's clear , boyish hand , Mr. Guy Thorpe , Poet , Philosopher and Friend . Vale . ' Even the date flashed before him , 1880 ; and with it , strange , inappropriate association ? the daffodils running Out upon the lawn , as no doubt he had seen them as he leaned from the schoolroom window , with the Greek grammar under his elbow on the sill . ' So that was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ? poor dear ! He felt suddenly quite kindly toward him , quite touched by his act of loyalty to the old allegiance in coming ; and flattered , too , ? yes , even by Mr. ' Thorpe , ? that he should be so recognized as a Follett who had done something for the name ; and smiling very benevolently upon him , he said , ' Oh , of course ; I remember perfectly 110W - your name , and drawings of you in old schoolbooks , you know . All tutors and governesses get those trib utes from their pupils , do n't they ? But I myself could n't remember , could I ? for it was before I was born that you were at Channerley . ' There was a moment of silence after this , and in it Marmaduke felt that Mr. Thorpe did not like being so placed . He had no doubt imagined that there would be less ambiguous tributes , awl that his old pupils would have talked of him to the younger generation . And something of this chagrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking round at the daffodils , he said , Yes , yes . Quite true . No , of course you could n't yourself remember . I was more though , I think I may fairly say , than the usual tutor or governess . I came , rather , at Sir Robert 's instance . ' ? Sir Robert was Marina-duke 's father . ? We had met , made friends , at Oxford ; his former tutor there was an uncle of mine , and Sir Robert , in my undergraduate days , used to visit him sometimes . He was very keen on getting me to comm . Young Robert wanted something of a firm hand . I was the friend rather than the mere man of books in the family . ' Poet , Philosopher and Friend ' ? Marmaduke had it almost on his lips , and almost with a laugh , his benevolence deepened for poor Mr. Thorpe , so self-revealed , so entirely Robert 's portrait of him . Amusing to think that even the quite immature first-rate can so relegate the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Mr. Thorpe third . The Folletts would not be likely to choose a third-rate man for a tutor ; second was kinder , and truer . He had , obviously , come down in the world . ' I see . It 's natural I never heard , though : there 's such a chasm between the elders and the youngers in a big family , is n't there ? ' he said . ' Griselda is twelve years older than I am , and Robert ten , you remember . She was married by the time I began my Greek . You never came back to Channerley , did you ? I hope things have gone well with you since those days ? ' He questioned , wanting to be very kind ; wanting to give something of the genial impression of his father smiling , with his , ' And how goes the world with you to-day ? ' But he saw that , while Mr. Thorpe 's evident emotion deepened , it was with a sense of present grief as well as of retrospective pathos . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I passed by : I never came to stay . I went abroad ; I traveled , with a pupil , for some years before my marriage . ' Grief and confusion were oddly mingled in his drooping face . ' And after that ? life had changed too much . My dear old friend Sir Robert had died . I could not have faced it all . No , no ; when some chapters are read , it is better to close the book ; better to close the book . But I have never forgotten Channerley , nor the Folletts of Channerley ; that will always remain for me the golden page ; the page , ' said Mr. Thorpe , glancing round again at the daffodils , ' of friendship , of youth , of daffodils in spring-time . I saw you there , ' he added suddenly , ' once , when you were a very little lad . I saw you . I was passing by ; bicycling ; no time to stop . You remember the high road skirts the woods to the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there you were ? in your holland pinafore and white socks ? digging up the daffodils and putting them into your little red-and-yellow cart . A beautiful spring morning . The woods full of sunshine . You would n't remember . ' But he did remember ? perfectly . Not having been seen , but the day ; the woods ; the daffodils . He had dug them up to plant in his own little garden , down below . He had always been stupid with his garden ; had always failed where the others succeeded . And he had wanted to be sure of daffodils . And they had all laughed at him for wanting the wild daffodils like that for himself , and for going to get them in the wood . And why had Mr. Thorpe looked over the wall and not come in ? He hated to think that he had been watched on that spring morning ? hated it . And , curiously , that sense of fear with which he had heard the approaching footsteps returned to him . It frightened hint that Mr. Thorpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinking were perhaps apparent in his face , for it was with a change of tone and hastiness of utterance , as though hurrying away from something , that Mr. Thorpe went on : ' You see , ? it 's been my romance , always , Channerley ? and all of you . I 've always followed your lives ? always ? from a distance ? known what you were up to . I 've made excuses to myself ? in the clays when I used to go a good deal about the country ? to pass by Channerley and just have a glimpse of you . And when I heard that you had done this noble deed , ? when I heard what you had done for England , for Channerley , for us all , ? I felt I had to come and see you . You must forgive me if I seem a more intruder . I ca n't seem that to myself . I 've cared ' too muds . And what I came for , really , was to thank you , ? to thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that because of you , life must be nobler , always , for all of us . ' His words had effaced the silly , groping fear . It was indeed , since his colonel 's visit , the first congratulation he had had from the outer world . The nurses , of course , had congratulated him , and the surgeons ; but no one who knew him outside ; the kindly telegrams from Robert and Sylvia did not count as congratulations . And in a way poor Mr. Thorpe did know him , and though it was only from him , it had its sweetness . He felt himself flush as he answered , That 's very kind of you . ' ' Oh , no ! ' said Mr. Thorpe , shaking his head and swinging his foot ? Marmaduke knew that from the queer movement of his body as he sat with very tightly folded arms . ' Not kind ! That ' s not the word ? from us to you ! Not the word at all ! ' I 'm very happy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happy again , and glad to share his happiness with poor Mr. Thorpe . ' It makes everything worth while , does n't it , to have brought it off at all ? ' Everything , everything ? it would ; it would , to you . So heroes feel , ' said Mr. Thorpe . To give your life for England . I know it all ? in every detail . Yes , you are happy in dying that England may live . Brave boy ! Splendid boy ! ' Now he was weeping . He had out his handkerchief and his shoulders shook . It made Marmaduke want to cry , too , and he wondered confusedly if the nurse would soon come back . Had not the half hour passed ? Really ? it ' s too good of you . You must n't , you know ; you must n't , ' he murmured , while the word , ' boy ? boy , ' repeated , made tangled images in his mind , and he saw himself in the white socks and with the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day , leading his men , his revolver in his hand and the bullets flying about him . ' And I 'm not a boy , ' he said ; ' I ' m thirty-four ; absurdly old to be only a second lieutenant . And there are so many of us . Why , ' ? the thought came fantastically , but he seized it , because Mr. Thorpe was crying so and he must seize something , ? ' we 're as common as daffodils ! ' Ah ! not for me ! not for me ! ' Mr. Thorpe gulped quickly . Something had happened to him . Something had given way in him ? as if the word daffodils ' had pressed a spring . He was sobbing aloud , and he had fallen on his knees by the bed and put up his hand for Marmaduke 's . ' I can not keep it from you ! Not at this last hour ! Not when you are leaving me forever ! ? My son ! My brave son ! I am your father , Marmaduke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ! ' It was the stillest room . The two calm bands of blue crossed the window . In the sunlight the gulls came flying back . Marmaduke looked out at them . Were they the same sea-gulls or another flock ? Then quietly he closed his eyes . Stillness ? calm . But something else was rising to him from them . Darkness ; darkness ; a darkness worse than death . Oh ! death was sweet compared to this . Compared to this all his life had been sweet ; and something far dearer than life was being taken from him . He only knew the terrible confusion of his whole nature . He opened his eyes again with an instinctof escape . There were the bands of blue , and , still passing in their multitudes , leaving him forever , the proud , exultant sea-gulls . The man still knelt beside him . He heard his own voice come : ' What do you mean ? ' ' I never meant to tell you ! I never meant to tell you ! ' a moan answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? dying ! ? my son ! ? who has given his life for England ! ? And how I have longed for you for all these years ! ? My romance , Marmaduke ? How could I be silent ? Forgive me ! Forgive me , my boy . Yes , mine . My known children are dear to me , but how far dearer the unknown son , seen only by stealth , in snatched glimpses ! It is true , Marmaduke , true . We were leven . She loved me . Do not ask . Do not question . We were young . She was very beautiful . It was spring-time ; daffodils were in the woods . She said that she had never known anyone like me . She said that her life was hollow , meaningless . I opened doors to her . I read to her . Browning ? I read Browning , ' he muttered on , ' in the woods ; among the daffodils . It was a new life to her ? and to me . And we were swept away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrong , there was great beauty ? then . Only then , for after , she was cruel ? very cruel . She turned from me ; she crushed and tore my heart . Oh ! ? I have suffered ! But no one knew . No one ever dreamed of it . Only she and I. My God ! ? I see her in your hair and eyes ! ' It was true . It was absolutely true . Through his whole being he felt its inevitability . Everything was clear , with a strange , black , infernal clearness . Ills life lay open before him , open from beginning to end : that beginning of tawdry sentiment and shame ? with daffodils ; and this end , with daffodils again , and again with tawdry sentiment and shame . He was not a Follett . He had no part in the Folletts . He had no part in Channerley . He was an interloper , a thief . He was the son of this wretched man , in whose very grief he could detect the satisfaction ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? of his claim upon a status above his own . Ile was all that he had always most despised , a second-rate , a third-rate little creature ; the anxious , civil:shrinking Marmalade of Cauldwell 's office . Why ( as the hideous moments led him on , point by point , his old lucidity , sharpened to a needle fineness , seemed to etch the truth in lines of fire upon the blackness ) , had n't he always been a pitiful little snob ? Was n't it of the essence of a snob to over-value the things one had n't and to fear the things one was ? It had n't been other people , it had been himself , what he really was , of whom he had always been afraid . He saw himself reduced to the heretofore unrecognized , yet always operative , element in his own nature ? a timid , watchful humility . Oh , Channerley ! Channerley ! The wail rose in his heart and it filled the world . Oh , his woods , his daffodils , his father 's smile ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smirched , withered , desecrated ! A hideous gibbering of laughter seemed to rise around him , and pointing fingers . Amy 's eyes passed with another malice in their mockery ; and Robert would never turn to him now , and Griselda would never look at him . He saw it all , as they would never see it . He was not one of them , and they had always felt it ; and oh , ? above all , ? he had always felt it . And now , quite close it seemed , softly rustling , falsely smiling , moved his loathsome mother : not only as he remembered her in her youth , but in her elegant middle years , as he had last seen her , with hard eyes and alien lips and air of brittle , untouched exquisiteness . Suddenly fury so mounted in him that he saw himself rising in bed , rending his dressings , to seize the kneeling man by the throat and throttle him . He could see his fingers sinking in on either side among the clustered hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How dare you ! You hound ! You sniveling , sneaking hound ! You look for pity from me , do you ! ? and tenderness ! Well , take this , this ! Everything , everything I am and have that 's worth being and having , I owe to them . I 've hated you and all you mean , always ? yes , your fear and your caution and your admiration and your great high forehead . Oh , I see it ! I see it ! ? it ' s my own ! And though I am only that in myself , then take it from me that I hate myself along with you and curse myself with you ! ' It came to him that he was slowly panting , and that after the fever-fury an icy chill crept over him . And a slow , cold smile came with it , and Ile saw Jephson , the wit of the office , wagging his head and saying , ' Little Marmalade take a man by the throat ! Ask me another ! ' No ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought he was a Follett . Was that what it all Caine to , really ? Something broke and stopped in his mind . He heard his father 's voice . How long ago it had all happened . He had known for years , had n't he , that this was his father . Marmaduke ! Mr. Follett ! What have I done ? Shall I call somebody ? Oh , forgive me ! ' His father was standing now beside him and bending over him . He looked up at him and shook his head . He did not want anyone to come . Oh what have I done ? ' the man repeated . ' I was dying anyway , you know , ' he heard himself say . What a pitiful face it was , this weary , loosened , futureless old face ! What a frightened face ! What long years of slow disgarnishing lay behind it : youth , romance , high hopes , all dropped away . He had come to-day with their last vestiges , still the sentimental , romancing fool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was beaten , at last , down into the very ground . It was a haggard , humiliated , frightened face , and miserable . As he himself had been . But not even death lay before this face . For how many years must it go on sinking down until the earth covered it ? Marmaduke seemed to understand all about him , as well as if he had been himself . Sit down , ' he said . He heard that his voice was gentle , though he was not aware of feeling anything , only of understanding . ' I was rather upset . No ; I do n't want anyone . Of course I forgive you . Do n't bother about it , I beg . ' His father sat clown , keeping his swollen eyes on the motoring-cap which , unseeingly , he turned and turned in his hands . Tell me about yourself a little , ' said Marmaduke , with the slow , spaced breaths . ' Where do you live ? How ? Are you fairly happy ? ' He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like most people with whom life had not succeeded , often imagine himself so , and Marmaduke wanted to help him , if possible , to imagine it . ' I live near London . I used to do a good deal of University Extension lecturing . I 've a clerkship in the Education Office now . ' Mr. Thorpe spoke in a dead , obedient voice . ' A small salary , not much hope of advance ; and I 've a large family . It ' s rather up-hill , of course . But I 've good children ; clever children . My eldest boy ' s at Oxford ; he took a scholarship at Westminster ; and my eldest girl 's at Girton . The second girl , Winnie , has a very marked gift for painting ; she is our artist ; we 're going to send her to the Slade next year when she leaves the High School . Good children . I 've nothing to complain of . ' So you 're fairly happy ? ' Marmaduke repeated . Oddly , he felt himself comforted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing about Winnie , her father 's favorite . Happy ? Well , just now , with this terrible war , one ca n't be that , can one ? It is a great adventure for me , however , this work of mine , motoring about France . I do n't think I 've ever done anything I cared so much about since ? for years , ' said Mr. Thorpe . ' It 's a beautiful country , is n't it ? and the soldiers are such splendid fellows ! One gets a lot out of it . But happy ? No , I do n't suppose I am . I 'm pretty much of a failure , and I started life with great imaginings about myself . One does n't get over that sort of disappointment ; one never really gets over it in a way . ' Mr. Thorpe was looking at him now , and it was as if there were a kindliness between them . ' Things have been rather gray and disagreeable on the whole , ' he said . They can be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marmaduke , closing his eyes . He was very tired , and as he lay there quietly , having nothing further to know or to suffer , having reached the very limits of conscious dissolution , something else began to come to him . It seemed horn of the abolition of self and of the acceptance of the fact that he was dead to all that had given life , worth or beauty . It would have been very good to be a Follett , though ; he saw it now , he had over-prized that special sort of goodness ? with so much else from which he had been , as ' really , shut out ; but he was not a Follett ; nor was he merely this poor , insignificant father . He did not quite make out in what the difference lay and he did not rejoice in it , for there was no rejoicing left in him . But , even if the difference were only an acquired instinct ( dimly the terms of his complacent readings in biology and sociology returned to him ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transmissible , it was , all the same , his own possession ; something that he and the Folletts had made together ; so that it was as true to say that he had won the V.C. as to say that they had . The lessened self that was left to him had still its worth . To see the truth , even if it undid one , was worthy ; to see so unwaveringly that it was good to be a Follett even when one was n't one , had the elements of magrot .. ha : - NO. 2 nanimity ; and to accept the fact of being second-rate proved , did it not ? ? if one still cared to prove it ; he felt himself smile as gently at the relinquished self as he had smiled at his father , ? that one was not merely second-rate . There was now a sound of stumbling movement ; doors opening and shutting , nurses , surgeons in the room ; and his father 's face , far away , against the blue bands , looking at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile at him and to say , It 's all right . Quite all right . ' At all events he had been decent to the poor old fellow . His thoughts came brokenly , but he was still seeing something , finding something ; it was like a soft light growing . At all events , he had behaved as a Follett would wish to behave even when brought to such a pass . No ? but it was n't quite that , either ; it was something new . He had behaved as anyone decent should wish to behave . And the daffodils glimmering to his vision seemed to light him further still . ' We are as common as daffodils , ' came back to him . Daffodils were for everybody . Foolish little boy who , on the distant spring morning in the woods of Channerley , dug them up to take them to his own garden ! He was there among them with his little red-and-yellow cart , and the thrush was singing high above him , in the rosy topmost branches of an elm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOW the sunshine streamed among them ! Dear Channerley , ' he thought . For again he seemed to belong there . Gentle hands were tending him and , as he turned his cheek on the pillow , it was with the comfort ? almost that of the little boy at Channerley being tucked up in the warm nursery to go to sleep ? of knowing that he was dying , and that , in spite of everything . he had given something to the name .
