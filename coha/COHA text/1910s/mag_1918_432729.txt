Few American women of to-day know of Mrs. Samuel Ripley , but a sentence from Senator Hoar 's Autobiography will give her a favorable introduction : ' She was one of the most wonderful scholars of her time , or indeed of any time . President Everett said she could fill any professor 's chair at . Harvard . ' To this we may add the testimony of Professor Child , whose authority no one will question : ' The most learned woman I have ever known , the most diversely learned perhaps of her time , and not inferior in this respect , I venture to say , to any woman of any age . ' It seems worth while to know a little more about her , does it not ? Prom her childhood she had a passion for books and study . Every available minute was snatched for them , and some that were not available . ' I never go to Boston or anywhere else , my passion for reading increasing inversely with time , ' she writes when little more than a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was growing up , New England was not very favorable to the education of girls ? nor was any other place . But she was fortunate in having a father ? Captain Bradford of Duxbury ? who was a scholar as well as a sea-captain , and who loved her and liked to indulge her fancies . ' Father , may I study Latin ? ' she asked him . ' Latin ! A girl study Latin ! Certainly . Study anything you like . ' Whereupon she compares him , greatly to his advantage , with another father who endeavored to convince his daughter that ' all knowledge , except that of domestic affairs , appears unbecoming in a female . ' Becoming or not , all knowledge was acceptable to her . She studied Latin until she could read it like a modern tongue , Greek the same , also French , German , and Italian . She did this largely alone , German without any assistance whatever , persisting incredibly , ' working still at an abominable language without being sensible of the least progress , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her coal for mathematics and philosophy Was fully equal . Most of all , perhaps , she loved the sciences ; and chemistry , astronomy , and especially botany , were a delight to her from youth to age . Nor did she take her study of languages as a task simply , as an end in itself , as so many do . It was but a means , a greater facility for getting at t he thoughts of wise men and past ages . She read Latin and Greek widely as well as thoroughly . Tacitus and Juvenal must have furnished odd reflection for a schoolgirl , and it is not every infant of fourteen who regales her imagination with the novels of Voltaire . Naturally such solitary reading in a child of that age had something academic about it , and the intellectual enthusiasm of her early letters abounds in pleasing suggestions of copy-book moralities . Yet the keen , vigorous insight often breaks through , even here .

' Pretty well for a girl of sixteen ! And though she studied rules and learned traditions , and so early laid over her spirit a mighty mass of authority , she did not propose to be in any way a slave to it . When rules vex her , she cries out against them . For instance , she could never spell , and why should she ? ' I wish the-free spirit were not trammeled by these confounded rules . ' Also , while she studies for study 's sake , and could hardly be expected , in the early days , to interest herself too much in the why of it , you get singular hints of penetration where you least look for them . She asks herself whether her devotion to the Classics springs ' from pride ' of learning in your humble servant or intrinsic merit in Cicero , Virgil , and Tacitus . ' The question is one that many an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all , in the line of religious speculation that one examines most curiously Sarah 's gradual change from a conventional acceptance of what is taught her to fierce , independent thinking for herself . She was brought up on by no means narrow lines of orthodoxy . But in her early letters there is a serious and earnest acceptance of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity and a loyal effort to apply them practically . Gradually this unquestioning submission yields to the steady en . croachment of the spirit of inquiry , the dread of enthusiasm , of the mind 's he-coming enslaved to a system perhaps erroneous , and shut forever against the light of truth . ' With the process or years the emancipation grows more marked , until little of the old faith is left but the unfailing habit of its good- Do not , however , for a moment suppose that this studious and thoughtful childhood was altogether lost in bookishness , that Sarah was , in youth or in age , a stuffy pedant . She was never that in the least , at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . She was at all points an energetic , practical , efficient , common-sense human being . She did not indeed have the eager life of sport and diversion that the girl of to-day has . No girl had it then . There was no tennis or basketball , not even skating , or swimming , or riding . TheAe things would not have been ladylike , if they had been possible . Instead of them , there were only long walks in the Duxbury woods and the rich , wholesome flavor of the New England autumn : ' The great pear tree at the gate , full of orange pears ; the ground strewed with golden high-tops ; the girl in the corn-barn paring apples to dry ; the woods filled with huckleberries . ' Also , there were the pressing cares of daily life , where mouths were many and means were little . Sarah had her full share of these and met them with swift and adequate efficiency . It is true , she groans sometimes over that dreadful ironing day , ' and rebels a lit/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat is to be dissected , ' interferes with letters filled with Greek poets and Roman historians . But she comes right down to earth and stays there , heats the irons , dissects the meat , sweeps the parlor , at proper times takes an apparently absorbed interest in shopping and ribbons and furbelows , as a normal girl should . Even her a.bstruser preoccupations are put to practical use . The oldest of a large fmily , she imparts her own acquirements to those who conic after her , not making any one the scholar she herself was , but giving them all an education exceptional in that clay or any clay . Also , site gave them more than book-education ; for the early death of her mother left her at the head of the household , and she attended to every duty as if her beloved ' looks did not exist at all . Nor was she moved by the sense of duty only , Mit by tenderness and affection , as appears charmingly in the words written by her father to her mother from over-sea : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) that I thank her with my tears which flow best as I now write and think of her good behavior , her virtues , her filial piety . ' To which let one add these further words of her father , which show that she was a live , flesh-and-blood girl and not a mere copy-book model : ' You I hope are skipping , jumping , dancing , and running up and clown in Boston . This I know you are doing if you are well , for you are always on the wing . ' Souls that skip and dance and are always on the wing usually have the elements of sociability in them . In her youth , as later , Sarah was popular and beloved by those who knew her . She me NO. a had a singular charm of simplicity and grace , and if she was aroused and interested , she had that social attraction which comes when quick words spring from vivid and eager thoughts . At the same time , she never sought the world and often shunned it . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them when possible . Trivial social occasions were to be avoided on principle : ' I dO not intend to give up all society ; I intend only to relinquish that from which I can gain no good . ' Moreover , she was naturally shy and self-conscious , doubted her own powers of conversation and entertainment , her own instinct of behavior in company . A dread of impropriety , she says , is the plague of her life . And again , ' I should have exerted myself more , but I believe I shall never learn to talk . ' She was a close analyst of her sensations and experiences with others as well as alone , and this is not a temper favorable to complete social enjoyment . The hearts of those about her she read with h equal keenness ? a habit also not . always socially fortunate . She would not for the world have hurt the feelings of a single human being ; and when she reproaches herself with talking scandal , we know that it is such scandal as one might expect front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw men and women as they are , and this , alas , in our mingled life , is too often to appear ill-natured . Therefore site turned from men and women to books and thoughts . Which does not mean that she had not kindly affections , deep and tender and lasting . Here also the sharp probe of her analysis intrudes itself . To her dearest friend she says , I love you as much as I ant capable of loving any one ' ; and later in life she observes , ' I have learned by experience that friendship is a plant that must be watered and nursed or it withers . ' But these self-doubting loves often are the tenderest and truest , and Sarah 's devotion to those for whom she really cared was as sincere as it was lasting . With a humility as touching as her independence , she writes to one of them , You are the only person who ever thought me of any consequence and I ant pretty well convinced that other folks are more than half right . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . ' These words were written to that singular personage , Mary Moody Emerson , aunt of Ralph Waldo and half-sister of Samuel Ripley , whom Sarah afterwards married . The friendship between these ladies was close and warm , and Mrs. Ripley always spoke of Miss Emerson with the greatest esteem . But one even nearer to her was Miss Allyn , later Mrs. Francis , and the long series of letters that passed between them is delightful in its simplicity , its cordiality , its curious revelation of two pure and sympathetic spirits . What an odd mixture it presents of common daily interests , of religious aspiration , of intellectual enthusiasm . New bonnets , old prayers , botany , chemistry , Homer and Tacitus jostle each other on the same page with quite transparent genuineness and charm . The one topic supposed to-be most common in young ladies ' letters , that is , young men and their doings and their attentions , is quite absent here . The truth is , Sarah was not concerned with such things . There is no evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she was twenty-five years old , she married Mr. Ripley . She did not pretend that it was a marriage of love on her side . She had the greatest respect for her husband , who was a clergyman of high and noble character in every way . Her father was anxious for the match , and she yielded to persuasion . But at the time a life of solitary study seemed to her preferable , as she frankly admits The words with which she announced her engagement , in writing to Miss Emerson , are curiously characteristic : ' Your family have probably no idea what trouble they may be entailing on themselves ; I make no promises of good behaviour , but knowing my tastes and habits they must take the consequences upon themselves . ' After which , it need merely be added that there never was a more devoted and affectionate wife . I ant going to pass at once from Mrs Ripley in youth to Mrs. Ripley in age . because in fairness I should end with the ripe splendor of her middle years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier and later periods , but little between , when she was too occupied and too active to write . In age as in youth her spirit was pure , lofty , and serene ; but with her temperament it was natural that the sadness of age should he peculiarly apparent . The poignancy of the contrast can not be better illustrated than by two very beautiful passages , written fifty years apart . In the buoyancy of early days she writes , ' A light breakfast and a ride into town in the cool morning air . stretched my existence through eternity . I lived ages in an hour . ' The tottering limbs and broken thoughts of after years recall a dim echo of these raptures , how far , how very far away . ' I took a walk in the pine grove near the cemetery , yesterday morning , and crept down the hill into a deep ravine we used to call the bowl , covered with decayed leaves , where we used to play tea with acorns for fairy cups ; the acorns anal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . ' It is in this older period of her life that the impression of Mrs. Ripley 's personal appearance survives with most of those who have told us anything about her career . It is not said that even in youth she was especially beautiful ; but in youth as in age there must have been the suggestion of earnest purity and dignity , so marked in all the likenesses of her that remain . Iler features arc calm , thoughtful , noble , sympathetic , but with a hint of the sadness of one who has long meditated on life with vast comprehension and limited hope . This impression of sadness is undeniably prominent in the numerous letters of her later years . ' Sorrow , not hope , ' she says , is the color of old age . ' Her sorrow never has the taint of petulance or pitiful complaining . It is even penetrated with a sweet kindliness which often amounts to sunshine . But the sorrow is there , deeply motived and all-pervading . To her clear vision it seems that all things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The contact with her fellows bad never been the chief thing in her life . Now the few she loved are gone or going , and the many who used to excite a vague curiosity have such dif-. ferent ways and thoughts that she can hardly understand them any more . Her last years were passed in the Manse , at Concord , the dwelling of her husband 's forefathers . The Manse was then , as it has always been , widely hospitable , and the hurry of eager feet often passed her threshold and the door of her quiet chamber . She listened to it with sympathetic tenderness , but her interest faded with the fading years . Religion ? Religion had melted for her into a great love . But of active beliefs she cherished few or none . The days of strenuous thought and fierce probing of impenetrable secrets were over . She would gladly put aside the little child 's questions , if she could have the little child 's peace . ' How well it is that the world is so large , that lichens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as sermons for those that like them . ' Newspapers ? She had rarely read them in her most active days . She could find little interest in them now . Even the turbulence of the Civil War touched her but slightly . Site had drunk deep of the horrors of the past and hated them . Why should she revive their torment in the present ? The war , she writes , ' sits on me as a nightmare . ' But like a night-. mare , she shakes it off when she can . Study ? Aim , that alone is still real , as always . And she would have echoed the phrase that Sainte-Beuve loved , ' On se lasso de tout excepte de coinprendre . ' ' Thank Heaven , ' site says , ' I led a lonely life of study in my youth and return to its rest with satisfaction . ' The books on her shelves are friends and companions who will not desert . her . ' When I am alive I hold audience with Plato , and when I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She learns Spanish by herself at seventy and reads Don Quixote with relish , complaining only that the pronunciation is beyond her . Yet , after all , even books afford but a pale consolation , when life is behind instead of before . And in a dull , dark moment she confesses that she reads mainly to kill time . As the years grow shorter and the hours longer , the one thing that she falls back upon more and more is the affections of the home . Her memory fails her , her great mental powers no longer sustain her . But , in noting this , she observes , with touching pathos , ' I may be childish , but there are no limits to love . ' In her active years she had never depended upon those around her for comfort or for diversion . To her sister-in-law , who remarked that she was contented only when she had all her children in the room with her , Mrs. Ripley said that she did not require her children 's presence , so long as she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her heart turned more to the contact of those she loved . It pleased her to he busy for them , when she could , though she deplored the weakness and ineptitude of age in this regard . ' It scents strange that I that have so little to do , should do that little wrong . ' It pleased her to have them about her . She writes to the daughter she loved best , with winning tenderness , ' I feel a want unsatisfied , and I think it must be to see you . Now this is somewhat of a concession for one who has always professed entire independence . But there is often , nowadays , a solitude of the heart which nothing can fill except your image . ' She loved to hear the prattle of her grandchildren , to watch their pretty , wild activities , as if they were creatures of her dreams . So they were , and she regarded them , as she regarded the whole world and her own soul , with a sad and gentle curiosity . In such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memory , she faded away , in the spirit of the beautiful words which she herself wrote not many weeks before the end : We have kept step together through a long piece of road in the weary journey of life : we have loved the same beings and wept together over their graves . I have not your faith to console me , as they drop one after another from my side ; yet my will , I trust , is in harmony with the divine order , and resigned where light is wanting . The sun looks brighter and my home more tranquil as the evening of life draws near . ' Now , to consider Mrs. Ripley as she was in her best years , from thirty to sixty , with all her wealth of spiritualpower and practical usefulness . We find , of course , the same qualities that we studied in her youth , but amplified , enriched , and balanced by the full development of maturity and a broader contact with the world . And first , the wife and mother and housekeeper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lid not lie in this direction . All the more notable is it that she was as admirable and successful here as in more abstract and ambitious pursuits . She herself recog. nines amply that in giving up her cherished interests for a life of active usefulness she had found gain as well as loss . ' I once thought a solitary life the true one , and , contrary to my theory , was moved to give up the independence of an attic covered with books for the responsibilities and perplexities of a parish and a family . Yet I have never regretted the change . Though I have suffered much , yet I have enjoyed much and learned more . ' And housekeeping for her meant , not a ladylike supervision , but hard , perpetual labor . She rarely had a servant , she had many children , she had large social obligations , and for years she had the needs or a boys ' school to provide for . Whatever her life lacked , it was not activity . The fret , the wear , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her health was never of the best . Sometimes she longed unutterably to be free and quiet . But she never complained , she never grew sour or querulous . Says one who knew her and loved her , ' In all the annoyances of an overtaxed life I never saw her temper touched . She did not know resentment ; she seemed always living in a sphere far above us all , yet in perfect sympathy . ' As a wife and mother she did her full duty as if it were a pleasure . The affection , almost devotion , with which her husband speaks of her is sufficient evidence as to her relation to him . I have already said that she did not depend upon her children for amusement ; but she watched over them and entered into their lives as only her intelligence could . Her methods of training and education were those of sympathy and kindness , and better testimony to their success could not be afforded than the noble qualities and eminent usefulness of her sons and daughters . No account of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit bout an analysis of her contact with the world , with her fellow men and ? manes . In one way her career was an isolated , or at least a limited one . She never traveled , knew nothing even of her own country outside the circle of her immediate surroundings . Books and talk , however , gave her a far wider knowledge of mankind than this would promise . And , though she did not go to the world , the world came to her . tier father 's houses in Boston and Dux-bury were always open to friends and neighbors , and during her husband 's long ministration in his Waltham parish , she kept up a hospitality which never failed or weakened . All sorts of people were welcomed in her parlor , and if her thoughts were often called away to other higher or lower cares , site did not . show it and her visitors never knew it . This is not saying that her duties were not sometimes irksome . Occasionally , in her most intimate correspondence , she rebelled and uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole to creep out of this most servile of all situations , a country clergyman 's wife . Oh , the insupportable fatigue of affected sympathy with ordinary and vulgar minds . ' Yet an impatience like this was but momentary , and was in no way incompatible with the social charm which I have already indicated in Mrs. Ripley 's youth , and which continued and increased with age . She certainly did not seek society , in fact preferred the multitudinous solitude of her own thoughts ; but neither did she avoid her fellows , and when with them she had always the supreme attraction of being wholly and perfectly herself . There was no affectation , no convention in her manners or in her talk . Site said ' what she thought , and , as her thoughts were wide , abundant , and original , her conversation could not fail to be stimulating . She was , indeed , more interested in the thoughts of others than in her own , and never permitted herself to be burdened with the demands of making talk where there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of quiet self-effacement . In the words of one who knew her well , Without being precisely shy , site often gave one the impression of an unobtrusive , yet extreme solicitude to be in nobody 's way . ' And this is not the worst of social qualities . It milk not , however , in Mrs. Ripley 's case , suggest dullness . When she did speak , it was with the ease and the fertility of a full soul . To Dr. Hedge it seemed that site had ' an attraction proceeding front no personal charms , but due to the astonishing vivacity , the all-aliveness , of her presence , which made it impossible to imagine her otherwise than wide awake and active in word or work . ' Yet even so , I have not quite portrayed the singular candor and impersonality of Mrs. Ripley 's spirit . Her lower self did not exist for her ; that is , she left it to regulate its doings by an exquisite instinct , without cumbering her soul with it . When her friends , in jest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broom in her hands and asked her to carry it across Boston Common , she did it quite without thought . In the same way , she carried her own external , social person through life , bearing it with the flawless and unfailing dignity that belonged to high preoccupations , and so making contact with her one of the privileges and delights of all she met . Among the activities of Mrs. Ripley 's prime none is more illustrative of her character than her teaching . She taught boys for many years , sometimes as an assistant in her husband 's boarding-school , or again simply taleing pupils to tutor in her own house . I find very little evidence that she enjoyed the work . Of course , there was the rare pleasure of really waking up a soul , knowing and seeing that you had done so . But the teacher was too self-distrustful to take much credit , even in such cases . She hated all responsibility ? how much , then , the responsibility of a young life . She hated drudgery , of body or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . And whatever pleasure there may be in teaching , few will deny that there is drudgery also . Especially she hated discipline , believed at least that she had no faculty for it , and refused to practise it in any harsher sense . It is said that , as she sat in her teacher 's chair , she knitted assiduously and purposely , so that small infractions of propriety might escape her notice . It is said , also , that when such things were forced upon her , she ma &; no continent at the time , but afterwards wrote gentle , pleading notes to the culprits , which never failed of their effect . For , whatever she may have felt herself , her pupils thought her eminently successful as a teacher . They learned from her , they obeyed her , they admired her , they loved her . No one affords better evidence than she that the stimulus of the soul goes further than the stimulus of the rod . Most of her boys were rich , idle fellows , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Such hearts are not always bad , but you have got to touch them to help them . On this point I do not know that I can quote better testimony than that of Senator Hoar . He says of the pupils who came to her from college : She would keep them along in all their studies , in most cases better instructed than they would have been if they had stayed in Cambridge . I remember her now with the strongest feelings of rev. creme , affection , and gratitude . In that I say only what every other pupil of hers would say . I do not think she ever knew how much her boys loved her , ' I can not leave Mrs. Ripley 's teaching and practical usefulness better than Willi the pathos of that last sentence . ly There is no doubt that the chief interest of Mrs. Ripley 's best years , as of her youth , is in her intellectual preoccupations . It is true that she theoretically subordinates such preocou. rations to useful action , but her very words in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tranquil enjoyment in study . There is no enjoyment like it , except perhaps disinterested action ; but all action is disturbing , because one is constantly limited and annoyed by others . ' So , in spite of the immense activity that was forced upon her by her choice of life and her surroundings , she persisted day after day and year after year in grasping more firmly and more zealously the things of the spirit . Sometimes , indeed , the difficulties were so great that even her courage faltered . ' I begin to think we must either live for earth or heaven , that there is no such thing as living for both at the same time . ' Her health was uncertain ; her time was broken , till there seemed nothing left of it ; those about her would call her attention to petty details and trifling matters , world removed from the high thoughts she loved to linger with . It made no difference . The persistence  --  call it obstinacy ? which others expended upon social success , upon worldly profit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , to study , to vaster acquisition of varied knowledge ; and somehow or other she knit up the flying minutes , which many would have wasted , into connected hours of profitable toil . Note that this spiritual effort was given to intellectual interests pure and simple . Mrs. Ripley had never any great love for the aesthetic side of life . Music , unless as a matter of analytical study , made little appeal to her . Art made almost none . am not sufficiently initiated into the mysteries of art to admire the right things , ' she says . Even in poetry her tastes were narrowly limited . The Classics she read because they were the Classics . To the moderns she gave little attention and less care . So with contemporary events . They passed her by almost unnoticed . Her whole thought was given to the eternal . Note also that she did not study to make a parade of it . She was as far as possible from a pedant in her speech as in her thought . She had no desire whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did literary ambition enter at all into her enthusiasm . She never wrote , had probably no great gift for formal writing . Her one inspiring passion , from youth to age , was to use every power she had in making just a little more progress into the vast , shadowy regions of obtainable knowledge . As I have already pointed out in connection with her young days , her intellectual appetite was universal in its scope . It almost seemed as if she did not care upon what she used her mind , so long as she used it . The truth was , that every study was so delightful that choice was hardly items- sorry . Language ? All languages fascinated her , and she grasped eagerly at every one that came within her reach . The ethereal flights of pure mathematics and astronomy might have absorbed her altogether , had it not been that chemistry and botany offered attractions so perpetually and variously alluring . The close contemporary of Thoreau , she had none of his imaginative interpretation of the natural world ; but it is doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact than hers . On the whole , it must be said , however , that her chief interest was in philosophy and abstract thought . The intense preoccupation with heaven and hell which beset every New England childhood in those days , turned , with her , as wills so many others , into a close and keen analysis of where heaven and hell came from ? and where they had gone to . She read the Greek and the English and the German philosophers and meditated upon them , with the result of a complete , profound , and all-involving intellectual skepticism . Observe that this skepticism was individual , not general . She was no dogmatic agnostic , no blatant unbeliever ; above all , she abhorred the thought of leading any other astray . She was simply a humble , gentle , reverent seeker , ever anxious to know whether anyone had found the light , but irrevocably determined to accept no false gleam , no deluding will-o ' - the- wisp . Even in face of the great mystery of all she would express only a deep resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel . ' Death is an event as natural as birth , and faith makes it as full of promise . But faith is denied to certain minds , and submission must take its place . The Unknown , which lighted the morning of life , will hallow and make serene its evening . Conscious or unconscious , we shall rest in the lap of the Infinite . Enough of this . Let us live while we live , and snatch each fleeting moment of truth and love and beauty . ' It may easily he maintained that Mrs. Ripley carried intellectual sincerity too far . She was so conscientious that she made a dogma , and finally even a duty , of doubt . She too often overlooked the blessed privilege of thorough skepticism , which is that it leaves hope as permissible as despair . Yet such singular , lucid , unfailing devotion to pure truth is highly notable in any one . I do not know whether a man may be forgiven for assuming that it is especially notable in a woman . It is in this connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy with her nephew by marriage , Emerson . It would seem as if the two must have been an infinite source of stimulus and solace to each other . That there was always the deepest affection and respect between them is perfectly evident . When Mrs. Ripley refers to Waldo in her earlier letters , it is as to a spirit inspired and almost super-earthly . And in her old age she writes of his absence , ' I miss my guide and support in many ways . ' Emerson 's tone is no less enthusiastic , not only in the eulogy of his friend published soon after her death , but in many passages of his Journal . Yet , with all this , one is rather surprised to note that the two seem to see little of each other , do not seek in each other 's society that constant sympathy that one would think they would have found there . The truth is , their ways of looking at life were radically different . Mrs. Ripley records a conversation between them in which she remarked that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation to what could not be helped ' ; and Emerson rejoined , 011 , no , not resignation , aspiration is the soul 's true state ! What have we knees for , what have we hands for ? Peace is victory . ' This difference of attitude peeps out slyly in a touch here and there in Mrs. Ripley 's letters . It is glaringly marked in the study of her , printed at large in the sixth volume of Emerson 's Journal . He does , indeed , repeat , with entire sincerity , much of his former praise . But he adds these somewhat harsh comments : ' She would pardon our vice in another which did not obscure his intellect or deform him as a companion . She knows perfectly well what is right and wrong , but it is not from conscience that she acts , but from sense of propriety , in the absence , too , of all motives to vice . She has not a profound mind , but her faculties are ver ? muscular , and she is endowed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pursuit of knowledge , not so much for the value of the knowledge , but for scam rope to twist , some grist to her mill . ' Few spiritual touches could be more instructive than this conflict of minds so akin in many interests and so closely thrown together . A certain justice in Emerson 's complaints is undeniable . Mrs. Ripley 's was in no way a creative , original intelligence . She knew that it was not , and perhaps we may say , did not wish it to be . Her mental activity does at times appear an offort at diversion and distraction , rather than a passionate struggle toward the ultimate ends of thought . Yet it is hard to be satisfied with Emerson 's criticism , when one reads passages like the following : ' Religion has become so simple a matter to me ? a yearning after God , an earnest desire for the peace that flows from the consciousness of union with him . It is the last thought that floats through my mind as I sleep , the first that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present life , saddened by past experience . It beditns my eyes wills tears when I walk out . into the beautiful nature , where love is all around me . And yet no direct ray comes to my soul . ' The true cause of the difference between Mrs. Ripley and Emerson was that her unconquerable , uncompromis , ing dread of illusion did not suit his persistent and somewhat willful optimism . The lucid shafts of her penetrating intelligence drove right through his gorgeous cloud-fabric . Doubtless she listened to his golden visions with the profoundest attention and respect . But she was ten years older than he , she had known him as a boy and from boyhood , and she read the boy in the man and the angel , and he knew she did . I have no direct evidence whatever , but I am inclined to suspect that she regarded those eager pages , peppered with capitalized abstractions , as Waldo 's pretty playthings , which amused Waldo and could hurt nobody . Emerson 's verdict on Mrs. Ripley 's moral character also , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected that skepticism so complete would have some moral effects ; but in this case those mainly perceptible are a divine gentleness and tolerance . Theoretical disbelief is apt to blight action . But action was so forced upon Mrs. Ripley all her life , that she could neither shun it nor neglect it . As to her moral instincts , Emerson himself indicates their sureness and delicacy . They never failed her in any connection . It was far more than a negative correctness of conduct . It was the most subtle and pervading sympathy with purity , holiness , and sacrifice , wherever they might be found . Above all , there was in her letters as in her life ? and this Emerson fully recognizes ? a singular tenderness , a pervading grace of comprehension , that endeared her toall who knew her . And hers is the saying , notable in one who so greatly prized all honesty and veracity , ' The law of love is higher than the law of truth . ' In short , it may well be said that she believed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the unfailing delight of the pursuit of knowledge . Even as to these things she had her doubts ; though they were clamped with iron tenacity to the inmost fibre of her soul , as to the existence of which she doubted also . But , however great the charm of Mrs. Ripley 's pure and saintly external life , the chief interest of her character , and of her example , must always lie in her extraordinary devotion to intellectual matters . It is to be observed that from her childhood to her age this devotion was absolutely disinterested . Most men who make a business of study combine it with some ulterior object , either professional success , or financial profit , or the glory of literary achievement or of scientific discovery . This woman never entertained the slightest suggestion of such advantage . With her there was but one aim , the pure exercise of thought for itself , t he perpetual probing a little deeper and a little deeper and a little deeper into the vast , elusive mystery of existence . Such a tremendous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own satisfaction with it , and its resources of desire and delight were as varied as they were inexhaustible . In Pater 's Imaginary Portrait , Sebastian van Storek says to his mother , ' Good mother , there are duties towards the intellect also , which women can but . rarely understand . ' No man ever understood those duties to the intellect better than this woman understood them .
