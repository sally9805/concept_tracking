The publishers of children 's books are earnestly attempting to cover the whole range of human thought , and , after a careful examination of nearly three hundred books , it has become evident to the reviewer that they aim to satisfy school boards . What the libraries call " non-fiction " is as plentiful as the story books " The Story of the Roman People " ( Houghton ) , by Eva March Tappan , is a satisfactory elementary account of Rome , giving the young reader , by means of mythology , legends , and history , an excellent idea of Roman belief and citizenship . The book is copiously illustrated with cuts from famous statues and paintings Elsa Barker 's " Stories from the New Testament for Children " ( Duffield ) is charmingly written , and mingles Bible text with narrative in an agreeable fashion .

The books are illustrated with portraits . A general history of England ( Doubleday , Page ) has been written by C. R. L Fletcher and Rudyard Kip-ling . That is to say , Mr. Fletcher has written the usual account , greatly embellished with marginal notes , while Mr. Kipling has conceived some spirited ballads , which , interspersed throughout the pages , lend a thrill to the narrative . A handsome edition of " The Story of France , " as told by Mary MacGregor , has been imported by the Frederick A. Stokes Co .

Lanier 's Malory and the late Howard Pyle 's Arthur books are too well known to be easily replaced .

Turning to biography , we find the field , as usual , deplorably weak As a connecting link with history , " First Voyages of Glorious Memory " ( Macmillan ) will find willing readers in high-school classes .

Harry Chase Brearley , in his entertaining book , " Animal Secrets Told " ( Stokes ) , shows us how we pass over the simplest observable things , even when they are brought under our very eyes He deals with the ears , mouths , and noses of our animals , and describes how the process of selection has modified their forms It is a book of " Whys " agreeably answered .

Aspects of Islam , . By Duncan Black Macdonald . ( Lamson lectures on the Religions of the World . ) New York : The Macmillan Co . Price , $1.50 net . The Aspects of Islam presented in these lectures are such as are of especial interest to missionaries in Moslem lands . In. discussing them , the author draws not only on a wide acquaintance with books , but on his own observations during a year recently spent in the East , and enlivens the treatment with abundance of anecdote and reminiscence . For a more thorough dealing with many points touched upon in the lectures , he could refer to his earlier works , " The Development of Muslim Theology , Jurisprudence , and Constitutional Theory " ( 1903 ) , and " The Religious Attitude and Life in Islam " ( 1909 ) . The central problem of Mohammedanism , from the missionary point of view , is Mohammed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person of the prophet , and the attitude of modern Moslems toward him , are therefore the most important in the book . Professor Macdonald makes much of the abnormal in Mohammed 's temperament : " The fundamental thing in him was that he was a pathological case " ; this sums up in a word " his essential personality and character " ; had he not been a pathological case , he might have been a great poet ; because of " the essentially pathological state of his mind " he had contradictory notions about the relation between God and the world ; above all , this accounts for his revelations . Byzantine writers disposed of Mohammed by calling him an epileptic ; Well labored to explain him in the same way ; others diagnosticate the prophetic infirmity as hysteria , while Sommer defines it as " psychogene Erregungszustande , " which makes everything clear ! The latest English biographer , Margoliouth , bids us study Swedenborg and Joseph Smith ; Professor Macdonald recommends us to psychical research : " the clue to Muhammad " is to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states . Mohammed certainly fell into trances , of which traditions purporting to come from his own household give sufficiently circumstantial descriptions ; he saw visions and heard voices , and took these experiences for objective and supernatural reality ; what came into his head in these states or when he emerged from them was for him divine revelation . There is no doubt that his steadfast faith in his ' Mission and the divine authority of his message through years of rejection and opposition was rooted in such experiences and sustained by their recurrence . Paul , also , saw visions , heard voices , had raptures in which he was caught up to the third heavenwhether in the body or out of the body , he could not tell ; his whole career was determined by the vision on the road to Damascus ; Krenkel proved to the satisfaction of many that the thorn in the flesh was epilepsy ; he was , as a Jewish author has recently reminded us , clearly a " pathological case . " For that matter , without going to all lengths with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended by a high degree of nervous instability , and from the point of view of what James called the " medical materialist , " prophetic visions are classifiable hallucinations and the mystics are all hysterics . But when the neurologist has given his best opinion about what was the matter with Paul or Mohammed , the problem of the origins of Islam or of Pauline Christianity remains for the historian exactly where it was betore . Admit that Mohammed was obsessed by his ideas , where did the ideas come from ? What gave them such power over him ? How came he to take them for a revelation from the one true God  --  where did he get that idea ? How did these ideas develop in his , own mind ? How are they unfolded in his prophesying and lawmaking and realized in his religious community or commonwealth ? These are the questions which are essential to a comprehension of Mohammed , and on them it is vain to look to abnormal psychology for light Goldziher , in his " Vorlesungen tuber den Islam , " recently reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of Harnack 's , apropos of Paul , about maladies which only afflict " supermen " It would be hard to say wherein his understanding and appreciation of Mohammed . suffer thereby . Professor Macdonald 's Judgment of Mohammed 's character is extremely unfavorable . He was not " in his beginnings a self-seeking insincere impostor . He was a pathological case His revelations came to him in trance , and like all trance-mediums he had strangely perverted ideas ; but an impostor he certainly was not . " But " there can be no shadow of question that in those last years at Medina he forged the awful machinery of divine inspiration to serve his own ignoble and selfish purposes . How he passed over at last into this turpitude is a problem again for those who have made a study of how the most honest trance-mediums may at any time begin to cheat . " When Mohammed , after ten years of prophesying at Mecca , shook off the dust of the unbelieving city and betook himself to Medina , circumstances which he could not have foreseen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of a religious commonwealth in which he was arbiter , law-giver , and leader , with divine authority . Modern writers often underline the contrast between the prophet of Mecca and the theocratic despot at Medina . They overlook the fact that Mohammed 's model of a prophet was not an Amos or a Jeremiah , but Moses ; it was only at Medina , as the theocratic head of a people , that he realized his own ideal of his calling . His adversaries were rebels against God , and deserved no better fate than Korah and his rout . He could not bid the earth open and swallow them up , but he used the natural means at his command with good effect , and , we have no reason to doubt , in the belief that he had the best of Precedents . He did some things that outraged the heathen sense of right and honor and made even his own followers shake their heads . The revelations  --  before or after the event  --  which warranted these doings were plainly suggested by his own desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offence . It is such utterances , doubtless , that the author has in mind when he charges Mohammed with " forging the awful machinery of divine inspiration . " That mediums often turn out swindlers is , however , hardly an explanation . Years of prophesying at Mecca had accustomed Mohammed to take the thoughts and impulses which came over him , not alone in trance states , but in full consciousness , as the mind and will of God revealed by his spirit in his prophet , and to give them out as such . His success at Medina had strengthened him in the conviction that he was the chosen instrument of God for the triumph of the true religion and the discomfiture of its foes . Elevated to a unique position as the representative of God , it is not strange that he should exempt himself from rules laid down for common men ; for example , in'the matter of the lawful number of wives . The refinement of self-scrutiny which should have led him to question the source of his inspiration because the revelation fell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should expect of him . All this may not alter an objective judgment of his conduct ; but it shows how easy it was to do as he did without conscious and deliberate fraud . His lapses illustrate , not the temptations of Mr. Sludge , but the mental and moral dangers of being a prophet  --  dangers obviously the greater the more unquestioningly the prophet believes in himself . In matters of theology , as the author remarks , Moslems stand much nearer to Christians than is commonly imagined ; but he does not dwell on the historical reasons for this resemblance . In the chapter on Theology and Metaphysics he illustrates the peculiar dialectic of the Moslem development of the doctrine of God rather than the points of agreement with the Christian doctrine or the characteristic differences . Two lectures are given to the Mystical Life , the emotional experience of religion as cultivated by the Sufis and the various orders of dervishes , and the place of mysticism in orthodox systems of theology , a subject by which Professor Macdonald has always been strongly attracted and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space given to these phenomena is justified by their intrinsic interest and by their peculiar importance to missionaries , whom it behooves to know not only how Mohammedanism satisfies the intellect of its adherents by its scholastic theology , but how it answers their spiritual needs . There are some interesting pages in the book on present conditions in the Moslem world and the outlook for the future . Professor Macdonald thinks that " unless all signs deceive , there lies before the Moslem peoples a terrible religious collapse " ; but to discuss these vieNts would lead us too far . By way of conclusion , it may be said that , as a popular presentation of some salient features of Mohammedan belief , and life , the volume may be read with instruction by a wider circle than that to which it is primarily addressed . CURRENT FICTION . The Exception . By Oliver Onions New York : John Lane Co . This sturdy protest against the vandalism of the iconoclast suggests that sober British respectability is getting back its breath again , and that audacity on the rampage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever the augury for the future of the English novel , the vehicle of the present rebuke is a manifest reversion to type  --  a deliberate return upon the safe old opinions of virtue , of marriage rights , of verbal decorum , and the safe old literary practice that reflects the actual surface of life ( rich texture and weathered hue , not thin , bright pattern of conventionalized design such as theorists fabricate ) . The theme is the precise vindication of that same conventional morality that it has been so much the recent fashion to decry . And it is upon the much derided reluctance of the Anglo-Saxon tongue to deal plainly with certain matters that the plot hinges . Berice Beckwith , honestly trying to confess to the man she is about to marry the shameful secret of an earlier intimacy , can find no words beyond these . " He was my lover . . . .

" Yet with all the tenacious vitality of an ugly fact , this " old central fact of her life " survives and in other memories than her own ; she finds herself continually confronted with it in other people 's opinions . For the knowledge of this illicit relationship is as a touchstone on which every character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , tacit or expressed , becomes the determining factor in her relations with each one . In. the end she sees " clearly enough . . . that she had only been one of the countless exceptions who , well warned beforehand , must still needs go through the deeps of suffering and the shallows of hopelessness merely to discover that they were not exceptional after all . " Proposed in cold blood , the enterprise smacks not a little of the morbid and the didactic ; in execution it affords some excruciating moments , but none that lacks sincerity and lifelikeness . Characters are finely distinguished , conversations gain in naturalness by sub-currents of unexpressed meanings , and the emphasis falls on certain elements of sanity and delicacy in the public mind that betoken health .

" There the writer was content with her characters , and the slightest pleasant shadow of a story to pull them together . Here she is more determined to tell a tale , and the result has a flavor of artifice , especially in the latter part of the narrative .

Osborne deserting Celia when the world turns its back on her , one sees Lady Eleanour intercepting Celia 's letter to Wayne , with the painful stiffness of puppets condemned to play their parts in the distressful scene . Celia herself is a winning heroine  --  like one of Mrs. de la Pasture 's sweet little girls , but with the saving graces of common sense and humor .

It is written avowedly to show a better way than the prevailing way of treating a despised woman . Given an old lady whose forte is mothering the young of both sexes , and whose ability to turn them from evil is co-extensive with her smile and her applications of Christian doctrine , nothing could be simpler than Mrs. Custance 's method . But with full appreciation of her motives , her courage , and her patience , we must think that her subjects yielded rather easily to her treatment and that not every dear old lady would have such success .

THE MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE . The Purchasing Power of Money . By Irving Fisher . New York : The Macmillan Co $3 net . Few persons are more successful than Profegsor Fisher in putting old wine into new bottles . He has taken the most hotly debated of all economic questions , and , by the use of arguments long familiar to special students , has produced an imposing work . While in innumerable instances it is easy to recognize the author 's indebtedness to earlier economists , as well as to contemporaries , it can be said of him , as of Handel , that though he may borrow freely , he always repays with interest . Interest with him takes the form of a patient elucidation , such as can be found in few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' that the main contentions of this book are at bottom simply a restatement and amplification of the old " quantity theory " of money . With certain corrections in the usual exposition of that theory , it may still , he declares , be called fundamentally sound . What has long been needed is , in his judgment , a candid reexamination and revision , rather than a repudiation . The great merit of this book is its exhaustiveness . The theory of the purchasing power of money may perhaps best be described as an hydra-headed monster , so manifold are the aspects which one must keep in mind in eliminating error from one 's conclusion . Mr. Fisher 'S aim has been to bring each of these aspects into bold relief , and he has effected his purpose admirably . The quantity theory has been one of the most bitterly contested theories in economics , largely , we are ' told , because the recognition of its truth or falsity affected powerful interests in commerce and politics It has , as is pointed out , been made the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invoked in behalf of irredeemable paper money and of national free coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 . As a consequence , not a few " sound-money men , " believing that a theory used to support such vagaries must be wrong , have drifted into the position of opposing , not only the unsound propaganda , but'also the sound principles by which its advbcates sought to bolster it up . These attacks upon the quantity theory have been rendered easy by the imperfect comprehension of it on the part of those who have thus invoked it in a bad cause . Personally , our author believes that few mental attitudes are more pernicious than those which would uphold sound practice by denying sound principles because some thinkers make unsound application of those principles . At any rate , in scientific study there is no choice but to find and state the unvarnished truth . The equation of exchange , as Mr. Fisher states it , is this : my-Hey-1=2PQ . In Common speech 'M represents actual money and V the velocity of its circulation ( that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M ' stands for bank deposits subject to transfer by check , and V ' for the average velocity of circulation . Turning to the goods side of the equation , we have to deal with the prices of goods exchanged and the quantities of goods exchanged . The average price of sale of any particular good , such as bread , purchased in the given community during the given year , may be represented by P ( price ) , and the total quantity of it purchased by Q ( quantity ) ; likewise the average price of another good ( say , coal ) may be represented by P ' , and the total quantity of it exchanged by Q ' ; the average price and the total qilantity of a third good ( say , cloth ) may be represented by P " and Q " , respectively ; and so on for all other goods exchanged , however numerous . The right-hand side of the equation is therefore the sum of terms of the form PQ , that is to say , a price multiplied by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the use of . x the symbol in mathem-ties of summation . With the extension of the equation of monetary circulation to include deposit circulation , the influence exerted by the quantity of money on general prices becomes , it is admitted , less direct ; and the process of tracing.this influence becomes more difficult and complicated . It has been argued that this interposition of circulating credit breaks whatever connection there may be between prices and the quantity of money . This would be true , Mr. Fisher admits , if circulating credit were independent of money . But the fact is , he contends , that the quantity of circulating credit , M ' , tends to hold a definite relation to M , the quantity of money in circulation ; that is , deposits are normally a more or less definite multiple of money . All this recalls J. S. Mill 's admirable dis cussion of the value of money in the third book of his " Principles of Political Economy . " Mill points out many qualifications " with which the proposition must be received , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supply , and is in inverse ratio of the quantity ; qualifications which , under a complex system of credit like that existing in England , render the proposition an incorrect expression of the fact . " The care with which Mr. Fisher weighs these qualifications constitutes one of the chief merits of his work . He does not ignore , for exarciple , Mill 's contention that " money , no more than commodities in general , has its value definitely determined by demand and supply . The ultimate regulator of its value is Cost of Production . " This particular aspect receives acute treatment from Mr. Fisher in one of his chapters on Indirect Influences on Purchasing Power . He finds that gold production will always tend toward an equilibrium in which the marginal cost of production will ( when interest is added ) be equal to the value of the product . If the purchasing power of gold is above the cost of production in any particular mine , it will pay to work that mine . If the purchasing power of gold is lower than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pay to work that mine . Thus the production of gold increases or decreases with an increase or decrease in the purchasing power of gold . In the chapter on Disturbance of Equation and of Purchasing Power During Transition Periods , we are reminded of Walter Bagehot 's article ( now a classic ) in the London Economist of December 30 , 1871 , entitled " The Great Rise in the Price of Commodities . " Fisher here works out in interesting fashion the consequences of belated changes in interest rates . Here is one of his lines of thought in epitome : Borrowers : unable to get easy loans , blame the high rate of interest for conditions which - Were really due to the fact that the previous rate of interest was not high enough . Had the previous rate been high . enough , the borrowers never would have overinvested . The reverse happens , in periods M. contraction of loans and deposits . It is readily admitted by our author that the factors in the equation of exchange are continually seeking normal adjustment , but seldom finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those of equilibrium the exception , the mechanism of exchange is almost always in a dynamic rather than a static condition . " Certain minor defects in this book remain to be mentioned . The author shares with the great majority of economists a tendency to lapse into a pedagogical style . The line drawings used to illustrate the text would be more suitable in a primary instruction book , andmathematical formulw could often have been dispensed with . - Napoleon and His Coronation .

Under the title " Le Sacre et le couronnement de Napoleon , " M. Masson added in 1908 another volume to his long shelf of interesting books of curious and copious information about Napoleon I. The translator of this volume would have done well to retain a literal rendering of the French title , for M. Masson has told a great deal more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is valuable , not so much because it pictures all the dramatic details of the pompous spectacle in which Napoleon set a crown upon his own head , but rather because four-fifths of its pages are devoted to a careful analysis of Napoleon 's reasons for wishing to be consecrated , of his diplomatic moves to persuade the Pope to perform the ceremony , and of his resulting relations with the Papacy and with the French people . The book is thus really a contribution to the history of church and state in France . Napoleon was not content with the Senatus-consultum of May 18 , 1804. establishing him as hereditary emperor , nor with its confirmation by the people in the favorable plebiscite of 2,962,458 to 2,567 votes . Incidentally , it is interesting to note that Napoleon juggled the figures . The " ayes " from the army and from the navy were 120,302 and 16,224 respectively . Displeased with these military figures , either because they showed the numerical strength of his forces or because he deemed it inexpedient to gauge their enthusiasm with , mathematical accuracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy " ayes " to 400,000 and 50,000 , and then altered the addition of the total to 3,574,898 in his favor ; the 2,567 votes against him he left unchanged . But he did not wish his Empire to rest merely on his sword and , on the votes of the Senate and people . He wanted it to seem to have the firmer foundation of Divine Right . He wanted to be a sovereign like other sovereigns . He wished as the Anointed of the Lord to be above ordinary mortals . All these things he hoped to procure , in a measure at least , by a consecration performed by the hand of the Pope . By holding back in secret the result of the plebiscite until the eve of the religious ceremony , and by conducting the consecration and the coronation together in Notre Dame with the assistance and approving presence of the Pope , Napoleon hoped his Empire might seem to be established upon both popular and Divine Right . The coronation of Josephine M. Masson considers a whim on Napoleon 's part . For centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de ' Medici , for whom there were special reasons ) had been crowned . Napoleon also tried to conceal from the Pope the fact that he and Josephine had never been properly married . It was useless . Pius learned it at the last moment from Josephine herself , and refused to perform the consecration ceremony until a religious marriage had been duly concluded . M. Masson gives all the interesting minutia ; of the costumes , the decorations , the fireworks , the balloon with a fiery imperial crown attached which was released before multitudes in Paris and which sailed to Rome in forty-six hours , the gifts to the Pope and to the people ? and the cost of it all . Was it worth it ? M. Masson is inclined to think not . His reasons are interesting , but too long to be summarized here . Mr. Hassall has courageously attempted to cover the whole of Napoleon 's career within the small compass of about eighty thousand words . To do this successfully , however , requires literary skill and a first-hand acquaintance with the psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the skilful perversions of the St Helena memoirs . Mr. Hassall does not give marked evidence of either . His narrative is clogged with dates and irritating repetitions , and appears to rest on material which , though otherwise excellent . is wholly secondary . There are good illustrations . But the volume can scarcely be held to be so satisfactory as the recent little biography by Johnston or as the sketches by Seeley in the old , and by J.

The tale here taken up has been told before , but it becomes increasingly possible in these days to tell it well , and Mr. Tucker Brooke has produced a volume which will be read with interest not merely by the professed scholar , but by all who feel any curiosity concerning Shakespeare and the dramatic traditions in which he so splendidly found his account The title of the book is justifiably interpreted to cover a sketch of the beginnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of morality plays , all of which , though of earlier origin , were the characteristic forms of English drama at the opening of the Tudor period ? And , similarly , the culmination of the study is constantly found in Shakespeare , who , though his greatest achievements fall in the reign of James , is here regarded as the last of the Elizabethans , continuing their sane and comprehensive grasp of life into an age less exalted and less universal , the drama of which , with all its brilliance , was , through Puritan opposition and gradual divorce from the serious concerns Of contemporary life , falling into the dust and putrefaction upon which the doors of the theatres eventually closed . Whether the break between Tudor and Stuart drama be as clean and sharp as the author contends is proper matter for reflection , it must be granted , at any rate , that a defensible thesis has been set up and supported , especially in the concluding chapters on realistic comedy and the nature of the Elizabethan drama , both with learning and with critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question how far the thesis ought to be carried , there are striking gains in unity and a sense of vivid movement to be got from passing under review the literary types of a more restricted field , as may be observed in the chapter on the transitional interlude . And the method of presentation by means of types , if it has a weakness in that so impressive a play as " Othello " comes off with but scant notice , gains much from the author 's manifest knack of setting up categories that are truly organic . In the chapters on the history play this power is exhibited at its subtlest , and it leads to some nice critical distinctions in the treatment of romantic comedy . Some may question , however , whether these matters are not pushed a little too far when " The Merchant of Venice " is so widely set apart from the stream ' of romantic comedy which has its headwaters in " Love 's Labor 's Lost " and " The Two Gentlemen of Verona , " or when a new category , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is erected . But 101r . Tucker Brooke treats neither type nor infivence in a rigid manner . He is quick to point out overlappings and he does not limit himself to obvious imitations . The reader is not allowed to forget , to choose but one in-stance , that while the example of the Roman dramatists made for precision of outline , their exuberant love of excitement and ornament deepened the native tendency toward romantic fancy The book is written with a certain liveliness of style which is not unattractive , but which sometimes gives to a critical dictum an undue air of finality The present reviewer feels that the denunciation of " Mankind " as an utterly wretched thing might stand some modification . Coarse buffoonery in lieu of plot it often has , but there is also something of the moral fervor and worldwide scope of " Piers Plowman " ; revived on the modern stage , it has been found capable of moving an audience , let us hope somewhat above " the Intel lectual range of fifteenth-century rustics , " with not a little of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on points like this is to testify to the stimulating qualities of the book , qualities which are gained by no scanting of the fulness of the record . A novel hypothesis is contributed to the discussion of the " War of the Theatres , " and succinct and helpful bibliographies are appended to the several chapters . The Record of an Adventurous Life . By Henry Mayers Hyndman New York : The Macmillan Co. $1.75 net . Mr. Hyndman 's career illustrates the unquenchable restlessness at the bottom of the English heart . Though English society be petrified by conventionalism , individual Englishmen , from the days of the Elizabethans to our own , have been drawn to the ends of the earth by the allure of adventure and of the unconventional . Born in 1842 , Mr. Hyndman had the usual upper middle-class training , took his degree at Trinity College , read for the bar in London , was one of the great ? est cricketers of his time , and soon discovered that he had no inclination for the law . So he roamed on the Continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent in the war of 1866 , and then returned to London . The sight of the poverty there roused in him , a born Radical , at first indignation , and later the resolve to devote his life to reforming society , until such hideous inequalities between rich and poor should be impossible . He knew Mazzini , Garibaldi , and George Meredith , wrote in the advanced journals , and was coming to be recognized as a rising disputant , when he went off to Australia for his health . During the next decade he roved widely , wrote Radical leaders for Melbourne papers , visited India , saw something of the United States , invested in Utah mines , returned to London , and had contacts high and low but all the while he was nursing his indignation at social conditions . It happened in 1880 that , on a voyage to New York , he first read Karl Marx 's " Capital " That book revealed to him the " scientific " basis of Socialism , gave him a creed , and fixed his emotions in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British Socialists . He drew inspiration from Marx in person . He founded Justice . He worked with William Morris on one side , and with the Central Land League of Great Britain on the other . Wherever there was agitation , there was After the West End riots he was tried , but acquitted He stood on a Socialist platform for the House of Commons . He spoke for India He denounced the Boer war . For years he has been in the inner circle of International Socialism . In short , he has , in true British fashion , relished adventure , whether among strange peoples in far-off lands or in new undertakings among his own people . - The last half of Mr. Hyndman 's memoirs , therefore , may serve as a document in the history of British Socialism : but they are throughout interesting because of the glimpses they give of prominent men in both hemispheres , and because of their side-lights on history and of their anecdotes . They show celebrities from a different angle , and they inform those who are not Socialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hyndman writes with dash , careless of his style , as becomes an agitator and publicist accustomed to move his hearers by the substance rather than by the form of his utterances . We welcome this portrait which he paints of himself as a real addition to Victorian autobiography .
