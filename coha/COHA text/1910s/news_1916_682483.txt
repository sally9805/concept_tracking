txt The iron band which Germany burst by slaying Serbia and cutting a corridor across the Balkan peninsula into Turkey has been drawing together in Asia Minor . The ends are now so close that it has been possible for a band of Cossacks to ride across the opening  --  that is , ' to spring from the Russians ' end or the closing ring , which is on the Turco-Persian border , to the end the British hold on the Tigris River , twenty miles south of Kut-el-Amara . It was a romantic incident . that leap of the Cossacks . General LAKE , commander of the British forces in Mesopotamia , could not report it without adjectives . A force of Russian cavalry had joined the British forces on the Tigris , he said , " after a bold and adventurous ride . " The achievement is of no military importance , perhaps ; cavalry is indispensable to Russian operations to the mountainous north , but of doubtful present value to the British , who are conducting trench warfare in a low , marshy country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported at all . The way by which it must have come is rough and very difficult and hardly suited to the movement of guns , ammunition trains , and large troop bodies . It was probably intended to be what it seems , an imaginative , impulsive Performance . inspired as much by the Russian love of color , poetry , and picturesqueness in war as by the desire to produce a political effect . In England the news was received with joyous emotions . In France already Russians had struck hands with their allies , but this was the first physical union of Russian and British forces In this war . In France . Russian troops marching through the villages were preceded by children , strewing the ground with flowers . One would give a lot to know how the " bold and adventurous riders . " appearing so unexpectedly , were received by the British soldiers on the Tigris River . Russia 's part in the war seems to be steadily growing . She will now have put troops into every important theatre of fighting . She will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is holding the whole long eastern front alone , because that is her own . and now Bagdad , which the British failed to take , is more likely to fall into Russian than into English hands , unless , however , a joint attack should become feasible . What seems more probable is that the Russians will force upon the Turks a battle for possession of Mesopotamia , at a point somewhere north of the Holy City . The British are to the south of it . If the Turks should lose , that would not be until they had already lost control of the Aleppo-Mosul-Bagdad highway , now their principal line of communication , and then their only escape would be to retreat in a due westerly direction , across the great Syrian waste through Palmyra to Damascus . When again the iron band meets , if it does , it will meet on the plains of Mesopotamia , which was the first of all places in the sun , and inside the ring will he not only Germany and Austria-Hungary , as at first , but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see out , the Kaiser 's dream of an overland route to India . via Vienna , Constantinople , and Bagdad , will become purely subjective again .
