txt The House of Commons tonight passed the second reading of the Government 's man-power bill , which extends conscription to Irekind The vote was 323 to 100 . In moving the second reading of the bill , ** Ce.VP% trilicitijet Member for Surrey , . said that it was the duty , of the country to do everything it could do , and then only should it be entitled to use to the fullest extent the help given by its allies . Germany had made Europe an armed camp , he added , and the necessity of taking every man who could he spared was overwhelming . Sir George said that he had been adi'ised that the application of the manpower bill to Ireland would yield a large ' number of men , but if only five divisions could be got from Ireland it would be worth while . He did not believe that the army would be needed to force the operation of the measure . Sir George added that even if there were an Irish Parliament today the question of conscription in Ireland still would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being continually interrupted by Nationalist members , Sir George said he doubted whether the voice of Ireland had yet been heard in the matter . The speaker of the House appealed to the Irish members to give him a fair hearing . Sir Charles Hobhouse , former Postmaster General , and Sir Donald . criticised the bill , expressing the opinion that the number of men over 40 who were fit for service did not justify raising the age limit . John Dillon , the Nationalist leader , said that , apart altogether from Ireland , no case had been made out for the bill itself . As to the Irish proposals , he asserted , they would destroy the hope of an Irish settlement during the war . He challenged the Government to take a plebiscite In Ireland , and said that Antrim would vote with Clare against conscription . The farmers of ulster , he said , were against conscription . Sir Edward Carson , interrupting , said : No more than the farmers of England . " Dillon Predicts " New War Front . " The estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nonsense . Two years ago the figures were put at 120,000 , and since that time 20.000 had volunteered . He believed that no more than 80,000 could be obtained without doing infinitely more injury by destroying the food supply . The real purpose of the bill , Mr. Dillon . said , was ' to divert public attention and inquiry ' from the true causes of the failure on the western front . The attempt to extend the bill to Ireland , he predicted , ' would open up another war . front In Ireland , all the more formidable because it would ' be a moral front , in which Britain would he wrong ; it would be a front which , whatever form the conflict took , would spread to America and Australia and to all the corners of the earth where the Irish race was scattered . The prospect before the Government , Mr. Dillon asserted , WhA that for the remainder of the war it must hold Ireland under strict military law , with ever-increasing bitterness . In committee the Nationalists , Mr. Dillon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if the Government would concede that , perhaps they would cry quits and not oppose the bill further . He had no hope that a home rule bill acceptable to Ireland . could be passed . Ex-Premier Asquith said that he Much doubted whether the raising of the military age to 50 would result in the increased military efficiency expected . He thought It more probable that , owing to the resulting dislocation in industry , it would cause a diminution in the sum total of the available national effort for the conduct of the war . Dealing with Ireland , Mr. Asquith said that the question whether compulsory service , when it was proposed for Great Britain , should be extended to Ireland had already been twice considered by the later Government , and on both occasions had been deliberately rejected . The test to be applied was always whether the advantages would be greater than the disadvantages . It was purely a practical question . Ile thought that the argument against compulsion in Ireland had been strengthened rather than weakened by the time that had elapsed since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of self-government for Ireland , Mr. Asquith said , and he honed that the measure would be received with something like general assent . There were both constitutional and revolutionary movements in Ireland , Mr. Asquith went on . The evidence showed that the latter was waning , but it was not stamped out . It still existed , and had to be reckoned with . He suggested that the Government . would he guilty of terrible short-sightedness , at a time when the Irish Convention had completed its labors , and- when it was asking the House to accept a far-reaching measure of self-government , in imposing on Ireland compulsion which was obnoxious to a very large number of the Irish people . It was all-important that unnecessary domestic controversy should be avoided , and that a united and unbroken front should be presented to the people , the Allies , and the world . Bonar Law Tells of Emergency . Andrew Bonar Law , spokesman for the Government , said that what had happened in France was unexpected . That was why this bill was presented , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , " he said . " Until the battle began the balance of forces ' VeAS not against the . AIlies on the western front . Not rally the Government , but the British and French military advisers , believed that there was no danger of anything fatal happening . Wherever the fault lies , it does not relieve the necessity of filling the ranks in the army , unless we are prepared to accept the position that we can not win . , " We have been able to fill the wastage in the battle thus far , but according to the figures of the casualties available , the most critical time is likely to arise at the end of May and June . We have succeeded to some extent in meeting the difficulty by what the Americans have done . We can not put too high our admiration of President Wilson 's action in this matter in brigading the American troops . Nothing but absolute necessity could have justified our making such a demand or President Wilson 's acceding to R. " Using Four Menthe Men . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Bonar Law continued , and if the struggle went on , as the Government believed It would , the men conscripted now would become available tjust at the time they were needed . The Government had already put in men of four months or less training , and must face the economic risk , confronted as it was by a greater risk . " What we are doing now , " he said , " might mean the difference between victory and defeat . " With regard to Ireland , the Government did not contemplate without reluctance or hesitation doing anything which threatened to make Ireland England 's enemy . It ought not to be so . The Government was asking Ireland to do nothing which was not asked from the citizens of every belligerent country , and the fact that it was delayed proved that the Government had been anxious to deal honorably and fairly with Ireland . " We acted only after mature consideration , " said Mr. Bonar Law , " and we are not going to alter our decision . If this clause is rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the country thinks we are making a mistake we will do our utmost loyally to support any other Government which carries on the war . " Colonel Martin Archer-Slice wanted to know if it was a fact that six weeks ago the American Government offered to recruit in the United States for the British Army , and if that offer was refused . If so , would the Government reconsider the decision and ask the Americans to take the step now . Irish Howl Down Geddes , After Captain William A. Redmond had spoken against the Government measure , a sensational scene arose ? in the House . Leif Jones , Liberal for Nottinghamshire , demanded on whose advice the Government was acting In deciding to conscript Ireland . Sir Auckland . Geddes , Minister of Recruiting . rose to address the House , but the Nationalist members shouted for Chief Secretary Duke to speak . Sir Auckland tried to speak , but his voice was drowned by shouts of : " Duke ! " " Duke ! " The Speaker of the House appealed for order , whereupon Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter . The disorders continued , Sir Auckland Geddes vainly trying to get a hearing . The Speaker again intervened aid said that , although some members were anxious to hear the Chief Secretary , others wanted to hear Geddes . This failing to quiet the commotion , the Speaker appealed to the House for a third time and said that , if a certain number of members were determined that Geddes should not be heard , that was a gain ? two parties could play at . He strongly- deprecated the attempt to shout down the Minister or . Recruiting . John Dillon appealed to his friends to allow Sir Auckland a hearing , and Andrew Bonar Law eventually promised that Mr. Duke should participate in the discussion of the Irish clause . Sir Auckland Geddes was then allowed to speak . He gave some explanations on details of the bill and strongly emphasized its urgency from a military viewpoint . Closure was applied and carried by a vote of 319 to 105 , and an amendment by Sir Charles Hobhouse , declaring that " while recognizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion that the measure diminishes the naval and economic power of the nation without adding commensurate military strength , " was defeated by a vote of 821 to 100 . The bill was then passed to second reading .
