txt It is almost a reproach to any American , or rather to all Americans , to enlarge upon the duty of patriots among men and women who are moved by a feeling of sympathy whenever they see their defenders in uniform , perhaps with empty sleeves or on crutches , to take Victory bonds to the limit of prudence . The question with most is where the limit of prudence lies . One bank In this town , and not one of the largest , thought that for it the proper amount was $40,000,000 , but that was because the bank thought that its customers would subscribe very heavily . There is no need to indicate the limit of prudence to that bank , or , in fact , to any bank . There is not one financial institution which does not know that it would be worse off if it did not go to the limit of banking prudence to assure victory for tile Victory Loan . But bank customers have anxieties as well as duties which are different from those of banks , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customers than of the banks to take the bonds , and more the duty of the banks to put the bonds in the hands of their customers than in their own vaults . The limit of prudence for the ordinary man in the street or woman In the home in taking Victory bonds is a little beyond the limit where they are afraid they are saving too much money . Fathers and mothers , and the rest of the family , who are straining every nerve to make their future secure , can try a little harder to take Victory bonds than to make deposits in savings banks because the bonds pay better interest , and the glow of patriotic duty done is a clear gain without cost , " an added attraction " gratis . Besides , dollars put into Victory bonds serve a double duty . First . they discharge the country 's debt to the defenders of democracy , which we each feel is a personal debt , and , second , they make the conditions of earning a living easier for everybody . Dollars put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by enabling the Treasury to pay its debts , thus putting money into the channels of business . The Treasury ran into debt for billions for war goods and is unable to pay for them until Victory Loan subscribers find the funds . The bill for transporting our soldiers over land and sea has not yet been paid , and the bills without date are past due . For example , yesterday the Lehigh Valley Railroad published its annual report saying : " None of the compensation " due from the United States Rail " road Administration for the year " 1918 was paid during the year . " The war could not have been won unless the railways ' had carried the soldiers to the war , and now back to their homes , and there are many reports differing hut little from the above . Uncle Sam , to speak frankly , is hard up on current accounts and has to borrow from his nephews to make both ends meet . Dollars put into Victory bonds do double or triple duty . They pay the blood debt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods delivered , and in due season the circle is completed by payment of interest and prinei6a1 to those who now make the advances . This circulation of cash will make the conditions of earning a iving easier for everybody in all de ; Tees of life . The more the " common people " take the better for them and ' or the country .
