Annunziata is preparing the evening meal over the fire . Isola is playing beside her . ANNUNZIATA Now , now ! Not so near . One of these days you 'll be falling into the fire , and there 'll be nothing left to tell us about you but your shoes . Put them on and get out the bowls for supper . ISOLA I like to play with the fire . ANNUNZIATA What a thing to say ! ISOLA I 'd like to let my hair into it , gently , gently , gently , gently . ANNUNZIATA Do n't you hear me tell you it 's a wicked thing ? ISOLA Brother Francis says it 's our brother , and one of the best things in the world . ANNUNZIATA Tchk , Tchk !  --  What makes the starling sing in his cage all of a sudden ? ISOLA It 's Brother Francis himself looking at us . ANNUNZIATA Tell him to come in and have some supper . ISOLA Come in , my mother says , and have some supper . ( Brother Francis appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROTHER FRANCIS I can very well go on to my own supper and need not lighten your kettle . p. 3 ANNUNZIATA Come in , Brother Francis . What you take will not even make a new ring around the kettle . Besides , I see you have been up to the top of the mountain again . You are cold and wet . Come and sit by the fire . BROTHER FRANCIS Yes , I have been up to the very top since yesterday , among the rocks and the birds in the rocks . Brother Wind was there and Sister Rain was there , but Brother Fire was not . ANNUNZIATA Now you sit by him , Isola , while I get some more wood ; but do n't ask him any questions . Now , Brother , put this fur skin across your knees . ( She goes out . ) ISOLA What did you do , Brother Francis ? BROTHER FRANCIS I watched and waited to see what they would let me see . For a long while there was nothing ; then they nodded to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched seven stars closely . Suddenly they turned and fled inwards , and I saw the Queen of Heaven leading forth her company before all the ship-wrecked seamen of this world .  --  However , do not tell thy mother , for she believes in no one 's miracles but her own . ISOLA My mother says the fire is a wicked thing . BROTHER FRANCIS ( Turning : ) What , Sister Annunziata , how can you say that ?  --  Why , what would cook your broth , what would keep you warm ? And when you return from the mountaintops , what else shines out from all the friendly windows of the world ? Look at its flames , how they lean towards us ! p. 4 ISOLA It says : Give me something to eat . Give me something to eat . BROTHER FRANCIS ( Excitedly : ) Yes , yes . Its warmth is a kind of hunger . I have a love for all things in fur , feathers and scales , but I have not less a love for the fire that warms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Look how it reaches for it . Wicked ? Wicked ? Never . ISOLA But , Brother Francis , it will it will ( The flames suddenly seize the cloak . Francis rises , wrapped in fire . ) Brother Francis , you are on fire ! Mother , Mother ! ( She rushes from the hut and returns with her mother . Annunziata snatches the fur from Brother Francis and throws it into the hearth . ) BROTHER FRANCIS ( Still standing ecstatically with lifted hands : ) Eat , Brother Fire . I knew you wanted this . I knew that you loved me too . ( He looks about him ; then ruefully to Annunziata ) Sister , you have spoiled his supper . ANNUNZIATA ( With somber and averted face : ) I do not know what you mean . Here is your bowl of broth . Sit down and eat it . BROTHER FRANCIS Sister , do not be angry with me. p. 5 ANNUNZIATA ( Breaking out : ) Come now , should we kill everything , the animals for their furs , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire ? Is it not enough that it takes our good pine tree by our road ? There , that is logic , Brother Francis . BROTHER FRANCIS Bring me not logic , sister . She is the least of the handmaids of Love . I am often troubled when she speaks . ANNUNZIATA Must we give what makes us often warm for that which makes us warm only for a moment ? BROTHER FRANCIS ( Waving his wooden spoon about humorously : ) My mind is strangely light tonight , like the flames that play about the relics of Saint James . I could wander again through the whole night . ANNUNZIATA Where is your mother that she should watch over you ? Had I not these other duties I should leave everything and watch over you myself . BROTHER FRANCIS She is in Paradise with a golden crook , leading the flames that died of hunger in this wicked world . She leads them to pasture on drifts of dried leaves . Look , Isola , I know that there is flame to burn all evil in the Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but I know also that fire is at all times useful to the great Blessed . It surrounds them and they dwell in it . And even now ( And so on. )
