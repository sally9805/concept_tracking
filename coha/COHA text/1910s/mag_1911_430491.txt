 | IN any review of the men who are piloting England through her present unexampled difficulties , it is inevitable that one should begin with the Prime Minister . But II must own to a certain diffidence in doing so . I do not know Mr. Asquith ; I have never exchanged a word with him . I have , however , heard and read a great many of his speeches ; I have watched his career pretty closely from the time he was introduced into public life as one of Mr. Gladstone 's discoveries ; I have constantly sat above him in the House of Commons ; and I have been moderately well placed for finding out what the average man , in and out of Parliament , says and thinks of him . The real Mr. Asquith may , of course , be very different from my outside estimate of him ? one sees inevitably only the worst side of a public man in public . But , such as it is , it is at least unprejudiced and independent . Asquith is one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the moment he entered his teens , he has been not merely distinguished , but supreme among his contemporaries . As a boy he took all the school prizes . As a youth he won the blue riband of classical scholarship , the Balliol , became president of the Oxford Union , ? the famous debating society of the University , ? took a " double first , " carried off the Craven scholarship , and so impressed his professors and fellow graduates , from Dr. Jowett downwards , that perhaps no man ever left Oxford amid so many or such confident predictions of a brilliant future . He matured early , and a character sketch of him in those Oxford years would probably need little modification in detail and none at all in essentials to-day . A companionable youth among his chosen associates , but at no pains to be popular or ingratiating outside his own circle ; a hard reader , and nothing of an athlete , with few recreations beyond whist , chess , and talk ; a lucid , confident , somewhat arrogant , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few swore by and many , perhaps , were more inclined to swear at , but of whose ability , directness , strength of character , and dry , triumphant adequacy there could be no question ? such was Asquith thirty-five years ago , and such , in the fundamentals of mind and temperament , he remains to-day . Asquith a Self-Made Man Asquith has made his own way in life . A Yorkshireman of Puritan stock , born in moderate circumstances , he started out with none of those advantages of family influences and connections and high social position that in England , more perhaps than in any other country , smooth the path of professional and political ambition . He had his full share of the ordinary anxieties and difficulties of the briefless barrister , and he alleviated them , as do most briefless barristers , by journalism and lecturing . It was during this period of trial and uncertainty , when he was still only five-and-twenty , with his career all to make , that he took a step which the Asquith of the popular imagination ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have taken : he married . One has to remember that . One has to remem-  | ber also that years afterwards he sought and won , as his second wife , Miss Margot Tennant , perhaps the most brilliant and the keenestwitted woman in the British Isles . And , further , one must bear in mind all the reports that reach one of his staunchness as a friend , his pride in the achievements of his gifted son , his sociability and considerateness as a host and companion . Asquith , after all , is human . That softer , warmer , more emotional side of him is not non-existent merely because the outer world is rarely , if ever , allowed to see it . It is a quarter of a century since Mr. Asquith , became something of a national figure . He unsuccessfully but very ably defended John Burns when he was arrested in connection with the Trafalgar Square riots of 1887 ? the same John Burns who is now President of the Local Government Board in the Cabinet of which Mr. Asquith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-four , entered Parliament . The British House of Commons , unlike the American House of Representatives , does not as a rule take kindly to lawyers , but Asquith gained its ear at once . I t was not , however , as a politician , but as an advocate , that he first  | later the famous Parnell Commission gave him his great chance . It fell to Mr. Asquith to cross-examine Mr. Macdonald , the manager of the Times . He did so with a masterly , merciless completeness that caught the popular fancy , was highly approved of by the profession , and put Mr. Asquith among the first flight of English lawyers . Used His Powers for Reform as Home Secretary From that moment his star rose rapidly . He began to figure in all the great cases , in society , and in Parliament . Mr. Gladstone conceived a warm regard and admiration for his qualities , and in 1892 , when the Liberals returned to power , made him Home Secretary . He proved himself a strong , competent , and open-minded administrator ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmness that lifted him at once altogether out of the ruck of time-serving politicians ; and the freshness and vigor with which he stretched his official powers in the cause of social reform , in fighting sweating and overcrowding , and in protecting the health and industrial interests of the working classes , made him the idol of Labor and penetrated the national consciousness with a new sense of its social responsibilities . In 1895 , when the Conservatives came back into office , Mr. Asquith returned to his law practice , and for some years afterwards took only a casual , but always a prominent , part in politics . Throughout the Boer War he ranged himself with the Rosebery group of Liberals , and steadily supported his political opponents in a cause which he held to be above party . But it was not , I think , until Mr. Chamberlain , in 1903 , launched his fiscal programme that the country took the full measure of Mr. Asquith 's abilities . The controversy precisely suited his trenchant , lucid style . Eight years ago he was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept , so little did any one expect to see it reopened ? who really knew why they were Free-Traders . He at once took up Mr. Chamberlain 's challenge , dogged his footsteps from town to town , and answered him speech for speech and point for point until it almost looked as if the issue would resolve itself into a gladiatorial combat between the two men . Asquith 's Rise to the Premiership The great wave that in 1906 carried the Liberals to power in unprecedented force landed Mr. Asquith in the second highest post in the ministerial hierarchy , the Chancellorship of the Exchequer . Already it was clear that he was a predestined Premier . Within his own party he had no rival , no one who united as he did the range , the abilities , and the kind of hold upon the people that are essential qualifications for the highest office of all . When Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman early in 1908 laid down the reins , King Edward merely interpreted the universal expectation of the party and the people in summoning Mr. Asquith to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two general elections and amid a momentous Constitutional crisis , he has guided the nation and the Empire with an efficiency , an authority , and a determination that have stamped him as one of the foremost of living Englishmen . Asquith has in an abundant degree the combative qualities that a party leader must have to be successful . He is a first-class fighting man , always supremely sure of himself , never at a loss for an effective retort , never far below the top of his form , and able to bring all his guns into action at a moment 's notice . For pungency , vigor , concise and clean-cut compression , and a wealth of sonorous and cogent diction , there is nobody in the House of Commons to equal him . However damaging the attack upon the Government , there is a cheer of perfect confidence from the Liberal ranks when Asquith gets up to answer it . The stocky figure of medium height , the strong , clean-shaven , fresh-complexioned face that belies the white hair above it , give out an instant impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opposition , the Prime Minister . begins to speak . There is no appeal to passion in what he says , no loose generalities , no attempt at rhetoric , nothing subtle or bewildering . The sentences roll out with a hammer-like precision ; the points made are direct and unambiguous ; the argument never wanders ; the humor is of the plain knockdown British brand ; the language is massive without being ornate and virile without being overstrained ; one gets the effect of some perfect machine producing an almost effortless fusillade of logical , ordered dialectics . How a Man Without Enthusiasms Leads Enthusiasts I have , indeed , known Asquith to succeed , by a speech of pitiless , piled-up lucidity and compactness , in lashing his party into an enthusiasm such as even Mr. Gladstone could not always evoke . But the enthusiasm was wholly intellectual ; the cheers were for the achievement , not for the man . For , while his speeches in their way are models of what public speaking  | should be , they are not oratory . They lack the tone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true oratory . Mr. Asquith always seems to know almost too well just what he is going to say and how he is going to say it . He never appears to be in the slightest danger of being carried out of himself . One could imagine him speaking equally well to no audience at all , or to an audience of broomsticks . The bloodless rigidity of excellence that runs through all his efforts seems to be independent of all spiritual communion between the speaker and those whom he is speaking to . It would be , perhaps , unfair to say that the party of all the enthusiasms is led by the man with none . Mr. Asquith 's Liberalism is not only a strongly held and closely reasoned creed : it is also an instinct , a vital part of the man himself , the sincerity of which is beyond question . At the same time , and by comparison with large sections of his party and with some of his principal lieutenants , the opinions , the manner , the whole bearing and attitude of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is scrupulous of the dignities and traditions of his high office , of the decencies and amenities of Parliamentary debate , of the repute and decorum of public life ; and of by no means all of his associates can as much be said . However much they may differ from his views and policies , all Englishmen are at one in feeling that the great succession of British Premiers suffers no deterioration in Mr. Asquith , and that his manliness , his impeccable honesty both of mind and character , and his great experience of affairs and his unfailing competence are assets , particularly in such critical times as these , of the first value to the State . But he is not a popular man . He has little of the " magnetism " that Americans prize so highly in their politicians . The insufficiency at which I have glanced in his speeches is equally noticeable in the man himself . Lord Rosebery has gone bail for it that Mr. Asquith has qualities of heart even more remarkable than his qualities of head , and those who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really as austere as he seems . But the average man remains slightly sceptical . He finds in Mr. Asquith a lack of expansiveness , one whose drawbridge is rarely down , whose amiable and appealing weaknesses , if he has any , are rarely visible . His political manner is not ingratiating . There is about him a warning air that fools will not be suffered gladly . Men accuse him of the superiority which is commonly associated with Oxford . They suspect that his inclination is to treat stupidity as a sort of crime . He holds himself almost too well in hand ; he is barricaded almost too completely against the possibility of committing an indiscretion ; he has measured his capabilities to a nicety that seems positively excessive ; the monotony of his hard , high , and constant success is almost too metallic for human nature 's daily food . Just as one misses in his oratory the touch and tone that would fuse and elevate the whole , so in the man one sighs , at times , for the glow and the mellow streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suspected of Caring Too Much About Blue China Mr. Balfour , his principal antagonist and closest friend , and the leader of the Opposition @#  | in the House of Commons , is a very different type of man . It is thirty-seven years since he entered Parliament . Even then he was a marked man . Not only was he Lord Salisbury 's nephew , but he had made a reputation on his own account . It was not , to be sure , a reputation of the kind that every young man of sixand-twenty would care to have . Mr. Balfour was suspected of being something of a dandy and a good deal of a dilettante . Tales of the enormous hours he would lie in bed , of his passion for blue china , BurneJones , and golf , and of the various nicknames he had earned among the robust undergraduates of Cambridge , used to float about the lobbies of the House . His tall , willowy frame , and a face that was attractive but not strong , bore out his reputation . His manners seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an air of the utmost nonchalance , his long legs crossed in front of him , his head resting on the back of the bench , his eyes peacefully surveying the ceiling . I t was most difficult for the stolid British householder to detect the makings of a statesman beneath such a show of airy negligence . The House laughed at him and his languid ways . Few , if any , saw in him anything but an amiable and indolent aesthete who had strayed i n t o politics by accident , who would soon tire of the game and bury himself once more among his books and china . Balfour was quick to master the parry and thrust of Parliamentary debate , and , as the nephew of a Prime Minister who never neglected the political interests of his relatives , he stepped almost as a matter of course into one of the minor Ministerial offices . But he had been in Parliament a dozen years or more before anything happened to make one think that a brilliant career was in store for him . His chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill health to retire from the Irish Secretaryship , and Mr. Balfour was chosen as his successor . The appointment was one of the greatest surprises ever sprung in modern English politics . That this slim , delicate " philosopher " should essay the most difficult and engrossing office in the service of the British Crown , an office that had killed Mr. Forster and turned Sir George Trevelyan 's hair white and broken down Sir Michael Hicks-Beach , seemed incredible to the point of laughter . " Pretty Fanny " and the Irish Nationalists It was a momentous day when Mr. Balfour took his seat on the front bench , among the derisive howls of the Irish Nationalists and t h e dubious encouragement of his friends . Lord Salisbury , however , had made no mistake . The mistake was made by the Irish members when they prophesied that " Pretty Fanny " would be either out of his office or in his grave in three months . They did their best to make good their threat , but they had yet to learn their man . Mr. Balfour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was phenomenal . He never let himself be " drawn . " They could make no headway against his unvarying good humor . An aristocrat to the finger-tips , he governed Ireland on the highly aristocratic principle of treating it as a nursery of ill-conditioned children , who had to be coerced into obedience ; and in the House he simply smiled while the Irish members raged .  | Three months went by , and he had neither died nor resigned . On the contrary , he had ceased to be " Pretty Fanny . " He was now the " base , bloody , and brutal Balfour , " and history was ransacked for tyrants and oppressors to compare him with . All this passed by the Chief Secretary like the idle wind . His glacial indifference , his measured , stinging sarcasms , wore them down . I t was in all ways a remarkable personal triumph , hailed both by the party and the country with almost exaggerated fervor . Balfour came out of it mentally hardened , physically made over , a new and vigorous man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. W. H.  | Smith in 1891 , his accession to the leadership of the House of Commons was undisputed . Eleven years later , when Lord Salisbury resigned at the time of King Edward 's coronation , Mr. Balfour became leader of the whole Conservative party and Prime Minister of England . His warmest admirers , I imagine , would hardly contend that Mr. Balfour has been as great a success as Prime Minister or as leader of the Conservative party as he was as Irish Secretary . He seems to be one of those men who need opposition to brace them . With his back to the wall , hemmed in by his foes , he displays the tenacity of a Scotchman and the guile and resourcefulness of an Irishman . But as the captain of an overpowering majority in the House of Commons he repeatedly made blunders that only the strength and discipline of his followers kept from being catastrophes . There is a strain of weakness or indifferentism , if not of petulance or fretfulness , in him somewhere that seems to warp his judgment and sap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed . A past master in the art of conducting a defence or a retreat , he is flaccid and hesitating in attack . So long as he remains in politics the Conservatives can have no other leader . They know it and admit it . Yet I doubt whether any leader was ever regarded with such mingled despair and admiration , admiration for his parts and personality , despair for the lack of force and strenuousness and decision that at times goads his more militant followers almost into revolt . Balfour Not a Man of Action Within four years of his accession to the Premiership he allowed his party and his government to drift to the greatest electoral disaster that has been known in the annals of British politics . In 1909 he sanctioned , approved , and instigated the action of the House of Lords in throwing out the Budget for the year , an action which precipitated the Constitutional crisis in which Great Britain is still desperately entangled . Since then there have been two General Elections , and in each one of them Mr. Balfour has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to earth , would hardly recognise in the broken , Protectionist , referendum-advocating , and purely opportunist party of to-day the mighty , triumphant , and steadfast host that he committed less than ten years ago to his nephew 's charge . It was Mr. Chamberlain 's plunge into tariff reform that showed Mr. Balfour 's defects most clearly . He was then Prime Minister . But he would neither embrace the new doctrine nor disavow it . He took refuge instead in a mist of subtleties and evasions through which no pursuer proved able to track him . He subordinated everything to gaining time and saving the party from irrevocable disruption . The consummate ingenuity with which he avoided every trap and every peril , baffled all inquiries , " cornered " the Opposition , and wrapped friend and foe alike in a fog of brilliant and bewildering sophistries , constituted a Parliamentary performance of the utmost dexterity . But it was not a performance of the kind that attracted the people . To them it seemed shifty , disingenuous , and feeble ; and the tidal wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owed much of its impetus to Mr. Balfour 's " tactics . " Even to-day , after eight years of the fiscal controversy , there is hardly an Englishman who could say with any confidence what Mr. Balfour 's views are . The Protectionists of his own party do not really trust him . His pledge to submit a Tariff Reform Budget to a Referendum before it becomes law seems to them , indeed , very much like shelving , or evading , responsibility for the whole question . The Liberal Free-Traders , on the other hand , still affect to believe that Mr. Balfour is a Free-Trader at heart and in his moments of unguarded instinct would talk Free Trade as naturally as Mr. Asquith . And the uncertainty is not due to any want of mental candor or of mental trenchancy in Mr. Balfour . His books show not only a keen and honest but a positive intellect . But it is an intellect of the kind that is most positive when it is most agnostic , and most trenchant when it is most concerned to justify an attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertility find their freest field in the work of critical destruction . There are few settled questions for Mr. Balfour ; his strongest intellectual conviction is , perhaps , a denial of the finality or permanence of anything . That subtle , supple , spacious , free-roving mind of his affirms little , analyses all things , and hardly finds a firm refuge anywhere . A Statesman Should Not Think Too Much For a leader in the hurly-burly of politics such a mental equipment as this is not always an advantage . Politics are for the one-idea 'd men , or at any rate for the men with only one idea at a time . To the plain party man , pining for a clear lead , Mr. Balfour 's refinements seem to smack of casuistry , and his hesitations , which are really the fruit of his scrupulous intellectual honesty , to argue an incurable vacillation . And if Mr. Balfour 's cast of mind thus handicaps  | him , so also does his temperament . He is not a pachyderm like Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman , nor has he anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the leisurely disposition that often goes with a quick-moving mind . Music , pictures , literature , philosophy , and golf compete for possession of him with the attractions of politics . Largely and unavoidably , the work of leadership is against the grain . The continuous , petty , chafing strain , the constant attendance at the House , the multitude of little details that have to be seen to , ? and Mr. Balfour hates details and figures and minutiae of all kinds , ? the necessity of listening to the cranks that find their way to Westminster ? all this , to a man of Mr. Balfour 's wide and delicate culture and extreme sensitiveness , must seem like a daily foretaste of the inferno . Hardly a winter comes around that he does not break down under it and take to his bed and a diet of hot gruel . Balfour 's Great Personal Popularity How is it , then , that he manages to retain his easy , indisputable ascendancy ? Well , in the first place , the Conservatives have no one like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his long and intimate experience of Parliamentary life and business , his noble gift of oratory , and his flashing , luminous , versatile mind . And , in the second place , the man himself , the extraordinary charm and sweetness and sympathy of his character , make him the most warmly liked member in the whole House . The House of Commons is not a body that gives its esteem or affections lightly . Mr. Balfour has won its regard by deserving it . The House is his natural sphere . He needs an audience that will catch the lightest shades and appreciate the most delicate turns to bring out all his powers . Then the quick play of humor and fancy , the exquisite retort that tickles while it demolishes , the strong , cool , persuasive reasoning , and at times the honest , irrepressible indignation , especially when a friend or colleague is unfairly attacked , make a matchless Parliamentary performance . The country , while he has never roused , as other and lesser men have often roused , its passionate enthusiasm , yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to a public man who is transparently incapable of anything low or mean , and not only sets a high standard himself but makes others live up to it by the mere influence of atmosphere . But at Westminster he has endeared himself k both sides of the most critical Chamber in the world by a hundred bonds of real , personal affection . Mr. Gladstone loved him as a son . His perfect courtesy to opponents , those little touches of chivalry that count for so much in an excitable and disputatious assembly , his disdain for mere personalities and the instant elevation of tone that his disdain engenders , have done more even than his gifts of mind and speech to establish him in the first place in the sentiments not only of his own party but of the whole House . If he is not a great leader , he is an irresistible critic , a fine intellect , an engaging , even a fascinating , character , and a great gentleman . The Wonderful Welshman Two men could hardly differ more completely in opinions , upbringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Balfour and Mr. Lloyd-George . The former is an aristocrat , a Scotchman , a member by right of birth of the governing class , a man of wealth who has never had to work for a living , a product , and an exceptionally fine one , of the best education that Great Britain has to offer . The latter is a Welshman , born in humble circumstances , a " man of the people " in every sense , whose life has been a constant and triumphant battle , and who has picked up for himself such knowledge as he possesses of the things that no amount of contact with life can teach . Twenty-odd years ago an obscure lawyer in a small Welsh country town ; to-day Chancellor of the Exchequer , the idol of his countrymen , and one of the most powerful , in some ways the most powerful , influence in British public life ? the bare record of his career from the village green to Downing Street is enough by itself to arrest one 's instantaneous attention and to proclaim a man far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock , Mr. LloydGeorge 's father was for most of his life a schoolmaster , and only reverted to the soil when his health demanded an out-of-door existence . Dying while still a young man , he left his widow and two children almost wholly unprovided for , and Mr. Lloyd-George 's earliest recollection is of his home and furniture being sold up . An uncle , who was the shoemaker and unsalaried Baptist preacher in a village in North Wales , took charge of the family , and it was there , in a district saturated with the history and romance of the country , that Lloyd-George grew up , a quick-witted , high-spirited lad , disciplined by severely straitened circumstances , speaking both the Welsh and English tongues , and an eager listener at the informal parliament of neighbors and peasants that foregathered in the cobbler 's workshop , there to discuss theology and politics , ? they go together in Wales , ? the iniquities of landlordism , and the oppres-  | siveness of a social system that seemed to care so little for human life and happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passionate Patriot " of Wales Those early years have left an ineffaceable mark on the Chancellor of the Exchequer . It was then that he imbibed a spirit of passionate and poetic patriotism for Vales , and all that Vales contains of lonely lake and mist-clad mountain and rushing stream and ancient haunts of chivalry and romance . It was then that there was implanted in him a fiery and abiding sense of compassion for the disinherited , the " under dog , " the millions who toil and ineffectively murmur . The iron of poverty entered into his soul , not to corrode it with unavailing bitterness , but to sting it with indignation and revolt . He was a born rebel . He is a  | rebel still . There is perhaps no man in the British Isles to whom the smugness and conventions , the appalling contrasts and inequalities , the buttressed authorities and arrangements of life in Great Britain are more absolutely repugnant . There is no man in whom the religion of humanity is more incarnate . Lloyd-George 's Start in the Law That admirable man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lifetime to prepare his nephew for the law , and together they quarried out of old dictionaries and grammars and text-books the knowledge that enabled him to pass the necessary examinations . At sixteen he was duly articled to a firm of solicitors ; at twenty-one he had qualified as a solicitor himself . The expense had completely drained his exchequer ; he had not even the fifteen dollars to buy the robes without which he could not practise in court . But success was not long in coming . A case of a kind peculiarly calculated to appeal to Welsh sentiment ? a case involving the right of a Nonconformist to be buried in the graveyard of the local Episcopal church ? was brought to him , and his conduct of it made him the hero of the neighborhood . " Should the vicar , " he told the village , " refuse to open the gates , then break down the wall which your subscriptions have built , force your way into the churchyard , reopen the grave , and bury the old man by his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its legality was confirmed by the highest court in the realm . In a few years Lloyd-George had built up one of the largest practices in North Wales . But the law never engrossed him . He joined debating societies ; he plunged into the movement against the payment of tithes ; he stumped the countryside on behalf of land reform and temperance ; and , when the County Councils came into being , he roused the peasantry to shake off " the old feudal yoke of squirearchy , " and was himself elected to the Council of Carnal-vonshire . A new Wales was born in the stress of that campaign . The spirit of Welsh nationalism and Welsh democracy awoke once more ; the old order of things , that permitted Wales to be represented in the Imperial Parliament by landlords and commercial magnates or imported carpet-baggers , who neither spoke the language of the people nor had the wit or knowledge to look after their special interests , was clearly breaking up , and it was as an impassioned advocate of Welsh patriotism and the common Welsh people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elected to the House of Commons . He Has Made the Welsh Effective in Politics It is too much to say that Lloyd-George has made a nation . But it is not too much to say that he has made that nation for the first time politically effective and politically conscious of itself . He marshalled the Welsh forces in Parliament into a single whole , and led them with a vigor and brilliancy not surpassed by Parnell . He pressed forward Welsh claims and rights as they had never been pressed before and against both the chief English parties in turn ; he withstood even Gladstone for the sake of Wales . Could he have had his way , a Welsh party , absolutely independent of any English connections , biassed in favor of the Liberals but by no means annexed to them , would have been evolved . As it was , he passed over from the tributary of Welsh nationalism to the broader stream M British Liberalism , without , however , parting with one jot of his localised patriotism . " Gallant little Wales " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On all questions of domestic politics his voice is the voice of the Principality . He is as Welsh as O'Connell was Irish ? more so , indeed , because he speaks the native tongue of the people . One would have to go back to the days of Owen Glendower to discover a leader who has won to an equal degree the enthusiasm that Mr. LloydGeorge commands among his warm-hearted and impressionable countrymen . It took but a few years for Mr. Lloyd-George to stamp himself on the House of Commons as a master of Parliamentary strategy and a daring , brilliant , biting swashbuckler of debate , the only man , indeed , on the Liberal side who could stand up to Joseph Chamberlain and return him blow for blow undismayed . He had from the first the three indispensable qualifications for political success ? courage , the incommunicable gift of seizing the occasion and attracting notice , and , lastly , an unwearied assiduity . And to these attributes he added a pervasive and irrepressible humor , passion , sincerity , the legal eye for a weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a wholly Celtic touch of idealism , zealotry , and imagination . The Boer War was the event that first brought him into really national prominence . He made himself the most intensely hated of all pro-Boers ; he was mobbed more than once ; it was only by desperate shifts that on one occasion he escaped being killed . But the English are not a resentful people , and they admire courage . When they think to-day of the war and Mr. Lloyd-George 's part in it , they think  | of a man who , however misguided , wrongheaded , and mischievous , had at any rate the supreme political courage to stake his career on his conscience . The ordeal of those exciting years did much to mature his powers , and hardly had the war ended than the Education Bill of 1902 gave him yet ampler scope for pungent attack . As a Welshman and as a Nonconformist it bitterly offended him , and he threw himself upon it with a dash and vehemence that thrilled his countrymen with something of the fervor of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little less than a rebellion against the enforcement of the Act . When the Tariff Reform movement was launched , Mr. Lloyd-George found another opportunity to hand . He shared with Mr. Asquith and Mr. Winston Churchill the distinction of being the most effective and sparkling of all the upholders of Free Trade . Lloyd-George " the Business Man of the Cabinet " That was the close of the first stage of LloydGeorge 's public career . The second opened in 1906 , when , on the return of the Liberals to power , he became president of the Board of Trade . There were many who gasped when the fiery young Welshman , the consummate mob-orator whose name had become a synonym for all that was most tumultuous in politics , was entrusted with the care of British industry and commerce . His appointment was the last appointment " the City " would have thought of . Yet none turned out so supremely well . Among many successful Ministers , he proved the most successful . In two years he raised a comparatively minor office to the highest level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed some bold and beneficent measures ; he tackled and solved problems that his predecessors had found insoluble ; he showed himself to be beyond comparison the business man of the Cabinet . When it was known that Mr. Lloyd-George had taken up a question , people ceased to worry about it . It grew to be almost an article of faith with the masses and in the world of business , that he could not fail . From the presidency of the Board of Trade he passed to the Chancellorship of the Exchequer . As such he devised the momentous Budget of 1909 , with its heavy super-taxes , the capture of part of the " unearned increment " of land , and its swinging duties on licenses . As such he has made himself the supreme advocate of the " condition of the people " question and of all measures of social reform . As such , too , he has surpassed all his colleagues in the vehemence , almost the virulence , of his attacks upon the House of Lords . No man in Great Britain has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of handling them to the utmost limit of emotion . The Representative of Newer England There are at least six Lloyd-Georges . There is the Lloyd-George who lets himself go among his beloved Welsh hills with an exuberance of poetic and half-mystical declamation that makes the ordinary Englishman mutter something about the " Celtic temperament . " There is the Lloyd-George , the Cabinet Minister , persuasive , polite , sagacious , pertinent , and conciliatory . There is the Lloyd-George , the administrator , composing disputes partly by his great tact and experience , partly by his almost instantaneous perception of what is essential as well as of what is possible , and partly by the reflex action of his open and winning personality upon those with whom he is dealing . There is the LloydGeorge who holds forth upon Liberalism and social miseries and the " idle rich " with restrained , semi-religious fervor . And there is the Lloyd-George , the often vulgar , the often ranting , but always conquering demagogue , who plays upon vast audiences with the touch of another Cleon , and seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , decency , justice on their side , so long as they are effective . And , finally , there is Lloyd-George the man , the warm-hearted , practical idealist , frank , engaging , and generous , as outspoken , cheery , and approachable to-day as when he was still an unknown novice . There is a tremendous air of life about him . He has something of Mr. Roosevelt 's tingling alertness and far more than the ex-President 's stock of geniality . Though he always hits his hardest , he is utterly destitute of malice and pettiness . He belongs altogether to the democracy of talent . One simply can not imagine him " putting on side " or cultivating the English habit of " condescension . " No man is so little hampered by formulae , or looks facts straighter in the face , or has so great a capacity for growth . Not a widely read man , not much of a thinker , he makes up for all deficiencies of culture and intellect by the intensity of his feelings and a sound , hardheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his nature , his candid , pouncing mind , the wholesome boyish streak that runs through all he says and does , the infectious freshness of his talk and outlook , his whole air of blithe com-  | radeship , combine to make him , if not the greatest , at any rate the most remarkable personality in British politics to-day . The Career of Lord Lansdowne If Mr. Lloyd-George may be taken as representative of the newer England , ? the England that judges men by what they are and do , and not by the non-essentials of birth or position or wealth , ? Lord Lansdowne , the leader of the Conservative party in the House of Lords , may stand equally well for a type of the older and more aristocratic England . Indeed , his whole career is a picture in little of the British system . I t is a part of that system that men in ancient lineage and great possessions should look upon office as a birthright , should find the path to public activity and distinction thrown invitingly open to their footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political axiom that they simply can not be got rid of . Lord Lansdowne 's record is a proof of how much experience and an early initiation into public life may do for even an average man , and of how important , how almost vital ; it is in England to get the right start . There is no country I know of in which it is so difficult for a man to rise by his own exertions . On the other hand , and as a natural corollary , those who are born into a settled position in England , who inherit a title and an estate and the means to support both , have what is perhaps the easiest and most delightful existence to be met with in Europe . Lord Lansdowne began with the supreme initial advantage of being the son of his father . It is an old and distinguished family that goes back to the Conquest and beyond. , Losing his father in boyhood , Lord Landsowne came into the family titles , ? there are some fourteen of them , ? the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasures of Bowood and Lansdowne House and 15o,000 acres of land , and a seat in the House of Lords , on his twentyfirst birthday . Three years later he added vastly to his wealth and his social influence by marrying the eldest daughter of the Duke I , f Abercorn . With such a start failure is difficult . Lord Lansdowne had only to let it be known that he wanted an office for an office to be given him . In the Under-Secretaryships that were immediately provided for him he did nothing distinguished and nothing foolish . His first real test came when , in his thirty-eighth year , he went to Canada as Governor-General . Little is expected from a Governor-General beyond the capacity to appear to govern . Lord Lansdowne BROOKS 135 possessed that capacity , and knew how to adorn it . An excellent French scholar , he scored a great hit by addressing the FrenchCanadians in their native tongue and with a flawless Parisian accent . He put down Louis Riel 's rebellion , was the first Governor-General to cross the Rockies on metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . The Boer War Fiasco From Canada he proceeded to the Viceroyalty of India . He proved an eminently safe , competent , and unexciting ruler of the great dependency . Returning home , he became Secretary for War , and as such had to bear the odium for the catastrophes and bunglings of the Boer War . A dozen years ago all England was clamoring for his Lordship 's official head . It was proved by a deadly accumulation of evidence that , though he entered the War Office four years before Mr. Kruger 's ultimatum , and had thus ample time to foresee and prepare , he did , if possible , less than nothing ; that he was as blind as a mole to the signs of the coming crisis ; that warnings the most earnest and emphatic filtered through him as through a sieve ; that he disregarded the advice of his professional colleagues ; that his policy , in short , was to let the morrow take care of itself , to slide as comfortably through the day 's routine as might be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other country would have been decisive . But , in strict accordance with the workings of the British system , Lord Lansdowne . having lamentably failed in one office , was immediately given another and better one . He became in 1900 Secretary for Foreign Affairs , and in that office he more than redeemed himself . He made , it is true , not a few mistakes . His handling of the Boxer difficulty was far inferior in humanity , foresight , and practicality to Mr. John Hay 's , and he steered Great Britain straight into the Venezuelan mess of 1903 under circumstances that made every Englishman 's ears tingle . On the other hand , he contributed effectively to the many influences that were making for an Anglo-French entente , and when confronted in 1901 with the alternative of a Russo-Japanese or an Anglo-Japanese alliance , he boldly elected to cut loose from tradition and to execute the most momentous curve In British policy of the past half century . On Lord Salisbury 's death in 1902 , Lord Lansdowne succeeded to the leadership of the Conservative party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it in his power to reject any  | measure sent up by the Liberal majority in the House of Commons during the past five years . With one exception , he has used his power with caution and discretion . But the rejection of the Budget in 1909 ? a proceeding that Lord Salisbury would never have sanctioned ? was a blunder the effects of which will be felt , have indeed already been felt , from top to bottom of the whole British Constitutional system . In himself as in his career Lord Lansdowne is an excellent type of the great English seigneur . A prudent , polished , naturally dignified man , of cultivated tastes , fond of sport , with a lucid though in no ways a profound mind , of a reserved disposition that nothing has yet been known to ruffle , of a fine instinctive courtesy , always pertinent and pointed in his speeches , magnificently self-possessed , with the saving grace of humor , and altogether contemptuous of the arts of advertising ? his right to a foremost place in that " governing class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impeachment . While not in the least a great man his abilities are thoroughly respectable , and for more than forty years , in spite of every inducement to a life of easy leisure , they have been placed , with hardly a thought of self , at the service of the State . Burns ' History Proves that the World Moves Fast Over against Lord Lansdowne , and in sharpest contrast to him , one may put the redoubtable figure of Mr. John Burns . Two decades ago England rang with the terror of his name . To-day moderate men give thanks that so steady and conservative a man should be at the head of the Local Government Board . He used to stand in the public mind for all that was incendiary , visionary , and revolutionary . Today men look upon him as a firm brake on the runaway coach of Labor . He is the first workingman to reach Cabinet rank in England . For many years he was the idol of his class ; he is now regarded by a large section of it with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Commons , indeed , tilt at no one as they tilt at John Burns . They fling his old speeches in his face ; they brand him as a traitor ; they fulminate with passionate extravagance against the conduct of his office . And John Burns meets them and handles them without gloves . He loves a fight . Nothing pleases him better than to fall upon some pet project of the Labor men and tear it to pieces . He is at his best when hitting the hardest , and , by a happy instinct for the picturesque , he always seems to reserve his most formidable blows for the members of the party from which he h as graduated . He fairly stamps upon them . Confident , ruthless , supremely self-reliant , a master of the pithy phrase , and a born fighter , there are few men in the House or out of it who can hold their own with John Burns in the rough and tumble of debate . His career has been one of storm and toil . He began life as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy with his mother dependent upon him . It must have been the Scotch blood in him that made him so passionate to educate himself . The passion has lasted . There are few men in England with a larger or a more thoroughly digested library on social and economic questions ; there is no man in England who has studied the lives of the poor at such close range or with a more understanding sympathy . His little home in Battersea is a book-store from cellar to garret , and its owner has not only read but mastered its contents , and can draw on all he has gathered from it for instantaneous service . Young ' Burns and His Red Flag Even before he was twenty he had made himself known as a stump orator on Clapham  | Common and a pungent letter-writer to the local papers . The economics of poverty , problems of housing , the workings of the poor law , the causes of unemployment , the organisation of industry ? he took to such topics as readily as most boys of his age and class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not for slackness or inefficiency , but because they did not care to have a bitter , active propagandist of Socialism and discontent on their pay-rolls . Flung into the ranks of the unemployed and boycotted by the ring of engineering masters , Burns threw himself wholly into the work of agitation . In the ' 80 's he made himself known all over London as the leader of the unemployed , " the man with the red flag . " He was frequently arrested ; he was once actually imprisoned ; for all well-todo people his name became synonymous with anarchy , riots , and spoliation . A change began to come over John Burns when he was elected to the London Common Council . The agitator turned by degrees into the administrator . He was the only Labor representative on the Council , and his experience , sanity , and good humor quickly made themselves felt . He proved himself an indefatigable Councillor , inspecting and inquiring into everything on his own account , and securing reform after reform in the treatment and wages of the Council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parks , drainage works , asylums , public control of the London street-car system , the erection of artisans ' dwellings , and so on . When he entered Parliament in 1892 , he found the same sort of work waiting to be done on a far larger scale . He gained the ear of the House at once ? first , because he never spoke without having something to say ; secondly , because the breezy , vigorous confidence of the man , his sincerity and enthusiasm , made indifference impossible ; and thirdly , because on many subjects he probably knew more at first hand than all the rest of the House put together . Everything that concerned the well-being and interests of the working classes found John Burns equipped at all points . A great deal of the social and industrial legislation of the past twenty years bears the mark of his influence , and you would have to search long and deep to come across another M. P. whose career has been so demonstrably useful and constructive . With his snow-white hair , his large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , BROOKS 137 his square and sturdy figure , his head thrown massively back , his whole bearing suggestive of power and combat , John Burns is a striking figure as he rises to address the House or as he tramps up and down the Terrace outside with free and swinging stride . But to see hint at his best you should see him some Saturday afternoon in one of the public parks , among his own people , giving and exchanging salutations , patting a youngster on the head , helping to fish out a ball that has fallen into the pond , showing a boy how to handle a cricket bat , skipping over the ropes with the girls , congratulating the mothers , jesting with the policemen ? the very picture of zest , health , and jollity . Burns the Biggest Product of the Working Classes The workingmen know him and love him . They recognise in him the biggest man that their class in England has vet produced . And John Burns knows them and loves them in return , and uses both his knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame them into elevating themselves . Himself a non-smoker and a total abstainer , he never shrinks from rubbing in his conviction that there is little the Government can do for the workingman compared with what the workingman can do for himself . No man has spoken out so strongly against drink and betting . No man has insisted more trenchantly that social and industrial reform must begin with the individual . It is there that he parts company with Keir Hardie and his followers . They are Socialists and look to the State for everything ; while John Burns hates nothing so much as the thought of the English workingman becoming a prey to that policy of pauperising coddle which the Labor party holds out as the highest social ideal . John Burns wishes to see the workingman brave , upright , and , above all , independent . From the very first he has had the profoundest contempt for the charity-mongers and the vicarious philanthropists whose plan of spoon-feeding the unemployed ends , as he says , " in the demoralisation of the donors and the degradation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English workingman of to-day is perhaps the greatest of the many anxious questions that the British people are now considering .
