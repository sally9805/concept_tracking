 | THE most popular of Shakspere 's comedies , the one most widely known , the one by means of which the most abundant success has been obtained on the stage , is " The - Ierchant of Venice . " No record exists statingwhen and where it was first produced . It is one of the twelve plays by Shakspere mentioned by Francis Meres in his " Palladis Tamia , WitsTreasury , " 1598 . It was entered at Stationers ' Hall in that year , first printed in iboo , reprinted the same year , ? each time in quarto , ? and not again printed till reproduced in the first folio , 1623 . In Philip Henslowe 's diary there is mention of the " Venesyan Comedy " as having been acted for the first time on August 25 , 1594 , but the authorship is not stated . If , as seems probable , that was Shakspere 's play , " The Merchant of Venice " has , in one form or another , been on the stage intermittently for three hundred and seventeen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Edward Alleyn , the distinguished actor who founded Dulwich College , where the diary is treasured , as it should be , because it is one of the most informative and useful of existing records relative to the drama in the time of Queen Elizabeth . If " The Merchant of Venice " was first acted on the date named by Henslowe , the performance occurred at Newington Butts , in Surrey ; for the players at that time , having been expelled from Southwark , had removed to that place , not distant from London . Between 1594 and the period of George Granville , Viscount Lansdowne ( 1667-1735 ) , who mutilated the comedy , and whose mutilation of it , first produced on January- 11 , 1701 , at Lincoln 's Inn Fields , was used in the theater for the ensuing forty years , the stage history of " The Merchant of Venice " is a blank . There is sufficient reason to believe that the first of the many performers who have appeared as Shylock was Richard Burbage , though nothing is known of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly @#  | be inferred from such imperfect knowledge as is possessed of his acting in general that he played the part in accordance with the serious spirit in which it is written . The elegy on his death ? as to the authenticity of a part of which there is , however , a reasonable doubt ? provides the information that in his dressing of Shylock he wore red hair , and J. Payne Collier declares that he also wore a long , false nose , such as was worn by Alleyn , the representative of Barrabas , in Christopher Marlowe 's " The Jew of Malta " ( acted in 1591 ) . If so , that fact would seem to indicate that Burbage laid particular stress , amounting , indeed , to caricature , on the Jewish physiognomy . Lansdowne 's perversion of Shakspere 's play is called " The Jew of Venice . " It is provided with a prologue , written by a person named Bevil Higgons , in which the ghosts of William Shakspere and John Dryden , crowned with laurel , deliver an inane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To-day we punish a stock - jobbing Jew . " In the second act several of the principal characters are assembled at a feast , and Shylock , sitting apart from the other persons , drinks a health , saying : " Money is my Mistress ! Here ' s to Interest upon Interest ! " This festival is prolonged by a dreary masque , called " Peleus and Thetis . " There are five acts in the Lansdowne hash , compounded of extracts , often garbled , from Shakspere 's text , and execrably bad verses by the adapter , the dominating purpose being to make Bassanio the chief part in the comedy . Shylock is made ludicrous and contemptible . The cast with which Lansdowne 's jumble was produced included Thomas Betterton , as Bassanio ; Barton Booth , as Gratiano ; John Verbruggen , as d ntonio ; Henry Harris , as the Duke of Venice ; Thomas Doggett , as Shylock ; Anne Bracegirdle , as Portia ; Mrs. Bowman , as Xerissa ; and Mary Porter , as Jessica ; by all accounts surely an extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of superb beauty . Betterton , incomparably the greatest actor of his time , never appeared as Shylock . Thomas Doggett , of whom it is recorded that he was " the first star " in the annals of the stage , made Shylock a low comedy part , especially in the colloquy with Tubal ; but particular description of his comicality has not been found . He was essentially comic actor . The comment that was made by Downes on that point is conclusive : " Mr. Doggett , on the stage , he ' s very aspectabund , wearing a farce in his face ; his thoughts deliberately framing his utterance congruous to his looks . He is the only comic original now 1708 extant : witness , Ben , Solon , Xickin , the Jew of Venice , &c."; Doggett died in 1721 . He was remarkable for care and correctness in the dressing of the characters that he assumed . Among the embodiments of Shylock that have established themselves permanently in theatrical annals are those that were given  | by Charles Macklin , John Henderson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Junius Brutus Booth , James William Wallack , Edwin Booth , Henry Irving , and Richard Mansfield . In the forty years preceding the time of Macklin , Shylock had been represented , when represented at all , which was not very often , only in Lansdowne 's version , and always as a low comedy part . Macklin reverted to Shakspere , revived the original play , discarding the Landsdowne deformity , and acted Shylock in a tragic spirit , achieving an immediate and prodigious success . The dress and make-up of Macklin included long , wide trousers , a loose , black gown , a three-cornered red hat , and a piqued beard . He probably wore red hair , as had been customary . Black hair was first worn in the part by Edmund Kean . Gray hair , the crown of the head being bald , was worn by Henry Irving . James William Wallack was the first actor to dress Shylock 's head with literally gray hair , which he did at the earnest request of his son , Lester Wallack . The exact age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a daughter of marriageable age ; in the trial scene he is called ' old Shylock " ; and he so designates himself : " Thou shalt see : thy eyes shall be the judge , the difference of old Shylock and Bassanio . " It is imperative to depict him as a man of fifty  | years or more . His visage , moreover , would naturally be marked by the lines of craft and seared by the seething fire of evil passions . Macklin 's embodiment of Shylock was grim and terrible . He was a man of sinister aspect . Quin , his contemporary , said that his face was marked not with lines , but with cordage . His eyes were dark and fiery ; his nose was aquiline and very prominent ; his jaws were large and heavy ; his mouth was wide ; his lower lip protruded ; his complexion was yellow ; his figure stout and formidable ; his voice harsh ; his temper arrogant . As Shylock , he incarnated malice and revenge , and therein he was true to Shakspere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation , to which various actors and commentators have succumbed , to provide the Jew with various redeeming human attributes . The notion that Shylock is , or was intended to be , a majestic type of the religious and racial grandeur of Israel appears to have germinated about the beginning of the nineteenth century . The German publicist Karl Ludwig Borne ( 1786 ? 1837 ) , writing about " The Merchant of Venice , " designated Shylock " an exalted Jew and an avenging angel , " not persecuting Antonio as the foe of usury , but as the foe of the Hebrew faith . Douglas Jerrold ( 1803 ? 1857 ) said of Edmund Kean as Shylock , that he impressed his audience " like a chapter of Genesis . " Thomas R. Gould , writing about the elder Booth as Shylock , declared that he made the part " the representative Hebrew . " That view is alluring to imaginative , sympathetic , ingenious students of this complex subject , and they are prone to read subtle meanings into the text of Shakspere ; but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , everything in the play confutes it . No word spoken by Shylock , and no word spoken about him , justifies the theory that he is " an avenging angel . " No part of his conduct justilies it , and , as an old proverb says , " Actions speak louder than words . " Shylock hates Antonio for several sufficient reasons , which are distinctly specified . He is a revengeful man , and he purposes to gratify his revengeful desire by committing murder under the sanction of legal form . Able and admirable representatives of Shylock , however much later than the time of Macklin , have deemed it essential to commend the character to public sympathy by investing it to some extent with paternal feeling and domestic virtue . Even George Frederick Cooke , the avowed disciple of Macklin , when delivering Shylock 's torrential expostulation , beginning " Hath not a Jew eyes ? " dwelt pathetically on the word " affections . " Henry Irving , after saying of Jessica , " I would my daughter were dead at my foot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my foot , and the ducats in her coffin ! " interjected , in tones of poignant @#  | anguish , " No , no , no , no , no ! " And Richard Mansfield , at the place where Shylock leaves his house to feast with his Christian enemies ( immediately subsequent to his passionate refusal to do so ) , made the father embrace his daughter Jessica and kiss her on the forehead ? that daughter who describes their house as " hell , " and testifies as to Shylock 's feelings and purposes , revealed in the privacy of his home : " When I was with him , I have heard him swear , To Tubal and to Chus , his countrymen , That he would rather have Antonio 's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he doth owe him . " Shylock has been grossly ill-treated by Antonio , stigmatized as a " cutthroat dog , " publicly spurned , insulted on the Exchange , ? the Rialto , ? kicked , spat upon , habitually reviled , treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; and Antonio ? " the good Antonio , " " the honest Antonio , " of whom it is said by one of his friends that " a kinder gentleman treads not the earth " ? has explicitly assured him of the likelihood of a continuance of the same ignominious treatment . Shylock accordingly hates Antonio with a malignant , implacable , natural hatred , and wishes to kill him ; and , opportunity presenting itself , Shylock speciously and treacherously induces Antonio to make a covenant , the breaking of which will , on the exaction of the nominated forfeiture , cost him his life . Shylock calls that covenant " a merry  | bond , " and signifies that even though Antonio should " ' break his day , " the penalty would not be exacted ; and this he does within a few moments of his private asseveration that , if he " can catch him once upon the hip , " he " will feed fat the ancient grudge " he bears him . From the first moment when he perceives even a glimmering chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder the man whom he hates and loathes . It is obvious that his reasons for entertaining and pursuing that intention are sufficient to his own mind , but it is also obvious that he is a malign , sanguinary , ruthless villain . Opinion on that point has always differed , and accordingly the numerous representations of Shylock which have been provided within the period ? one hundred and seventy years ? since Shakspere 's Jew was restored to the stage by Macklin have chiefly varied in the particular of morality , some actors endeavoring to present Shylock as an austere image of justice , others presenting him as a baleful image of Revenge , and still others striving to make him a composite of both . Macklin 's restoration of Shakspere 's comedy to the stage was accomplished under circumstances of peculiar interest . The scene was Drury Lane Theater . The actor , then past fifty , was desirous of making a more distinctive mark than he had ever before made . The manager of the theater , Charles Fleetwood , had left the direction of the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . lIacklin chanced to consider the character of Shylock , and , disapproving of Lansdov-ne 's play and the long-prevalent custom of making the Jew a broadly farcical character , as that play requires that the actor of Shylock should do , determined to revert to the original piece , and to act the part as a serious one . Fleetwood consented , and Shakspere 's comedy was put into rehearsal . The actors associated with Macklin , when apprized of his purpose to appear as Shylock , received the avowal of it with derision . At the rehearsals , accordingly , the astute player , guarding his full design , enjoined his fellows , speaking in his capacity of stage manager , to put forth their utmost powers ; but he himself acted tamely , so that they were all deceived and became persuaded that he would meet with disgraceful failure . Fleetwood , alarmed by their reports , urged him to desist from the attempt , but was reassured by the intrepid innovator 's declaration that he was purposely misleading his associates in the cast , and " would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quin , the Antonio of the occasion , said that he would be hissed from the stage . When the night of trial arrived , an eager assemblage , filling Drury Lane , saw Shylock attired as he had never before been attired within their knowledge , and likewise saw a presentment of the character which was altogether new . Approval greeted the opening scenes , but  | when , in the tremendous passion of the street scene , the actor liberated all his fire , the astonished audience became wildly enthusiastic , and his triumph was complete . " I had the good fortune , " so he said , recounting his memorable experience , " to please beyond my warmest expectations . The whole house was in an uproar of applause , and I was obliged to pause between the speeches to give it vent , so as to be heard . . . . The trial scene wound up the fullness of my reputation . Here I was well listened to , and here I made such a silent yet forcible impression on my audience that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is recorded that the dense monarch King George the Second , who saw the performance , was so completely frightened by it that the was unable to sleep that night . The German traveler and critic Lichtenberg , to whom readers are indebted for glimpses of the acting of the Quin-MacklinGarrick period , wrote of Macklin 's Shylock : " In the scene when for the first time he misses his daughter he appears without his hat , with his hair standing on end and in some places a finger 's length above the crown , as if the wind from the gallows had blown it up . Both hands are firmly clenched , and all his movements are abrupt and convulsive . " The comedy , as revived and treated by Macklin , held the stage for a long time , and was often performed , always with success . Macklin 's embodiment of Shylock , judging from the records which survive , while it has been excelled in minutix of detail , has never been excelled in ideal or in terrific power . On the night of Macklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pritchard played Nerissa . John Henderson , succeeding after many repulses , made his first prominent appearance in London , playing Shylock , June 11,1777 , at the Haymarket Theater , and although , as certified in one contemporary record , " his style , being different from Macklin 's , critics were divided in opinion , " gained brilliant success . " Henderson 's Shylock , " said John Philip Kemble , " was the greatest.effort that I ever witnessed on the stage . " George Colman , then manager of the Haymarket , said that " in the impassioned scene with Tubal he seemed a black Lear " and bore " an odd resemblance of a mad king in a storm " ; but Colman objected to his costume , declaring that it looked as if it had been hired from a pawnbroker . Macklin attended the performance , and cordially praised it . " And yet , sir , " said Henderson , " I have never had the advantage of seeing you in the character . " " It is not necessary to tell me that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had not , or you would have played it differently . " Garrick , who disliked Henderson , remarked , after witnessing the representation , that the part of Tubal had been acted well . The renown of Henderson , who  | in his short professional life of only thirteen years , played more than a hundred parts , rests mainly on his impersonations of Shylock , Falstaff , Iago , and Sir Giles Overreach , although he was also admired in Hamlet , Macbeth , and Lear , and in Horatius , in William Whitehead 's tragedy of " The Roman Father . " Among all the players of the shining Garrick period , he appears to have been exceptionally versatile and of a distinctively original genius . The testimony is emphatic that his acting was guided by extraordinary acuteness of judgment and vitalized by splendid enthusiasm . He was wonderfully effective in his sudden transitions from one passion to another , and he excelled equally in the delivery of soliloquy and the pointed ejaculation of abrupt speeches . Minute analysis of his method of representing Shylock is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a black Lear " ? conveys instructive significance both as to manner and aspect . He made his way to eminence despite some serious physical disadvantages and some harsh adversity of  | criticism . He died November 25 , 1785 , at the age of thirty-eight , and his ashes rest near those of Garrick and Dr. Johnson in the Poets ' Corner of Westminster Abbey . George Frederick Cooke , who in his youth had seen Macklin as Shylock , followed in general the example of that distinguished predecessor ; yet while embodying Shylock as an odious incarnation of the diabolical purpose of murderous revenge , he slightly tempered the malignity of the character by an infusion of domestic sentiment and grim piety . That turquoise ring which Shylock had of Leah when the was a bachelor , and that oath of his , which he declares to have been registered in heaven , are the chief pretexts for that humanitarian gloss . Cooke 's performance of Shylock was first seen in London in 1800 , and first seen in New York in 181o . Mention is made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of Antonio 's losses , the electrical rapidity of his transitions of passion , and his mingled apprehension and malignity when , replying to Portia 's entreaty , " Bid me tear the bond , " the Jew ejaculates , " When it is PAID ? according to the tenor ! " Shouts of applause testified to the effect of his utterance of the tremendous agony and rage of the street scene . " I can , " wrote his biographer , William Dunlap , " conceive of nothing so perfectly the Jew that Shakspere drew ' as the voice , face , manner , and expression of Cooke " : and , according to that authoritv , " the whole of the trial scene was inimitable in Cooke 's hands , " defying competition . When Portia spoke the line , " It is an attribute to God himself , " he reverently bowed his head ; but when she said , " That same prayer doth teach its all to render the deeds of mercy , " he made a movement of head and hand to signify his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his race . Other performers of Shtlock have used that business in later years . Edmund hean ? the story , at once romantic and pathetic , of whose triumph as Shylock , achieved at Drury Lane , on that dreary winter night , January 26 , 1814 , has been so often told that a repetition of it here would be superfluous ? presented the Jew as a creature of terrific malignity , and vet of distinctively Hebraic majesty , and of what can perhaps correctly be called Mosaic fanaticism , a relentless adherence to the dogma " an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth " ; captivating the public , however , rather by the spell of terror , exerted in a whirlwind of conflicting passions suddenly loosed out of cold , concentrated , iron composure , than by a definite , coherent , rounded impersonation . One of his greatly effective points was a complete collapse at the climax of the trial scene , when the spoke in tones of overwhelming agony the abject supplication , " Nay , take my life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the accounts which survive of Kean 's acting are so charged with enthusiasm and garnished with superlatives that they bewilder more than they instruct ; but obviously he was a prodigy of genius . Macready 's ideal of Shylock , which he presented in his customary admirable style of minute elaboration and complete symmetry , was not , as commentary has sometimes declared , the majestic Israelite , intent to avenge upon the Christian the accumulated wrongs of his " sacred nation , " but a creature compact of austerity and murderous malice . He expressed the opinion that the character is " composed of harshness , " and intimated that Shylock 's anguish relative to the loss of the ring of Leah is only the suffering of wounded cupidity . His delivery of one sentence , ? " Nearest his heart ? those are the very words , " which was horrible in its expression of malignity and exultant cruelty , signified the intrinsic spirit of his performance . The elder Booth , as Shylock , laid particular stress on those intimations of racial and religious austerity which Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " at our synagogue , " and " an oath , an oath , I have an oath in heaven . " Like Edmund Kean , however , he thrilled his hearers by the tempest of emotion , the frenzied ebullition of contrasted passions , in the street scene . Edwin Booth , in his earlier day , strove to express , as Shylock , the aggrieved religionist and the injured father ; but later he reverted to a sterner ideal ? that of the vindictive , relentless avenger of personal indignities . His utterance of " I thank God ! " when apprized of Antonio 's ruinous losses , was indescribably terrible . His dress comprised a red cap , a gabardine , and pointed red shoes . In his early representations of the part he wore a " blackbald " wig ; later , one of grizzled hair . It is not practicable here to describe , or to do more than mention , various assumptions of Shylock that the stage has displayed in England and America , since the time of Macklin , some of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though commentary on them might compel a monotonous ringing of the changes between miscreant and martyr , Shylock having been presented in both ways . Some of the names more or less conspicuously associated with the part in the annals of the English stage are those of Edward Shuter , West Digges , Thomas Sheridan , Thomas King , Stephen Kemble , George Bennett , William Dowton , ? who is said to have assumed the Jew by request of Lord Byron , and who was virtually laughed off the stage , ? Bartley , Thomas Ryder , John Harley , Robert William Elliston , Charles Kean , and Samuel Phelps . On the American stage The Merchant of Venice " was performed for the first time , September 5 , 1752 , at Williamsburg , Virginia , being the second of the plays of Shakspere acted in America . Notable performers of Shylock in the early days of the American theater were John Henry and Thomas Abthorpe Cooper . Later representatives of the part were John Vandenhoff , 18.0 ; Charles W. Couldock , 1853 ; James William Wallack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCullough ; Lawrence Barrett ; Richard Mansfield ; Robert Mantell ; and Edward H. Sothern . Shylock was acted in New York by Macready in 1844 , and by Charles Kean in 1845 . Couldock , when first he played the part in that metropolis , appeared at Castle Garden . When The Merchant of Venice " was produced at Wallack 's Theater , ? the old Broadway and Broome Street house , ? in 1858 , it held the stage thirty-three nights , and that was recorded as " a longer run than ever before enjoyed by a Shaksperean production . " The elder Wallack acted Shylock , his son Lester Wallack being Bassanio , and llrs . Hoey ( Josephine Shaw ) Portia . Many years afterward , Lester Wallack , speaking to me of that performance , said that his father " was best in Shylock , " representing him as an injured , suffering man , and deeply affecting the feelings of his audience . That method of acting Shylock has of late years , it is notable , been pursued by most of the foreign actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough and absorbingly interesting impersonation of Shylock that has been seen within the last sixty years ? and , in its maturity , as I believe , after duly weighing the recorded evidence , the best ever given ? was that of Henry Irving . That great actor had studied the subject with microscopic scrutiny , and he knew every fiber of it . His opinion relative to the earlier performances of  | the part was expressed to me in the remark that , as far as his reading and observation had enabled him to judge , Henderson was the greatest of the old actors , and I believe he considered that Henderson gave the true Shylock . A complete analysis of Irving 's presentment of Shylock ( such as I have made , following it through all its mutations to its final perfection ) would occupy much space , and it can not be included here . Irving 's ideal of Shakspere 's conception and his earlier presentation of the character were not precisely accordant . " Shylock , ' ' he said , in my presence , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , if you wish to succeed ; you must get some sympathy with him . " That sympathy , in acting Shylock , he contrived to obtain by the charm of his magnetic personality , and without any material sacrifice of the vindictive and terrible spirit of the part . Mention has already been made of the momentary revulsion of feeling that he permitted the Jew to indicate , after his frenzied invective relative to Jessica 's ignominious robbery of his treasure and flight from his home . That seemed to be an involuntary impulse not so much of human nature as of the animal propension toward its young . A kindred emphasis was placed on " No tears but of my shedding " ; but the tears of Shylock are those of rancorous rage and furious desperation , not of tender grief , and that was the meaning Irving conveyed . In the street scene , as played by him , there was no rushing about the stage and no yelling . For the most part he stood still ; but he signified the changes from passion to passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " I will have the heart of him if he forfeit , " his Shylock was an authentic and terrible image of tragedy . Persons who truly saw that frightful figure can never forget it ? the tall , attenuated form , the ghastly , pallid face , the deep-sunken , dark eyes , blazing with wrath , the jaws champing , the left hand turning the sleeve upon the right arm as far back as the elbow , and the fingers of the right hand stretched forth and quivering , as if already they were tearing out the heart of his hated enemy . Irving 's dress , for Shylock , comprised a brown gabardine , girdled by a party-colored shawl or scarf , a black , flattopped cap with a yellow band across it , and pointed shoes of soft leather . He dressed the head with gray hair , long behind , the crown of the skull being bald . One lock of hair , being brushed forward , appeared on the brow , projecting from beneath the hat . He carried a black crutchstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the costume , ? entering the house to do so , while Launcelot hurriedly spoke his message to Jessica , and returning as the " patch 's " last words were uttered , ? wearing the same body garments as before , but with a cloak added , and with his head wreathed in a kind of turban of a tawny orange color . In the third act he wore the long robe , but neither hat nor gabardine , and his hair and attire were in wild disorder , the garments torn open over the throat and upper part of the chest . In the trial scene , Act IV , his dress was scrupulously correct , neat , and formal , his hair carefully smoothed and arranged , his aspect that of a priest going to the altar about to offer sacrifice : a more composed , relentless , cruel , deadly aspect could not be imagined , ? the aspect of a lethal monster of malignity , sure of his prey , bulwarked behind the pretense of religion and law , and invincibly determined to take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 1 , i 879 , at his London theater , where the play then had a run of two hundred and fifty consecutive performances , a record never equaled with any play of Shakspere 's . He restored the fifth act , which sometimes had been omitted . The braiding of the two stories , ? that of Portia and the caskets , and that of the cruel feu ' intent on getting his pound of flesh , ? so as to combine them in one harmonious plot , has , from the beginning of Shaksperean commentary , been warmly admired for its dexterous , pleasing ingenuity . While it is not possible to sympathize with a fortune-hunter who purposes to rectify his financial accounts by marrying a wealthy heiress , it is easy to perceive that Bassanio is substantially a good fellow , and that he is truly in love with Portia. as Portia certainly is with him , and , so perceiving , it is pleasant to follow the course of their love-story to its happy close . Portia , unhappily , has often been performed by elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masculine . She is a young and lovely girl ; she lives in the season when love is essen-@#  | tial and delicious ; and when she says to her intimate companion Nerissa , " My little body is a-weary of this great world , " she unconsciously indicates her desire of love ? her weariness of a life that is incomplete . The words that Portia speaks immediately after Bassanio has made his choice of the leaden casket utter the very heart and soul of love . The Portias of the stage have been very numerous . When Burbage acted Shylock , the part must have been misrepresented by a male , according to the custom of that period . Kitty Clive and Peg Woffington were among the first prominent actresses to appear as Portia after Macklin had revived Shakspere 's comedy . Kitty Clive , in the trial scene , when disguised as Bellario , was accustomed to imitate the manner of one or another well-known lawyer of the day . Mrs. Yates acted Portia in 1770 . Mrs. Siddons -- advertised as " A Young Lady , " and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in 1775 . Then , in the old records , follow the names of Miss ' Macklin ( daughter of Charles ) , Miss Barsanti , Elizabeth Farren , Miss Younge , Eliza Kemble , Anne de Camp , Miss Ryder , Mrs. Pope , Miss Murray , Mrs. Glover , Miss Smith , Mrs. Ogilivie , Miss Jarman , Mrs. Morris , Mrs. Henry , and Mrs. Merry ( Anne Brunton ) . Nearer to the present time come Ellen Tree , Helena Faucit , Fanny Kemble , Mrs. Barrow , Mrs. Conway , Bella Pateman , Helena Modjeska , Ada Rehan , and Julia Marlowe . Madame Modjeska gave a delicious impersonation of Portia . She specially revealed , and exulted in , the tender , ardent , intrinsic womanhood of that golden girl of Italy , and I remember that the love-light in her eyes when Portia looked at Bassanio , while he was making choice among the caskets , was one of the most expressive , artistic , fascinating beauties of her beautiful performance ? a seemingly spontaneous but perfectly ordered achievement in acting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love story of Shakspere 's exquisite comedy , " Where every something being blent together Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy . " Ada Rehan 's impersonation of Portia Ada Rehan 's impersonation of Portia was characterized by inherent loveliness of spirit and a fine aristocracy of demeanor . Her sparkling raillery could not conceal the winning sweetness of her temperament . There was an irresistible charm in the archness of her innocent mischief , as when she said , in the first colloquy with Nerissa , " I know it is a sin to be a mocker . " During the casket scenes she expressed a tremulous solicitude , peculiarly animative of sympathy , and her simulation of delight , combined with feminine delicacy and a maidenly restraint of ardor , in Portia 's self-surrender to the fortunate Bassanio , was supremely artistic . She was the first and only representative of Portia in our time who , when appearing before " the strict Court of Venice , " evinced and consistently maintained the anxiety , not to say the solemnity , inseparable from the situation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of wealth or ruin and life or death . But , all things considered , the most spontaneously feminine and completely symmetrical , and therefore flawless , embodiment of Portia that has graced the modern stage was that of Ellen Terry , as shown in the earlier days of her professional association with Henry Irving . All the gaiety and all the poetry of the part were elicited by her without the least effort , and she was the first among players to show Portia as a lover ? a woman in love , a woman knowing herself to be loved , and radiant with happiness because of that knowledge . One piece of her stage-business will speak for all . After Bassanio had made his choice , she crumbled some roses and allowed the leaves to flutter down into the leaden casket from which the fortunate lover had taken her picture , and then , bending over it , . seemed to consecrate it with a kiss . She was the first to dress Portia for the trial scene in a beautiful , flowing scarlet robe , incorrect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laws of the period of the play , but delightfully effective . The lovely lines about Mercy came from her lips in a strain of golden melody . She could and did speak blank verse so as to make it seem the language of nature , and , a little to vary Wordsworth 's couplet , The music in our hearts we bore Long after it was heard no more .
