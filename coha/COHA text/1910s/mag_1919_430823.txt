 |p785  TO a father whose young children are just approaching those fateful years when their education in some form must be begun , this modern world , if he in any real sense belongs to it , presents a disturbing , because a worried and ambiguous face . Such a father must often find himself wishing that he and his little family were snugly moored in some rural backwater of the early eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries , rather than exposed to the turbid cross-currents and dangerous rapids of the twentieth . Perhaps there is some illusion here , for I presume the immediate moment in any century , to a thoughtful man , has always seemed fraught with perplexity and danger . Yet surely there have been happy periods , in favored spots , when the flux of life could hardly have been noted by those fortunate ones borne so gently onward that they deemed themselves fixed in a changeless tradition , physically and spiritually becalmed . I have lately been re-reading Jane Austen 's " Emma , " and I can not feel that either Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , found ? if the years brought them offspring ? any grave difficulties involved in the problem of their education . I am supposing , however , the sly Time Spirit forbore to drop a young Shelley or a young Darwin into their comfortable nest . Given an average brood , their minds must have been pretty serene . Their world may have been narrow , but it was congenial , and so thoroughly organized as to seem permanent . Church and State and the County Families : ft was all sound and simple and secure ? a peace that passeth understanding . No wonder a modern father is now and  |p786  then tempted to wish that he , with his family , might have shared it ! They , reckless young American chicks , have entered so changed a world that they could hardly have found things more otherwise on Mars ! " Our whole life and mind , " says a philosophically detached observer , " is saturated with the slow upward filtration of a new spirit ? that of an emancipated , atheistic , international democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be altered now in one respect only : the upward filtration of this new spirit is no longer slow . For better or worse we are struggling through years of accelerated change , and our brains grow fatigued and easily addled by the insistent confusion . Many of us , perhaps most of us , who now have young children are living ourselves in a state of intellectual muddle without previous parallel in the history of civilization . From one hour to the next we know not what we think or do , nor whither our uncertainties are driving us . We are radical ; we would go to the root of the matter ? but having gone there we find no roots . Worshippers of reason , a sort of insanity has seized us . And now , in the midst of this humming madness , it becomes our first plain duty to act as guides for the impressionable young . There would be high comedy here ? if the issues were either less personal or less vast . But the modern parent is in no mood for laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his cheek a cold breath caught from tragedy 's hovering wing . In quieter moods of reflection , I think it is pity he chiefly feels for his youngsters . So much is to be required of them ; so much forced upon them . The fields of knowledge are so boundless , yet so intensively cultivated ; and these poor babies are to be dragged wearily through them all ? and given appropriate and meaningless diplomas after the exhausting survey . What they are to do with these diplomas ,  |p787  except frame them , boggles the kindliest imagination . They are no charters to happiness or peace of mind ; nor are they in any sense legal tender for daily bread . They are not even decorative as spots on a study wall . In short , the modern father who would like to give his children something better to live by than he himself has received or wrung from life , too often finds he is bankrupt and has little that is substantial to offer . And he usually , from sheer despair of bettering what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and methods ? has Susan or John baptized , sends them to kindergarten and Sunday School , and so onward , and says to himself : " God help them ! I have done nothing , but I can do no more . " He does not abdicate thus from indifference , but from felt impotence ? or fright . It is coward 's work , though , this abdication ! It will not do . High time is it for us ? timid ostriches with our eager broods about us ? to present to the world some more inspiring spectacle than our feathered rumps ! High time is it for us to withdraw our heads from the infertile sands ! For there are enemies abroad ? foes of the spirit . Foes of the spirit , too , who are masking as its friends . They are everywhere ; their name is legion . Indeed , the future is perhaps already theirs , and we who would fight them are perhaps already defeated . Yet , in a higher and final sense , they have no future , these foes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their hour or their era , and our hapless children may be of them and go down among them ; but their hour will pass . The vaster drift is against them ; they can not ultimately prevail . That , no doubt , is cheering ? in the long run ; but I confess it is not particularly cheering to me as a modern father . I am more interested in what is going to happen to little Susan or little John , than in what is going to happen to their remote descendants . It is for them I lay my archaic lance in rest and charge . Clouds of terribly effective mus-  |p788  tard gas may overwhelm me ; but I care not . The temper of Cyrano is strong upon me : " Il me faut des geants ! " But lest you leap to the too hasty conclusion that the writer is a blind reactionary , let me state my simple creed in the words of genius , the words of a true friend of the spirit : " The whole drift of my education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that the world of our present consciousness is only one out of many worlds of conciousness that exist , and that those other worlds must contain experiences which have a meaning for our life also ; and that although in the main their experiences and those of this world keep discrete , yet the two become continuous at certain points , and higher energies filter in . By being faithful in my poor measure to this over-belief , I seem to myself to keep more sane and true . I can , of course , put myself into the sectarian scientist 's attitude , and imagine vividly that the world of sensations and of scientific laws and objects may be all . But whenever I do this , I hear that inward monitor of which W. K. Clifford once wrote , whispering the word bosh ! ' Humbug is humbug , even though it bear the scientific name , and the total expression of human experience , as I view it objectively , invincibly urges me beyond the narrow scientific ' bounds . " " The total expression of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase . Permit me now to focus attention for a moment on Mr. Santayana 's statement , already once quoted : " Our whole life and mind is saturated with the slow upward filtration of a new spirit ? that of an emancipated , atheistic , international democracy . " This world has never been a satisfactory place to live in for any great number of its teeming children . The Golden Age is a myth ; Utopia remains a dream . Some good moments , but few and fleeting , many dull , indifferent days , and some desperately bad ones , are about all the average human being can reasonably hope for from life ?  |p789  if we take life at its face value . Wise men , therefore , true friends of the human spirit , have never so taken it . To take life , honestly , at its mere face value need not necessarily be ignoble , but it is always to despair . Honestly so taken , it can lead to but one conclusion : The sense that every struggle brings defeat Because Fate holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dumb or cheat Because they have no secret to express ; That none can pierce the vast black veil uncertain Because there is no light beyond the curtain ; That all is vanity and nothingness . There , at least , is honesty ; even , if you will , a noble rigor of mind ; clearness ; a stark refusal to speak out one iota less than the " bitter old and wrinkled truth . " I honor James Thomson for speaking out , but I can never regard him as a friend of the human spirit . I honor him , because one must always honor a sincere and courageous opponent . It is the foe who is neither open , courageous , nor sincere ? the stabber in the dark ? who is really dangerous , and whom one must despise but never foolishly underrate . They are legion about us , I repeat , these lurking foes ; clever , too ? often learned , witty , and superficially stimulating companions . For one grimly honest Leopardi , or Schopenhauer , or James Thomson , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cloak his despair or sophisticate his thought , there are thousands of a different stamp , who take life at no more than its poor face value , yet who ask us to believe that its value can ? by some mechanical trick or material jugglery ? be raised to ? well , there is no limit they will boggle at ! Simply to follow their suggestions will bring mankind at once and permanently to its first authentic Golden Age . Utopia , mark you , is at hand . These are the vessels of that new spirit now saturating our lives , leaders or henchmen of that emancipated , atheistic , international democracy , which Mr. Santayana mentions  |p790  in his detached , slightly disdainful way . And these are the foes of our human household ; flushed now with a rapidly growing sense of power and eager for young disciples ! They are waiting for our children . Susan and Arthur and Richard and little Alice will not escape them if they go out among them unprepared . For at least let us do our foes this justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to meet them , then , openly , face to face ? ? It is thus , worried mothers and heavy fathers , we shall have to meet them ? face to face , and not otherwise . The day has gone by for " Let 's pretend " ! Our children , let us hope , are not going to be weaklings or fools . What is about them they will hear and see , as they should , and will try to understand . We shall accomplish nothing but disaster if we try to stop their ears or bandage their eyes . We must begin , then , certainly , by giving them a true account of the poor face value of life ; though we must not expect them wholly to believe us , for they are young ? and youth while it lasts is an enormous asset ; only ( but this , thank God , youth can never be persuaded ! ) it does not last . Nevertheless , youth itself ? at its mere face value ? can be over-praised , and generally is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect synonym for buoyancy , or joy , or hope . It is also the season of strain , of skepticism , of self-distrust ; if youth 's roses are redder than ours , its devils are bluer too ; and it knows nothing of patience . Some portion , thus , of our true account , if we give it sincerely , will get unwillingly believed : though , if we must stop there , shooting would be too good for us for having given it at all ! Better any false promises ? ours or the enemies ' ? than that ! No : together with that true account , concurrently with it , we must introduce the children to their friends ? to those who rightly approached will prove their unfailing friends , for they are the tested friends of the holy spirit of man . And these ? often difficult ? introductions we must make , winningly , naturally too , ourselves . The official  |p791  introductions of the schools will not do . They come too coldly , too formally , and generally too late ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we must forward , is what we must absolutely kindle . Of Emerson , Matthew Arnold said , " He is the friend and aider of those who would live in the spirit . " I am not ashamed of that well-worn quotation , though I have tried to avoid it ; it still seems to me both beautiful and just ? a supreme word of gratitude . But how many such friends wait for our children , if we can but bring them naturally and winningly together ! And Virgil guided Dante safely , remember , through the eight circles of Hell . Only ? and this I feel is important ? we must not attempt too much . We must not seek to run our children 's minds as if they were molten metal , into pre-arranged moulds ; for , in the first place , if we succeed ( which is improbable ) we shall leave them rigid and inert , dead shapes that were meant to be quicksilver currents ; and in the second , if we do not , we shall rightly lose their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having brought them , winningly , naturally , into the presence of their friends ? those true friends and aiders of all who would live in the spirit ? we must bid them Godspeed , and be willing to stand aside . For the life of the spirit takes many forms , works through many temporal combinations , and we must trust our children to find or create the forms most congruous to their individual hearts , the forms that best satisfy them , please them best . Too anxious a shepherding will but weary out these lambs , till they sicken of our superfluous care . This pasture or that ? what does it matter ? this hill or that valley ? ? if only we have persuaded them to enter ( and that merely by showing them its beauty ) a green , wide country where there are neither deserts nor wolves ! As for these deserts and wolves ? foes of the spirit ? they are not imaginary ; they exist . But let me now rid your minds of these conventional symbols , and present you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete example ? what I take to be a sinister fact . Here , then , is Rosa Luxemburg , a woman whose cruel death , during the recent disorders at Berlin , does not alter the speciousness of her recorded message . I quote from her article , " My Idea of Bolshevism , " lately reprinted in English by " The Living Age . " In this remarkable , firmly expressed message , Rosa Luxemburg , it seems to me , says all that can be said , and as well as it can be said , for her vision of this world ( " the world of sensations and of scientific laws and objects " ) made suddenly perfect by proletarian control . Its poor face value is to be changed ? raised indefinitely , and , as it were , overnight . And first she paints the present conditions of social inequality and injustice under which , miserably enough for the most part , we live ; and there is much wholesome truth in her indictment , together with some obvious exaggeration . Let that pass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely mechanical or material sleight-of-hand by which " all this must be changed " and , second , Rosa Luxemburg 's frank admission ? an admission setting this paper apart from all proletarian propaganda of a lower grade ? that , after all , merely mechanical sleight-of-hand will not work unaided : " It implies a complete internal regeneration of the proletariat . " The mechanical sleight-of-hand consists , of course , in the workers taking possession , once for all , of " all the wealth of society . " " The private owner vanishes . " This is familiar enough . What is less familiar , coming from a leader of the revolution , is the following admission : . . . " if the real purpose of production is to provide a respectable standard of life for everyone . . . then in that case the productivity of labor must be much greater than it is to-day . " But how is this greater productivity to be obtained ? The answer has already been given : by " a complete internal regeneration of the proletariat . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proletariat is to survive. )  |p793  Agreed , Rosa Luxemburg ! Only ? here our minds , if you will grant me one , cease even superficially to meet . You believe ( or believed ) this " complete internal regeneration " a simple mundane matter ; I do not . My trusted friends ? the friends of the spirit of man ? have never so believed it . Little Arthur and little Prudence , if they have made these friends , will never , I feel certain , believe it to be either simple or mundane . They will not suppose , as you have sought to persuade us , and as countless others are seeking to persuade us to-day , that mankind can lift itself rapidly to perfection by its own boot-straps . Was not that your naive conviction ? I can interpret these words in no other way : " Socialism will never succeed in a nation of lazy , lightminded , egoistic , thoughtless , and indifferent people . . . . But we do not need to waste several centuries or decades until a new race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary idealism and mental maturity " ? not by education of mind or heart , mark you , but ? " by the very struggles of the revolution . " ( That is , by hatred , wrath , violence , and shed blood ! ) " When we make good revolutionists , we make the socialist workers of the future , upon whom must rest the foundations of a new order . . . Our youthful workers are called first and foremost to this great task . " Yes : there is idealism here ? a starved , gasping idealism , cut off from all that our true friends of the spirit have taught us , have pragmatically proved for us , to be nourishment , strength , and consolation to the soul . But it is not with radicalism itself that I quarrel , if by radicalism is meant the drastic criticism of all human institutions coupled with an unselfish desire to reform them or replace them ? if need be ? in the interests of a more general well-being . Constructive radicalism of this high type ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or ( to leap towards a modern instance ) of Bertrand Russell , is  |p794  born of the spirit and can never be its foe . The higher radicalism let us justly call it , and let us always recognize it by an unfailing sign : its genuineness is certified to by a conspicuous omission , by the absence of hate . Brains it may sometimes lack , its conclusions may sometimes seem fantastic ; but love it can never lack , nor pity , nor patience . Patience ; a willingness to persevere in the long labor of mind on mind , to labor so without rest , perhaps without visible result , without reward almost certainly , without discouragement certainly . Like Rosa Luxemburg , Mr. Russell too would abolish private property in capital and land ; but he would first abolish hatred from the human heart , knowing well that the seed-plot for his Utopian harvest can lie only there . Is it not the spirit , the fettered , warped , but indestructible spirit of man , he addresses in these words : " The ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reached through persuasion " ? And now let me clear up one or two corners of my meaning , so far left passably obscure . First : I am not advocating any special formula , belief , dogma , or ethical system . I am trying to say , with William James , that , on the whole , taking into view " the total expression of human experience , " man must be dealt with as something more than a regrettable accident in a fortuitous universe ; and if our children are to keep sane and true they must , ultimately , so deal with others and with themselves . Second : I am not preaching ? above all I am not preaching ? an ascetic withdrawal from the daily life of this world ! Life becomes worth living , a thrilling adventure , the very moment we cease merely to take it at its poor face value ! Nor do I regard as foes of the spirit those men who are unable to take it otherwise , and so ? not ignobly ? despair . There is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least see life steadily , if they do not ? in my humble opinion ? see it whole . No : our foes , I repeat , are they who having missed " the total expression of human experience , " see life  |p795  neither whole nor steadily ? see it , rather , wildly , a little madly , as a sort of jig-saw puzzle to be shuffled and reshuffled until the pieces fall somehow together and their preconceived Perfect ( and perfectly lifeless ) Pattern is revealed . And , finally : God knows I am not apologizing or pleading for things as they are ! I am not saying that they can not be bettered ; that a far closer approach to social justice can not be made ; that there can never be more of liberty , fraternity , leisure , and beauty , and joy in human life . But these inestimable things will not be borne to us overnight on the iron wings of a class revolution . Through what national or international forms the evolution of society may lead us I can not guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and happier forms than we have known , it will only be because nobility and justice and happiness have become the natural fruits of the tree of life ? and its next fruiting , remember , will be the hearts of our children . It is little enough we can do for them , when all 's said . They must live their own lives . But we can at least help them betimes to get in touch with their true friends , who will companion them simply and wisely and hopefully , but never flatter false hopes which can lead only to real despair . Such friends will speak to them of many things , and among many beautiful words such old-fashioned and lovingly-fashioned words as these : Who is the happy Warrior ? . . It is the generous Spirit , who , when brought Among the tasks of real life , hath wrought Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought : Whose high endeavors are an inward light . . .                @ @ @ @ @
