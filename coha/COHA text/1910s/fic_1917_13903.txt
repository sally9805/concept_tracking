SCENE  --  Captain Keeney 's cabin on board the steam whaling ship Atlantic Queen  --  a small , square compartment about eight feet high with a skylight in the center looking out on the poop deck . On the left ( the stern of the ship ) a long bench with rough cushions is built in against the wall . In front of the bench , a table . Over the bench , several curtained portholes . In the rear , left , a door leading to the Captain 's sleeping quarters . To the right of the door a small organ , looking as if it were brand new , is placed against the wall . On the right , to the rear , a marble-topped sideboard . On the sideboard , a woman 's sewing basket . Farther forward , a doorway leading to the companion way , and past the officer 's quarters to the main deck . In the center of the room , a stove . From the middle of the ceiling a hanging lamp is suspended . The walls of the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , and the light which comes through the skylight is sickly and faint , indicating one of those gray days of calm when ocean and sky are alike dead . The silence is unbroken except for the measured tread of some one walking up and down on the poop deck overhead . It is nearing two bells  --  one o'clock  --  in the afternoon of a day in the year 1895 . At the rise of the curtain there is a moment of intense silence . Then the Steward enters and commences to clear the table of the few dishes which still remain on it after the Captain 's dinner . He is an old , grizzled man dressed in dungaree pants , a sweater , and a woolen cap with ear flaps . His manner is sullen and angry . He stops stacking up the plates and casts a quick glance upward at the skylight ; then tiptoes over to the closed door in rear and listens with his ear pressed to the crack . What he hears makes his face darken and he mutters a furious curse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he darts back to the table . Ben enters . He is an over-grown , gawky boy with a long , pinched face . He is dressed in sweater , fur cap , etc . His teeth are chattering with the cold and he hurries to the stove , where he stands for a moment shivering , blowing on his hands , slapping them against his sides , on the verge of crying . THE STEWARD ( in relieved tones  --  seeing who it is ) Oh , ' t is you , is it ? What 're ye shiverin ' ' bout ? Stay by the stove where ye belong and ye 'll find no need of chatterin ' . p. 3 BEN It 's c-c-cold. ( trying to control his chattering teeth  --  derisively ) Who d'ye think it were  --  the Old Man ? THE STEWARD ( makes a threatening move  --  Ben shrinks away . ) None o ' your lip , young un , or I 'll learn ye . ( more kindly ) Where was it ye 've been all o ' the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Man see ye up for'ard mon-keyshinin ' with the hands and ye 'll get a hidin ' ye 'll not forget in a hurry . BEN Aw , he do n't see nothin ' . ( A trace of awe in his tones  --  he glances upward . ) He just walks up and down like he did n't notice nobody  --  and stares at the ice to the no'the'ard . THE STEWARD ( the same tone of awe creeping into his voice ) He 's always starin ' at the ice . ( in a sudden rage , shaking his fist at the skylight ) Ice , ice , ice ! Damn him and damn the ice ! Holdin ' us in for nigh on a year  --  nothin ' to see but ice  --  stuck in it like a fly in molasses ! BEN ( apprehensively ) Ssshh ! He 'll hear ye . THE STEWARD ( raging ) Aye , damn him , and damn the Arctic seas , and damn this stinkin ' whalin ' ship of his , and damn me for a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizing the uselessness of this outburst  --  shaking his head  --  slowly , with deep conviction ) He 's a hard man  --  as hard a man as ever sailed the seas . p. 4 BEN ( solemnly ) Aye . THE STEWARD The two years we all signed up for are done this day . Blessed Christ ! Two years o ' this dog 's life , and no luck in the fishin ' , and the hands half starved with the food runnin ' low , rotten as it is ; and not a sign of him turnin ' back for home ! ( bitterly ) Home ! I begin to doubt if ever I 'll set foot on land again . ( excitedly ) What is it he thinks he 's goin ' to do ? Keep us all up here after our time is worked out till the last man of us is starved to death or frozen ? We 've grub enough hardly to last out the voyage back if we started now . What are the men goin ' to do ' bout it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( going over to him  --  in a half whisper ) They said if he do n't put back south for home to-day they 're goin ' to mutiny . THE STEWARD ( with grim satisfaction ) Mutiny ? Aye , ' t is the only thing they can do ; and serve him right after the manner he 's treated them  --  ' s if they wer n't no better nor dogs . BEN The ice is all broke up to s'uth'ard . They 's clear water ' s far ' s you can see . He ai n't got no excuse for not turnin ' back for home , the men says . THE STEWARD ( bitterly ) He wo n't look nowheres but no'the'ard where they 's only the ice to see . He do n't want to see no clear water . All he thinks on is gittin ' the ile  --  ' s if it was our fault he ai n't had good luck with the whales . ( shaking his head ) I think the man 's mighty nigh losin ' his senses . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crazy ? THE STEWARD Aye , it 's the punishment o ' God on him . Did ye ever hear of a man who was n't crazy do the things he does ? ( pointing to the door in rear ) Who but a man that 's mad would take his woman  --  and as sweet a woman as ever was  --  on a stinkin ' whalin ' ship to the Arctic seas to be locked in by the rotten ice for nigh on a year , and maybe lose her senses forever  --  for it 's sure she 'll never be the same again . BEN ( sadly ) She useter be awful nice to me before  --  ( his eyes grow wide and frightened ) she got  --  like she is . THE STEWARD Aye , she was good to all of us . ' T would have been hell on board without her ; for he 's a hard man  --  a hard , hard man  --  a driver if there ever was one . ( with a grim laugh ) I hope he 's satisfied now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind . And who could blame her ? ' T is a God 's wonder we 're not a ship full of crazed people  --  with the damned ice all the time , and the quiet so thick you 're afraid to hear your own voice . BEN ( with a frightened glance toward the door on right ) She do n't never speak to me no more  --  jest looks at me ' s if she did n't know me. p. 6 THE STEWARD She do n't know no one  --  but him . She talks to him  --  when she does talk  --  right enough . BEN She does nothin ' all day long now but sit and sew  --  and then she cries to herself without makin ' no noise . I 've seen her . THE STEWARD Aye , I could hear her through the door a while back . BEN ( tiptoes over to the door and listens ) She 's cryin ' now . THE STEWARD ( furiously  --  shaking his fist ) God send his soul to hell for the devil he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly down the companionway stairs . The Steward hurries to his stacked up dishes . He is so nervous from fright that he knocks off the top one , which falls and breaks on the floor . He stands aghast , trembling with dread . Ben is violently rubbing off the organ with a piece of cloth which he has snatched from his pocket . Captain Keeney appears in the doorway on right and comes into the cabin , removing his fur cap as he does so . He is a man of about forty , around five-ten in height but looking much shorter on account of the enormous proportions of his shoulders and chest . His face is massive and deeply lined , with gray-blue eyes of a bleak hardness , and a tightly clenched , thin-lipped mouth . His thick hair is long and gray . He is dressed in a heavy blue jacket and blue pants stuffed into his seaboots . ( He is followed into the cabin by the Second Mate , a rangy six-footer with a lean weather-beaten face . The Mate is dressed about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty or so. ) p. 7 CAPTAIN KEENEY ( comes toward the Steward  --  with a stern look on his face . The Steward is visibly frightened and the stack of dishes rattles in his trembling hands . Keeney draws back his fist and the Steward shrinks away . The fist is gradually lowered and Keeney speaks slowly . ) ' T would be like hitting a worm . It is nigh on two bells , Mr. Steward , and this truck not cleared yet . THE STEWARD ( stammering ) Y-y-yes , sir . CAPTAIN KEENEY Instead of doin ' your rightful work ye 've been below here gossipin ' old woman 's talk with that boy . ( to Ben , fiercely ) Get out o ' this , you ! Clean up the chart room . ( Ben darts past the Mate to the open doorway . ) Pick up that dish , Mr. Steward ! THE STEWARD ( doing so with difficulty ) Yes , sir . CAPTAIN KEENEY The next dish you break , Mr. Steward , you take a bath in the Bering Sea at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes , sir . ( He hurries out . The Second Mate walks slowly over to the Captain . ) SLOCUM I war n't ' specially anxious the man at the wheel should catch what I wanted to say to you , sir . That 's why I asked you to come below . p. 8 CAPTAIN KEENEY ( impatiently ) Speak your say , Mr. Slocum . SLOCUM ( unconsciously lowering his voice ) I 'm afeard there 'll be trouble with the hands by the look o ' things . They 'll likely turn ugly , every blessed one o ' them , if you do n't put back . The two years they signed up for is up to-day . CAPTAIN KEENEY And d' you think you 're tellin ' me somethin ' new , Mr. Slocum ? I 've felt it in the air this long time past . D' you think I 've not seen their ugly looks and the grudgin ' way they worked ? ( The door in rear is opened and Mrs. Keeney stands in the doorway . She is a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes are red from weeping and her face drawn and pale . She takes in the cabin with a frightened glance and stands as if fixed to the spot by some nameless dread , clasping and unclasping her hands nervously . The two men turn and look at her . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY ( with rough tenderness ) Well , Annie ? MRS . KEENEY ( as if awakening from a dream ) David , I  --  ( She is silent . The Mate starts for the doorway . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY ( turning to him  --  sharply ) Wait ! p. 9 SLOCUM Yes , sir . CAPTAIN KEENEY D' you want anything , Annie ? MRS . KEENEY ( after a pause , during which she seems to be endeavoring to collect her thoughts ) I thought maybe  --  I 'd go up on deck , David , to get a breath of fresh air . ( She stands humbly awaiting his permission . He and the Mate exchange a significant glance . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY It 's too cold , Annie . You 'd best stay below today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ice . MRS . KEENEY ( monotonously ) I know  --  ice , ice , ice ! But there 's nothing to see down here but these walls . ( She makes a gesture of loathing . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY You can play the organ , Annie . MRS . KEENEY ( dully ) I hate the organ . It puts me in mind of home . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( a touch of resentment in his voice ) I got it jest for you . MRS . KEENEY ( dully ) I know . ( She turns away from them and walks slowly to the bench on left . She lifts up one of the curtains and looks through a porthole ; then utters an exclamation of joy . ) Ah , water ! Clear water ! As far as I can see ! How good it looks after all these months of ice ! ( She turns round to them , her face transfigured with joy . ) Ah , now I must go upon deck and look at it , David . p. 10 CAPTAIN KEENEY ( frowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day when the sun shines . MRS . KEENEY ( desperately ) But the sun never shines in this terrible place . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( a tone of command in his voice ) Best not to-day , Annie . MRS . KEENEY ( crumbling before this command  --  abjectly ) Very well , David . ( She stands there staring straight before her as if in a daze . The two men look at her uneasily . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY ( sharply ) Annie ! MRS . KEENEY ( dully ) Yes , David . CAPTAIN KEENEY Me and Mr. Slocum has business to talk about  --  ship 's business . MRS . KEENEY Very well , David . ( She goes slowly out , rear , and leaves the door three-quarters shut behind her . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY Best not have her on deck if they 's goin ' to be any trouble . SLOCUM Yes , sir . CAPTAIN KEENEY And trouble they 's goin ' to be . I feel it in my bones . ( takes a revolver from the pocket of his coat and examines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . CAPTAIN KEENEY Not that we 'll have to use ' em  --  not if I know their breed of dog  --  jest to frighten ' em up a bit . ( grimly ) I ai n't never been forced to use one yit ; and trouble I 've had by land and by sea ' s long as I kin remember , and will have till my dyin ' day , I reckon . SLOCUM ( hesitatingly ) Then you ai n't goin '  --  to turn back ? CAPTAIN KEENEY Turn back ! Mr. Slocum , did you ever hear ' o me pointin ' s'uth for home with only a measly four hundred barrel of ile in the hold ? SLOCUM ( hastily ) No , sir  --  but the grub 's gittin ' low . CAPTAIN KEENEY They 's enough to last a long time yit , if they 're careful with it ; and they 's plenty o ' water . SLOCUM They say it 's not fit to eat  --  what 's left ; and the two years they signed on fur is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts when we git home . CAPTAIN KEENEY To hell with ' em ! Let them make what law trouble they kin . I do n't give a damn ' bout the money . I 've got to git the ile ! ( glancing sharply at the Mate ) You ai n't turnin ' no damned sea lawyer , be you , Mr. Slocum ? p. 12 SLOCUM ( flushing ) Not by a hell of a sight , sir . CAPTAIN KEENEY What do the fools want to go home fur now ? Their share o ' the four hundred barrel would n't keep ' em in chewin ' terbacco . SLOCUM ( slowly ) They wants to git back to their folks an ' things , I s'pose . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( looking at him searchingly ) ' N you want to turn back , too . ( The Mate looks down confusedly before his sharp gaze . ) Do n't lie , Mr. Slocum . It 's writ down plain in your eyes . ( with grim sarcasm ) I hope , Mr. Slocum , you ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( indignantly ) That ai n't fair , sir , to say sich things . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( with satisfaction ) I war n't much afeard o ' that , Tom . You been with me nigh on ten year and I 've learned ye whalin ' . No man kin say I ai n't a good master , if I be a hard one . SLOCUM I war n't thinkin ' of myself , sir  --  ' bout turnin ' home , I mean . ( desperately ) But Mrs. Keeney , sir  --  seems like she ai n't jest satisfied up here , ailin ' like  --  what with the cold an ' bad luck an ' the ice an ' all . p. 13 CAPTAIN KEENEY ( his face clouding  --  rebukingly but not severely ) That 's my business , Mr. Slocum . I 'll thank you to steer a clear course o ' that . ( a pause ) The ice 'll break up soon to no'th'ard . I could see it startin ' to-day . And when it goes and we git some sun Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursts forth ) It ai n't the damned money what 's keepin ' me up in the Northern seas , Tom . But I ca n't go back to Homeport with a measly four hundred barrel of ile . I 'd die fust . I ai n't never come back home in all my days without a full ship . Ai n't that truth ? SLOCUM Yes , sir ; but this voyage you been ice-bound , an '  --  CAPTAIN KEENEY ( scornfully ) And d' you s'pose any of ' em would believe that  --  any o ' them skippers I 've beaten voyage after voyage ? Ca n't you hear ' em laughin ' and sneerin '  --  Tibbots ' n ' Harris ' n ' Simms and the rest  --  and all o ' Homeport makin ' fun o ' me ? " Dave Keeney what boasts he 's the best whalin ' skipper out o ' Homeport comin ' back with a measly four hundred barrel of ile ? " ( The thought of this drives him into a frenzy , and he smashes his fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell ! I got to git the ile , I tell you . How could I figger on this ice ? It 's never been so bad before in the thirty year I been acomin ' here . And now it 's breakin ' up . In a couple o ' days it 'll be all gone . And they 's whale here , plenty of ' em . I know they is and I ai n't never gone wrong yit . I got to git the ile ! I got to git it in spite of all hell , and by God , I ai n't agoin ' home till I do git it ! ( There is the sound of subdued sobbing from the door in rear . The two men stand silent for a mement , listening . Then Keeney goes over to the door and looks in . He hesitates for a moment as if he were going to enter  --  then closes the door softly . Joe , the harpooner , an enormous six-footer with a battered , ugly face , enters from right and stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN KEENEY ( turning and seeing him ) Do n't be standin ' there like a gawk , Harpooner . Speak up ! JOE ( confusedly ) We want  --  the men , sir  --  they wants to send a depitation aft to have a word with you . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( furiously ) Tell ' em to go to  --  ( checks himself and continues grimly ) Tell ' em to come . I 'll see ' em . JOE Aye , aye , sir . ( He goes out . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY ( with a grim smile ) Here it comes , the trouble you spoke of , Mr. Slocum , and we 'll make short shift of it . It 's better to crush such things at the start than let them make headway . SLOCUM ( worriedly ) Shall I wake up the First and Fourth , sir ? We might need their help . CAPTAIN KEENEY No , let them sleep . I 'm well able to handle this alone , Mr. Slocum . ( There is the shuffling of footsteps from outside and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe . All are dressed alike  --  sweaters , seaboots , etc . They glance uneasily at the Captain , twirling their fur caps in their hands. ) p. 15 CAPTAIN KEENEY ( after a pause ) Well ? Who 's to speak fur ye ? JOE ( stepping forward with an air of bravado ) I be . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( eyeing him up and down coldly ) So you be . Then speak your say and be quick about it . JOE ( trying not to wilt before the Captain 's glance and avoiding his eyes ) The time we signed up for is done to-day . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( icily ) You 're tellin ' me nothin ' I do n't know . JOE You ai n't pintin ' fur home yit , far ' s we kin see . CAPTAIN KEENEY No , and I ai n't agoin ' to till this ship is full of ile . JOE You ca n't go no further no'the with the ice afore ye . CAPTAIN KEENEY The ice is breaking up . JOE ( after a slight pause during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grub we 're gittin ' now is rotten . CAPTAIN KEENEY It 's good enough fur ye . Better men than ye are have eaten worse . ( There is a chorus of angry exclamations from the crowd. ) p. 16 JOE ( encouraged by this support ) We ai n't agoin ' to work no more less you puts back for home . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( fiercely ) You ai n't , ai n't you ? JOE No ; and the law courts 'll say we was right . CAPTAIN KEENEY To hell with your law courts ! We 're at sea now and I 'm the law on this ship . ( edging up toward the harpooner ) And every mother 's son of you what do n't obey orders goes in irons . ( There are more angry exclamations from the crew . Mrs. Keeney appears in the doorway in rear and looks on with startled eyes . None of the men notice her . ) JOE ( with bravado ) Then we 're agoin ' to mutiny and take the old hooker home ourselves . Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at the others , Keeney 's fist shoots out to the side of his jaw . Joe goes down in a heap and lies there . Mrs. Keeney gives a shriek and hides her face in her hands . The men pull out their sheath knives and start a rush , but stop when they find themselves confronted by the revolvers of Keeney and the Mate . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY ( his eyes and voice snapping ) Hold still ! ( The men stand huddled together in a sullen silence . Keeney 's voice is full of mockery . ) You 've found out it ai n't safe to mutiny on this ship , ai n't you ? And now git for'ard where ye belong , and  --  ( He gives Joe 's body a contemptuous kick . ) Drag him with you . And remember the first man of ye I see shirkin ' I 'll shoot dead as sure as there 's a sea under us , and you can tell the rest the same . Git for'ard now ! Quick ! ( The men leave in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Mate with a short laugh and puts his revolver back in his pocket . ) Best get up on deck , Mr. Slocum , and see to it they do n't try none of their skulkin ' tricks . We 'll have to keep an eye peeled from now on . I know ' em . p. 17 SLOCUM Yes , sir . ( He goes out , right . Keeney hears his wife 's hysterical weeping and turns around in surprise  --  then walks slowly to her side . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY ( putting an arm around her shoulder  --  with gruff tenderness ) There , there , Annie . Do n't be afeard . It 's all past and gone . MRS . KEENEY ( shrinking away from him ) Oh , I ca n't bear it ! I ca n't bear it any longer ! CAPTAIN KEENEY ( gently ) Ca n't bear what , Annie ? MRS . KEENEY ( hysterically ) All this horrible brutality , and these brutes of men , and this terrible ship , and this prison cell of a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( After this outburst she calms down and wipes her eyes with her handkerchief . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY ( after a pause during which he looks down at her with a puzzled frown ) Remember , I war n't hankerin ' to have you come on this voyage , Annie . MRS . KEENEY I wanted to be with you , David , do n't you see ? I did n't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I 've been doing these last six years since we were married  --  waiting , and watching , and fearing  --  with nothing to keep my mind occupied  --  not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney 's wife . I used to dream of sailing on the great , wide , glorious ocean . I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all . I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport . And instead  --  ( Her voice grows tremulous . ) All I find is ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 18 CAPTAIN KEENEY I warned you what it 'd be , Annie , " Whalin ' ai n't no ladies ' tea party , " I says to you , and " you better stay to home where you 've got all your woman 's comforts . " ( shaking his head ) But you was so set on it . MRS . KEENEY ( wearily ) Oh , I know it is n't your fault , David . You see , I did n't believe you . I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( protestingly ) I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be . ( Mrs. Keeney looks around her in wild scorn . ) I even sent to the city for that organ for ye , thinkin ' it might be soothin ' to ye to be playin ' it times when they was calms and things was dull like .

If I do n't get away from here , out of this terrible ship , I 'll go mad ! Take me home , David ! I ca n't think any more . I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain . I 'm afraid . Take me home ! p. 19 CAPTAIN KEENEY ( holds her at arm 's length and looks at her face anxiously ) Best go to bed , Annie . You ai n't yourself . You got fever . Your eyes look so strange like . I ai n't never seen you look this way before . MRS . KEENEY ( laughing hysterically ) It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd make any one look strange . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( soothingly ) In a month or two , with good luck , three at the most , I 'll have her filled with ile and then we 'll give her everything she 'll stand and pint for home . MRS . KEENEY But we ca n't wait for that  --  I ca n't wait . I want to get home . And the men wo n't wait . They want to get home . It 's cruel , it 's brutal for you to keep them . You must sail back . You 've got no excuse . There 's clear water to the south now . If you 've a heart at all you 've got to turn back . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( harshly ) I ca n't , Annie . MRS . KEENEY Why ca n't you ?

You want to live up to your silly reputation even if you do have to beat and starve men and drive me mad to do it . p. 20 CAPTAIN KEENEY ( his jaw set stubbornly ) It ai n't that , Annie . Them skippers would never dare sneer to my face . It ai n't so much what any one 'd say  --  but  --  ( He hesitates , struggling to express his meaning . ) You see  --  I 've always done it  --  since my first voyage as skipper . I always come back  --  with a full ship  --  and  --  it do n't seem right not to  --  somehow . I been always first whalin ' skipper out o ' Homeport , and  --  Do n't you see my meanin ' , Annie ?

You 've got more than plenty . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( impatiently ) It ai n't the money I 'm thinkin ' of . D' you think I 'm as mean as that ? p. 21 MRS . KEENEY ( dully ) No  --  I do n't know  --  I ca n't understand  --  ( intensely ) Oh , I want to be home in the old house once more and see my own kitchen again , and hear a woman 's voice talking to me and be able to talk to her .

( She gives a laugh which is half a sob . ) I used to love the sea then . ( She pauses ; then continues with slow intensity . ) But now  --  I do n't ever want to see the sea again . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( thinking to humor her ) ' T is no fit place for a woman , that 's sure . I was a fool to bring ye . MRS .

It was on the twenty-fifth of August we were married , David , was n't it ? CAPTAIN KEENEY ( trying to conceal the fact that her memories have moved him  --  gruffly ) Do n't you remember ? MRS . KEENEY ( vaguely  --  again passes her hand over her eyes ) My memory is leaving me  --  up here in the ice . It was so long ago . ( A pause  --  then she smiles dreamily . ) It 's June now . The lilacs will be all in bloom in the front yard  --  and the climbing roses on the trellis to the side of the house  --  they 're budding .

Why d' you ask me such a question , Annie ? MRS . KEENEY ( shaking him  --  fiercely ) But you do , do n't you , David ? Tell me ! CAPTAIN KEENEY I 'm your husband , Annie , and you 're my wife . Could there be aught but love between us after all these years ? MRS . KEENEY ( shaking him again  --  still more fiercely ) Then you do love me . Say it ! CAPTAIN KEENEY ( simply ) I do , Annie . MRS . KEENEY ( gives a sigh of relief  --  her hands drop to her sides . Keeney regards her anxiously . She passes her hand across her eyes and murmurs half to herself ) I sometimes think if we could only have had a child . ( Keeney turns away from her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to face her  --  intensely ) And I 've always been a good wife to you , have n't I , David ? CAPTAIN KEENEY ( his voice betraying his emotion ) No man has ever had a better , Annie . MRS . KEENEY And I 've never asked for much from you , have I , David ? Have I ? p. 24 CAPTAIN KEENEY You know you could have all I got the power to give ye , Annie . MRS . KEENEY ( wildly ) Then do this this once for my sake , for God 's sake  --  take me home ! It 's killing me , this life  --  the brutality and cold and horror of it . I 'm going mad . I can feel the threat in the air . I can hear the silence threatening me  --  day after gray day and every day the same . I ca n't bear it . ( sobbing ) I 'll go mad , I know I will . Take me home , David , if you love me as you say . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me home ! ( She throws her arms around him , weeping against his shoulder . His face betrays the tremendous struggle going on within him . He holds her out at arm 's length , his expression softening . For a moment his shoulders sag , he becomes old , his iron spirit weakens as he looks at her tear-stained face . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY ( dragging out the words with an effort ) I 'll do it , Annie  --  for your sake  --  if you say it 's needful for ye . MRS . KEENEY ( with wild joy  --  kissing him ) God bless you for that , David ! ( He turns away from her silently and walks toward the companionway . Just at that moment there is a clatter of footsteps on the stairs and the Second Mate enters the cabin. ) p. 25 SLOCUM ( excitedly ) The ice is breakin ' up to no'the'ard , sir . There 's a clear passage through the floe , and clear water beyond , the lookout says . ( Keeney straightens himself like a man coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mate with terrified eyes . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY ( dazedly  --  trying to collect his thoughts ) A clear passage ? To no'the'ard ? SLOCUM Yes , sir . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( his voice suddenly grim with determination ) Then get her ready and we 'll drive her through . SLOCUM Aye , aye , sir . MRS . KEENEY ( appealingly ) David ! CAPTAIN KEENEY ( not heeding her ) Will the men turn to willin ' or must we drag ' em out ? SLOCUM They 'll turn to willin ' enough . You put the fear o ' God into ' em , sir . They 're meek as lambs . CAPTAIN KEENEY Then drive ' em  --  both watches . ( with grim determination ) They 's whale t' other side o ' this floe and we 're going to git ' em . SLOCUM Aye , aye , sir . ( He goes out hurriedly . A moment later there is the sound of scuffling feet from the deck outside and the Mate 's voice shouting orders. ) p. 26 CAPTAIN KEENEY ( speaking aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home like a yaller dog ! MRS . KEENEY ( imploringly ) David ! CAPTAIN KEENEY ( sternly ) Woman , you ai n't adoin ' right when you meddle in men 's business and weaken ' em . You ca n't know my feelin 's . I got to prove a man to be a good husband for ye to take pride in . I got to git the ile , I tell ye . MRS . KEENEY ( supplicatingly ) David ! Are n't you going home ? CAPTAIN KEENEY ( ignoring this question  --  commandingly ) You ai n't well . Go and lay down a mite . ( He starts for the door . ) I got to git on deck . ( He goes out . She cries after him in anguish ) David ! ( A pause . She passes her hand across her eyes  --  then commences to laugh hysterically and goes to the organ . She sits down and starts to play wildly an old hymn . Keeney renters from the doorway to the deck and stands looking at her angrily . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) CAPTAIN KEENEY Woman , what foolish mockin ' is this ? ( She laughs wildly and he starts back from her in alarm . ) Annie ! What is it ? ( She does n't answer him . Keeney 's voice trembles . ) Do n't you know me , Annie ? ( He puts both hands on her shoulders and turns her around so that he can look into her eyes . She stares up at him with a stupid expression , a vague smile on her lips . He stumbles away from her , and she commences softly to play the organ again. ) p. 27 CAPTAIN KEENEY ( swallowing hard  --  in a hoarse whisper , as if he had difficulty in speaking ) You said  --  you was a-goin ' mad  --  God ! ( A long wail is heard from the deck above . Ah bl-o-o-o-ow ! A moment later the Mate 's face appears through the skylight . He can not see Mrs. Keeney . ) SLOCUM ( in great excitement ) Whales , sir  --  a whole school of ' em  --  off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big ones ! CAPTAIN KEENEY ( galvanized into action ) Are you lowerin ' the boats ? SLOCUM Yes , sir . CAPTAIN KEENEY ( with grim decision ) I 'm a-comin ' with ye . SLOCUM Aye , aye , sir . ( jubilantly ) You 'll git the ile now right enough , sir . ( His head is withdrawn and he can be heard shouting orders . ) CAPTAIN KEENEY ( turning to his wife ) Annie ! Did you hear him ? I 'll git the ile . ( She does n't answer or seem to know he is there . He gives a hard laugh , which is almost a groan . ) I know you 're foolin ' me , Annie . You ai n't out of your mind  --  ( anxiously ) be you ? I 'll git the ile now right enough  --  jest a little while longer , Annie  --  then we 'll turn hom'ard . I ca n't turn back now , you see that , do n't ye ? I 've got to git the ile. ( in sudden terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? ( She keeps on playing the organ , but makes no reply . The Mate 's face appears again through the skylight. ) p. 28 SLOCUM All ready , sir . ( Keeney turns his back on his wife and strides to the doorway , where he stands for a moment and looks back at her in anguish , fighting to control his feelings . ) SLOCUM Comin ' , sir ? CAPTAIN KEENEY ( his face suddenly grown hard with determination ) Aye . ( He turns abruptly and goes out . Mrs. Keeney does not appear to notice his departure . Her whole attention seems centered in the organ . She sits with half-closed eyes , her body swaying a little from side to side to the rhythm of the hymn . Her fingers move faster and faster and she is playing wildly and discordantly as The Curtain Falls )
