txt In the last few hours allowed him by the Constitution , President Taft decided to-day against the Immigration bill and vetoed it in a brief message to the Senate . There , as soon as it was read , Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , Chairman of the Immigration Committee , after a conference with leaders of both parties in the House and Senate , announced that When the pending business was out of the way he would move to pass the bill , the objections of the President of the United to the Celltrary notwithstanding . " It is expeced hat this effort will be made on Monday . The reading test for would-be immi grants is the one reason mentioned ' by ? the President for his disapproval , . and in the Senate the opinion was freely expressed this . afternoon that the motion to override the veto would easily command the needed two-thirds vote . In the House there is greater edopht , , although , Mr. Lodge 's announcement was made with the approval of Congressman John L. But= net of Alabama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The measure had such strength in the Senate that it passed without roll calls . But in ' he House , at one stage of the proceedings , a motion to recommit the bill was defeated only by 1-19 to 70  --  or 0 more than a bare two-thirds , and a change of four votes on ' that motion would have shown the measure with less than twothirds of the House behind it. / It has always been supposed that a motion to override the President 's veto brings to the side of the Administration trany members of the President 's party , who otherwise would vote against him . But that is hardly true  --  in this case . The President ? - will retire into private life in eighteen clays , and his influence is at low ebb . Besides , the circumstances of the present veto have greatly angered even the President 's supporters In both Houses . Senator Lodge is a close friend of the President , as are many of the Senators who most cordially supported the Immigration bill and they will lead the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hoped that Mr. Taft would sign the measure . At the Cabinet meeting this morning the President was still undecided , and even When the Cabinet adjourned after discussing the bill for more than two hours , his mind was not made up . Taft Swayed by Nagel . The Cabinet itself appeared about equally divided . In the end the President accepted the reasoning presented to him in a letter from the Secretary of Commerce and Labor , Mr. Nagel , and that letter , appended tei , his brief message , constituted the real criticism of the measure . The President 's message contains little more than one hundred words , written on one sheet of paper in the President 's own handwriting . This message the Pr. ! sident wrote at his desk ' some time after the Cabinet meeting broke up . If the President had . waited until after the Senate had adjourned this evening the bill would have become law without his signature . His message , short as it is , indicates , what a struggle there was in the President 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes behind the measure in both houses , he said , and the able presentation of the bill 's merits . by delegations before him , had great weight , but he could not make up his mind to sign a bill out of harmony with American institutions . He explained that statement as having reference to the literacy test and . referred to Mr. Nagel 's letter in elaboration of ? his view . The President 's message reads : . I do this with great reluctance . The bill ? Contains many valuable . amendments to the prea  --  lit immigration law , ? tvtileh will- insure greater certainty in excluding-.undesirable migrants . The bill received strong support in both houses , and was recommended by an able commission after an extended investigation and carefully drawn conclusions . But I can not make up my mind to sign a bill which in its chief provision violates a principle that was , in my opinion , to be upheld in dealing with our immigration . I refer to the literacy test . For the reasons - ? stated in Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that test . The Secretary 's letter accompanies this . Like the President , Mr. Nagel based his final objection to the bill on the sole ground of the literacy test . He mentions five other objections , of which a good deal has been made , but dismisses most of them with the remark that , while unsatisfactory . those clauses leave the law pretty much where it is . His minor objections have to do with the inclusion of Hawaii within the terms of the bill ; the ' vague language of the provisions exclud ! ing aliens capable of assuming citizenship ; the provision whereby the Secretary of Commerce and Labor 's decision , admittirg skilled labor under contract , may be submitted to a review by the courts lir advance of affirmative action : the pro ' vision for detailing matrons and inspeetors on immigrant vessels , and the drastic power in the hands of the Secretary for penalizing ship companies that solicit immigrants . Objections to Literacy Test . Nr . Nagel 's objections to the literacy test are as follows : In my opinion this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the immediate effect which it may have upon immigration , and the embarrassment and cost it may impose upon the service , but because it involves a. principle of far-reaching consequences , with respect to which our attitude will be regarded with profound intercat . The provision , as it now appears will require careful reading . In some measure the group system is adopted ; that is , one qualified im-riUgront may bring.in certain members of his family , but ; the effect seems to be that a qualified alien may bring in members of his family who may themselves be disqualified , whereas a disqualified member wc-ctd exclude all dependent members of his family , no matter hot , ? well qualified they might otherwise be , in other words , a father who can read a dialect might bring In an entire family of absolutely illiterate people , barring his sons over 1G years of age , whereas , a father who can not read a dialect would bring about the exclusion of his entire family , although ; every one of them can read and write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the family as against the male members , does not seem to me to rest upon sound reasons . Sentimentally , of course , it appeals , but industrially considered , it does not appear to me that the distinction is sound . Furthermore , there is no provision for the admission of anions who have been domiciled here and Who have ? simply gone abroad for a visit . Tim . test wouldlabsolutely exclude them upon return . Tn the administration of this law very considerable embarrassment will be experienced . This at least is the judgment . of members of the immigration force . upon whose recommendations I rely . Delay will necessarily ensue at all ports , but on the borders of Canada and Mexico that delay will almost necessarily result in great friction and constant complaint Furthermore . the force will have to be Vert ' considerably increased . and the appropriation will probably be in excess of presentsums expended by as 11-0,11 as a million dollars . The force of interpreters will hove to tic largely increased , and . practically speaking , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interpreter for any kind of language or dialect of the world at any port at arty time . Finally . the interpreters will necessarily be foreigners . and with respect to only a very few of the languages or dialects will it be possible for the officials in charge to exercise anything like supervision : Provision iadefensive . Apart front these considerations , I am of the opinion that this provision can not be defended upon its merits . It was originally urged as a selective test . For dome time recommendations in its support upon that . p.otind have been brought to our attention . The matter has been considered from that point of view , and I became completely satisfied that upon that ground the test could not he . sustained . The. - older argument Is now abandoned .. and in the later conference , at least , the ground is taken that the provision is to be defended as a practical measure to exclude -a large proportion of undesirable immigrants from cents in countries . The measure proposes to reach this result by indirection , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filial purpose being to reduce the quantity of cheap labor in this country . can not accept this argument . No doubt the law would exclude a considerable perventage of immigration from Southern Italy . among the Poles , the Mexicans. and the Greeks . This exclusion would embrace probably in large hart undesirable but also a great many desirable people , and the embarrarsatent , expense , and distress to those who seek to enter could be out of all proportion to any good that can possibly be promised for Viis measure . My observation leads me to the conclusion that . so far as the merits of the individpal immigrant are concerned , the test is altogether overestimated . The people woo conic Isom the countries named are frequently illiterate because opportunities have bfli , denied them . The oppression with which these people have to contend in modern limes Is not religious , but it consists of a denial of the opportunity to acquire reading and writing . Frequently the attempt to learn to read and write the language of the particular people is discouraged by the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really striving to free themselves front the conditions under which they have been compelled to live . So far as the industrial conditions are concerned , I think the question has been superficially considered . We need labor in this country , and the natives are unwilling to do the work which the aliens come over to do . It is perfectly true that in a few cities and localities there are congested conditions . It is equally true that in very much larger areas we are practically without help . Immigrant Distribution Bad . In my judgment no sufficiently earnest and intelligent effort has been made to bring our wants and our supply together , and so far the same forces Mat give the chief support to this provision of the new bill have stubbornly resisted any effort looking to an intelligent distribution of new immigration to meet the needs of our vast country . In my judgment no such drastic measure , based upon a ground which is untrue and urged for a reason which we are unwilling to assert . should be adopted until we have at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . Furthermore , there is a misapprehension as to the character of the people who come over here to remain . It is true that in certain localities newly arrived aliens live under tic Movable conddlons . Just as Muen may be said of certain localities that have been inhabited for a hundred years by natives of this country . These arc not the general conditions . but they are the exceptions . It is : rue : hat a very considerable portion of immigrants do not come to remain , but return after they have acquired some means , or beeatwe they find themselves unable to cope with the ? ondit ; ons of a new anti aggressive country . Those who return for the latter reason relieve us. of their own volition , of a burden . Those who return after they have acquired some means certainly must be admitted to have left with us a consideration for the advantage which they have enjoyed . A careful examination of the character of .. tse warp , who eutne to stay and of the employment in which a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mY judgment . dispel the apprehension which many of our people entertain . ? The census will disclose that with rapid strides the foreign-born citizen is tics:miring the farm lands of this country . Even if the foreign-born alone is considered , the percentage of his ownership is assuming a proportion that ought to attract the attention of the native citizens . If the second generation is included it is safe to say that In the Middle West and West a majority of the farms arc to-day owned by foreign-born people or they are descendants of the first generation . This does not embrace only the Germans and ? - the Scandinavians , but is tree On large measure , for illustration , of the Bohemians and the Poles . It is true in surprising measure of the Italians . not only of the northern Italians , but of the southern : Aliens Who Return . Again , an examination of the aliens who come to stay is of great significance . During the last fiscal year ** aliens came to our shores , although the net immigration of the year was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received of skilled labor.127. - 01 ( 3. and only 35,800 returned , we received servants , 116,029 , and only 13,490 returned ; we received farm laborers , ** and only 3.975 returned , It appears that laborers came in the number , 135.720 , while ? 09.210 returned . Those figures ought to demonstrate that we get substantially what we most need , and what we can not ourselves supply , and that we get rid of what we least need and what seems to furnish . in the minds of many , ithe chief justification for the bill now under consideration . The census returns show conclusively that the importance of illiteracy among aliens is overestimated , and that these people are Prompt , after their arrival , to avail of the opportunities which this country affords . While , according to the reports of the Bureau of Immigration . about 25 per cent . of the incoming aliens are illiterate , the census shows that among the foreign-born people of such States as New - York and Massachusetts , where most of the congestion complained of has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . fur . Nagel was persuaded , he said in conclusion , that the provision was in principle of very great consequence , and that it was based upon a fallacy in undertakin ' ? to apply a test which was not calculated to reach the truth and to find relief from a danger which really did not exist . lie did not think it admitted of compromise , and , much as he regretted to do so , because he deemed the other provisions of the measure as I most respects excellent and in no respect really objectionable , he was forced to advise the President not to approve the bill .
