txt The report published in yesterday 's New Yong . Tans that the present T. Pierpont Morgan would not- give the famous fifty-million-dollar Morgan art collection to the City of New York , as his father had intended to do , created excitement In art circles throughout the world . Cable inquiries for details were received from the best-known dealers in all the principal cities of Europe , from London to Vienna and Budapest . Late in the afternoon a cable dispatch was received here rrom Buenos Aires asking if the news was true , as there were plenty of wealthy Argentinans who had money to spend on rare art objects that were known to toe , genuine . To sel Isuch a colection as Mr. Morgan 's would take several years , in order to realize the proper value for the treasures it contains . Foreign art experts now in New York said yesterday that , properly arranged and disposed of the collection would reanze between $40 , - 000,000 and $50,000,000 . Friends who have spoken with Mr. Morgan on the subject of his fathers famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with it . He has , however , they say , made up his his mind that he will not give it to the City of New York , and also he intends to get rid of a number of articles In the collection which he does not want . Exactly what these objects are , Mr. Morgan may make known when the collection has been arranged and set out in the Metropolitan Museum , so that he can see it all and decide what he will keep and the various articles that he will either give to the Museum or dispose of otherwise . In making this selection Mr. Morgan will probably have , the advice of some of the bestknown art experts of this country and Europe , who will fix a value on such objects as are to be sold . These may be Offered at public auction in this city , a portion at a time , after the whole collection has been on view for a year or more at the Metropolitan Museum . Should this be decided upon , ample time will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America , and elsewhere . Mr. Morgan , Taillts. , J. F. Morgan said yesterdaf-in his Office in the Mills Building , in ' Broad Street , that he would not add to the statement in regard to his intentions which was published in Tau Ngw YORK TT:HES yesterday morning . He went on to say that any attempt to " accelerate " his disposition of his father 's collection might result in " the sale of every piece in it . " Mr. Morgan spoke of the clauses in the will which suggested giving part of the collection to the Morgan Memorial in Hartford , Conn . As indicating the difficulty of making a disposition of the collection that would satisfy every one , lie referred to the fact that whatever went to Hartford might be considered a loss to New York City , while gifts to the Metropolitan Museum here might be considered unjust to Hartford . Wo n't Be Hurried . Mr. Morgan emphasized the statement that he would take his own time to making his decision as to what he would do with his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be sold , and the works of art would be exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum . Previous to the opening of this exhibition , he said , he would have no knowledge of what the collection as a whole contained . Its scope was so great that he had never had an opportunity to familiarize himself with it . Robert W. de Forest , President of the Metropolitan Museum , did not visit his office , at 30 Broad Street , yesterday . It was said there that Mr. de Forest had sent word that he would not discuss the announcement in yesterday 's NEW Yoga Tams that New York City was to lose the Morgan collection . On Mr. de Forest 's behalf copies of the June Bulletin , published by the Museum , were given to reporters . This issue of The Bulletin contains letters exchanged between Mr. Morgan and Mr. de Forest . In his letter to Mr. Morgan , the Secretary of the Museum acknowledges Mr. Morgan 's right to make such permanent disposition of the collection as he sees fit . This is The Bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced in the daily papers of May 29 , Mr. J. Pierpont Mor- ' gan has made known his intentions and desires regarding the preliminary disposition of the works of art sent by his father from Europe to this country last year . His formal announcement was made in the following letter addressed to the Trustees of the Museum : May 27 , 1913 . Gentlemen : It is my desire that the objects of art left by my father should be exhibited for the benefit of the public as soon as may be . I know it was in my father 's mind to make a loan exhibition of them in the new south wing which is to be built , for which I understand that an appropriation has been assured by the Board of Estimate . A long time , however , must necessarily elapse before the construction of the new wing makes such an exhibition possible . I understand from various talks with Mr. Robinson that it is quite possible to arrange in the new northeast wing , a temporary installation of the objects , which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage to the people of New York , since it would enable them to see the things and get the benefit of them pending such final disposition as may be made of the objects under Mr. Morgan 's will . If it can be done , therefore , I should be glad to have the things shown at a loan exhibition to be opened at some time early in the year 1914 . I quite understand that the installation in the new northeast wing would be only temporary in character , and would not be as satisfactory as the more loerfect arrangement which would be possible by waiting , but I am impressed by the fact that a delay of two -- years must occur if we decide to wait for the more perfect conditions , and Coruized on Page 3 . ALL THE WORLD . SEEKS MORGAN ART // it would be a pity to ftprive the public for so long of an opportunity of seeing these objects . Yours very truly , J. P. MORGAN . Concedes Morgan 's Right to Sell . To this letter , Mr. Robert W. de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of the Trustees : May 28 , 1913 . J. P. Morgan , Esq. : Dear Sir : We have your letter of May 27 containing your generous offer of a loan exhibition of the objects of art left by the late Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan , at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and shall be very glad to arrange for the temporary exhibition which you suggest . We are sure that the public will be grateful for the opportunity of seeing them promptly and will approve our giving their exhibition precedence . It is perfectly understood by us , and will be understood by the public , that this In no way commits you or the other executors of Mr , Morgan 's estate to any course in regard to their ultimate disposition . Yos very truly , ROBERTur W. DE FOREST , Secretary . From Mr. Morgan 's letter It is clear that he has not yet reached a decision as to the ultimate disposition of this collection , as he is empowered to do by his father 's will , and it is to be inferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temporary exhibition , of which he speaks , shall have been inaugurated . It is gratifying to know , however , that for a time at least the collection will not be broken up or divided , and that the people of New York will be given ample opportunity to see and enjoy the post famous collection of works of art that has been brought together in our generation , remarkable alike for the wealth of Important objects which it includes and the wide range of interest covered by them . The opportunity will be one which even the collector himself never enjoyed , for he never saw all these treasures in one place or at one time . Half the Collection Set Out . TnE NEW YORK Trams learned yesterday that a little more than half of the Morgan collection has been set out in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and that , when completed , it will fill more than twenty rooms . The work will occupy another four weeks at least , and the collection in its entirety will then be viewed for the first time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , as it was scattered over London ? in the National Gallery , South Kensington Museum , and in his London house until it was brought to this country . According to the best-known art experts in New York , London , and Paris , the Morgan collection is the finest private collection in the world and embraces the entire field of art with the exception of armor . It begins with the fourteenth century and includes some of the rarest manuscripts , books , and works of art in existence . Nearest Great Collections . The next best private collection is that owned by Lord Alfred Rothschild in London , and the third best is that owned by Baron Alphonse Rothschild of Paris . Part of their collections came from Frankfort , Germany , on the death of Baron Leopold Rothschild , when his house , filled with the art treasures he had collected in Persia , India , China , and Japan , as well as Europe , was broken up and its contents divided among the members of the family . The collection of art treasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum for the citizens of New York to view consists solely of paintings , gold jewelry , rare jewels of all descriptions , lace , tapestries , embroideries and other objects of art brought over from London . Rare books , manuscripts , privets , paintings and miscellaneous treasures collected by the late J. P. Morgan remain in his library at 33 East Thirtysixth Street , where he had them arranged . No Appraisal Begun Yet . Benjamin Duveen of Duveen Brothers , art dealers of 720 Fifth Avenue , said yesterday that Mr. Morgan had not discussed the disposition of his father 's collection with him and that such a discussion to be official would have to be conducted with him as the senior partner . He said that he had not been asked to appraise the collection for the purposes of the State inheritance tax and he asserted that he doubted whether any other member of the firm had been so approached . He said that only the other day he had called up a friend in the New York office of State Controller William Sohmer to ascertain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of the Legislature the Morgan collection would be exempt from the transfer tax , he said , if it was given to public uses within two years . after Mr. Morgan 's death . There had been no report in the art trade , Mr. Duveen said , that any dealer had been called upon to appraise the Morgan coleiction . To do justice to the collection in making a final disposition of it , Mr. Duveen said , would require a great deal of time and thought , and for that reason , he said , he did not expect any uevision on Mr. Morgan 's part for some months . If there had been any negotiations looking toward the sale ? of any part of the Morgan collection , Mr. Duveen said yesterday , he felt that he should have heard of it . City Authorities Interested . Controller Prendergast and George , President of the Board of Aldermen , were much interested yesterday in the report that J. P. Morgan might not give to the city the more important art objects gollected by his father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was not familiar with the situation . When Mr. was asked just what interest the city had in trying to keep the collection , he said : " The Board of Estimate appropriated corporate stock to the amount of 8750 , - 000 to build an additional wing to the Metropolitan Museum of Art . All negotiations were conducted with the trustees of the Museum . Presumably the additional wing was to be constructed - to take care of the Morgan collection , but whether or not work has been started upon it I do not know . It was stated by the trustees that the additional wing was needed and the Board of Estimate went ahead and appropriated the money . So far as I know the late Mr. Morgan did not make any promises to the city regarding his collection , but the trustees of the Museum dealt with him personally and the Board of Estimate had nothing to do with it beyond furnishing the money . If there was any obligation on the part of Mr. Morgan to give his collection to the city only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Controller Prendergast said that his understanding of the situation was the same as Mr. MeAneny's.
