The oeganizations instruct their followers to assemble at factories to prevent work and direct them to avoid street demonstrations in order that the government may have no opportunity to crush the movement by force . Some 300 business and professional men and officers in the city , mostly adherents of the old order , held a meeting and decided to - take immediate steps for organizing a general strike of all the non-Socialist classes as a counter measure . It was asserted in the debate at the gathering that the government officials believed such a strike would assist them effectively In the struggle against the " red terror .
