As the year draws to a close , and the fifth consecutive month of the European war is nearly ended , the American financial markets are moving in a suggestive and interesting way . The stock market , after its vigorous advance on the reopening of the Exchange , and after the rather speedy downward reaction , has fallen into a state of uncertainty . Confronted on the one hand by an undoubtedly strong demand from American investors , and on the other by the continued doubt as to whether foreign investors would not sell on any inviting rise in prices , the market seemed to have become in a sense between comparatively narrow limits of prices . Even last Fri-clay 's decision of the rate case , in favor of the railways , gave only a temporary stimulus to the rise . This may have meant that financial judgment as to intrinsic values has not yet been determined  --  especially as prices still hold well above those of July 30 , when the Stock Exchange closed its doors . But in. other branches of the financial marli-ets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to begin with , have returned to by far the lowest level since the war began  --  in fact , to what even in ordinary times would be called " easy money . " Official rediscount rates at the Federal Reserve Banks have been reduced ' fully 2 per cent . - Yet , in spite of this absence of anything ' like a bid for European capital , international exchange has moved decisively in. this ? ountry 's favor . Exchange on London , - which in August and September held so long at rates exorbitantly high , has this week declined to the lowest level since last February ; a level not far distant from the normal gold-import point . This notable movement is ascribed , first to the large remittances of gold already made by us to Europe , but also , and perhaps chiefly , to the expanding export movement . Even in October the country 's excess of exports fell $81,600,000 under 1913 . In November , it was only $17,700,000 smaller . This month , with Europe 's purchases of materials very large , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cotton exports last week matching those of a year ago ( whereas in August they were barely 10 per cent . of 1913 ) , the influence of our outward trade in merchandise is undoubtedly much more positive . Not least in importance among the movements on the markets has been the rise in wheat , this week , to a price higher than was reached even in the excited " war speculation " of September . This rise is partly recognition of the continued and very heavy European buying . But it is also based on some new calculations for the immediate future . Last Thursday the Government gave out its estimate on condition and acreage of our newly planted winter wheat crop . The figures brought both reassurance and disappointment . The crop 's condition is the lowest of any December since 19119 per cent . under last December , and nearly 3 per cent . below the ten-year average . Yet , ? on the other hand , the planted area is 1138 per cent . greater than a year ago , and 203/a Per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure that the higher acreage so far offsets the lower condition as to indicate a yield of 689,000,000 bushels , as against 690,000,000 this past season . But " December forecasts " are a notoriously dangerous reliance , and the fall in the crop 's condition percentage in . Kansas to 80 , as against 100 last December , inspires some caution . As a general.rule , the grain trade is inclined to regard the outlook for the next winter wheat crop as decidedly poorer than a year ago . Even if our own crop were to fulfil the tentative estimate just cited , it does not seem possible for the world 's wheat crop of 1915 to equal that of 1914 ? though this year 's total , despite the huge American harvest , fell 386,000,000 bushels short of 1913 . The new acreage in France , Germany , Austria-Hungary , Belgium , and the Balkan States , also in Holland and parts of Russia , is almost sure to be greatly reduced , as a result of the drafting of able-bodied farm workmen into the various armies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland , as a result of continuous warfare on the very ground where the new crop would normally be planted The Balkan States in 1913 , despite continuance of their savage war well into the crop season , produced unexpectedly large harvests ; yet the decrease from the previous year in the yield of Bulgaria , Servia , and Greece was something like 20 per cent. , while neighboring countries which were not at war showed little change . On the basis of final estimates on the great wheat yield of 1914 , there is likely to be only 82,000,000 bushels left from our own crop for the balance of the season  --  which is a very small reserve . Australia 's crop is short ; she will have to import about 8,000,000 bushels , against exports of 68,000,000 last season . Canada will be cleaned out of wheat , in all probability , at the end of this present season . So that this is the interesting situation which appears to be ahead of us . If this country 's wheat crop of 1915 were to turn out one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a season of excessively high prices for grain And even if our harvest  --  after a December condition estimate which is , after all , far better than that which preceded the then very large wheat yield of 1912 ? should once - more be abundant , we should in all probability repeat the remarkable achievements of this year 's American grain trade . For Europe will certainly need all the wheat that the United States will have to spare .
