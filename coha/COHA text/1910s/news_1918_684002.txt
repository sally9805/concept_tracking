txt The front has subsided into actions of no more than local importance . The five days ' battle west of the Oise has ended for the Germans , after an advance varying from two to six miles , in a very costly reverse , and for the Allies in a brilliant success of good generalship and indomitable spirit in the ranks . Beside the losses of the enemy , the French loss of the Thiescourt hills and the wooded part of the valley opposite is of little importance . The offensive which - was to give a decision against them Is far from finished , but in relation to the resistance it encounters , it shows a falling , not a rising , gamut of power . The first push toward Amiens ended in ten days , having entailed upon the Allies the sacrifice of a tract forty miles deep and serious casualties . The following attack in the north lasted about as long , but with much slighter gains . The German succesN on the Chemin-des-Dames brought the Crown Prince 's vanguard to the Marne , twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less vital ground is proved by the transfer of its centre of pressure to the Ourcq Valley near Villers-Cotterets . From these results to those of the present week 's fighting there is a marked descent , and this failure occurs in what must be accounted one of the most critical directions the enemy can pursue . The ambitious character of his design is now clear . It is not merely to divide the British from the French army and then destroy one of them , but also by a single series of converging operations to destroy them both . His approach to Amiens as the centre of their joint communications and to Hazebrouck as the door to the Channel ports has been followed by an approach along four converging lines to the region of Paris , the centre of French administrative life . In fact , the attainment of all these objectives would not end the war , for I am sure there is in France , and there probably is in the other countries concerned , a deadly resolution that it shall not be ended in any such way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven forfend  --  another capital shall he found , and that there shall be no surrender while there is an army on its legs . Happily , these extremities are not in view , but it is well that the German people should understand what they are up against . Two Atmre of . the Offennive . This offensive has had two aims ? to reach the crescent north and east of Paris , whence a general attack could be launched , and to draw down , disperse , and harry the allied reserves preparatory to the final " Kaisentehlacht , " the crowning blow along the whole line . Its relative failure is a great encouragement . The north may have to meet a like blow . There is no room for infatuated confidence , but , even without counting a factor that will at last be decisive  --  the young and already splendidly active American Army ? we may compare the desperate plight of the German people with the inordinate program its military chiefs have dared to plan , with the heroic stand of the French armies this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deduced .
