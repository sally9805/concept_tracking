txt Senate Committee Summons Burleson to Explain Expansion Order . " WASHINGTON , July 22 , ? Concerted opposition has developed in Congress to Postmaster General Burleson 's order reducing parcel post rates and increasing the maximum size of packages to be handled in the service . The order was issued Sunday , to become effective Aug. 15 , and to-day the Senate Post Office Committee requested Mr. Burleson to appear before the committee next Thursday with an explanation of the authority for his action . This was the first step in what promises to be a bitter contest . When the Postmaster General has been heard the committee , it Is expected , will undertake to have withdrawn before Aug. 15 any authority he may claim Congress - has given him to change rates and sizes . It was contended in the committee that the proposed changes would entail an enormous loss to the Government . Some of the members complained strenuously that the Post Office Department had failed to furnish to Congress data concerning the parcel post . Apparently , there was no difference of opinion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rates , Democrats and Republicans agreeing that only Congress ought to have this power . Those supporting the Postmaster General insist that the only loss imminent under the proposed changes would be to the express companies , which now carry the profit-making ' laro'e-size packages , while the Government transports the unprofitable small ones . Although members of the committee contend that it is a mere ungrammatical jumble of words , without sense or power , department officials say that the Postmaster General is given ample authority for his order by the following section of the parcel post law : The classification . of articles mailable , as well as the weight limit , the rates of postage , zone or zones and other conditions of mailability under this act , if the Postmaster General shall find on experience that they or any of them are such as to prevent the shipment of articles desirable or to permanently render the cost of the service greater than the receipts of the revenue therefrom , he is hereby authorized , subject to the consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission after investigation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight limit , rates . zone or zones or conditions , or either , in order to promote the service to the public or to insure the receipt of revenue from such service adequate to pay the cost thereof . Senator Bryan of Florida on April 15 last introduced a , bill to repeal the clause in question , and after Mr. 13urleson 's appearance he will urge a favorable report upon this measure . The Senate committee Is said to be chagrined because the Postmaster General announced his proposed changes before sending the committee a reply to a request for his opinion on the Bryan bill . Consideration of the bill had been delayed pending his response . The joint committee to investigate the parcel post , composed of members of ? the Senate and House Post Office Committees , is dissatisfied , too , because the request of its Chairman . Senator Bristow , several weeks ago , for data in regard to the parcel post has brought no results .                   @ @
