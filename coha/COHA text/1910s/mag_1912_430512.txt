 | Exactly to convey the sentiment of a section or people at any time is well-nigh impossible , and this is especially true now , more than a half century later , with reference to the seething and heterogeneous public opinion of the southern people in 1850 . The fact that so little has been written of the southern convention which in June , and again in November of that year , met in Nashville , Tennessee , adds to the difficulty of the task accurately to present today either its historic import or its significance at that time . So far as my efforts at research have led , not one article of more than newspaper importance pertaining to it has ever been placed before the reading public . A careful examination of the files of the papers issued in Nashville and elsewhere during the convention 's sessions , of text-books of the period , which for the most part devote anywhere from three or four lines to a page or so to the subject , and of a few other miscellaneous sources , among which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is therefore inaccurate , reveals the fact that there was , and is , a vast difference of opinion as to whether the meeting really reflected the southern sentiment generally , or even that of the southern leadership of the time . It is not the purpose of this paper to review the history of the period , except incidentally , nor even to go far into the detailed discussions which took place in the convention itself ; but rather , from a study of all the material available , to show wherein this vast project proposed by Calhoun and Mississippi failed of the purpose for which public sentiment believed it called . In order to make the study interesting , however , it is necessary to go back to the previous year , and see how the convention was the result of congressional discussions . The long discussed but ever new subject of slavery was vigorously debated in the 1848-9 session of the American congress . Very early in the session a caucus of sixty-nine southern members was called , the outcome of whose discussion was an " Address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued January 22 , 1849 . This caucus and this paper but reflected the leadership ? nay , the dominance ? of John C. Calhoun , although a study of the record shows that he did meet with strenuous opposition , which slightly amended his vigorous denunciation of all things northern . The " Address " was a plea for unity " among ourselves , " for the purpose of resisting any application of the Wilmot Proviso , and for other purposes . It was the avowed opinion of the Whig element in the caucus ? perhaps of the Whig party in the South just at this time ? that Mr. Calhoun was bent upon the destruction of the Union , and an independent confederacy . In fact , the only conclusion which could be drawn from the " Address " was that " the honor and duty of self preservation with equal imperiousness required that they protect themselves at whatever cost . " * It sounded gloomy indeed ; and yet it stated that beyond being " united and ready " it would not be proper to go " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wondered whether he was not simply afraid to go further and say the final word . That is a thing which will perhaps never be known . The " Address " did not directly call for a convention , but strongly hinted at the idea as a necessary future resort . The " Address " was published in the leading newspapers of the South , and found a hearty response in most of them . More and more , the question whether the southern states should join together to resist their aggressive and , as they thought , unscrupulous and greedy neighbors , came to be discussed throughout the section . Newspapers are powerful moulders of public sentiment , though perforce very often faulty . More authentic expressions are those of the state legislatures . Let us notice some of them , immediately before , and closely following , the publication of the " Address . " South Carolina , always in the lead in this matter , on December 15 , 1848 , had said that " the time for discussion has passed , and this General Assembly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of the Wilmot Proviso at any and all hazards . " f Florida , on January 13 , 1849 , just before the " Address " was published , had declared herself ready to join other  | states " for the defence of our rights , whether through a Southern Convention or otherwise . " * Virginia , January 20 , 1849 , made provision for a special session of the legislature in the case congress should pass the " obnoxious measures now pending . " f North Carolina , January 27 , 1849 , suggested the extension of the Missouri Compromise Line through the new territory over which the debate was raging. : -I : Missouri , March 10 , 1849 , asserted that the action of the North forced the South from the Compromise of 1820 , and declared that she was willing to " cooperate with the slave-holding states for mutual protection against Northern fanaticism . " ? The action of the legislatures , so nearly uniform in purpose and note , indicates the widespread and general dissatisfaction then existing . Calhoun and Webster were engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended to the territories . The debate ended without a settlement ; and Calhoun , having failed to win a majority of the congress to his view , seemed now more than ever bent upon uniting the entire South in some organized and practical way . It is perhaps generally conceded now that the great chieftain believed secession the inevitable necessity of the South , and thought the sooner it came the better . A study of his private letters to friends in the different states , and those published in newspapers throughout the South , overwhelmingly convinces us that before there was any organized movement or general desire for a convention , he for one believed sincerely that such a meeting was the only definite and practical way of obtaining a united expression of the will of the people of his section . Perhaps the first definite ? though informal ? movement , outside of South Carolina , having in view the crystallization of the southern sentiment into some definite outline , took place in May , 1849 , just after the publication of the " Address , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens for the stated purpose of " protesting against the policy of Congress . " The meeting was significant : it issued a call for a State Convention to meet in October of that year , to " consider the threatening relations between the North and South . " The language of the  | call was general : it did not allude to special grievances , but simply spoke of the " strained relations . " If the above meeting was in itself small and informal , the state convention which met in Jackson in October in response to its call was largely attended and took on a semblance of authority and prestige . It was the united expression by Mississippi Democrats , and by many of the Whigs as well , of their common section 's disapproval of national management . Further on I shall devote a paragraph to a treatment of the influence of sectionalism on the two great political parties in the South . The chairman of this meeting was none other than Judge William L. Sharkey , the distinguished chief justice of the state , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secessionist , and decidedly and consistently of Union tendencies , he was nevertheless very strongly opposed to congress ' removing slavery from the territories . The chief work of this convention was the issuance of a call ? again through an address ? to the people of the South to send delegates to meet at Nashville , Tennessee , the following June , with a view and hope of arresting the course of aggression . Now was the hope of Carolina 's sage to be realized . The anxiety of the man for just such a meeting has been shown . In a letter* dated July 9 , 1849 , and written by him at Fort Hill to Colonel C. S. Tarpley , a prominent Mississippian who had written for advice as to the course the October state convention should pursue , he voices that high solicitude . Beyond all doubt he believed now that such a convention was the South 's only hope . " I have delayed answering your letter , " he said , " that I might more fully notice the development at the North before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us every day . There has not been a single occurrence since the rising of congress which does not indicate on the part of the North a determination to push the abolition question to the last extreme . " Then he states his idea of the purpose of such a convention as that about to meet as being " to put forth , in solemn manner , " ? Calhoun was always solemn , mind you ? " the cause of our grievances in an address to the other states . " His advice was followed , exactly . It was probably not expected by the Mississippians who called it that the Southern Convention should decide on any definite  | plan of action ; for the address stated that " should the Convention be unable to secure the proper redress " , the legislatures of the states injured should call " still more solemn conventions , whose members should be chosen by the people to deliberate , speak and act , with all the sovereign power of the people . " From these small conventions there might be " yet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate government for their separate existence , apart from the North . " I think we may conclude from this that the state convention which called the Nashville meeting was characterized by a hesitation and fear of going too far ; an anxiety for discussion and resolutions with a wider geographical approval than that of any state ; an undercurrent of supreme solicitude , seeking sanction from sister states , and not yet ready to break out into actions of defense . In the interim between the calling of the convention in October of 1849 and June , 1850 , the conflict of ideas and the consequent ferment of thought among the people of the South perhaps reached its culmination for the period of which I write . It is very interesting to note how the proposed convention was looked upon , first , by the people of the South , and then by the North , and at the nation 's capital . From the newspaper discussion in the South between October and January , 1850 , I think we may conclude that southern leadership approved the idea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting which they thought at last would bring relief to their condition . I say the leadership , because the masses knew very little indeed of the proposed convention , or of its purposes , and of those who did only a small per cent had any inclination in the matter one way or the other . And by the last of March perhaps the feeling for the convention had very nearly , if not quite , subsided among the editors themselves ; for out of the sixty newspapers published in the ten slave-holding states at that time , not more than fifteen gave it active support . Further , the lack of regularity in the election of the delegates in the different states does not give one a very high impression of the convention . It lacked the prestige of state authority . The governors in their messages to their legislatures , in most cases , sounded a note of fear , and expressed the hope of some kind of  | pre- or extra-convention adjustment . Most of the states were represented there by men informally chosen by call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? elections unmarked by the formality of high authority , and characterized by the laxity of indifference . Outside of two or three of the southern states ? South Carolina , Mississippi and perhaps Georgia ? there was very little anxiety for it , as the time for assembling approached . In those states , however , mass meetings were held in almost every county , and most of these seem to have expressed themselves as radically in favor , not only of the convention 's meeting , but of the adoption by it of a definite programme of resistance . In Virginia and Tennessee meetings were held denunciatory in nature . Several years before some one had proposed a southern convention to consider the question of the annexation of Texas , and the proposal gained currency in the newspapers that it be held either in Richmond or Nashville ; and the newspapers alike of the two cities had disclaimed and hooted at it . An examination of some private letters and the files of the Nashville papers for the days just preceding the assembling , reveal the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor it . On June the first some citizens of the county ( Davidson ) held a mass meeting at the Court House* to consider the Clay measures just introduced in Congress , and stated in a resolution that " it is the sense of this meeting that the provisions of said resolutions offer as fair and equitable adjustment of the dangerous questions as their embarrassing nature admits of . . they are calculated to restore peace and harmony " . The meeting closed with a toast and three cheers for the Union . The toast was : " The Union forever under the guarantees of the constitution . " This meeting was of sufficient importance to be lauded in most of the state and county papers . The Nashville Convention was a child come to be nursed upon the breast of an unwilling parent . It may be said with safety that the North neither knew nor cared much about the Nashville meeting before it assembled . True , there were mass meetings , many of them expressive of approval of the compromise measures , and in many parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , were little interested . At Washington , however , there was interest , of course ;  | and the southern convention about to meet at Nashville was looked upon as a movement directly and immediately for disunion . Thousands of people doubtless thought that the southerners would actually withdraw in this convention . At the nation 's capital it was the excitant of gloomy forecasts and awful fears . Mr. Webster alluded to it in his seventh of March speech . He intimated that if any persons should assemble at Nashville " for the purpose of concerting measures for the overthrow of the Union over the bones of Andrew Jackson , that old hero would turn in his coffin . " The delegates began to arrive at Nashville on June 2 , the day before the convening of the assembly . They continued to come in for two or three days . The first meeting was held on the afternoon of June 3 , the time being taken up by the election of officers . Hon. A. V. Brown , of Mississippi , called the convention to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former convention in his state the previous October , was chosen president . Ex-Governor McDonald , of Georgia , was elected vicepresident . It is not my purpose to go in great detail into all the wrangles which took place in the convention 's sessions , but rather to make a study of the motives and intent of the delegates assembled , and an attempt to answer the question whether they were representative of the popular feeling at the time . Perhaps Judge Sharkey sounded the key-note of the convention 's purpose in his speech accepting the presidency . But whether he voiced the feeling of the majority of the delegates , seems not now to be definitely ascertainable : ? there is a strong probability that he did not . He stated that the purpose of the meeting was to obtain relief from the " violations of the Constitution which the North had made , and to perpetuate the Union , not destroy it . It had met , he said , " to devise a remedy for the evils under which the South is laboring . " But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed explanation of those " evils " . There is no record of any tumultuous cheering having greeted his remarks . And yet , to the fanaticism of many people , North and South , who took the convention to be the immediate forum for expressions of rabid radicalism , Judge Sharkey 's published speech came with a shock of surprise , if not of disappointment . The second day 's session was taken up with the presentation  | of their credentials by the delegates . It is interesting to note the personnel of a meeting like the Nashville Convention . The assembly numbered many influential , widely-known men . In addition to Judge Sharkey , there were present men like Governor Henderson of Texas , ex-Governor McDonald and M. J. Crawford of Georgia , Judge Wilkinson of Mississippi , General Pillow of Tennessee , Colonel Pickens of South Carolina , General Walker and John A. Campbell , of Alabama , the last named afterwards a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States , and the venerable Cheves of South Carolina , the compatriot and rival forty years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a quarter of a century the quiet of private life ; ? men of the highest position in their states , of broad views , and of the strictest integrity . The presence and counsel of men of this type would give dignity to any meeting . Some , no doubt , had come with a view to preventing extreme action . Individuals from nine of the southern states took their seats . After a debate as to the method of voting in the convention , in which it was decided that votes should be cast by states , the opening of the third day 's session brings to us the first discussion of any really definite plan for the carrying out of the purposes of the convention . Mr. Campbell , of Alabama , had prepared resolutions and now read them . His sentences were marked by caution and prudence . They were condemnatory of the Wilmot Proviso , but advised no method of resistance , in the confident hope that congress would not adjourn without a settlement of the questions in dispute . " The territories of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . as common property . Whatever the states call property the federal government should recognize as such . . . . On this principle alone will the difficulties under which the South labors be removed , and the questions of territories and of boundaries will lose their sectional aspect and significance . " The resolution went on to predict that the controversy would be ended and conciliation and harmony effected , either by a northern recognition of the South 's constitutional rights , or by an equal partition of the disputed territory between the North and South . Thus we see that , while positive , the resolutions of Mr. Campbell bore no semblance of finality . " The convention has no right to conclude , " he stated ,  | " that congress will adjourn without making an adjustment of the controversy . " Fortunate it would have been , if all the delegates had agreed with him . It is appropriate here to speak of the cause of the internal dissensions which marked , sometimes dangerously , the debates ? the difference in belief existing between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most interesting subjects of study of the period is that of the influence of sectionalism upon the membership of the old political parties of the time . In the caucus debate preceding the issuance of the " Address " of 1849 , the Whigs had openly and vigorously declared that they would not give their consent to the formation of a strictly southern party until they were ready to dissolve the Union . One of their members drew up resolutions modifying the tone of Calhoun 's message from that of " passionate complaint and threatening challenge to that of urgent appeal to the patriotism and fair-mindedness of the North . " * To be sure , this was rejected by the Democratic majority of the caucus , and Calhoun 's challenge was adopted with but few alterations ; but only one Whig voted for it . Hodgson , in his " Cradle of the Confederacy " , points out that the mass meetings preparatory to the convention were participated in by " States Rights Whigs " as well as Democrats , although the great bulk of the Protestants came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part were content to remain quiet and await the issue.f The term " States Rights Whigs " indicates a breach in the ranks of the " grand old party " of Henry Clay . To some extent the sectional feeling was cleaving the party in twain ; but evidently the Whigs in the Nashville Convention were filled with no great desire to accept bodily and without dispute the Democratic theories . Perhaps the most heated debate took place , on June tenth , over resolutions relative to the more stringent enforcement by the North of the Fugitive Slave Law . The wrangle lasted for several hours , until the prospect for any united action seemed dim indeed . But the more sanguine ? perhaps the more distinguished men of the group ? threw themselves heroically into the breach , urging the blotting out of all party lines in the South . " There should be no Democrats , no Whigs , when the matter of protect- ing the rights and liberties of the South is concerned " , passionately exclaimed one of the delegates . Colonel Colquit , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , cried out that all should immediately " go to moulding bullets for the common cause . " He was one of the extremists himself ; but his words seemed to have , in that instance , the effect of bringing the parties to terms of agreement . " The South should stand for equality in the Union , or independence out of it " , was the slogan by which , for the time , the Whigs were brought " within the pale " . Beyond passing for publication certain resolutions and providing for another meeting of the delegates " on the sixth Monday after Congress adjourns " , the first session of the Nashville Convention accomplished nothing . Briefly stated , the resolutions are as follows : The states have equal rights in the territories ; The Wilmot Proviso is unconstitutional ; The Fugitive Slave Law must be enforced ; The convention has met to " take counsel " as to what course the South should pursue for the maintenance of her rights , liberties , and honor . But congress has taken no action , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose for which called ; The states are earnestly exhorted to send delegates from every county to the next convention ; The dignity and importance of the situation in this country makes this convention no ordinary occasion . The constitution is to be preserved , and our liberties and institutions maintained . The convention adjourned on the twelfth . Old McKendree church , the central home of Southern Methodism , in which the sessions were held , had taken on the added significance of historic interest . The weeks which followed the adjournment of the convention were a period of suspense , of anxiety , awful and intense , to southern leadership . Nor did the feeling of unrest die out entirely when Fillmore succeeded Taylor and signed the last of the compromise measures on September twentieth . Thousands had hoped that the measures would fail of passage , that the South would thereupon secede , and set up an independent government . In the North the abolitionists denounced the proposed Fugitive Slave Law as a violation of morality . The Free Soilers objected to the application of any compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking instead of encouraging the secession movement . If the June convention had been a failure in the eyes of some , the November one was to prove still more disappointing . It suffered the additional humiliation of the refusal of men of prominence to return ; for men of the Sharkey type , who had been the leaders in the former session , were conspicuous by their absence . It was Judge Sharkey who , the next year , organized a Whig-Democrat , anti-secession party in Mississippi , and referring the matter of disunion to a popular vote , had it overwhelmingly repudiated by the people of the state . The very fact that such men withdrew their support from the adjourned session had a tendency to take away the dignity which the convention had possessed in June . The number of delegates was extremely small . They were as follows : Virginia , 1 ; Georgia , 11 ; Alabama , ? ; Florida , 4 ; Mississippi , 8 ; South Carolina , 16 ; Tennessee , 14 . Ex-Governor McDonald , of Georgia , a secessionist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair upon the assembling of the delegates , and the next day was made president . In his speech of acceptance may be heard the note of a majority of the delegates present : " The hope that our labors of June would cause the whole matter to be remedied and peace restored has been miserably shattered . Everything depends upon the Constitution remaining unchanged and unbroken . It is the great temple of our religious and political liberty . Unless it be rescued from the violent machinations of those men " ? the Northern leaders ? " it will be destroyed . I do not speak to excite sentiment . It requires wisdom , moderation and courage to meet the crisis . Shall we rest quietly , seeing the approaching dissolution , and adopt no measures of safety if it must come ? No ; we must guard ourselves in so just a cause " . No doubt that those men believed very strongly that the " approaching dissolution . . . must come . " The session adjourned on the eighteenth . The resolutions which it passed expressed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of any state to secede . They further recommended to the southern states that they refuse to go into any national convention for the purpose of nommating candidates for the presidency and vice-presidency of the United States " until the constitutional rights of the South should be secured " . Lastly , they recommended that the South go into a  | " big " convention , to meet at Montgomery , Alabama , at some time in the near future , and urged that delegates to " twice the number of representatives now in congress from the South " be sent to this meeting , empowered to " represent their states in sovereign capacity . " The fatal inability and lack of authorization of the Nashville Convention was thus revealed in the implied admission of its own failure to represent the states " in sovereign capacity " . Something bigger and more authoritative must be found to serve as the mouth-piece of southern " sovereign " states . Extreme as the adjourned session doubtless seems , yet the preamble to its resolutions stated that " we make no aggressive move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of the constitution , and claim its guarantees . Our rights ? our independence ? the peace and existence of our families , depend upon the issue . " But in it all we can but detect the subdued threat and hear the muttered determination of the men who claimed that they were brave enough to come to Nashville again and stand up and defend the southern people , if other leaders would not . Even in this adjourned session , as I have intimated , there was opposition to the spirit which is breathed in the resolutions whose substance has been stated . The Tennessee delegates , again headed by General Pillow , protested with all their might against the adoption of the resolutions and declared the whole proceeding to be " unhallowed and unworthy of Southern men . " They proposed resolutions expressive of satisfaction with the compromise measures as the best possible " present " remedy for the ills , and while demanding that " all agitations on the part of the North , upon the subject of slavery , shall instantly cease , " yet went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremity , commercial non-intercourse with the North ; but their resolution failed overwhelmingly . Highly offended , the Tennesseeans retaliated by holding on the twenty-third , five days after the adjournment of the convention , a great Union mass meeting at Nashville which was characterized by " unanimity and great enthusiasm , " and led by such distinguished men as Hon. Andrew Ewing and Hon. A. J. Donaldson . The convention , in fact , met with strenuous opposition in all parts of the South . Men like Senator Foote , Judge Sharkey ,  | page deleted  | safe to say that not one-tenth of the southern leadership was in sympathy . An editorial which appeared in the Republican Banner and Nashville Whig of the thirteenth , * the day after it met declared that the members of the session wanted nothing less than a southern confederacy , thus breaking the Union : but that Tennessee believed the sentiment of the sage of the Hermitage : " The Union : it must be preserved . " And at this time , i. e. , just after the compromise measures had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the mind of southern leadership . And the adjourned session of the Nashville Convention was but the refuge of a still frightened band ? claiming bravery , nevertheless ? who thought that they foresaw the doom of the South 's interests in the Union . It was rumored that the president of the United States would forcibly put the convention down , but that was unnecessary , ? the South itself put it down . Yes ; " a few men met in November , " again ; " but to call that a Southern convention , or to say that the South had any active participation in it ? preposterous ! " t It was a huge disappointment ? the half-hearted rallying together of a few upright but scared visionaries , far from representative of the southern sentiment . It was not the Nashville Convention of 1850 , as here and there a boasting southerner , still straggling on the high road to nationality , proclaims , but rather the compromise measures that the November session of the convention opposed , which postponed for ten years the fratricidal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
