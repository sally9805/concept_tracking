Dr. Cramp told a Mass reporter last night that he thought Mr. Stackpole might have contracted the disease by scratching himself , and then getting the wound infected . The patient first noticed a small lump on his face on Friday , which soon became a red , itching spot . The disease rapidly spread over his face and has now reached the chin .
