txt A Magnificent Chestnut Tree . In regard to your article , " Famous New York Trees and Their Fate , " I was in Fort Washington Park a little over two weeks ago while a gang of men were cutting out the dead trees . One was a chestnut ( Castanet ! , dentate ) which forked about three feet from the ground . It bad already been felled , so It was impossible to make an exact measurement , but the overseer , a most intelligent man , one of the city 's expert arborlculturists , guessed its circumference below the fork at seventeen feet . The members of the gang agreed with this computation , but I was inclined to think it underestimated . This was without the bark , the tree being stripped . So there lay , in all probability , the largest tree on Manhattan Island . The overseer remarked , " If the papers knew about this , there would have bean a few reporters around .
