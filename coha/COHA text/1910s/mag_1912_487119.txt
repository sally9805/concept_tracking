For many days after the election the vote of California was still see-sawing between Roosevelt and Wilson . The process was followed with a mild interest throughout the country ; but of excitement over the matter there was not a trace . Yet one shudders at the thought of the situation that would even now be confronting us if the election in the nation had been close , and the decision of the Presidency turned on California 's thirteen electoral votes . There are few things in the immediate past for which the country has more reason to be grateful on this coming Thanksgiving Day than for the fact that the verdict of the election was emphatic and unmistakable , and especially that nothing turned on the settling of a close count in any State . But , while the situation in California is of no practical importance in regard to this year 's Presidential contest , it is of very great interest in its bearing on the advantages and disadvantages of our method of electing the President . The most conspicuous peculiarity of the existing system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire voting weight of the State to be cast into the scales on the side of the winner of that plurality . Situations of the utmost acuteness , have arisen on this account ; the most notable being that which ended in the casting of New York 's 36 electoral votes for Cleveland against Blaine , in 1884 . Exclusive of New York , the electoral vote stood 183 for Cleveland and 182 for Blaine , and the final count of New YOrk 's popular vote gave the State to Cleveland by a plurality of only 1,149 in a total vote of 1,167,169 . That situation , moreover , is of a kind that is not only likely , but almost certain , to recur . In every election since 1884 , with the single exception of 1888 , there has been an immense electoral preponderance in favor of the winning party ; but whenever the parties are nearly evenly matched , there is a chance that the contest may turn upon the electoral votes of some one State , or some group of two or three States , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingency points to a real and serious danger can not be denied ; and at first sight it might be thought that a system under which the votes of the States were not cast solidly , and under which the result was determined by the actual preponderance of the popular vote  --  either directly or through some method of State percentages  --  would remove that danger . But the fact , as a little reflection will suffice to show , is quite the opposite . The ' danger , be it understood , is not at all that of a failure to record " the popular will " ? all methods are but expedients for roughly determining that . The danger is that of a contested election  --  contested not only on the score of downright fraud , but also on account of the decision of those innumerable cases of legitimate doubt about which absolute impartiality on the part of election officials can not be expected . Well , the danger of bitter contests of this kind , far from being diminished , would be most seriously aggravated under a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of that in only one or a very few States , should become of critical moment in any close election . It is quite true that the vote is not likely to be so close in the country as a whole as in some single critical State ; but under the other system , where the piling up of large pluralities in every State was the object of pursuit , a thousand disputes would assume importance where only a score are now of any consequence . Attention could not be effectively centred on the danger-points until too late ; and instead of one Presidential count out of many being the occasion of critical tension , it would probably become the rule , rather than the exception , for the results of our national elections to be in greater or less measure clouded by doubt and protest . There are many other considerations which confirm the conclusion that the existing system of solid votes by the States is , in spite of its faults , better than any that has been proposed in its place ; but there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South may not be entirely satisfactory ; but the country is evidently going to let that sleeping dog lie for a very long time ; and even if a change should be made in this regard , the considerations we have in mind would continue to apply with almost equal force . The point about the South is that it habitually gives its vote solidly for the Democratic party , and that nobody disputes the result . But here is a case of what is often to be found in the domain of human affairs  --  that the part is greater , more difficult to handle , than the whole . The North and West . acquiesce without reserve in the throwing of Georgia 's total vote for the Democratic Candidate , under a system in which every State disposes of its total vote as a unit ; but once let the result depend on whether Georgia divides in the ratio of 13 to 1 or of 10 to 4 , and it is impossible to imagine the rest of the country indifferent to the means by which that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what is true in this radical fashion as regards the South is true in lesser measure of other parts of the country . No one can say to what extent the nation has been saved from contentions of the most ominous character through this incidental feature of our system of State autonomy . THE PHILIPPINE OUTLOOK . Hard upon the heels of the rejoicing-in the Philippines over the success of the Democratic party , and the announcement that the bill for Philippine independence will be pressed to passage in the House , we have the inevitable prophecies of dire consequences . Unnamed army officers are quoted as pointing to Aguinaldo 's appearance in the celebrations as being of sinister significance . We are told that already American capital is alarmed at the prospect of our withdrawal from the islands . The Filipinos themselves are , as usual , lost to shame . Are they not at this moment plotting how they are going to distribute the offices ? Aguinaldo 's return to public life is interpreted to mean that " he will be in the front ranks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Filipino delegates to Congress , is also accused of " carrying on political campaigns with a view to strengthening his position with his people at home . " Knowing how reprehensible the public holds any American who aspires to office , we are sure that mere mention of this misconduct of Messrs . Aguinaldo and Quezon will suffice to damn them forever . As to the flow of American capital into the islands , it went with knowledge that we had loudly proclaimed our intention of remaining there only as trustees . There was no promise to stay forever to protect investments . It is true that the present Governor-General , Mr. Forbes , has done his best to lure " big business " into the islands , and that there are companies now forming to exploit their resources . But that can not Stand a day in the face of the Democratic pledges " to recognize the independence of the Philippine Islands as soon as a stable government can be established , such independence to be guaranteed by us until the neutralization of the islands can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political party make a more solemn or more deliberate pledge  --  now for the fourth time reiterated  --  nor one more clearly in accord with the highest traditions of this Republic . That opportunists in plenty will protest against the Democratic policy we have no doubt . Government officeholders , particularly those in the islands , will explain at length that the Filipino is not and never can be made ready for self-government  --  at least , so long as they themselves are drawing salaries . All the old arguments so familiar in 1899 and 1900 will be brought out , and we shall once more be told how splendid it is that the sun never sets on " Old Glory . " One ancient argument , however , the very language of the Democratic plank effectually disposes of . If the simple plan of neutralization is carried out , no one can revive the Japanese and German bogies . As every one in jingo circles knows , we had to make that bad bargain with Spain in 1899 , or one of those two nations would in our stead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filipinos . Fortunately , there has been a marked change in the temper of the people since that time The public knows now that annexation of the Philippines did not mean that we should get rich over night , or that , with the hoisting of the flag , Filipinos would be consumed with a desire to buy American goods . Most people of conscience are , moreover , beginning to have doubts about the manliness and desirability of holding millions of men and women under our control against their will . Still less , after our own experiences of recent years , do they wish to turn them over to the tender mercies of exploiting Trusts . Two serious arguments will , however , be used to impress those who have thought only superficially on this matter . How about the wild tribes ? And how about the possibility of these people governing themselves ? The facts about the non-Christian tribes are that they constitute but 600,000 out of 7,600,000 People ; they dwell in the mountain fastnesses , and , says Judge James H. Blount in his new book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cut little more figure , if any , in the general political equation , than the American Indian does with us to-day . " To those who have any doubts on this question we most heartily recommend this excellent volume from the pen of one who was an officer of volunteers in the war and subsequently a judge . He has not the slightest question as to the ability of the Filipinos to set up satisfactory governments . As far back as 1907 , he wrote as follows : If three strong and able men , familiar with insular conditions , and still young enough to undertake the task , were told by a President of the United States , by authority of the Congress , " Go out there and set up a respectable native government in ten years and then come away , " they could and would do it , and that government would be a success , and one of the greatest moral victories in the annals of free government would have been written by the gentlemen concerned upon the pages of their country 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind ; on the contrary , he is firmer than ever in this view . Under the promise of independence , he declares , a " very fair electorate of at least one-third , possibly one-half , of the adult male population , could be built up . " The setting up of prospective Filipino States would , he says , " electrify the Filipino body politic , " as would the mere definite promise of independence . But without that definite promise , nothing can be gained . Least of all would it be fair to deny self-government to millions because of a fraction of the uncivilized among them . We must , as Judge Blount says , make clear to all concerned , and particularly to the American grafter and Filipino demagogue , " that the government of a remote and alien people is to have no permanent place in the purposes of our national life . " PHILOSOPHICAL MR . GOMPERS . At Indianapolis the trial of forty-five labor-union officials , indicted as a result of the McNamara disclosures , is now under way . At Rochester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel Gompers presiding , is now in session . The defendants at Indianapolis are men affiliated with the Federation of Labor . The Federation is supposed to have spent nearly a million dollars in the McNamara defence . Evidently , Rochester was under the moral necessity of taking cognizance of what was going on at Indianapolis . This is the way Mr. Gompers did it , in his opening address : This organization of ours is just as you find it . We are human As humans we sometimes err . But our organization is a mighty power for human progress In all other avocations it will be found that the highest and best is held up as a type , but in the labor movement it is the derelict who is selected as our representative type Against this we protest For high motives , for altruism , for the righting of wrongs , for the winning of rights , for human progress , there is no other body in the world , man for man , that Will compare with the American Federation of Labor To catch the full force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ortie McManigal . Re-read the story of Mr McManigal 's pleasant little jaunts about the country in the pursuit of " jobs . " Re-read the story of the Los Angeles explosion as told by J. B. McNamara to McManigal . After planting the infernal machine in the Times building , " J. B. " wrenched off a gas jet in the basement : McNamara : Because when the explosion occurred , I wanted the whole building to go to hell . McManigal . And you knew there were so many people in theie. too ? McNamara : What 's the difference 9 I was to make a good clean out and I did it . But I am sorry so many were killed In view of the high motives , the-altruism , the righting of wrongs , which animated J. B. McNamara and Ortie McManigal , it is surprising that up till now the Nobel prize for idealism has not been divided between these two men . Hypocrisy is not the word to describe Mr. Gompers 's attitude at Rochester . Hypocrisy implies a prima facie capacity to deceive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , not even if the child were as innocent as a labor-union official with dynamite stored about the premises , all unknown to him . Mr. Gompers was simply indulging in disgusting effrontery . Being human , the American Federation of Labor is liable to error But the erring consisted in the pursuance of a policy of terrorism extending over years and carried out in cold blood . The Federation must not be judged by its " derelicts . " But the derelicts in the McNamara disclosures were the directing officials of labor unions , many of whom are still holding office . In whatever city Ortie McManigal turned up for a " job , " he was put into communication with the business-agent of the local union , from whom McManigal received orders and directions , And at the ironworkers ' headquarters in Indianapolis a ' close watch was kept on Malanigal 's activities . Money appropriations were made , so that McManigal might devote himself single-heartedly to his altruistic mission . There seems to have been a fixed scale of remuneration . The fact that McManigal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $125 per " job " instead of the $200 appropriated to that purpose , may be brought to Mr Gompers 's attention as another instance of human frailty . What Mr. Gompers might have said is that organized labor as a whole is not in favor of dynamite as a method of winning strikes . What he might have said is that the great majority of the rank and file in the American Federation of Labor is opposed to murder in industrial warfare . That would have been true . Violence has been a feature of labor conflicts , officially unsanctioned , but tolerated nevertheless , or even secretly encouraged . But there are degrees of violence . Violence will be practiced in the course of bitterly-fought strikes . At critical moments in such contests , passion may run even to the length of murder . But there is a vital difference between a crowd of riotous teamsters and ' longshoremen engaging in battle with strike-breakers , and a committee of union officials sending forth its emissaries of death as part of a deliberately planned campaign deliberately carried out . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and file of the American Federation of Labor ' would not approve of such tactics , because no group of two million civilized people would approve of them . Terrorism always emanates from a small minority in whose philosophy the end justifies the means . So Mr. Gompers might justly have asserted of the ordinary member of the American Federation of Labor , that he is opposed to McNamarism and 1VIciVlani --  , galism But that would have meant to condemn the present system of labor leadership . As it is , the prestige of Samuel Gompers is to-day badly shattered To public opinion outside of organized labor he stands out as the head of a " conservative " labor movement which is now foully smeared with anarchy To the members of organized labor he stands out as a leader who has allowed the odium of anarchy to he saddled upon them without the compensating prestige that comes from assuming a frankly revolutionary attitude To throw bombs for the purpose of overthrowing the " capitalist " system is a comprehensible mode of procedure . But to pursue the conciliation of labor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stigma of McNamar-ism upon it , the American Federation of Labor under Gompers is an object of fear to the conservative citizen , and an object of derision to real revolutionists like the Socialists and the Industrial - Workers of the World . THE PROFESSOR AND THE MA-CHINE . Professor Jastrow , of the University of Wisconsin , who , like Professor Cat-tell , of Columbia , has long been one of the leading spokesmen of the doctrine of professorial independence , gives in the Popular Science Monthly for November a somewhat rambling , but on the whole decidedly impressive , survey of the question . The article has a striking collocation of opinions from many sources , which serves to reveal how far the evil of excessive systematization , undue control , and unnecessary concentration of power has been felt by serious observers of our universities . The title of the article ? " The Administrative Peril in Education " ? is a catchword that ought to stick . Whatever particular harm or offence there may be in this or that error of administration , it is not errors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the soul of university life , rather than the body , that the " administrative peril " touches ; and the damage to that soul is done not by defects of administration , but by the exalting of the administrative ideal above the ideals of intellectual distinction and of personal individuality and freedom . Criticism of the administrationism that pervades our universities most often takes the shape of an attack upon the dominance of the university president In truth , this is not of the essence of the matter ; but it is natural that it should attract the most attention . On this head , there is many a telling stroke in Professor Jastrow 's paper , both from his own hand and from that of others . A combination of the two is presented in this passage : " When the wisdom of letting a man lord it over an aggregate of employees instead of conferring with a company of scholars is questioned , the answer is the efficiency with which the autocrat can get things done " ( J McK . Cattell ) . Efficiency undefined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous of terms . . . Even so directly utilitarian a thing as a signpost is efficient only when you know where you want to go and where not , the term should never be permitted to appear in educational discussions without a chaperon From many quarters , academic and other , are quoted judgments like this of the Springfield Republican : No single thing has done more harm in higher education in America during the past quarter-century than the steady aggrandizement of the presidential office and the modelling of university administration upon the methods and ideals of the factory and the department store he says nothing at all about the danger of the democratic faculty government becoming in its own way inimical to individuality , to personal freedom , to the prerogative of intellect in the university . He is deeply concerned about the dignity of the profession ; and doubtless this would be enhanced by raising the faculty to a position of headship , instead of inferiority , in the university government . But no improvement in its mere administrative status could effect that elevation of the professorate which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its source . It is not more scientific management , or " team work , " or coordinatin , or subordination , but more individual freedom , that is needed to raise the tone of the professorate , and to attract into it strong minds and high natures . Professor Jastrow himself is keenly aware of the real need , although he has not brought it out clearly in this article How we are to advance towards the ideal held in view by him , and by the many writers whom he quotes , is a difficult question to answer . One of the serious obstacles to be encountered springs from that merging of the university with the college which , while probably a necessary outcome of our educational history , has given rise to much confusion of counsel . But progress in the right direction will be furthered by discussion ; for the one thing most needful is that all who are interested in the higher education should become aware of the existence of the question , and of its seriousness . As Professor Jastrow puts it ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ominously the prospects of the higher education , is the ' undue dominance of admuutstratOn ? in policy , in measures , in personal relations , in all the distinctive interests of education and the welfare of ideas and ideals What is imperilled most directly is the academic career its worth , its service , its security , its satisfactions , its attractiveness to the higher types of men FLIRTING WITH FAME . Upon whom will the literary spotlight in England next fall ? Just now it appears to be flashing a bit aimlessly among old favorites . A new play by Shaw and revival of his old ones have put the public in a flutter , but nothing like the original flutter ; Conan Doyle is out with what his publishers call an improvement upon Sherlock Holmes ; Mr. Wells has just had his say on the most important institution in life , " Marriage " , and a new work is advertised by A. C. Benson . Yet from all this flurry there emerges the definite impression that Mr. Bennett has at length stepped out of the limelight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has never been there before . Meanwhile there have appeared , within the past month or so , three books from the same pen A glance at Who 's Who reminds us that their author began writing nearly two decades ago , that he has experimented with several literary types , and , to judge by his present rate of issue , that he probably has a trunk full of unpublished manuscripts ready to be put forth the moment the public shall give the word What more promising candidate for literary radiance has England to offer ? We are not really prophesying , we are not exploiting , we are simply pondering over one who is just now assailing the public with his ideas ? Hilaire Belloc . Mr. Bailee has to his credit , in the immediate present , a highly diverting mystery story , " The Green Overcoat " ; " The Four Men , " being mainly a symposium shared in by " Myself , " Grizzle-beard , a Poet , and a Sailor , on an imaginary walk through Sussex ; and a book of essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A look at his past marks him as a versifier , a novelist , and a writer of miscellaneous articles , with a bias for history and the out-of-doors Like Mr Benson , he is an academic , having been for the past year or so head of the English department at East London College He has already shown a many-sided activity , and on occasion has contrived to be in the forefront of public discussion , as a member of Parliament and especially in his defence of Catholicism . But the fact that he is so much better known in England than in this country makes it clear that he has never quite attained genuine popularity One can get his flavor by turning to his latest essays , which we fancy were collected from the usual newspaper column . There is the smartness which seems to be required of the London set . If Chesterton could demonstrate how admirable a creature is a bore , Mr. Belloc has closely reasoned praise for the dupe . With him , too , pure logic squints at life 's foibles . Assuming ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out the most advantageous way to he , to deceive ; or to gain useful acquaintance with , the great : Another very good trick , which still possesses great force , is to repudiate any personal acquaintance with the celebrity in question , and treat him merely as some one whom one has read of in the newspapers , but next , as though following a train of thought , to begin talking of some much less distinguished relative of his with the grossest possible familiarity . But Mr. Belloc at this game is much more human than his predecessors . What saves Mr. Chesterton 's essays from the appearance of mere jugglery is his steady plea for orthodoxy ; Mr. Bennett 's smartness is tempered by common sense . Mr. Belloc , on the other hand , partakes of a spirit of indulgence , which reveals the close contact with life and suggests not infrequently the remonstrances of Thackeray . The latter , we know , had somewhat the French manner , and it may be that Mr. Belloc 's French parentage on his father 's side speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily to farcical Lions , helping out the wit of pure logic by a buoyant humor . So in the spirit of the higher criticism he edits one of his own works , recovered supposedly from oblivion in the thirtieth century . By an elaborate comedy , with Shakespeare as hero , he pictures deliciously the present-day attentions of publisher and society to rising authors . " My daughter tells me , " writes one great lady , " how much she admired your play , Macduff , ' and very much wants to see you . " A pretty feeling for nature runs through Mr. Belloc 's work , with which fancy and philosophy pleasantly mingle . On this side he is Mr Benson without his great seriousness . With a moving simplicity he makes no religion of nature , but accepts her joyfully where she meets him : It any man owned that valley , blessed he that man , but if no man owned it , and only God , then I could better understand the benediction which it imposed upon me , a chance wanderer , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish as to attempt a prolongation of this blessedness these things are not for possession they are an earnest only of things which we may perhaps possess , but not while the business is on As will be seen , he is not a Romanticist , and indeed elsewhere comes out strongly for the classical standard of control , for the proportioned and reasoned sum of all human emotions . Nature of the country , town , or city takes its place in that general sweep of history and tradition which for him is the backbone of life . Whether Mr. Belloc ever catches the public ear with the insistence of some others is not a matter of great moment ? except , of course , to him . He is , at any rate , an interesting figure in English literary life ; and , if he may be taken as typical of it , will serve to bring out the differences between such life there and here . Of American essayists who have the cleverness to win genuine popularity , to whom may we turn for anything like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry with it that extreme commitment to modernity which loses touch with the lessons of the past . WIVES OF LITERARY MEN . Mrs. Andrew Lang has been writing about the " Trials of the Wife of a Literary Man . " It is mostly that lady 's social and public relations that are discussed . Doubtless the fireside companions of some of the irritable tribe of writers have their personal domestic tribulations , but the wife of Andrew Lang could scarcely have been one of these . Unless he was very different in his married life from what he was as the public and his friends saw him , he could not have been a man " gey ill to live with . " Mrs. Lang does , indeed , speak as one who knows from experience when she refers to the duty of the wife of a literary celebrity to be a sort of " amateur Providence " to him , reminding him of his engagements , etc. ; but this intimate side of the matter she passes over lightly . Her witty comments are expended upon other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she plainly believes to be not all beer and skittles . It carries with it , to be sure , many social opportunities , but also how many social embarrassments , how many disconcerting situations , how many awkward moments ! The wife receives an invitation , we will say , to spend a weekend at some great country-house with her husband . Instantly the feeling arises in her mind that she is asked merely as a necessary encumbrance . It is the genius who is really wanted , and his frump or bore of a wife is included only for the sake of politeness . She is as anxious as the Lady Clare to be loved for her own true worth , yet she has a horrid doubt lest she be graciously accepted only as the woman who cooks and sews for her husband , and who therefore has a claim upon his hosts . And the best role for her to attempt to play under such dubious and trying circumstances is a vexing puzzle . Shall she set up for a blue-stocking ? Or shall she sardonically make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe her to be ? Shall she smile sweetly and efface herself ? Or shall she set out to be vivacious and take the lead in conversation ? She has to consider not only other people , but her husband . His reputation is , in a way , in her keeping , and she also knows that his comfort and peace of mind may depend for the moment upon the way in which she conducts herself in general company . She may be very gayly and successfully assuming a part , when his reproachful eye will meet hers to make them both ill at ease . One of the severest trials of the wife of a literary man must arise out of the foolish talk she is forced to hear about him . Some of this she overhears , all " unbeknownst , " and can laugh to herself quietly about it . But in person she has to face the compliments , often left-handed , and the stupid remarks and silly questions which some people are forever pressing upon the wives of famous men . Do n't you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a towering intellect ? How does he ever manage to discover such wonderful thoughts ? Do you talk over the plots of his novels with him ? Did he take that lovely character of Griselda partly from you ? He surely has thousands of admirers . It must be great fun to read their letters . Do you ever let anybody come in to watch him while he is writing ? Confronted by such impertinences and banalities , what is a woman married to a literary man to do ? Probably her wisest course would be to imitate Mrs. Carlyle , who , - when one of the servants asked her if " Master " was not the greatest man in England , replied : " We fondly hope so . " Mrs. Lang goes upon the supposition , that the literary marriage she deals with is one of true minds . The wife is fitted to understand if not actually to help the husband in his chosen pursuits . But it is well known that there have been two views about the desirability of this . The matter was discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The Intellectual Life . " He presented two alternatives to the literary man in search of a helpmeet . Let him either look for a wife of high intelligence , able to sympathize with him and encourage him and cooperate with him in his work , or for one who will know nothing whatever about his writing , and will stand apart from it and let him go his own way , giving , meanwhile , slave-like attention to his comfort . This last plan has had the practical commendation of some great names . Rousseau and his unaccountable Therbse have been often mentioned in this centenary year . Not a few have been wholly unable to explain , except on the ground of the vagaries of genius , how Goethe  --  the man who wrote the letters to Frau von Stein ? could have been content to live all those years with his unintelligent Christiane . Such a union as that of the Brownings would be voted by most people to be vastly nearer the ideal . But even in instances like that the wife 's trials  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wholly absent . Possibly the literary man as husband also has his .
