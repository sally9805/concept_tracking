The living-room of JEFFREY FAIR 'S home on Long Island . The walls are panelled and painted in soft tones ; at the left is a fireplace , at the right a door into a hall , and at the back three French windows opening onto a terrace , beyond which is a vista of wooded hills . The room is charmingly and luxuriously furnished , everything denoting wealth and refinement . A large table with a lamp , writing materials , photographs , books and bowls of flowers is at the right . Behind it is a chair and in front of it a couch . Between the windows are consoles and , on either side of them , small chairs . In the corner of the room is a lacquer cabinet . There are two large wing chairs , one in front of the fireplace , the other against the left wall below the fireplace . Bowls and vases of flowers are in every available place , giving a festive aspect to the room . Above the centre window is a floral piece fashioned of laurel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre the words " Welcome Home Our Heroine " , at the base red , white and blue ribbons fastened with a cockade and projecting from its upper corners are miniature flags of the United States , Great Britain and France SYLVIA FAIR is coming from the garden through the sunshine of a May morning . In a simple gingham dress with her hair hanging in a golden cloud about her shoulders , her arms filled with lilacs , she is a radiant picture of sweet , unspoiled girlhood , not at all the usual modern miss of eighteen . She runs up the steps and into the room , where she flits about arranging the flowers , humming the air of a gay little song . Her task completed , she stands looking at the result with joyful satisfaction when the voice of ALAN FAIR is heard outside in the hall ALAN callingOh , Sylvia ! p. 3 SYLVIA Yes , Alan . ALAN FAIR , a fine example of American youth , comes in hurriedly ALAN Hello , Sis . SYLVIA Hello , Alan ! ALAN Mother not here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . The boat docked an hour ago . ALAN Did you get in touch with Dad ? SYLVIA Yes . Last night as soon as I received the wireless . ALAN Why did n't you meet mother ? SYLVIA They wo n't let you on the pier without an alibi or something . ALAN Hello ! Give me John 6780 ! SYLVIA What are you going to do ? ALAN ' Phone Peggy . I motored her in this morning . Tire went bad . She was afraid I would n't be here in time . SYLVIA I wonder why mother did n't cable that she had changed from the French Line to the Olympic ? ALAN Oh , hello ! Is this 6780 John ? I 'd like to speak to Miss Gibbs . To SYLVIASay , but you 're going to be a big surprise to mother . p. 4 SYLVIA Yes . Two years makes a lot of difference in a woman . ALAN You ! You 're only a kid .

Oh , that 's all right . I 'm going to tell Sylvia . No , I wo n't say a word to any one else . I promise . SYLVIA , astonished , goes to ALAN and suddenly reaches over , turns the transmitter towards herself and talks into it SYLVIA Oh , Peggy , I 've been hoping you were going to be my sister-in-law . ALAN greatly surprisedWhy , how did you know ? SYLVIA taking the telephone from ALANPeggy , Alan wants to know how I knew . Is n't that funny ? When did you say " yes " ? Last night ? ALAN is impatiently trying to take the telephone from SYLVIAI 'm so glad . Yes , I 'm awfully excited . I can hardly wait until mother gets here . ALAN grabbing the telephoneGoodbye , darling ! Do n't get so fresh ! What number do I want ? You 've cut me off ! ALAN irritably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes the telephone from ALAN and puts it on the table . ALAN goes sulkily to the armchairHow did you know I was in love with Peggy ? p. 5 SYLVIA coming to him Oh , you were n't running up to Connecticut every other minute since you 've been demobilised to see your " buddy " , even if he is as nice a one as Tom Gibbs . Why , the very first time I met Peggy , I knew . ALAN I did n't know it myself then . He sits SYLVIA leaning over the back of the chairAre you going to tell mother and daddy ? ALAN Not right away . SYLVIA Afraid they wo n't like your marrying beneath you ? ALAN Where do you get that stuff ? SYLVIA Peggy is a stenographer , and you are the son of Jeffrey Fair . ALAN Yes , and Peggy 's been selfsupporting and , except what Uncle Sam paid me , I 've never earned a nickel . Marrying beneath me ! I 'm marrying above me . SYLVIA sitting on the arm of the chair I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been helping for four years to save the world for Democracy . I suppose that 's made her democratic , and daddy has no use for his ancestors . Still , it 's going to be an awful shock to everyone here . ALAN I should worry about shocking the neighbors. p. 6 SYLVIA Then why keep it a secret ? ALAN Peggy thinks it might spoil the family reunion for mother if I  --  well , spring a new member on her . SYLVIA That 's very thoughtful , very sweet of Peggy . ALAN Everything about her is sweet . I 'm crazy about the whole family . They have the homiest kind of a home . You know , at night Mrs. Gibbs sewing and Mr. Gibbs reading his paper and a bowl of apples on the table . SYLVIA Of course , an apple at night would give me the pip , but it must be lovely . ALAN It would be great if you liked Tom . SYLVIA Oh , Alan , I do n't believe I could marry a policeman . ALAN He 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pal . Sylvia , you 're not going to be a rotten snob about a man who fought for you , side by side with your own brother ? SYLVIA You know I 'm not a snob . I love Peggy and I like Tom . But I ca n't marry all the men who fought for me . I do n't want to marry , anyway . All I want to do is get acquainted again with my mother . NORA , a housemaid , enters NORA Mr. Alan , a gentleman to see you . ALAN takes the card , looks at it p. 7 SYLVIA Why , Nora , we ca n't see any one to-day . NORA That 's what I told him . It 's something to do with your mother . SYLVIA going to ALANWho is he ? ALAN reading " E. Dudley Gillette of the Gillette Lecture Bureau . " NORA He says it 's very important . ALAN Show him in .

She sits in the armchair NORA shows in E. DUDLEY GILLETTE , a man of thirty-five , of good appearance and address , but not a gentleman . His manner is over-suave , his clothes too correct GILLETTE Good morning , Captain Fair . ALAN No , just plain Mr. Fair now . GILLETTE bowing to SYLVIAI hope you 'll excuse this intrusion  --  to ALAN  --  but I have something here for Major Fair that was too important to entrust to a messenger , as I want her to receive it immediately on her arrival . He takes from his pocket an envelope and hands it to ALAN p. 8 ALAN Wo n't you sit down ? GILLETTE Thank you . ALAN indicating the envelopeSomething of a confidential nature ? GILLETTE Well , no . It 's an offer to make a lecture tour of the country under my management . ALAN A what ? He opens the envelope SYLVIA Mother lecture ? Oh , how ghastly ! ALAN reading the contractThis would n't interest her . GILLETTE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would give my offer her consideration . ALAN That 's my mother 's way of being polite . GILLETTE . Possibly . Still she did go to London to see my man . ALAN You know that mother was arriving on the Olympic ? GILLETTE Yes , that 's why I am here . I wanted to be the first on the ground . There will be a keen competition for her among the lecture bureaus . ALAN Why ? GILLETTE The newspapers have been full of the work done overseas by Major Fair and her Unit ; her decoration by the French Government , all that with her social position here  --  p. 9 SYLVIA indignantlyWhy , I think it 's perfectly awful of you or any one else to think that our mother is going around the country showing off her Croix de Guerre . ALAN Mother has no desire to boast of her work . There is not the slightest use leaving this .

GILLETTE looks at her interestedly , in fact rather rudely " sizes her up . " SYLVIA is puzzled and a little embarrassed , being utterly unaccustomed to that kind of scrutiny . ALAN turns . GILLETTE quickly assumes a suave smileThank you . Good morning . ALAN . Good morning . GILLETTE goes . SYLVIA rises and runs over to ALAN p. 10 SYLVIA distressed  --  almost in tears Oh , Alan , mother would n't do it . Surely , when she 's been home only once in four years she wo n't want to go away again . ALAN soothinglyCertainly not . He puts his arms around SYLVIA ANGELICA BRICE , a pretty blonde widow in the thirties , fragile , appealing , essentially feminine and charmingly gowned , appears at the door to the terrace BRICE Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust . SYLVIA runs to ANGY SYLVIA Oh , Angy , darling . Come in . BRICE Oh , no . I simply wanted your mother to have this little welcome from her next-door neighbor . SYLVIA That 's lovely of you . Come in and tell me if you think the place looks nice . She takes the violets , places them in a bowl on the table . ANGY comes into the room . She looks at the decorations BRICE Oh , it 's charming ! How do you do , Alan ? ALAN coldlyHow do you do , Mrs. Brice . p. 11 BRICE Oh , it 's charming . She sits in the armchair SYLVIA running over to herI 'm so glad mother came home in May . She loves the Spring flowers . BRICE I suppose your father 's at the dock . SYLVIA I hope so .

I 'm so glad for you that your mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for father 's sake . He looks meaningly at ANGY , who , although thoroughly understanding the implication in his speech , is apparently oblivious . SYLVIA is wholly unaware of ANGY 'S and ALAN 'S fencing BRICE He must have missed her . Has n't it been awfully sporting of him never to have complained ? SYLVIA If it had n't been for you , we 'd have died of loneliness . I 'll never forget how good you 've been to me and daddy . ALAN Neither will I. You 've tried your darndest to take mother 's place . And even if you have n't succeeded , you 've made a corking good stab at it . p. 12 BRICE to ALAN , very sweetlySo glad you appreciate it . ALAN Why , no one in this family appreciates you as I do . SYLVIA delightedly runs to ALANI knew you 'd like Angy when you understood her . ALAN Why , Sylvia , I 've always understood Mrs. Brice .

SYLVIA Mother ! ALAN It 's mother ! They rush into the hall calling excitedly , " Mother ! Mother ! " There is a babel of excited greeting . ANGY rises and retires to a position where she can watch unobserved the advent of NANCY FAIR , who appears presently , between SYLVIA and ALAN , her arms about their shoulders . In her Overseas uniform of horizon blue , Sam Browne belt , beret and ribbon of the Croix de Guerre , she is a vividly arresting figure , the personification of those American women brought into prominence during the war because of their executive ability , gay courage and unselfish devotion . NANCY is overjoyed at the meeting with her children . She hugs and kisses SYLVIA repeatedly . ALAN is trying to attract his mother 's attention and finally taps her affectionately on the shoulder p. 13 ALAN Mother , I could do with a little of that . NANCY Alan ! Alan ! She turns to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , puts him away from her , looks at him fondly , then embraces him again and again . SYLVIA has run across to JEFFREY FAIR , who has followed them and is watching , happily , the reunion of his family . He is fifty and represents the highest type of the American man of affairs . ANGY , coming foward is seen by JEFFREY . He is slightly startled and visibly annoyed , but controlling himself he bows , smilingly , then tries to attract NANCY 'S attention JEFFREY Oh , Nancy ! NANCY does not hear him . He raises his voiceOh , Nancy  --  ! NANCY turns to him . He indicates ANGYThis is Mrs. Brice . ALAN , annoyed , moves away . NANCY turns to MRS . BRICE , smiling , and is about to go to her , when SYLVIA runs to ANGY and , taking her by the hand , brings her to NANCY SYLVIA Mother , this is Angy !

NANCY Nobody ever had a nicer daughter . ALAN They 've got to go some to tie you , Mother  --  eh , Dad ? JEFFREY I 'll say it ! NANCY Such compliments from my family ! You 're not getting me in a good humor so that you can spring something on me ? ALAN How does it seem to be home , Mother ? NANCY If Sylvia wo n't be shocked by my language , I 'll confess I 'm having a pippin of a time ! JEFFREY puts his arm around her p. 18 ALAN You are going to find it awfully flat . NANCY is smiling .

SYLVIA Alan ! The idea ! She did n't find it flat when she was here the last time . ALAN Mother was busy getting money for her Unit , and she was going back . Take it from me . I 've been through it . You 're going to miss the something  --  I do n't know what it is  --  but life over there gets you . You know that , Mother . You 'll find yourself thinking more about the people you left over there than your old friends here . NANCY rises nd moves toward SYLVIA . She is thinking . The others watch her closely . Seeing that SYLVIA is looking at her anxiously , she smiles and goes to her NANCY What are you worrying about , dear ? SYLVIA You wo n't get bored at home , will you , Mother ? JEFFREY Sylvia , do n't pay any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ALANWhat the devil is the matter with you ? He glares in indignation at ALAN , who rises and goes to the door to the terrace . SYLVIA , even with her mothers ' arms around her , is still unconvinced p. 19 SYLVIA But you wo n't get bored , will you ? NANCY No . No . No . You silly little goose ! She has taken SYLVIA 'S face in her hands , kissing her after each " No " and at the end of the speech , then , taking her over to the armchair , swings her onto the arm of the chair , where SYLVIA perches , all smiles again , her arm around NANCY , who is seated . JEFFREY is sitting on the couch , looking at them and smiling happily JEFFREY It 's good to see you over there , Nancy . We missed you  --  eh , Sylvia ? SYLVIA You missed us , did n't you , Mother ?

She rises , greeting NORA warmly p. 20 NORA It 's glad I am to see you , Mrs. Fair , safe and sound out of them trenches ! NANCY moves toward the tray and begins to examine its contents . JEFFREY and SYLVIA join ALAN . They stand watching her , much amused NANCY What 's this ? NORA Luncheon 's a couple of hours off and cook thought you might like a snack .

Have you seen the afternoon papers ? JEFFREY We have . SYLVIA Are n't they wonderful ? ALAN is silent . SYLVIA goes to JEFFREYAre n't they wonderful ? JEFFREY does not answerOh , I think that you are both as mean as you can be about mother ! I should think you 'd be proud of her ! JEFFREY We were . SYLVIA Why are n't you now ? Everybody was crazy about her last night and neither of you so much as congratulated her . ALAN I could't get near her . SYLVIA You did n't try very hard . And , Daddy , you left us flat and went home with Angy Brice . p. 49 JEFFREY Angy was feeling seedy . SYLVIA Humph ! Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALAN Just finding that out ? JEFFREY Nonsense , children ; she admires her enormously . SYLVIA You might have waited and said something nice to mother this morning . ALAN We had a foursome on and she was n't up . JEFFREY Oh , enough people will make a fuss over her . SYLVIA I do n't see why you two hate the " fuss " everyone makes over mother . She ca n't help being celebrated and having people chase after her . You see just as much of her as I do . I do n't mind , but you and Alan act so funny . TearfullyNothing 's the same as I thought it would be when mother came home . I do n't know what 's the matter . JEFFREY going to SYLVIAWhy , Sylvia , Alan and I would n't do anything to worry you for the world , would we ? ALAN Certainly not . SYLVIA tearfullyThen why are n't you both nicer to mother ? JEFFREY taking her in his armsOh , come now ; do n't cry . Do n't you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spot and I 'll lie down and let you walk on me . SYLVIA smilesThat 's better .

SYLVIA Bridget Wynne and the others . JEFFREY dropping SYLVIA 's handsNo . I saw all of them yesterday . SYLVIA Now , Daddy , you 're not going to be nasty about these photographs ? JEFFREY Not a yap out of me , He laughs . SYLVIA kisses him , then runs down the steps , calling " Oh , Mother ! " NANCY and the women who are at the right of the garden call to her . JEFFREY follows SYLVIA to the door , where he stands looking off into the garden , from which comes the sounds of laughter and conversationGosh , I 'd like to come into this place just once and not find that bunch of women here . A man would have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Whenever mother is at home this house looks like a club women of each other ? ALAN joins JEFFREY at the door ALAN And the line of flattery they hand out and mother lapping it up like a cat does cream ! p. 51 JEFFREY I know . Even a woman as levelheaded as your mother will soon believe she 's the greatest thing in the world . He goes to the armchair and sits ALAN Why do n't you take her away , out of it all ? JEFFREY She 's booked up a month ahead . Banquets , receptions , although I thought she had been given one by everybody from the Mayor down to the Conductorettes ' Union . ALAN And they have almost worn out that Croix de Guerre passing it around from hand to hand . JEFFREY Yes , and what are you going to do about it ? ALAN Why did you let her start ? JEFFREY Who told me to keep her busy ? ALAN I did  --  I did . I was n't counting on the endurance of women . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't rested a day since she arrived . ALAN It 's a wonder to me that she has n't had a nervous breakdown . JEFFREY Son , the only thing that makes a woman have a nervous breakdown nowadays is having to stay at home . A noise of laughter and high pitched gabble comes from the gardenListen to that cackle . What are they doing ? p. 52 ALAN They 're leaving . JEFFREY All of them ? ALAN No . Mrs. Wynne , the bodyguard , is sticking around . JEFFREY What 's Sylvia doing ? ALAN Standing there , adoring mother as usual . JEFFREY She is the sweetest kid . ALAN coming to JEFFREYShe is that . Does n't even see that mother is neglecting her . Why ca n't she settle down and devote herself to Sylvia ? JEFFREY She would if it were n't for those women and that damn Gillette ! He 'll have her signed , sealed and delivered . ALAN Why do n't you tie a can to him ? JEFFREY How ? By forbidding him to come here ? My boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years without realizing that , if you want her to do something , tell her she ca n't . ALAN I 'm " kinda " that way . JEFFREY Yes . It works with you , too . They laugh . JEFFREY , rising , sees ANGY , who has come from the left side of the garden , and is now at the top of the stepsHello , Angy ! BRICE May I come in ? p. 53 JEFFREY Certainly . BRICE Sure I 'm not intruding ? ALAN sarcasticallyOh , not at all . Wo n't you sit down ? BRICE Oh , I simply wanted to see Jeff a minute  --  ALAN Might as well be comfortable while you 're looking at him . With elaborate politeness , he indicates the armchair . ANGY looks at him sharply . ALAN smiles sweetly . ANGY controls her annoyance , smiles at him and sits . JEFFREY , oblivious , sits on the couch on the opposite side of the room . ALAN wanders over back of ANGY 'S chair , and takes up his position in the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BRICE Oh , yes . It was very close in the clubroom last night . Then I got quite worked up over Mrs. Fair 's lecture . It was so harrowing . ALAN very pleasantlyQuite a success , though . BRICE smiling sweetly at himYes , being a woman in uniform helped a lot , do n't you think ? I 'm sure she 'll be a great success on tour . She 's so well advertised . You ca n't pick up a magazine without seeing your mother 's picture under " In the Public Eye . " p. 54 JEFFREY annoyedShe 's not on tour yet . BRICE innocentlyShe 's going , is n't she ? ALAN It is n't decided . BRICE affecting great surpriseWhy , Mr. Gillette told me the other day that it was practically settled . He was afraid that the family might interfere . I laughed at the idea . Why should you object to Mrs. Fair going away for a few months when she had left you all alone so long ? ALAN That was kind of you to reassure him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFFREY I ? BRICE sympatheticallyI suppose it would get tiresome , being merely the husband of Major Fair . JEFFREY Yes , one can get fed up on it . BRICE I 'd be perfectly willing to take charge of Sylvia again . ALAN Mother has n't gone yet . BRICE protestingIf she wants to , I think she should . It is n't as though Mrs. Fair were a home body like me , just content to make a man comfortable and happy . You ca n't expect any one so brilliant as your mother not to get bored with her home and her family . Not that I 'm insinuating that she is. p. 55 ALAN Oh , no . JEFFREY tired of the discussionWhat did you want to see me about , Angy ? BRICE This letter , but there 's no hurry . There is a pause ; ANGY looks at ALAN and turns away , annoyed . ALAN smiles . Finally ANGY , determined to be rid of him , turns and smiles sweetlyOh , Alan , been to see your " buddy " lately ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive to have you so devoted to him . MeaninglySylvia says he has a very charming sister . ALAN more confusedYes  --  yes , he has . JEFFREY risingWhat 's this I hear ? ALAN very much embarrassedI think I 'll go change . He hurriedly leaves the room . JEFFREY watches , amused . ANGY smiles to herself , pleased at having rid herself of ALAN . JEFFREY goes to ANGY JEFFREY Well , Angy , let me see the letter . BRICE The letter was only an excuse . I saw those stupid women in the garden and I knew how it bored you to have them around , so I came over to give you an excuse to get away . p. 56 JEFFREY Good for you , Angy , but I 'll stay here . They have to go home some time , if it 's only to sleep . He goes to a chair below the fireplace , where he sits facing ANGY , who looks annoyed at the failure of her ruse ; as JEFFREY turns to her she smiles sweetly BRICE sighingI 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do . BRICE They do n't . All their nasty husbands do . JEFFREY Why are n't you as nice to the wives ? BRICE I do n't get a chance . The husbands always grab me and rush me off to a corner . The next man I marry has to build me a house that 's perfectly round . I 'm sick of corners . JEFFREY laughsAnd I 'm sick of other women 's husbands , too . JEFFREY Including me ? BRICE I have n't had enough of your society since your wife came home to get tired of you , and as I 'm not going to have any of it to-day , I may as well go home . She rises and starts toward the terrace . JEFFREY follows her JEFFREY Oh , wait , Angy , I  --  He stops , arrested by the appearance of NANCY and MRS . WYNNE entering from the terrace . NANCY is surprised at the sight of ANGY , then comes toward her . NANCY 'S manner is polite but not cordial p. 57 NANCY How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so sorry we could n't come to the club . JEFFREY coldlyThat 's all right . Sylvia explained . BRICE Oh , Mrs. Fair , I do n't know what you must have thought of me running away with Jeff last night . NANCY Did n't even know you did ! BRICE I wanted to stay and tell you how splendid you were , but I was rather upset . WYNNE smilingYes . Do n't you hate to hang around where another woman is making the hit ? NANCY That does n't often happen where Mrs. Brice is . Does it , Jeff ? BRICE Oh , really . NANCY You will have to excuse me . I have to put on my hat and powder my nose . Come along , Biddy . JEFFREY Are you going out again , Nancy ? NANCY Yes , dear , going over to the Club . BRICE Oh , then may I borrow your nice husband to help me with some stupid business things ? NANCY If you 'll be sure to return him . BRICE I always have , have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFFREY If I can manage it . BRICE Good-bye , Mrs. Wynne ; give my love to dear old Wynne . Good-bye , Mrs. Fair . Hope the photographs are a success . I wish somebody wanted to take mine . It must be lovely to be notorious . She smiles very sweetly , then goes down the steps through the garden to the left NANCY Sweet woman ! WYNNE She 's some fast worker with the harpon . Bye-bye , Jeff . She goes . NANCY . is following her , but at the door to the hall she stops , looks at JEFFREY , who is standing at the fireplace , then advances toward him NANCY Jeff , dear , why do n't you come with us ? JEFFREY What are you going to do ? NANCY Mr. Gillette wants a photograph of me with my girls on the steps of the clubhouse . JEFFREY Absurd idea ! NANCY Why , what 's absurd about it ? You and Alan were photographed in the Father and Son Tournament . JEFFREY That 's different . I 'm guyed enough by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a magazine at the club without someone asking me if I 'm looking for the Major 's picture . He comes to her angrily I ca n't come into this house without falling over a camera , or finding some interviewer smoking my best cigars . p. 59 NANCY taken abackI 'm sorry . I do n't know quite how I would explain to Mr. Gillette and the girls that you object  --  JEFFREY Do n't let me embarrass you . If you want to go on making yourself and your family ridiculous , do n't let me stop you . He starts toward the door to the terrace . NANCY is indignant , then controls herself NANCY expostulatingJeff ! JEFFREY turningYes ? NANCY I did n't think  --  JEFFREY No . You never think about anybody but yourself . NANCY stands , annoyed , hurt , speechless . GILLETTE enters hurriedly from the terrace GILLETTE Oh , Mrs. Fair  --  Sees JEFFREYI beg your pardon . JEFFREY Oh , that 's all right . He goes , meeting SYLVIA at the foot of the steps to the garden . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight pause , then NANCY turns to go GILLETTE Mrs. Fair , are you going to sign that contract to-day ? p. 60 NANCY I have n't decided . I 'll let you know before the day is out . I 'll be right down . She goes , GILLETTE looking after her , annoyed . JEFFREY leaves SYLVIA and goes through the garden in the direction taken by ANGY . SYLVIA runs up steps and comes into the room . GILLETTE turns to her GILLETTE Are n't you coming with us ? SYLVIA No . Miss Gibbs is coming to tea . GILLETTE Who 's she ? SYLVIA Alan 's buddy 's sister . GILLETTE thoughtfullyGibbs ? What 's her brother 's name ? SYLVIA Tom Gibbs . GILLETTE quicklyTom Gibbs ? What does he do ? SYLVIA Arrests people . GILLETTE startledWhat ? SYLVIA He 's a detective . Same thing as a policeman , only he does n't wear a uniform or stand on the corner . GILLETTE I know what a detective is ! Are these Gibbs friends of yours ? SYLVIA Oh , yes . GILLETTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . p. 61 SYLVIA Oh , Dudley , you must n't be a snob . It is n't being done since the war . GILLETTE What does Miss Gibbs do now ? SYLVIA She is a stenographer . Why are you so interested in her ? GILLETTE Interested in her ! With you here ! He goes over to SYLVIA , who is seated in the armchair . His manner becomes subtly , almost impudently , familiar . He flatters SYLVIA in order to extract information from her SYLVIA You 're not interested in me . GILLETTE I would n't dare tell you how much . SYLVIA Why not ? GILLETTE Your mother would n't like it . SYLVIA She 's not here . GILLETTE But she will be . Think your mother will sign that contract ? SYLVIA I do n't know . Girlishly but not flirtatiouslyWhy do n't you tell me why you 're interested in me ? GILLETTE leaning over the arm of chairDo n't tempt me , you little siren . SYLVIA I 'm not . GILLETTE You 're a regular little baby vamp. p. 62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GILLETTE You like it , do n't you ? SYLVIA Uh huh . GigglingIt 's funny , but you should n't  --  GILLETTE leaning over so that his face is very close to SYLVIA'SYou should n't be so fascinating . SYLVIA is a little embarrassed , but is enjoying it . GILLETTE , feeling that he has impressed her sufficiently , turns away and in business-like tone and manner begins to question herHas your mother said anything about signing the contract ? SYLVIA disappointedI do n't know . She rises slowly and goes to the mantel , her back toward GILLETTE , who is not looking at her GILLETTE Do you think your father will object ? SYLVIA impatientlyI do n't know . GILLETTE Do you think that Alan will put his oar in to prevent your mother  --  SYLVIA angrilyOh , I do n't know ! She stamps her foot and starts to go .

GILLETTE You were going to . SYLVIA I wo n't tell you . Very much embarrassed , she runs away to the other side of the room . GILLETTE looks at her as though what she had said had given him an idea GILLETTE slowlyIt had never occurred to me . SYLVIA turns quickly I mean , that you would . SYLVIA Well , I would n't , Mr. Dudley Gillette , so there ! She goes toward the door to the hall . GILLETTE is much amused . NORA shows in PEGGY GIBBS SYLVIA Oh , Peggy , dear ! Nora , tell Mr. Alan that Miss Gibbs is here . NORA exits . GILLETTE has turned and starts slightly at the sight of PEGGY , who is a girl of twenty-five , sincere , clear-thinking , practical , yet not lacking in feminine charm and humor . She wears a severely plain yet modish frock p. 64 Peggy , may I present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've met before . GILLETTE on his guardReally ? SYLVIA Where ? GIBBS At the War Relief Bazaar in 1914 . I was a volunteer there . SYLVIA The one there was all the scandal about ? GILLETTE casuallyI do remember something about it . But I was n't in New York then . GIBBS Then I 'm mistaken . GILLETTE impressivelyYes . I 'm sure if I ever had the pleasure of meeting you it would have been utterly impossible for me to forget you . PEGGY , annoyed at the flattery , turns away . SYLVIA is pleased and smiles at GILLETTE . NANCY enters , wearing a hat , carrying gloves and a parasol . She is followed by MRS . WYNNE NANCY I 'm ready , Mr. Gillette . SYLVIA Oh , Mother  --  NANCY . turns . SYLVIA and PEGGY advance to her p. 65 NANCY shaking handsOh , is this Miss Gibbs ? Sylvia told me you were coming to tea . I 'm so glad to meet you . I 've heard of you from Sylvia and of course Alan 's told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great pleasure for me . I 've heard so much of you and I 've been so thrilled by all the great things you 've done . NANCY Oh , Sylvia , is n't that sweet ! Oh , Biddy , is n't that charming ! To PEGGYThis is Mrs. Wynne , one of my Unit . I wonder if you are going to be very generous and forgive me if I run away for a few minutes ? Someting unexpected and important . I 'll hurry back as fast as I can , for I want to have a real visit with you . GIBBS Of course . Do n't let me interfere . NANCY That 's very understanding of you . I wo n't be ten minutes . Sylvia will take excellent care of you . She goes , followed by MRS . WYNNE and GILLETTE . They disappear through the garden , PEGGY watching them from the door as they go SYLVIA Well ? GIBBS Oh , Sylvia , she 's charming . SYLVIA Have I said too much about her ? GIBBS Not half enough . ALAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to the hall p. 66 ALAN Peggy ! PEGGY turns . ALAN goes to her quickly and puts his arms around her . Do n't look , Sylvia . GIBBS expostulatingOh , Alan ! ALAN kisses her ALAN Now , where 's mother ? SYLVIA She 's gone to be photographed at the Club . ALAN What ! That 's the limit ! Did n't she know Peggy was coming ? GIBBS I 've just met her and she 's made her excuses and is coming right back . ALAN Oh ! GIBBS You 'd better " Oh . " Sylvia , has he always spoken before he thinks ? SYLVIA Always . ALAN Where 's Dad ? SYLVIA I 'll get him . He is at Mrs. Brice 's . She goes GIBBS Oh , Alan , I 'm going to love your mother . I hope she likes me . ALAN You should worry . GIBBS That 's just what I 'm doing  --  worrying . ALAN Well , if anybody in my family does n't like you , you know what they can do , do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ALAN Well , anyway , I 'm going to announce our engagement to-day . GIBBS Why , if Sylvia had told me that I would n't have come . She said that you simply wanted to introduce me to your father and mother . ALAN I did n't tell her in what capacity . GIBBS Please , Alan , let your mother get to know me first . If you thrust me at her it may prejudice her . ALAN Nonsense . What 's more , I 'm going to tell them that we are to be married right away . GIBBS We are not . I 'm not going to be rushed into marriage . ALAN Rushed ? Why , I 've known you eight weeks . GIBBS Yes , you had me engaged to you before I knew what was happening to me . ALAN Only way to handle you . If you get too much time to think  --  GIBBS I 'm going to have a good long think before I get married . ALAN It 's cold , then Good-bye , darling . He moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can we be married ? p. 68 ALAN Why , you have a license and a ring and a minister  --  GIBBS Yes , and money that you 've earned , not that you get from your father . ALAN Do n't need his money . I 've got a job . GIBBS What ? What sort of a job ? ALAN That 's my secret . GIBBS Oh , is it so bad that you 're ashamed of it ? ALAN Bad enough to pay me thirty dollars a week ! GIBBS I knew that you had hypnotic charm for women . What did you do to the man ? Frighten him ? ALAN No . He used to be my top sergeant . GIBBS Oh , that explains it . ALAN I thought you 'd be pleased . GIBBS Did he get himself a little job ? Oh , darling , I 'm only funning . I 'm very proud of you . ALAN Then you 'll marry me ? GIBBS Ca n't we wait until  --  ALAN Look here . I postponed our marriage to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then I had to wait until I got a job . Well , I have one . Now it 's up to you . If you do n't want to marry me , say so . p. 69 GIBBS I do , Alan . You know I do . But I want your father and mother to approve . There is a chance they might n't like me . ALAN You 're not marrying them . Who are you marrying , darling ? GIBBS mischievouslyNone of your business . ALAN Just for that , you sassy little devil  --  He tries to take PEGGY in his arms . She dodges and runs away . ALAN catches her and swings her around into his arms . They are laughing and struggling , their backs to the door to the terrace at which JEFFREY appears . He stands amazed at what seems to be ALAN 'S efforts to kiss a girl against her will . He frowns in annoyance and starts toward them JEFFREY sharplyAlan ! ALAN over his shoulderIt 's all right , Dad . We 're engaged . PEGGY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S voice , is kissed by ALAN , then released . She is much embarrassed . ALAN crosses to JEFFREY , leading PEGGY by the handDad , this is Peggy . JEFFREY Peggy ? ALAN Peggy Gibbs . p. 70 JEFFREY coldlyHow do you do , Miss Gibbs ? GIBBS Mr. Fair . ALAN Well , Dad , I suppose you 're surprised JEFFREY sarcasticallyHas the engagement just occurred ? ALAN Oh , no ; it 's a month old . JEFFREY Really , Alan , I  --  ALAN Dad , do n't be hurt because we did n't tell you . GIBBS Alan did n't want to spoil his mother 's home-coming by the announcement . ALAN It was n't my idea at all : it was Peggy 's . JEFFREY Why should this engagement distress your mother ? ALAN You see , Dad , Peggy is my " buddy 's " sister . JEFFREY Yes ? GIBBS Oh , Alan let us be frank . To JEFFREYIt annoys him when I say it , but I 'm not of your class . I 'm a stenographer . ALAN proudlyShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GIBBS Twenty dollars a week . p. 71 JEFFREY Thank you ; I deserved that . ALAN Well , Dad , are you for me or " agin " me ? JEFFREY That depends . ALAN On what ? GIBBS hastilyOn me . You ca n't expect your father to give a snap judgment on a person he has just met . Suppose you leave us together so that we can have a little talk . She moves away JEFFREY A very good idea . ALAN goes to PEGGY ALAN whisperingDo n't be nervous , dear . Dad 's aces . He kisses PEGGY , then goes to JEFFREYNow , Dad , no heavy father stuff . He leaves them JEFFREY Wo n't you be seated ? GIBBS Thank you . She sits on the couch . JEFFREY brings a chair and sits facing her JEFFREY Well , Miss Gibbs ? GIBBS To begin with , Mr. Fair , my family and I are , socially speaking , a total loss . JEFFREY In what way ? p. 72 GIBBS My father is the village postman . My brother is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JEFFREY I see . GIBBS drylyYes , I thought you would . My mother does her own work , but the weekly washing is sent out . JEFFREY Very interesting , especially that bit about the laundry . GIBBS I graduated from High School , then went to Brown 's Business College . I am now employed at forty dollars a week as a private secretary in the office of a firm of lawyers , O'Brien and Rosenweber . JEFFREY I know of them . GIBBS I am twenty-three years old , quite healthy , am supposed to have a good disposition . Oh , there is one thing more : I 'm a suffragette , and while I am not militant , I do parade . I believe that is all . JEFFREY And you have Thursdays off ? My dear Miss Gibbs , I 'm not interviewing you as a prospective servant , but as a possible daughter-in-law . GIBBS Well , you wanted to know about me , did n't you ? JEFFREY You suggested the interview . I appreciate that it 's a very difficult one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , if I did n't learn something of the girl my son wishes to marry , I would be failing in my duty as a father , would n't I ? p. 73 GIBBS Yes . JEFFREY Why are you so on the defensive ? GIBBS Possibly because I 'm a little afraid . JEFFREY Surely not of me ? Unless you 're marrying Alan for  --  GIBBS For money and this sort of thing ? No ! Not that I would n't like it and enjoy it , but only if Alan earned it . And he will in time . He 's made a start . He has a job . JEFFREY Why did n't he come to me for a position ? GIBBS Oh , Mr. Fair , please do n't help him . That would spoil all my plans . JEFFREY surprisedHow ? GIBBS It 's better for him to be entirely on his own . JEFFREY puzzledWhy ? GIBBS The dear boy is full of the brotherhood of man . He got that from the trenches , and if he is going to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time at least . JEFFREY Sounds to me like a very serious courtship . GIBBS Is anything more serious than marriage ? I 'm scared to death of it . JEFFREY amusedWhy ? p. 74 GIBBS I have to give up a great deal of my liberty and I want to be sure it 's worth it . Oh , dear , life and what to do with it and Alan 's problem and mine seems so much simpler on our back veranda . I suppose my family are right . JEFFREY surprisedDoes n't your family approve of the marriage ? GIBBS Not at all . JEFFREY indignantlyWell , I  --  Do n't they like my son ? He rises GIBBS smilingI like you for that . JEFFREY sputteringWell , I  --  GIBBS Oh , they are devoted to Alan , but they ca n't see any happiness in the marriage for me . They 're afraid that the two families wo n't harmonize . JEFFREY That 's true ; they might n't . There is a slight pauseIt seems to me you love my son . GIBBS Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you . I 'd marry you and say damn the families . GIBBS Oh , Mr. Fair ! She rises impulsively , starts as though to embrace him , catches herself and recedes a little , JEFFREY follows her , inviting her to embrace him . They laugh p. 75 JEFFREY Now we will put Alan out of his misery . CallsAlan ! Come here , young man . ALAN , who has been in the hall awaiting the verdict , comes in quickly . He looks anxiously at JEFFREY ALAN Well ? JEFFREY Son , I hope you appreciate how lucky you are . ALAN joyfullyDad ! He goes quickly to PEGGYExcuse us . He kisses her JEFFREY I could do with one myself . PEGGY crosses to JEFFREY and offers her lips to him shyly . He kisses her tenderlyNow , young man , what is this job ? ALAN It 's with the Iverson Construction Company . Time-keeper . JEFFREY Well , you held the interscholastic record of America for wasting time . It 's up to you to keep a little . ALAN Dad , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truckling to her father-in-law . SYLVIA running inIs it all right ? JEFFREY If you mean Peggy , she 's very much all right . p. 76 SYLVIA delightedlyOh , wait until you know her . Now I wish mother would come . JEFFREY So she went to the club after all . SYLVIA Yes . She wo n't be long . She goes up to the door to the terrace and looks off toward the entrance to the garden JEFFREY annoyedDid she know that Peggy was coming here this afternoon ? GIBBS hastilyOh , yes , I met Mrs. Fair and she explained . JEFFREY Left you here . That 's most annoying . SYLVIA Here is mother now . NANCY hurries in NANCY You see , Miss Gibbs , I have n't been long . Oh , you have n't had tea . Sylvia , dear , take mother 's things and tell them to bring tea right in . SYLVIA , taking NANCY 'S hat and gloves , runs out . NANCY goes to the telephone on the table I must ' phone to the Colony Club right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important . JEFFREY severelyMore important than to pay some attention to the girl your son is going to marry ? NANCY looks at JEFFREY , dazed , then slowly turns her regard upon PEGGY , then on ALAN p. 77 NANCY Alan , how long have you been engaged ? ALAN Since the day before you came home . NANCY A month ago . Why did n't you tell me ? GIBBS I 'm to blame , Mrs. Fair . I did n't want Alan to tell you because I feared it might distress you and spoil your home-coming . NANCY Why should it do either ? ALAN Peggy 's afraid that because she 's a stenographer  --  you  --  NANCY What right had Miss Gibbs to judge how I would receive the news of my son 's engagement ? GIBBS I can see now that what I did might be misjudged , but really my motives  --  ALAN It is n't necessary to explain your motives . JEFFREY I can vouch for Peggy . ALAN Thank you , Dad , but no one needs to vouch for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sylvia loves her , and that you approve , should be enough for mother . NANCY flinches , but is so shocked by the news that she says nothing , simply looks at ALAN . Her eyes fill with tears , her lips quiver , and to conceal her emotion she turns away and goes to the door to the terrace p. 78 GIBBS Mrs. Fair , I know what you are thinking  --  feeling . NANCY is silent . PEGGY , distressed , turns to JEFFREYIt is much better that I should go . JEFFREY Perhaps it would be as well . Alan , take Peggy to the station . ALAN and PEGGY go . NANCY turns , stretches out her hand as if to stop them . Then , covering her face with her hands , she stands crying silently . JEFFREY , ashamed of his outburst , manlike takes refuge in irritation . He goes to the table , picks up a paper and sits , making a pretence of reading . He waits , expecting NANCY to speak , then breaks the silenceYou 've made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you had n't been so keen on publicity , all this need n't have happened . NANCY coming toward himDo you suppose if I had been told why Miss Gibbs was coming here that I would have allowed a stupid photograph to interfere ? Is n't Alan 's engagement something that could have been told me without shocking me , bewildering me so that  --  Oh , you 've made me seem ungracious to my boy . It was wicked , cruel of you . She turns away and sits on the couch , crying p. 79 JEFFREY How did I know you were going to take it like this ? NANCY What did you expect me to do ? JEFFREY Open your arms to her as any mother should . NANCY How long have you known of this engagement ? JEFFREY Not until to-day . NANCY And did you welcome her with outstretched arms at once ? JEFFREY Frankly , I was surprised ! But after I had had a talk with her  --  NANCY Exactly . You had an opportunity to judge of her before you gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the son I 've loved , watched over , prayed for , to a girl of whom I know nothing . JEFFREY I told you I vouched for her . NANCY , in a rage , springs to her feet NANCY What 's that to me ? He 's my son , too . JEFFREY That 's jealousy talking . NANCY Is it strange that I should be jealous ? Is n't it hard for any mother at first to give her son to another woman ? If Alan had had any right feeling for me he would have told me tenderly , tactfully , that he loved someone else more than me . Instead , he let you thrust the fact at me . I do n't know what I have ever done that he should have told you , even Sylvia , before me ; made me feel like an outsider . p. 80 JEFFREY Who is to blame for that ? You put yourself outside your home . You ca n't hope to receive Alan 's confidence if you are never here to get it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I give up everybody and everything belonging to me and endure privations , horrors , because I think it 's my greatest duty , and then I am neglecting my family ! BitterlyMy family seems to have gotten along very well without me . Ever since I came home you and Alan have resented everything I 've done . JEFFREY We do n't approve of what you 've been doing . He rises and begins to pace up and down NANCY scornfullyApprove ! Must I secure the approval of my husband and my son for what I think best to do ? JEFFREY Your desire to appear in public , for instance ? NANCY very calmlyIf you had been overseas and had been urged to appear in public , would you have had to ask my approval ? No . It would have been the perfectly natural thing for you to do . JEFFREY It 's not the same thing . NANCY Because I 'm a woman . Well , this war has settled one thing definitely . A woman 's work counts for just as much as a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings her . Her calmness maddens JEFFREY . He advances on her furiously p. 81 JEFFREY You 've done your duty by your country , but , by God , you 're capitalizing it . NANCY turning upon himJeffrey ! JEFFREY Ever since , you 've been home you 've thought of everything but your duty to your family . All you think of is your appearance at public functions , getting your name and photograph in print . Can you deny that you are eager to sign that contract so that you can make a triumphant tour of the country , telling the Great American public how you helped win the war ? Well , you 'll put an end to all this publicity . You 'll stop all these ridiculous lectures . You 'll tear up that contract . You 'll give up this tour and remain where you belong . NANCY very quietlyAnd why must I do all this ? Why must I remain here where I belong ? JEFFREY emphaticallyBecause I am your husband and I forbid you to go . They look at each other for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is master of the situation , walks slowly away and stands at the fireplace , his back toward NANCY , who smiles satirically , then goes quietly to the table . She sits , draws the contract , which is on the table , to her , and signs it . At the sound of the scratching of her pen JEFFREY turns quickly . He crumples the folded newspaper in his hand and throws it irritably on the chair . NANCY rises . They are standing facing each other in defiance as the@@ The sitting-room of JEFFREY FAIR 'S apartment in a New York hotel . The decorations , furnishings and appointments are tasteful , luxurious and characteristic of a modern " smart " hotel . On the left are double doors to the private hall and a door to a bedroom at the back is a large window and at the right a fireplace and a door to another bedroom . A console table with a mirror over it stands against the right wall below the fireplace , in front of which is a Lawson sofa . On the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window a small table with a telephone , and in the center an oval table to the left of which is an armchair . There is a small chair in front of the desk , another at the window and a third at the back of the center table There are no photographs , books nor flowers ; in fact , there is a noticeable lack of any attempt to create a homelike atmosphere , and , although the room is brilliantly lighted , the curtains drawn and a fire in the grate , the effect is one of dreariness in contrast to the charm of the environment in the preceding acts . It is an evening in October As the curtain rises JEFFREY enters from the door at the right of the room . He wears informal evening dress and carries an overcoat and a hat which he places on the sofa . Then going to the doors to the hall , he opens them , showing across the hall a door , on which he knocks . There is a slight pause and he knocks again , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He opens the door , looks into the room , then closing the door returns and goes to the telephone JEFFREY Give me the desk , please . A pauseIs this the desk ? This is Mr. Fair speaking . Are you quite sure my daughter did not leave a note for Mrs. Fair ? If you find one , send it up . By the way , what is the correct time ? Nine twenty-three . Thank you . JEFFREY sets his watch , then takes a cigarette , lights it and sits on the couch . His attitude is one of deep dejection . There is a slight pause , then ALAN enters from the room at the right p. 83 JEFFREY turning to himWell , son ? ALAN happilyIt 's all right . JEFFREY Made it up with your mother ? ALAN nodsThat 's fine . Did she mention Mrs. Fair , Jr. ? ALAN Yes . She inquired very cordially for Peggy . He sits JEFFREY Did she accept Peggy 's invitation for dinner ? ALAN She could n't . Her secretary reminded her that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . JEFFREY satiricallyI suppose that 's why she came home . ALAN Why was n't Sylvia here to meet mother ? JEFFREY She was n't expected until the day after to-morrow and Sylvia had made a dinner engagement that she did n't care to break . ALAN That 's queer . I wonder if they 've had a quarrel ? JEFFREY What gave you that idea ? ALAN Well , Peggy and I have never been able to get anything out of Sylvia as to why she remained only a month on tour with mother . p. 84 JEFFREY I can understand just what happened . Her mother was entertained a great deal . That was part of the game of being the famous Mrs. Fair . It was n't possible to include Sylvia in all of the functions . Naturally she was bored . So she came home . ALAN Considering they have n't seen each other for two months and that this is mother 's first night at home , it is very selfish of Sylvia not to give up one party . JEFFREY irritablySylvia 's had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to drop everything whenever she chooses to appear on the scene . ALAN All right , Dad , all right . You are so touchy about Sylvia . JEFFREY You 've shown a disposition of late to criticize your sister , and I do n't like it . ALAN Do n't let us scrap about Sylvia . I 'm sorry if I have seemed unkind . But you know , Dad , you are spoiling her . JEFFREY Oh , Hell , why not ? A man 's got to have some woman to spoil . Sylvia 's sweet and loving to me . I was mighty glad to have her home again . It would have been a damn sight better for me if I had never let her go away . ALAN Now that mother is home , I suppose you 'll give up these rooms and go back to the country ? p. 85 JEFFREY She 's going on another tour . He rises and begins to walk about the room restlessly ALAN I am disappointed . Damn Gillette . JEFFREY It is n't his fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's not a bad sort when you get to know him . ALAN You do n't like him ? JEFFREY No . But I no longer hold him responsible for your mother going lecturing . If it had n't been he it would have been some other manager . ALAN Gillette 's around here a good deal , is n't he ? JEFFREY Yes . BitterlyI would n't deprive Sylvia from seeing a man who knows a damn sight better what her mother 's doing than I do . He sits behind ALAN Sylvia is around with Gillette and his crowd a lot , is n't she ? JEFFREY Yes , he 's been very kind to her . He 's introduced her to his friends . ALAN You 've met them ? JEFFREY Casually . p. 86 ALAN Dancing a good deal , is n't she ? JEFFREY Everybody does . Keeps good hours , always tells me where she 's going . ALAN Where is she to-night ? JEFFREY I ought to know . I do n't remember . DefiantlyWhy ? ALAN apologeticallyOh , nothing . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I go home . JEFFREY smilingShe 'll come toddling in soon , bless her . I hope she 's had a good time . ALAN By the way , what 's become of Angy Brice ? Sylvia never mentions her . JEFFREY slightly confusedShe has n't seen Mrs. Brice . Do n't you remember I had this place ready for Sylvia when she came home ? I thought she 'd find the country dull without her mother . Slightly embarrassed , he picks up a magazine , turns over its leaves . ALAN watches him narrowly as JEFFREY replies to his questions ALAN casuallyHas n't Mrs. Brice been in town ? JEFFREY Yes . ALAN Have you seen her ? p. 87 JEFFREY carelesslyOccasionally . ALAN Odd Sylvia has n't looked her up . They used to be such great pals . JEFFREY Angy 's too old for Sylvia , and Sylvia 's made new friends . ALAN disarmedWhen mother goes , Peggy and I must see Sylvia oftener . I 'm afraid we 've been rather selfish . JEFFREY Every newly married couple has that right . My boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't discourage her . ALAN Peggy works all day . I study all evening , so we do n't have time to get bored with each other . JEFFREY I wish Peggy would give up her job . What the devil 's the good of all my money ? I ca n't spend it all on Sylvia . ALAN Well , Dad , if a wife wants to work these days , you have to let her . JEFFREY Yes , but sometimes I wonder in this modern scheme of things where in hell the husband belongs . ALAN Why do n't you put up an argument about this new tour ? JEFFREY I put up a good one once , but she went , did n't she ? No , son . ALAN eagerlyPerhaps if I talked to her  --  p. 88 JEFFREY risingDo n't you complicate things with her by trying to force anything for me . Let me give you a bit of advice . Never try to play God for your family . You only raise the devil . ALAN Very well , Dad , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything any more . Do n't you worry about me . So long as I have Sylvia I can stagger along . He crosses and gets his hat and coat ALAN surprisedAre you going out ? JEFFREY Yes . ALAN risingBut mother ? JEFFREY I would n't dream of intruding . She took great pains to tell me at dinner that she had a stack of mail waiting for her a mile high . Can I drop you at the subway ? ALAN I 'm not going home . Peggy 's at the office to-night , working on an important case . I 'm going to call for her . Anyway , I think I 'll leave a little line for Sylvia . JEFFREY pleasedFine ! Good night . ALAN Good night . JEFFREY Give my love to Peggy . He turns to leave the room , stops , hesitates , turns to ALANTell her if she wants me to-morrow night , I 'd be very glad to come . p. 89 ALAN going to him quicklyWhy , Dad , we always want you . JEFFREY taking ALAN 'S outstretched hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . He goes ALAN watches him . His lips quiver ; there are tears in his eyes . He brushes them away and is starting towards the desk , when from the door at the left of the room NANCY enters . She wears a simple evening gown NANCY Oh , Alan , I 'm so glad you have n't gone . I have been thinking it over and I 'm not going to that boring banquet . I 'm going to dine with you instead . ALAN That 's bully of you , Mother . But it is n't necessary . You can come another night . NANCY No , no . I insist . I want to telephone your wife now . ALAN Peggy 's not at home . She 's at the office to-night . I 'm going down to fetch her . NANCY I 've a nice idea . I wonder if she would be too tired to drop in on the way home ? ALAN surprisedTo-night ?

I wo n't . NANCY It 's almost made an old woman of me . ALAN It 's been tough on me . I was wrong . NANCY No , no , I was to blame . ALAN I wo n't stand for that . NANCY Oh , my dear , it does n't matter who was wrong , so that it 's all right now . ALAN You bet it is , but  --  but  --  NANCY We wo n't spoil this by any post-mortems . She kisses himDid you see your father ? ALAN Yes . NANCY Where is he ? ALAN He went out . NANCY disappointedlyOh ! p. 91 ALAN He thought you were too busy to be disturbed . NANCY I sent my secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go for Peggy . She 'll be on her ear . NANCY Do n't you think you had better rescue her ? Now hurry right back . Oh , Alan , I have something for her and I want you to see if you think she will like it . TenderlyI 'm going to see you and Peggy very often before I go away again . ALAN When do you go ? NANCY I do n't know just what arrangements Mr. Gillette has made . He is coming to see me about them tonight . ALAN Mother , do you think you ought to go ? I mean  --  ought to come to us instead of to that banquet ? NANCY That 's all settled . I put them on the trail of another celebrity . She laughs and goes into her room . ALAN is smiling happily , humming a little tune , when the doors to the hall open and SYLVIA enters . She is completely transformed . In dress , coiffure and manner , she is the modern " cutie . " Her face is rouged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle is an ermine toque and wrapped about her throat is an ermine stole . She saunters over to the mirror at the right , greeting ALAN as she passes him p. 92 SYLVIA indifferentlyHello , Alan . ALAN Hello , Sylvia . SYLVIA Mother here yet ? ALAN Yes . SYLVIA " primping " What about friend wife ? ALAN It 's all right . IndignantlyWhy were n't you here to meet mother ? SYLVIA carelesslyI had a very special date . ALAN disgustedlyWith that Gillette , I suppose . SYLVIA That 's my affair . ALAN How you or any one else can  --  SYLVIA crosslyAlan Fair . do n't you dare to knock Gillie . You do n't like him  --  I do . Enter NANCY , smiling happily . She sees SYLVIA and is so shocked by the change in her appearance that she stops , speechless .

I 'll just ask him " what 's the idea . " She turns toward the telephone , and sees a hat box on the tableOh , the darn thing came at last . She opens the box and takes out a " freakish " hatI was going to wear this to-night . She holds it up admiringlyIs n't that a sweetie ? ALAN disgustedlyWhere did you get it ? SYLVIA going to the mirrorAt Francine 's . She makes for all the smart chorus girls . She puts it on , then strikes a poseHow do I look ? ALAN Just like a movie " cutie . " NANCY reprovinglyAlan ! SYLVIA Oh , Mother , do n't mind Alan . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , snatching the hat off her head , throws it into the box and tosses it into a corner of the room . As she turns away , NANCY , who has been watching her in amazement , goes to ALAN p. 94 NANCY Oh , what have you all done to her ? ALAN It is n't our fault . NANCY No , it 's mine . A slight pauseAlan , say good night to your sister . SYLVIA Where 's daddy ? ALAN He 's gone out . Mad ? SYLVIA kissing himNot so you 'd notice it . ALAN See you later , Mother . He goes NANCY Well , darling , glad to have your mother home again ? SYLVIA Believe me , I am . She is wearing her hair in exaggerated curves over her ears . NANCY puts her hands on either side of SYLVIA 'S face and pushes the hair gently off her cheeks NANCY Why do you wear your hair like that ? SYLVIA Everyone in my crowd does . NANCY Come and sit , down . I want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . NANCY Not so often lately . SYLVIA resentfullyWith somethin ' doin ' every minute I did n't have the time . p. 95 NANCY quickly I 'm not reproaching you , darling . Let 's have a nice snuggly time . She sits in the armchair , taking SYLVIA on her lap . Then drawing SYLVIA 'S head down on her shoulder , puts her arms about her , kisses her . SYLVIA begins to cry SYLVIA My , I 've missed this . NANCY very much affectedSo have I , dear . She takes her handkerchief and wipes SYLVIA 'S eyes and at the same time seizes the opportunity to remove a little of the rouge from SYLVIA 'S face and lips NANCY Now let 's begin at the beginning . SYLVIA Let 's skip the beginning . It was horrid . NANCY surprisedIn what way , dear ? SYLVIA I was so lonesome . NANCY As soon as I knew you were to be at this hotel , instead of at home , I wired to Bridget Wynne . Did n't she look you up ? SYLVIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me a luncheon and a box party and asked all the girls in our set . It was a perfect lemon . NANCY How ? p. 96 SYLVIA For all the attention they gave to me I might as well not have been there . NANCY Why should they be rude to you ? SYLVIA They did n't mean to be . I did n't know all the little intimate things they talked about . One girl 's mother was doing this for her , and another one 's mother was doing that  --  anyway , I felt like an outsider in what should have been my own crowd . When I got home I just bawled my head off , and daddy said we would n't bother with any of them again , but it was pretty awful , especially as I did n't have Angy to fall back on . NANCY No ? SYLVIA Daddy said you did n't like me to be intimate with her . NANCY I see . Have n't you seen Alan and Peggy ? SYLVIA It 's terribly dull at their flat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they do n't know you 're around . They laugh NANCY Did n't father go about with you ? SYLVIA Oh , yes , daddy 's a darling , but he is old . Gillie 's been my life saver . NANCY mystifiedWho is Gillie ? SYLVIA Mr. Gillette . He took me to a tea one day at a dancing place and introduced me to his friends . When he found I liked them , he said , " Sylvia , this little old town is yours . We 'll take it all apart and see what makes it tick . " p. 97 NANCY That does n't sound like Mr. Gillette . SYLVIA Oh , he puts on his grand manners with you . You do n't know the real Gillie . NANCY thoughtfullyNo , I do n't believe I do . A slight pauseWho are these friends ? SYLVIA I do n't know . Just New Yorkers . NANCY Has your father met them ? SYLVIA Oh , yes . NANCY Has he gone around with you ? SYLVIA Not to the lively parties . NANCY shockedMy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gillie 's . NANCY Is she a married woman ? SYLVIA gigglingIs she ? Three times . NANCY How awful ! SYLVIA protestinglyShe 's terribly nice . You must know her . So sweet to me . Takes me motoring in the park almost every afternoon . NANCY Where did you meet her , dear ? p. 98 SYLVIA At a party at " The Drowsy Saint . " NANCY Where 's that ? SYLVIA It 's a new freak place in the Village . NANCY Who took you there ? SYLVIA Gillie . He 's a sweetie lamb , and so generous . He spends money like water . NANCY puzzledHe does ? SYLVIA Yes , he 's taken me on parties to all the cabarets , ' n ' everywhere . NANCY Does your father know that you go to these places ? SYLVIA Sure . NANCY He never objects ? SYLVIA Why should be when you go with your own crowd ; there 's no harm in them , is there ? NANCY They are not exactly the places for a girl who has been brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escort to these parties ? SYLVIA smilingHe 's my " gentleman friend . " NANCY He does n't make love to you ? SYLVIA gigglingNo , but I guess he 'd like to . p. 99 NANCY Darling , you must n't say such things . It is n't nice . SYLVIA sulkilyWhy not ? NANCY Well , nice girls do n't  --  that 's all . SYLVIA resentfullWhat else do n't they do ? NANCY hesitatinglyWell , dear , they do n't go to the places you have been going , and they do n't use rouge , or wear hats from Francine 's . SYLVIA All the women in my crowd do . NANCY Then I think you 're going with the wrong crowd . SYLVIA indignantlyHow do you know ? You 've never seen any of them . They may not belong , but they know how to be kind . NANCY Sylvia , I 'm sorry . I do n't mean to criticize  --  SYLVIA rising in a fury of rageBut you are , you are ! Daddy is the only one that never finds fault with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . NANCY , horrified at the implication that she does not love SYLVIA , rises quickly , grasps her in her arms , and almost roughly places her hand over SYLVIA 'S mouth . She stands there crucified by the realization of the fact that she has apparently lost the love of her child p. 100 NANCY Oh , my dear , my dear  --  never say that to me again . She pauses a moment , then very tenderlyIt is n't always kind to allow you to do just as you please . SYLVIA sullenlyDoes n't every one else in this family do as they darn please ? NANCY hopelesslyYes , I suppose we do . There is a slight pause . SYLVIA looks defiantly at NANCY , who moves slowly across to the fireplace where she stands her elbows resting on the mantelpiece , her face buried in her hands . The telephone bell rings sharply . SYLVIA turns quickly to answer it SYLVIA Yes . Turning to NANCYDudley 's downstairs . If you do n't want to be bothered I can see him in the lounge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillette come right up . To NANCYWere you expecting him ? NANCY Yes , he 's coming to talk to me on business . SYLVIA I want to talk to him , too , but I had n't better butt in on your party . NANCY It wo n't interfere , dear . p. 101 SYLVIA I 've a message for Gillie from the bunch . NANCY Ca n't you give it to Mr. Gillette now ? SYLVIA defiantlyAny objection to my seeing him alone ? NANCY Why , none at all , dear ; I 'll let you know as soon as we have finished . The buzzer at the double door sounds SYLVIA Come in . GILLETTE enters . He wears informal evening dressOh , there you are . I thought you were going with us to dinner to-night . GILLETTE , who has entered smilingly , frowns in annoyance at SYLVIA , and motions her to silence ; then , smiling suavely , advances toward NANCY GILLETTE Good evening , Mrs. Fair . It 's a very great pleasure to see you again . NANCY acknowledges GILLETTE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillie , have them page me in the lounge . I 'll go down and hear a little jazz . She smiles sweetly at GILLETTE , who turns and smiles at her . She starts towards the door into the hall . NANCY crosses quickly to her NANCY No , Sylvia , you wait in my room , please . SYLVIA turns angrily , looks at NANCY ; there is a brief clash of wills , then SYLVIA goes into NANCY 'S room , slamming the door . NANCY sinks wearily into the chair and sits staring before her , lost in thought . GILLETTE place his hat , cane and gloves on the sofa , then approaches NANCY p. 102 GILLETTE effusivelyMrs . Fair , I must congratulate you on the success of your tour . It was phenomenal . I am proud to have had the privilege of presenting you to the American public . NANCY makes no reply . GILLETTE looks at her in surpriseI trust that you have found it agreeable to appear under my management . There is no response and GILLETTE looks at her again I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better terms for the new tour . He sits NANCY I am not going on another tour . GILLETTE astoundedYou are not going on  --  but , Mrs. Fair , all the arrangements have been made . NANCY They will have to be cancelled . GILLETTE But you agreed to it by letter . You ' phoned me to bring these contracts to-night . NANCY Things have occurred that have made me change my mind . GILLETTE Are you dissatisfied with me ? NANCY No . But I ca n't go on . GILLETTE You ca n't mean that you are going to give up all your triumphs ? p. 103 NANCY satirically " Triumphs ! " GILLETTE Why , Mrs. Fair , I am leaving to-night for Montreal to arrange for your appearance in Canada . The people in the East have n't heard you talk of your great work . NANCY Mr. Gillette , there is nothing that could induce me to talk of my great work again . A pause I will be very much obliged if you will bring me an accounting to-morrow . GILLETTE nervouslyTo-morrow ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen thousand dollars due . GILLETTE stammeringWhy  --  why  --  I wo n't be able to make a settlement to-morrow . It will take the bookkeeper several days to make out a statement . NANCY Let me have it as soon as possible , as I am going to re-open our house in the country . And now I believe Sylvia has some message for you . I will send her in and you can say good bye to her . She rises and goes to the door of her room GILLETTE astonishedGood-bye ? NANCY turning to him I think it wiser . Sylvia has been telling me of your kindness to her . I do n't wish to seem ungrateful , but I would rather you did not see her again , at least for the present . p. 104 GILLETTE angrilyAre you insinuating that I am not good enough to associate with your daughter ? NANCY I never insinuate , Mr. Gillette . If I must speak more plainly , I will , and I hope you will not resent it . GILLETTE rudelyWell  --  NANCY Sylvia 's story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have rather different standards as to the sort of associates and amusements that are suitable for a girl of her age and up-bringing . GILLETTE sneeringlyShe enjoyed the associates and the amusements . NANCY Possibly , but I am sure that she will like much more the ones I intend to provide for her from now on . When may I expect the statement ? GILLETTE The day after to-morrow . NANCY Good night , Mr. Gillette . GILLETTE Good night , Mrs. Fair . NANCY goes into her room . GILLETTE walks up and down . He is deeply annoyed , worried . Enter SYLVIA . She runs across to him SYLVIA Oh , Gillie , the bunch said to tell you  --  p. 105 GILLETTE irritablyOh , hang the bunch ! SYLVIA Why , Dudley , what 's the matter ? GILLETTE Your mother has thrown me down . She has cancelled her tour . SYLVIA surprisedMother 's not going away ? GILLETTE No , and she has put me in an awful hole . SYLVIA How ? GILLETTE Oh , you would n't understand about business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars by the day after to-morrow ? SYLVIA I 'm so sorry you 're so worried . GILLETTE I can do with a little sympathy . She 's made me feel like a yellow dog . SYLVIA Did mother say something unkind to you ? GILLETTE bitterlyDid she ? She spoke " plainly " and " hoped I would n't resent it . " Me doing all I could so that you would n't be lonely . A lot of thanks I got . Told me I was n't good enough to associate with you . He laughsWell , if she objects to me , what 's she going to say about your father and Angy Brice ? SYLVIA Dudley ! What do you mean ? p. 106 GILLETTE The minute your mother 's wise , she 'll get a divorce . SYLVIA shockedDivorce ! GILLETTE Why , you poor kid , are n't you onto your father and Angy Brice ? Everybody else in town is . SYLVIA Oh , I never thought my daddy would go back on me . Broken hearted , she sinks into a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . That selfish brother of yours has no time for anybody but his wife . Your mother leaving you alone for years at a stretch , and your father running around with Angy Brice . A lot they care about you . SYLVIA Nobody wants me . GILLETTE . suddenly alarmed lest SYLVIA 'S sobs may be overheard by her mother , crosses quickly to her and quiets her GILLETTE I want you . I 'm the only one that cares anything about you , and I 've been ordered to say good-bye to you . SYLVIA bewilderedGood-bye ? GILLETTE Yes , you 're going to be taken down to the country . SYLVIA I wo n't go . GILLETTE You 'll have to go and you 'll soon forget all about me. p. 107 SYLVIA I wo n't . GILLETTE Oh , yes , you will . SYLVIA I wo n't . GILLETTE No ? Then prove it . SYLVIA How ? GILLETTE Come with me to Montreal to-night . SYLVIA Oh , Dudley ! GILLETTE We 'll be married as soon as we get there . SYLVIA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure they will . Did n't they forgive Alan ? Forgive you ! Why , they 'll be on their knees to you , and to me , too . SYLVIA I do n't know what to do . GILLETTE Oh , all right . I might have known you would n't come through . You pretend to care for me . It 's only a bluff . Well , stay here where nobody wants you . Good-bye . He makes a pretense of leaving hurriedly . SYLVIA rises and runs to him SYLVIA Oh , Dudley , please do n't go . GILLETTE Well , what are you going to do about it ? SYLVIA patheticallyYou 're sure you really want me ? p. 108 GILLETTE Of course I want you . We ca n't talk here . Meet me down stairs in the lounge and we will talk it over . Now you wo n't weaken ? He opens the door to the hall . SYLVIA crosses it to her room . He closes the door and stands for an instant , smiling in triumph as he looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes hurriedly and gets his hat and cane from the sofa , and is starting to leave the room quickly when NANCY enters from her room . He stops and assumes a nonchalant attitude NANCY surprisedOh , Mr. Gillette , where is Sylvia ? GILLETTE I 've said good-bye to her . She 's gone to her room . Good night , Mrs. Fair . NANCY Good night . GILLETTE bows smilingly and leaves the room , closing the door . NANCY stands thinking , then goes towards the door on her way to SYLVIA 'S room . Her hand is on the knob when the telephone rings sharply , then again . NANCY answers itHello . Put her on , please . Who ? Mrs. Brice ? Oh , this is Mrs. Fair . Yes . I 'll give Mr. Fair your messge . Enter JEFFREYThat was Mrs. Brice on the telephone . JEFFREY surprisedReally ? Why , I saw her  --  p. 109 NANCY Yes , I know . She said that you had just been there , but she wants to see you to-morrow . JEFFREY Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NANCY Yes , she is in her room . Jeffrey  --  He stops  --  I hardly know how to say it . I understand about Mrs. Brice , but has it ever occurred to you that other people might n't ? JEFFREY What do you mean ? NANCY The worst of these platonic friendships is , that people will talk . JEFFREY Have you heard any talk ? He places his overcoat and hat on a chair and goes toward NANCY NANCY Well , Bridget Wynne is n't a gossip , but even she wrote to me that you and Mrs. Brice were about a good deal together . JEFFREY Oh , she is still reporting to her senior officer . He sits at the right of the table . NANCY sits at the left of it NANCY Jeffrey , frankly , do you think it courteous to go to see Mrs. Brice a few hours after my arrival ? JEFFREY You were busy with your own affairs as usual . p. 110 NANCY I have some pride . JEFFREY I do n't understand . NANCY I was very glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolong your boredom at dinner . JEFFREY I was n't bored . Sorry if you were . I thought I was very entertaining . You 'll have to make allowances for me . I have n't had the advantage of mingling with the mighty minds of two continents . NANCY Jeffrey , I 'd like you to be serious . JEFFREY Oh , have n't we been ? I think being told by your wife that you are a bore is fairly serious . Still if there 's more , let 's have it . There is a slight pause NANCY Jeffrey , long ago we decided that if we ever came to the conclusion that our marriage had been a mistake  --  JEFFREY I have n't said so . NANCY Words are n't necessary Actions sometimes  --  JEFFREY When it comes to actions , I have n't forsaken my bed and board NANCY We need n't go into that . JEFFREY Pardon me , but that is the crux of the whole affair . NANCY Oh , no , Jeffrey , your attentions to Mrs. Brice are the crux of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to object to anything I do ? NANCY My right as your wife . JEFFREY Have n't you forfeited that right ? NANCY How ? JEFFREY If you prefer the public to your husband , you must n't kick at the price you have to pay . NANCY Meaning that I am not to protest if you choose to make me conspicuous by your attentions to that woman ? Really this is delicious . She laughs , rises and goes to the desk , at which she sits JEFFREY Are you paying me the compliment of being jealous of me ? NANCY Jealous of a man who does n't want me ! JEFFREY Oh , Nancy , you know damn well I want you . You may not be jealous of me , but I am of you , and of everything that concerns you . I 'm jealous of your career because it takes you away from me . He rises I tried to live up to our agreement . Have n't I the right to expect that you 'd live up to it , too ? If it was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to take care of it ? Had you the right , be honest , Nancy , to go on this tour ? You ca n't be married and be a free agent without making some one suffer . I 'm so damned sick of my life , as I 'm living it now  --  but there , I do n't want to keep you if you want to be free . He turns away from NANCY , who rises and follows him quickly p. 112 NANCY I do n't want to be free . As JEFFREY turns to take her in his arms , she stops him Oh , wait , I want to be honest with myself and with you . I could n't go back to my life as I lived it four years ago . It is n't that I do n't want a home . While I was in France there were glorious moments and honors and flattery , but there were nights when I was so sick of the horrors , the pain , the misery , that it seemed to me if I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loneliness of my heart against yours I could n't go on . JEFFREY takes her in his arms , kisses herWith death on every side I used to worry for fear you were n't taking care of yourself . They decorated me for bravery . They never knew what a coward I was about you . Why , on this tour the nights when I had had a great success and while people were crowding around me congratulating me , I 'd see some wife tuck her hand through her husband 's arm , just as I had tucked mine so many times through yours , and she would trot away home with her man and I would go to a lonely hotel room and think about you . Then is when I would realize that success meant nothing if I had to give up you . She breaks down and cries . JEFFREY 'S arms are about her . He murmurs her name and kisses her JEFFREY Then , Nancy , I 've got you again . NANCY Yes , and hang on to me . If I ever try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water . p. 113 JEFFREY What about this supplementary tour ? NANCY laughing in hysterical reliefThere " ai n't going to be no tour . " JEFFREY Fine ! When did you decide that ? NANCY To-night . But do n't ask me why . JEFFREY I do n't care a damn why , just so you 're not going . He kisses her NANCY Bless you . The first thing we 'll do will be to get out of this hole . She moves away from him JEFFREY I do n't believe Sylvia will like the country . NANCY She 'll like it with me . She 's going to have all the fun she 's missed in four years crowded into as many months . It 's going to be very expensive for you , darling . She laughs and sits on the sofa . JEFFREY follows her and sits beside her JEFFREY Go as far as you like . NANCY She and I are going out to-morrow and buy a lot of frills . And if the exchequer runs to it I want new curtains for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party for my two daughters ! JEFFREY pleasedYou 're going to take Peggy up ? p. 114 NANCY No , I 'm going to try to make her love me , that 's all . JEFFREY She will . After that , what ? Remember , Nancy , I do n't want to tie you down to the home . NANCY If you can have a career and do your duty to the family too , ca n't I ? I ought to be as smart as you . But you 'll help me find some welfare work to keep me and my Unit out of mischief , wo n't you ? JEFFREY Sure . NANCY That 's settled . Oh , Jeff , you are a nice old thing ! She leans back in his arms JEFFREY Nancy , you 're a darling ! NANCY teasinglyAnd you 're quite sure that I am as well suited to you as Angy Brice ? JEFFREY Oh , forget her . I discharged all my obligations to her tonight . NANCY I am kind of sorry for poor Angy . A pauseObligations ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself away from him ; looks at himHas she any real claim on you ? Tell me the truth . Tell me the truth . JEFFREY Nancy , for God 's sake , be big enough to understand . NANCY Oh ! She shudders away from him , rises , goes to the mantelpiece and buries her face in her hands p. 115 JEFFREY It was just after you had gone on this tour . You know how we parted . You did n't write to me . I was lonely , reckless . But I 've never loved her . You wo n't believe it , but I 've never ceased loving you . NANCY Stop , stop ! Everything you say only makes it more horrible ! She moves away from him across the room . JEFFREY rises , moves about and finally stands looking into the fireplace . There is silence . Then NANCY goes towards the door to her room . She stopsI will go West and establish a residence . We wo n't drag in Mrs. Brice . Your lawyer will make all the necessary arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're going to divorce me ? NANCY turning to him You do n't think I 'd go on living with you ? JEFFREY Nancy , you 're not going to hold me entirely to blame ? You 're not going to dodge your own responsibility ? NANCY For what am I responsible ? JEFFREY Surely you do n't think my affair with Mrs. Brice was a greater sin against our love than your craving for a career ? NANCY And surely you are not daring to place me in the same category as yourself ? p. 116 JEFFREY Why not ? Do you think you can starve my affections , my passion , for years , without moral guilt ? NANCY You must be mad to think such thoughts , and lost to all sense of decency to express them . JEFFREY I  --  NANCY I refuse to listen to anything more . All I want to know is , are you going to try to keep me against my will , or must I make a scandal to get free ? JEFFREY is silentSurely you do n't want to blacken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JEFFREY I 'm not going to marry her . She knows it . I 'm not in love with her , nor she with me . A sum of money will console her . NANCY Your bargain with her has no interest for me . You may make what use of your freedom you choose . I mean to have mine . JEFFREY Very well . My lawyer knows the amount of my income . You may have what you wish of it . NANCY I would n't take any of it , were it not for Sylvia . JEFFREY What do you mean ? Sylvia ? NANCY Do you think I would allow her to remain with you ? Look what your neglect has made of her . Through your carelessness Mr. Gillette has been allowed to introduce her to a sort of life until she is no more the child I sent home to you than  --  Do you think when I realize that you are responsible that I would trust her to you again ? Never ! Never ! p. 117 JEFFREY And do you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest thing in my life . I 'll never let her go . NANCY She 's the only thing in mine . If you force me to do it , I 'll tell her the truth about you . JEFFREY So that is your threat ! She is in her room , you say . Well , you tell her the truth about me and let her decide . He starts toward the door to the hall . NANCY stands aghast . ALAN rushes in , followed by PEGGY ALAN Dad ! Mother ! Where is Sylvia ? NANCY She is in her room . ALAN She is not . To PEGGYI was right . It was Sylvia in that taxi-cab with Gillette . To JEFFREYThey drove away just as we arrived . GIBBS I found this letter on Sylvia 's dressing-table . She gives the letter to ALAN , who hands it to JEFFREY ALAN For you , Dad . JEFFREY takes the letter . The others watch him apprehensively as he open it JEFFREY reading " Dear Daddy  --  I  --  " He mumbles indistinctly , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and drops his head in misery . NANCY , who has been watching him in fear , starts toward him . She is trembling and can scarcely walk . Her hands are outstretched toward the letter p. 118 NANCY hoarselyJeff , Jeff ! JEFFREY looks at NANCY , then hands her the letter JEFFREY Sylvia has decided . He rushes to the telephoneHello , hello , give me Police Headquarters quickly , quickly . JEFFREY is at the telephone , frantically calling Police Headquarters . ALAN and PEGGY are beside him . NANCY , with the letter crushed against her breast , leans for support against the table . She stares straight ahead , her face drawn with agony , as the@@ The scene is the same as that of the previous act . The room is in semi darkness , the curtains drawn aside showing through the window , blurred by the drizzling rain , the lights of a building across the street . Two hours have elapsed NANCY is standing at the window , peering into the street . Presently PEGGY , a wrap over her arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cry , turns quickly at the sound of the closing door , then with a sigh of disappointment resumes her watching attitude . PEGGY goes to her and places the wrap about her shoulders NANCY Thank you , Peggy dear . PEGGY switches on the light in the chandelier . The bell of the telephone on the writing-desk rings shrilly . PEGGY rushes to it . NANCY turns sharply and during the telephone conversation , to which she listens intently , moves down and stands behind PEGGY GIBBS excitedlyHello , yes . Police Headquarters . Oh , yes , Tom . Any news ?  --  None . Oh  --  Gillette went to his apartment . Was Sylvia with him then ?  --  She waited outside in the taxi . You have n't any idea where they went from there .  --  Your men are watching all the depots and ferries . She breaks down Oh , Tom , you 've got to find her .  --  No . I wo n't . He 's there with you ?  --  Hello , Alan . Your mother ? Why  --  Not knowing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone . PEGGY bows her head on the desk , crying p. 120 NANCY Yes , dear , I 'm all right . Do n't worry about me , there 's a good boy . Your father ? He 's gone out . I do n't know where .  --  Now , Alan , dear , you must n't give up hope . You 'll find her .  --  That 's better .  --  That 's more like my boy . Of course you 'll bring her back to me . I know you will .  --  That 's it . Good-bye , dear . She puts the telephone on the table and , smiling bravely , places her hand on PEGGY 'S headDo n't cry , Peggy dear ; they 'll find her . They 'll find her . Then , beginning to lose her self-control , she turns away to the window , her hands folded as though in prayerOh , God , find her ! Find her ! Find her ! She goes to the window and , leaning against it , her face pressed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her and , putting her arms about her , leads her to the fireplace and places her in the couch , where NANCY sits , holding out her hands to the blaze . PEGGY kneels beside her . There is a pause , then NANCY looks at the clock on the mantelIt 's almost twelve o'clock . GIBBS We 'll hear some good news very soon now . RisingWould n't you like a cup of tea ? NANCY shakes her headNot if I sent for the things and made it myself ? I make very nice tea . NANCY I 'm sure you do . But I could n't . There is a pause p. 121 GIBBS Oh , Mrs. Fair ! I would n't keep on reading that letter . NANCY Oh , Peggy , I know it by heart . " I 'm in everybody 's way . Nobody wants me . Dudley does , so I 'm going with him . Sylvia . " Oh , my baby ! She breaks down again GIBBS Please do n't cry  --  please ! NANCY No , I must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could only do something ! GIBBS There is nothing to do but wait . She sits on the arm of the couch , her arms around NANCY . Again there is a pause NANCY wildlyOh , Peggy , tell me again that they 'll find her ! GIBBS Of course they will . Now , Mrs. Fair , you must n't . Please do n't cry . NANCY controlling herselfWhy are you so good to me ? GIBBS very tenderlyBecause you 're Alan 's mother . And because you 're you . NANCY I do n't deserve this , my dear , but I 'm very grateful . GIBBS I 've been wanting to do this ever since that day we hurt you so cruelly . NANCY pulls PEGGY 'S head down to her and kisses her . PEGGY sits beside NANCY and taking NANCY 'S hand in hers , strokes it affectionately . There is a pause . Both of them are lost in thoughtThe one thing I ca n't understand is Sylvia 's leaving her father . She would never have gone if she had n't felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have left  --  She stops abruptly p. 122 NANCY You could understand her leaving me . I 'm beginning to understand that , too . I 'm beginning to see that he has more right to her than I have . GIBBS Oh , I do n't mean that she does n't love you , but the love Sylvia had for her father was wonderful . NANCY He had earned it . GIBBS I do n't think Mr. Fair realized it , but he did n't want her to love any one more than she did him . NANCY This is going to be terrible for Jeffrey . A pauseIt 's strange , Peggy , how one can seem to be doing one 's duty and fail so miserably  --  go so hopelessly wrong . A pause , then NANCY looks toward the telephoneQueer they do n't telephone . I wonder where Jeffrey is ? If they do n't find Sylvia  --  GIBBS Oh , they will , they will . NANCY risingOh , what is her father going to do without her ? GIBBS Thank God , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . NANCY winces and turns away as the door opens to admit JEFFREY , tired , haggard . Both the women turn to him inquiringly . He shakes his head . Then places his hat and coat on the chair beside the door . PEGGY goes to him p. 123 JEFFREY Any news ? GIBBS cheerfullyNot yet . But there will be very soon . JEFFREY You all right , Nancy ? NANCY Yes , Jeffrey . JEFFREY Did Alan telephone ? GIBBS Yes , just a moment ago . JEFFREY No trace of them ? PEGGY shakes her head . JEFFREY moves slowly down to the chair at the desk , where he sits brooding . PEGGY sits in the armchair at the table . A pause SavagelyCurse the day the swine came into my house ! NANCY Oh , Jeff , do n't make me feel my responsibility for it all any more than I do . I ca n't bear it . I ca n't bear it . JEFFREY I 'm sorry , Nancy . NANCY That 's all right , Jeff , NANCY goes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with her hands to cut off the light from the chandelier . Presently she rubs the moisture off the pane and peers cut again , Then she lifts the sash and leans out , looking down into the street . Suddenly she gives a little startJeff ! Here comes a taxi ! JEFFREY and PEGGY run to the window and look out over NANCY 'S shoulder p. 124 GIBBS excitedlyIs it stopping ? NANCY No , it 's going on . PEGGY and JEFFREY return to their chairs ; NANCY remains at the window . A pause , then JEFFREY takes out his watch GIBBS whisperingWhat time is it ? JEFFREY whisperingA quarter past twelve . PEGGY , sighing , sinks back into the chair , and after a moment JEFFREY turns and looks at NANCYMother , you 'd better come away from that window ; there is a draught . You 'll take cold . NANCY does not replyNancy , you 'll take cold . NANCY does not answer . Another pause . Then JEFFREY , rising , goes to PEGGY , touches her quietly on the shoulderPeggy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get stand it . I ca n't stand it . Profoundly moved , he walks over to the sofa and sits . PEGGY goes to NANCY and touches her on the shoulder NANCY Yes , dear ? GIBBS I would n't watch for them , dear . NANCY No ? GIBBS You know a watched kettle never boils . NANCY smiles , but remains at the window . PEGGY returns to the armchair and stands behind it is it raining now , Mr. Fair ? p. 125 JEFFREY Yes . NANCY quite unemotionallyI hope Sylvia had n't on thin shoes . She takes cold so easily . At least , she used to . JEFFREY buries his face in his hands . PEGGY 'S lips quiver . Her eyes fill with tears . They wait JEFFREY Nancy , did Gillette owe you any money ? NANCY intently watching the streetYes , several thousand . JEFFREY That 's it ! NANCY indifferentlyWhat do you mean ? JEFFREY I found out from Tom Gibbs to-night that Gillette was the man who was mixed up in that Bazaar scandal . He has stolen your money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JEFFREY Do n't you see you ca n't prosecute him now without bringing Sylvia into it ? Damn him ! It all seems of little moment to NANCY , and she turns again to the window . The door to the hall opens very softly and ALAN stands in the doorway , unseen by JEFFREY and NANCY . PEGGY , moving to sit in the chair , sees ALAN and goes quietly to him . He whispers to her and she darts out and across the hall into SYLVIA 'S room . He comes in quickly , closing the door . At the sound NANCY and JEFFREY turn . JEFFREY springs to his feet p. 126 NANCY with a great cryAlan ! ALAN She 's here ! JEFFREY Thank God ! NANCY makes a rush for the door ALAN stopping herWait , Mother . What that are you going to say to her ? What are you going to do ? NANCY Oh , Alan , what would I do ? ALAN I did n't know . JEFFREY Where did you find her ? ALAN At 125th Street station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he ? ALAN I 've taken care of him . He 's  --  NANCY hysterically , and trying to pass ALAN . What does it matter where he is ? All that matters is that she 's here . Do n't shut her outside . Alan , do you hear me ? Let me go to her ! JEFFREY Easy , Nancy , easy ! ALAN taking her in his armsAll right , Mother , all right . But be careful treat her very gently . He goes NANCY Jeffrey , I 'm giving up my claims to her . She 's yours . So be kind to her . SYLVIA enters , white-faced , definant , followed by PEGGY and ALAN . NANCY rushes toward her to embrace her . SYLVIA , stretching out her hands , stops her . NANCY , surprised , stunned for the moment , looks toward JEFFREY bewilderedlyJeff  --  JEFFREY looks at SYLVIA , who looks coldly at him p. 127 NANCY Wo n't you sit down , dear ? SYLVIA I can take what everybody has to say , standing . NANCY very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid . NANCY We 're not going to scold you . We 're not going to say anything . SYLVIA No ? Well , I am . JEFFREY sternlyVery well . Go on . I 'm interested to hear what you have to say . NANCY turning to himJeff , please ! JEFFREY I 'll handle this , Nancy . Alan , take Peggy into your mother 's room . SYLVIA She need n't go . She 's in on this . GIBBS I ? SYLVIA You were responsible for our arrest , were n't you ? ALAN You were n't arrested . SYLVIA We would have been if you had n't been there . GIBBS No , no , dear . Tom would have brought you here to us . SYLVIA Oh , then you did arrange it all ? Do n't you think , for a new member of this family , you were taking a good deal on yourself to  --  p. 128 JEFFREY Come , come , Sylvia ; it was I who got Tom Gibbs on the wire . You should be very grateful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SYLVIA turning upon him I 'm not . What right has she  --  what right have any of you  --  to butt in on my affairs ? NANCY Why , my dear , we all love you . SYLVIA You acted like it , did n't you ? What have you all got against Dudley ? ALAN Sylvia , I 've told you that he was an embezzler , and that his only idea in marrying you was to use you to prevent mother prosecuting him . SYLVIA That 's what you say . Mother , has Dudley taken any money from you ? NANCY No . SYLVIA Well , Alan , mother ought to know . ALAN He confessed that he was short in his accounts . SYLVIA I did n't hear him . ALAN You were n't there when he was begging Gibbs to let him go . SYLVIA No . I was being made conspicuous , seated on a bench on the platform between two officers . Oh , I 'll never forget it ! She puts her hands to her face as though to shut out the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go to her now . JEFFREY going to SYLVIAI am sorry , dear , that all this had to happen  --  that you feel we 've all conspired to disgrace you . But we were only trying to protect you . SYLVIA Protect me ? If you wanted to protect me , why wait ? You knew that I was going about with him . NANCY But , Sylvia , dear , your father did n't realize the sort of friends that Mr. Gillette had  --  introduced  --  SYLVIA He introduced me to the only friends he had . What do you know about them ? You never met them . JEFFREY Sylvia , I forbid you to use that tone to your mother . NANCY Sylvia is right , Jeff . I judged them solely by what she told me of them . SYLVIA And while you were judging you passed sentence on Dudley . too , did n't you ? You forbade my best friend seeing me again . JEFFREY Your mother had every right to do that . SYLVIA She had no right to make him feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was she who introduced him to me . JEFFREY She did not know that you were associating with him so intimately . p. 130 SYLVIA No . She was n't here , was she ? NANCY No , Sylvia , I was n't here . JEFFREY But I was . I 'm to blame . I should have watched over you . SYLVIA But you did n't care what I was doing , where I was going , just so you were free to run around with Mrs. Brice . JEFFREY flinches as though he had been struck NANCY Sylvia , how dare you talk like that to your father ? ALAN Have n't you any respect ? Have n't you any feeling ? Ca n't you see that you are hurting father and mother cruelly ? SYLVIA Well , have n't they hurt me ? ALAN indignantlyHurt you ! You ought to be down on your knees , thanking them for saving you from a marriage  --  SYLVIA Were you worrying about how cruelly you hurt mother when you told her about Peggy ? Would you have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save you from marrying her ? JEFFREY Stop , Sylvia ! How can you ? If it had n't been for Peggy  --  SYLVIA I would n't have had to stand all this . ALAN You do n't think it 's pleasant for us , do you ? p. 131 SYLVIA There 's an easy way of stopping it . JEFFREY How ? SYLVIA hystericallyLet me get out of here . She makes a rush for the door . ALAN stops her JEFFREY Where do you want to go ? SYLVIA jerking herself away from ALANAnywhere away from all of you ! Why am I dragged back here , where nobody loves me , wants me ? She throws herself in the armchair at the table , sobbing wildly NANCY Your father loves you , wants you . SYLVIA A lot he loves me ! He loves Angy Brice . ALAN Who told you this damn lie ? SYLVIA sobbingIt 's not a lie . Everybody has known but us that he was going to get rid of mother and marry Angy . ALAN Dad  --  my God !  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't you going to leave Daddy ? There is a pause . SYLVIA , ALAN and PEGGY are waiting for the answer . JEFFREY stands with bowed head p. 132 NANCY No . JEFFREY turning , makes an effort to speak , and finally articulatesNancy ! Then , overcome , he turns away to the window SYLVIA going to NANCYWhy , Dudley said  --  That 's why I went away with him . I did n't know what would become of me when you separated . I thought my daddy had gone back on me . NANCY folds her in her arms , kissing her . JEFFREY comes to them JEFFREY Your daddy will never go back on you , if you will only  --  NANCY Jeff , do n't make conditions ; we 've both been wrong . We must be content with whatever Sylvia want . SYLVIA I only want you all to want me . NANCY Oh , my dear ! my dear ! GIBBS snivellingAlan , where is Gillette ? ALAN In an ambulance .
