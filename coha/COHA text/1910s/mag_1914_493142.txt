NUMBER 3 NOW that the American troops are to evacuate Vera Cruz , it is fair to ask why they were sent there and what they have accomplished . If we remember correctly , it was said at the time that the flag had been insulted by a Huertista , and American dignity required an act of reprisal . We presume that this comic-opera reason was not the one which actually inspired the President . For it was clear that the Administration favored the Constitutionalists , and that after the fall of Torreon the darling idea of destroying Huerta seemed about to be realized . There was a chance , however , that a new shipment of arms would help the Federals . By seizing Vera Cruz we could prevent the " Ypiranga " from landing her cargo , and so deprive Huerta of the weapons he needed . We seized Vera Cruz , but the arms were landed at Puerta Mexico . Nevertheless Huerta fell , and the President 's policy was called a success . There was just one rift in the lute . When Huerta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment conditions in Mexico are said to be worse than at any time within the memory of man . Constitutional government is as far off as it ever was . The needed land reforms are not in the least likely to be carried out , foreigners are not safe in Mexico , and the country is prostrate . What have we accomplished ? For what purpose did American and Mexican soldiers die at Vera Cruz ? To what end did we intervene ? O T HE President is a silent and secretive man , and he has the air of profound intentions . His hand has been free because the news was constantly suppressed , because Europe was unable to interfere , and because this country shared his dislike of Huerta and his genuine desire for peace . Moreover , there never was any question that Mr. Wilson was eager to serve the Mexican people , and to prevent any aggression by the United States . Because Americans admired his idealism , they resolved to trust his methods . It seemed inconceivable that he should be without definite policy , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprisal , and that behind the brooding andthe watching and the waiting and the impressive silence there was not some large and well-defined idea . Yet when the , troops leave Vera Cruz on Monday they will leave the Mexican problem completely unsolved . A good intention does not constitute a good policy . The President is , if anything , further from a solution than he was when Mr. Taft so genially bequeathed the difficulty to him . Mr. Wilson has no Mexican policy , yet Mr. Wilson has interfered in Mexico . Mr. Wilson wished to establish self-government in Mexico ; he leaves it in chaos . Mr. Wilson wishes peace and deplores aggression , Mr. Wilson seized a paltry excuse for aggression , and then shrank feebly from the consequences . He has blown hot and cold , has favored different factions , has put embargoes on arms and allowed arms to go in . W E find it hard to understand why we should evacuate Vera Cruz when more trouble is just about to begin . Perhaps Mr. Wilson has given up all hope of doing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For whatever influence he may have had will be lessened by this empty rattling of the sword and hasty retreat . From Vera Cruz he had at least a tangible leverage on Mexico . It might have been possible to justify the taking of Vera Cruz if Mr. Wilson had used it as a base from which to exert pressure in the direction of some definite policy . Vera Cruz in American hands was a big , impressive physical fact . Vera Cruz evacuated now is an object lesson to Mexico that our attitude is capricious and without underlying plan . The latest dispatches say that while we are withdrawing the army , we shall not restore the customs money until order is restored . In other words we are to weaken our hold , but we are not to let go . We are still intervening . But it is a serious business to interfere in another country , and only the most genuine reasons can ever justify it . By withdrawing now we show that our intervention was unjustified , for we leave with nothing essential accomplished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be given some weight in Mexico . From Washington his words will beat the air . And if foreigners are killed or plundered now , what will he do ? Will he be ready to admit that he has failed , that he can do nothing about Mexico , that our intervention has achieved nothing ? Or will he , with great determination , seize Vera Cruz again ? ? I N presenting his estimates to the House of Com- mons on Tuesday , Lloyd George estimated that one year of war would cost Great Britain no less than 450,000,000 or , roughly , two and a quarter billion dollars . The Chancellor reminded the Commons that this sum was greater than the entire cost of any war waged by England , and was over twice the sum spent during the whole four years of the South African contest . The expense is to be met by a great loan , by increased taxes on beer , and by a tax on tea , in order to reach " the elusive teetotallers " who , according to George , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the most significant financial expedient is the doubling of the income tax , to be levied at first on part of the income and later on the whole income . The effect will be to set a new standard of heavy taxation on earned and unearned incomes , and it is not probable that these increased rates will ever be greatly reduced . The shifting of the burden of taxation from those who are less to those who are more able to stand it goes on rapidly in peace and still more rapidly in war . ? W HEN reform once starts , you never can tell where it will stop . A university president has come out against militarism , a conspicuous number of editors are against the Kaiser , several ladies have bought a bale of cotton , a large number of socks are being knitted . But the tide can be stemmed . Though in New Jersey a bill has been introduced making it illegal for an organ-grinder to employ a monkey , it may still be legal to employ a child . F OR the complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to a corporate body . To speak of the American National Woman Suffrage Association is alone enough to stifle thought . It is a formidable and overwhelming title , staggering to read or to articulate . But apart from the duty of repeating this leaden title , there is nothing formal to be said about the annual convention of this extremely important organization which concluded last Monday at Nashville . No haze hangs over the vital decisions at which this convention arrived . It was called uponto clear its own mind on two fundamental issues . It had to take its stand on the partisan tactics of the Congressional Union , and it had to clarify the moot question of constitutional amendment . Both these questions it faced , it debated , it voted upon and it decided . The Congressional Union is the body that two years ago expressed the necessity for political activity on the part of woman suffragists in America . Flung out as an advance guard , it undoubtedly showed a healthy reaction from the political passivity of the National Association . But when the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union , the women who composed that body gave signs of recalcitrance , and eventually of positive disagreement . During 1913-1914 there were numerous clashes between the Union on one hand , and the Congressional Committee of the National Association on the other , and all through the country there were evidences of the heat and confusion engendered by outspoken antagonism . Against the candidacy of Dr. Anna Howard Shaw , president of the National , and Mrs. Medill McCormick of Chicago , chairman of the Congressional Committee , these recalcitrant forces were marshalled in the convention last week . By a vote of more than 2 to i Dr. Shaw was reelected president , and two uncompromising resolutions were carried , settling the political policy of the National Association . The convention declared itself , in the first place , " absolutely opposed to holding any political party responsible for the opinions and acts of its individual members , or holding any individual public official or candidate responsible for the actions of his party majority , " and in the second place it announced itself ready to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors might authorize . The good sense of the large minority in the convention was shown by its acquiescence in the decisions . These make perfectly clear the non-partisan character of the Association , and they keep the issue of woman suffrage where it belongs , before the entire male electorate of this country , to be passed upon , not as a party measure , entailing opposition to the party in power , but as a measure fundamentally democratic , to be decided on its own merits , by communities educated to the importance to women of all that suffrage means . T O the people who are sure that nations must be all of one race we suggest this question . Austria-Hungary consists of many races , and you say it ought to be dismembered on racial lines ; the United States consists of still more races , and you say it ought to be united . Austria is the " whirlpool of Europe , " and we are the " melting-pot " of the world . Wherein is the difference ? T HIS is the time not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international affairs . For this reason no one will dispute the wisdom of Secretary Daniels ' order to the captains of the Tennessee and the North Carolina that they are to take no action which would involve this government . Undoubtedly the President and his Cabinet have a very sharp recollection of the Tampico incident , and there is great comfort in the thought that they will not wish to repeat it . The reports of what happened in the Bay of Smyrna do not justify a scarehead agitation in the newspapers . That official Turkey was responsible for the shooting is unthinkable . It was probably either a mistake for which there will be apologies , or it was the result of a local outburst beyond the control of the Turkish government . In neither case is there reason for a stampede . ? ? W HILE minor poetry is enveloping the " brilliant exploits " of the cruiser Emden , word reaches us about one of these brilliant exploits . There was a ship on its way to Madras carrying the city and town-planning exhibition devised by Professor Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so India and the world will have to do without the inspiration of that cargo . For the moment , perhaps , the world will not notice the loss ; it will pour out its admiration of the Emden , and waste no pity on the men whose life work is so incidentally destroyed . We hear that most of the exhibition can not be replaced , yet this may be the wrong time to lament that these plans for noble cities fit for mankind are lost . Civilization is cheap just now , for the world is busy defending it . ? B ERNARD SHAW 'S comments on the war may be wrong , his proposals unworkable , his judgments inadequate , but their value is unimpeachable . They are full of that rarest kind of courage which enables a man to maintain his self-respect against the intoxication of a crowd . Europe to-day is overrun with men who are ready to face guns ; it is depressingly empty of men who are ready to be snubbed , to be slandered , to be called coward . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily as Shaw has done the good-will of their own people . Few understand what it means to write as he has written . After years of ridicule and abuse he has won a real popularity ; he is middle-aged now , and had peace prevailed he might have looked forward to a quiet enjoyment of his success . The author of " Fanny 's First Play " was obviously quite able to amuse the ordinary Londoner , to grow rich and be admired . It would have been easy for Shaw to do what Wells and Bennett and Chesterton have done , accept the English case as a good one , and mount to greater fame as a scathing satirist of the Kaiser . No man in Europe could have blown Bernhardi into smaller fragments . It would have been the easy choice , but he has not made it . He has instead done the difficult thing at the most difficult time , and whether he is right or wrong in what he says is a small matter when the right is as murky as it is in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul blow like a cleansing gale upon the feverish hate of that continent . ? P RESIDENT WILSON did not appear at his best in his recent conference with the delegation which appealed to him in behalf of the negroes in the Government service . If , as is alleged , Mr. William Monroe Trotter of Boston , the spokesman of the committee , was guilty of an impropriety in making a reply to the President , then the President might well have used his discretion as to whether a rebuke was in order . But it does not seem obviously appropriate for the President of the United States to complain of the " intolerable burden " of his own office to negroes who daily suffer burdens more intolerable , who come to the President with real grievances due to the President 's own inaction in a moral crisis . The President waives aside all references to considerations of political support by negroes as " blackmail , " but the President before his election sought that support , and sought it with explicit promises which negroes and others believe have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , " he said during the campaign of 1912 , " they the colored people may count upon me for absolute fair dealing and for everything by which I could assist in advancing the interest of their race in the United States . " What the President has as yet done in advancing this interest he does not state ; what he intends to do in the future he does not state . But he does express his unwillingness to interfere with Southern members of his Cabinet , who are segregating colored employees , setting apart Federal civil servants with negro blood in them as though they were lepers , a humiliation which is bitterly resented by colored people throughout the country and deplored by thousands of high-minded white people , yet one which the President finds words to condone . The President used fair words in 1912 in his appeal to the negroes for votes . We know now that those words meant nothing . AO= i ; : =11 W E live these days in an atmosphere of large words . Militarism , aggression , freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of them glibly as if we knew just what they meant // But where , for example , in the gradation from Tolstoi to Bernhardi does a man become a militarist ? What constitutes aggression ? Was it aggressive for Germany to send the gunboat Panther to Agadir , or for France to seize Morocco ? Was England aggressive or defensive in South Africa , in Persia ? It is aggressive to try to monopolize the trade of backward countries ? Are protective tariffs aggressive ? Was Austria aggressive when it set up a tariff against Servia 's commerce in pigs ? Would it be aggressive for Italy to " redeem " Trieste ? Were we aggressive when we took the Philippines ? Is the Monroe Doctrine aggressive ? And what is a war for freedom ? Would the crushing of the Hohenzollerns by the Allies be a liberation of the German people ? Was our refusal to recognize Huerta an act to further self-government in Mexico ? What is peace ? Are tariff wars , concession wars , labor wars , diplomatic wars , armaments races , all aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ? Can nations be destroyed by the enemy ? Is national destiny written in the stars or in the newspapers ? When national destiny tells Greece , Servia and Bulgaria in turn that its destiny is to control the Balkan peninsula to the exclusion of the others , what about the destinies that ca n't be satisfied ? Above all , what about race ? Who are the chosen people ? When German Emperors have English mothers and Russian cousins , how do they know which race they belong to ? When Englishmen sweat Englishmen in nasty slums , who are the chosen people then ? 11121:1 ? V ERY often the same people who talk in favor of developing " our " trade , talk against allowing workingmen and the public to share in the management of industry . They say they do not wish " outsiders " to " interfere " in " their business , " yet they are surprised when employees and consumers do not grow enthusiastic about " our " trade . But we can not have the thing both ways . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time treat it as the exclusive private interest of the employer . Either business is run by business men for themselves alone , and the rest of us have nothing to say , or business is a national service in which workingmen , consumers , investors , and managers are all represented . Talk to-day to an enlightened workingman or an intelligent consumer , and he will smile when you mention " our " industries . He knows they are not his industries . T HE Federal Reserve Board has already attacked the problem of reorganizing the vast and diffused business of cotton-growing in the United States . In connection with the new cottonloan administration , Secretary McAdoo is sending out a circular to bankers throughout the cotton-growing states , urging them to advise planters to change their methods of farming during the coming year . If the present acreage devoted to cotton is maintained , prices are bound to remain low owing to the disorganization of the textile industries of Europe . If , on the other hand , one-quarter of that acreage can be devoted to the raising of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only will there be a foreign as well as a home market for Southern beef , pork and other products , but the price of cotton , even of the present year 's crop , will inevitably rise . The recommendation of the Federal Reserve Board can hardly be disregarded in view of its control of the fundamental conditions of credit . If , as seems not at all unlikely , the Board is successful in carrying out its policy of placing cotton-growing upon a more stable basis , the way will be opened for other attempts to reorganize and solidify our American industries . 4 A NINETEEN-YEAR-OLD New Jersey boy was sentenced to 120 days in jail for shooting out of season a rabbit which had been devastating his mother 's vegetable garden . Citizens offered to pay the fine of $124 , but the youth preferred to serve his term rather than let half of the fine go to the informer . The mother , of whom he was the sole support , was compelled to seek employment . In the end the young man was released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped . This unimportant instance of " Jersey justice " is worthy of attention because every step in it illustrates the weakness of our criminal law ; the heavy penalty for a trivial offense and the statute 's failure to take account of intention ; the alternative of fine and imprisonment , a device for softening the rigors of the law for people of means ; the antiquated custom of making procedure a personal quarrel between accused and accuser ; the hardship inflicted upon innocent , dependent persons . To make the blundering record complete , when influential people interested themselves in the affair , all the immutable principles involved in this rabbit 's untimely demise were forgotten , and then it was that the case was appealed . p ROMINENT Washington women in a box at the Columbia Theatre brought forth knitting material during the intermissions .
