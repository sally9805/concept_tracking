In accounting for his defeat in New Jersey , the Republican candidate for Governor , Mr. Lewis , attributes the result largely to " the wisdom of the Democratic party in selecting a candidate of the calibre of Dr. Wilson . " Much the same could obviously be said of the nomination of Judge Baldwin in Connecticut and of Judson Harmon in Ohio . The voters like to support clean and able men . Even a democracy is eager to open a career for distinguished talent . This has been demonstrated again and again , but at no time more clearly than in last week 's elections . In many localities the electors displayed remarkable discrimination in honoring exceptional men with an exceptional vote . Never was the moral sense of the community more successfully appealed to . Now , this pre-election wisdom of the Democrats ought to be made post-election also . Other great struggles are before the party , in State and nation , and it can not begin too soon to prepare for them by putting its best foot forward . This year 's sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the reins of power two years from now . We have seen too many swift ups and downs in our politics , too many landslides going now to this party , now to that , to justify any notion that the country has definitely made up its mind to put the Democratic party in charge of the national government . This great blow to the Republicans was chiefly dealt by Republican hands . A vast Republican vote , discontented with the managers and policies of its own party , either went to the Democrats or was not cast at all . But this vote can be repelled as easily as it was won . The temporarily disgruntled Republicans , with the great body of independent voters , can be readily driven away by Democratic ineptitude or folly . And the great teaching of this year 's campaign is that Democrats who look forward must seek to deserve success as well as fight for it , and to that end should give the posts of honor and responsibility to men whom the country will perceive to be capable of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather cold comfort  --  that the Democrats will make such a mess of things in the next House that the country will be disgust ed and gladly fly back to the arms of the Republican party . The danger that this may happen is undeniable . Democrats in Congress have not , during recent years , made a display of great ability or unity or consistency . Their situation in the next Congress will not be unlike that which they faced in 1875 , after the political upheaval in the election of 1874 had made the House Democratic for the first time in eighteen years . But the Democrats of those days rose to the opportunity . They made Kerr Speaker and put S. J. Randall in charge of their plans for effecting economies . They felt that they were on trial . It was for them to prove to the nation that they had strong and safe men in whose hands the administration of public affairs could with confidence be placed . And the steadiness and sobriety shown by the Democratic House elected in 1874 helped the election of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availed of , or they may be stupidly wasted . Certain it is that if the Democratic majority in the next House does not put able and responsible men on duty , stand for economy , and work out constructive plans for legislation , the party will be exposed in 1912 to as severe a rebuke as if the elections of 1910 had never brought a triumph . It is , however , upon the State of New York that specific attention will be converged to see what use the victorious Democrats will make of their great opportunity . Of the purpose of Governor-elect Dix to give a clean and businesslike administration , there can be no doubt . He will surround himself with skilled and honorable advisers , and will , we are confident , make his chief appointments with an eye single to 9fficiency . But it is the choice of a Senator to succeed Depew which will most quickly and definitely mark the attitude of the New York Democracy towards forward-looking and high-minded policies in the nation , and upon that choice thought and effort should immediately be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platt and Depew has been one of the worst offences of the long Republican domination in this State . It will never do for Democrats who have cried out upon it not to exert their utmost power to complete the removal of that disgrace . It would be impossible to go lower than Depew , but the Democrats are bound to go much higher . If they were to make such a miserable failure now as they made after 1892 when they elected Edward Murphy Senator , despite the protest of President Cleveland , they would go far to destroy at once the respect of the people and their own hopes for the future . It is distinctly a time when a man should be selected of the very highest type . Several excellent names are already under discussion , though some of the men mentioned say that they can not be considered . We do not know that Mr. Shepard is or would be a candidate , but we do know that a man of his sort ought to be chosen . Ability for ability , Mr. Shepard 's could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature political convictions , his deep study of our political history , his readiness in debate and his value in counsel , together with his unblemished character , would make him a Senator whom New York would delight to honor . His personal wishes are unknown to us , but such a name as his should be kept to the front so that by discussion in the press and by individual urging the great duty of choosing a fit Senator should be held in the forefront . What the party has won by going to the polls with able and even eminent nominees , it can retain only by clinging to the same high standard in appointments to office and in elections by the Legislature . THE PENSION ROLL . The Pension Commissioner 's annual report , which has just made its appearance in full , is coincident with the publication in the World 's Work of a series of articles by William Bayard Hale on the " staining of the nation 's honor-roll with pretence and fraud " ? an exposure of some of the crimes against honest soldiers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But were this perennial uncovering of these abuses not going on , the report of the Commissioner would still deserve careful study , if only because of the demand for " dollar-a-day " pensions heard at the last encampment of the Grand Army , and the all-pervading public ignorance as to the size of the pension expenditures . Mr. Davenport , the Commissioner , records that forty-five years after Appomattox there are still 602,180 soldiers and sailors drawing pensions , in addition to 318,461 widows and dependents and 442 nurses , who together receive annually no less than $158,332 , - 391.82 ? a sum exceeded but three times in our pension history , and but four rail-lions less than last year 's expenditures . Although there was a decrease of 25,111 in the number of pensioners the slight net reduction in the expenditures is plainly disappointing , from the taxpayer 's point of view . The average annual pension is now $171.90 , against $138.18 in 1906 ; it increased only $2.08 above that of 1908-1909 , but that in- , crease added $1,915,852 64 to the total expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress , applications for larger pensions , and 3,015 special pensions granted by separate acts of Congress  --  the worst abuse of all . How the cost would jump if the 483,000 pensioners of the civil war were to receive a dollar a day , in place of $171.90 a year , any one can figure out for himself . But consideration for the Treasury never prevents the average Congressman from passing bill after bill to " correct the record " of deserters , bounty-jumpers , and cowards . It is the easiest way for a Representative to make friends in his district . What cares he as to the character of the men he places on the roll , so long as he may tell his constituents that he got Congress to agree to 250 or 300 or 600 private pension bills ? Mr. Hale has printed some splendid samples of these , among them a bill of Congressman Brownlow of Tennessee , enrolling Bradford Whaley as a private in the Eleventh Tennessee Cavalry , in which he never served , and then giving him a pension . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whaley a veteran of the Revolution . Yet 3,015 bills of this kind , though few so flagrant , were passed last year and approved by President Taft  --  resulting in an increased drain upon the taxpayers of no less than $894,495 and benefiting 6,063 persons . It is not , however , merely the growing size of the pension which is ominous . The number of widows of soldiers of the civil war increased by 9,045 , despite the ravages of death among the 211,781 who drew pay last year for their husbands ' services forty-five years ago . It will amaze most people to hear that there are already no less than 27,889 pensioners of our brief war with Spain and the Philippine insurrection . There were not 27,000 soldiers in the regular army early in 1908 , and , if we remember correctly , Gen. Shafter 's force at Santiago was not above 18,000 men . Yet within twelve years of that brief struggle there are on the rolls 22,783 invalid soldiers , 1,183 widows , and 330 minor children , 3,072 mothers of soldiers and 512 fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In such measure is the government paying for the fever camps and that one conflict which most civil war veterans would have regarded as but little more than a skirmish . Every war the country has been in is now represented on the pension roll , for there are still one " daughter of the Revolution " and 338 widows of the war of 1812 obtaining government aid ; while 2,042 survivors and 6,359 widows are accredited to the war with Mexico , which ended sixty-two years ago . If the same longevity prevails as in the case of the last survivor of the second war with England , we shall be paying Mexican war veterans up to 1941 and Spanish war veterans up to 1991 . Already the Spanish war veterans and dependents have received ' A 0,191,725.72 , or within fourteen millions of the Mexican war pensions and sixteen millions of the total amount paid out for the war of 1812 ; and there were 47,295 claims for pensions pending in June , 9,135 for service against Spain or the Filipinos . Now , if the money side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bad enough , particularly if we take into account the pensioning of fully 100,000 Confederate veterans by the Southern States at a cost of probably $4,500,000 to $5,000,000 . They have been well inoculated , too , with the pension virus , for Georgia in 1909 pensioned 3,492 veterans at a cost of $561,077 . But worse than the pecuniary aspect is the demoralizing effect of the system , which in the North , at least , discriminates not at all between good and bad , worthy and unworthy applicants , but gives above 900,000 people the idea that patriotism on the battlefield is cashable , and that it is the duty of the Treasury to hand out money , precisely as protectionists think the government owes it to them to guarantee the profits of their business . In the South the pension system menaces , as a writer in rite South Atlantic Quarterly points out , the proper educational and social progress of that section . In the North it is honeycombed with fraud , and offers such an inviting opportunity for a President who desires to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corruption , that it is hard to see how Mr. Taft can resist the temptation to overhaul the whole business . And what we miss in the Pension Commissioner 's report is an indication of a vigorous cleaning up of the pension-rolls . Only fifty-five frauds were punished last year ; but the country , as Mr. Hale shows , is full of them . NON-MANIFEST DESTINY . In the current number of the Popular Science Monthly there occurs the following quotation from the introductory statement preceding the list of courses in physics offered at one of our great universities in 1894 : While it is never safe to affirm that the future of physical science has no marvels in store . . . it seems probable that most of the grand underlying principles have been firmly established , and that further advances are to be sought chiefly in the rigorous application of these principles to all the phenomena which come under our notice . . . . An eminent scientist has remarked that the future truths of Physical science are to be looked for in the sixth place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the discovery of R ? ntgen rays , 1895 ; Becquerel rays , 1896 ; Zeeman effect . 1896 ; radium , 1893 ; atomic disintegration , the transformation of matter , the thermal effect of radio-activity , and intra-atomic energy , 1903 . I am unable to locate the sixth decimal idea in recent catalogues . " The suddenness of the change in the aspect of physical research which has taken place within the past two decades is a phenomenon of extraordinary interest ; but the reflections suggested by the contrast " above referred to are quite as pertinent in the domain of human affairs as in that of scientific investigation . We are all ready enough to admit in the abstract that it is the unexpected that happens , and that most long-range prophecies are vain ; but , strange to say , the specific application of this maxim to the questions that constitute at once the most difficult and the most vital problems of humanity is al : - most universally neglected . When it comes to the great currents of human history and opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly a protest by the minority , the people who try more or less vigorously to work against the current or who at least wish that it were other than it is Up to a certain time a movement may seem to be utopian or academic or eccentric ; but let it grow steadily for some years and attain a position of real power , and the time soon comes when the word is passed all along the line that its ultimate and complete triumph is a certainty . Opposition may continue , and perhaps the very people who admit the coming event may go on acting according to their principles ; nevertheless , the fact remains that the acceptance of the manifest destiny idea , in each such case , is a factor of great potency in sapping the vitality of the opposition . Take such a matter as Socialism . There are to-day millions of people whose attitude toward Socialism is profoundly influenced by the feeling that , however little they may like it , however undesirable in itself or ultimately impracticable in its working they may be convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day of individualism , they feel , is rapidly passing ; in a hundred ways they see the handwriting on the wall . It is only lack of imagination , they say to themselves , that prevents anybody from seeing what is so clearly patent ; a few more years and everybody will see it . But in reality it takes more imagination to realize the possibility of a change in existing tendencies than to realize what results those tendencies , if unchecked by new developments , will bring about . It was easy , for example , for anybody to see , only a few years ago , that China was on the eve of dissolution and partition among the European nations ; it was not easy to see that this destiny , so manifest in everything that had happened for half a century , was suddenly to be abrogated by the marvellous assertion of the potentialities of the Orient made by Japan in her war with Russia . And if it be said that this event was related merely to the special characteristics of particular nations or races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on forces imbedded in universal human nature , the answer is simple enough . In the sea of forces involved in the socialistic recasting of human life there are unsounded depths quite as far removed from our ken as were the factors which played a decisive part in the Russo-Japanese drama What is true of these largest questions is equally true in regard to political issues of lesser sweep . In our own country we have seen a great growth of the importance and the power of the Federal government . That this growth has been made necessary by modern economic developments  --  the new relations among all parts of the country created by modern methods of transportation and communication and the new problems arising out of the modern organization of industry and business  --  is very true . That the process will be and should be carried still farther in certain directions few reasonable persons will deny . But to drift from this conclusion , resting on reason and judgment , into an easy-going acceptance of State impotence and central omnipotence as the verdict of manifest destiny , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation in England , manifest destiny , as shown in the spread of protection on the Continent and in the alleged decay of England 's industrial power , was his strongest ally . Our own imperialist venture in the Philippines would never have been made were it not for the debilitating effect of the manifest destiny idea at a time of sudden excitement and military vainglory . But the truth is we know but one thing about destiny  --  that it is not manifest ; and we have but one duty concerning it  --  each in his degree to do what in him lies to shape destiny according to his conviction , not of what it will be , but of what it ought to be . INTELLECT AND SERVICE . In his remarkable " Statistical Study of American Men of Science , " Professor Cattell arrives at the conclusion that the number of our scientific men of importance has in recent years been increasing at only about half the rate of increase of the whole population , and that the production of scientific men of the highest order has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fact that in the complete list of men who , by the judgment of their peers , deserve to rank among the thousand leading men of science there are only six under thirty years of age , and none of these in conspicuously high rank . " This , " he says , " is significant and disquieting . A man of genius is likely to do his work at an early age and to receive prompt recognition . Kelvin was appointed full professor at Glas gow at twenty-two , Thomson at Cambridge at twenty-six , Rutherford at McGill at twenty-seven . Men of science of this age and rank simply do not exist in America at the present time ; nor is it likely that we are faring better in scholarship , in literature , and in art . " In the earlier days of the Republic , we used to explain any deficiency of our country in great intellectual fruits by pointing to the fact that we were engaged in " subduing a continent , " and that partly the material rewards and partly the inherent attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth away from intellectual pursuits . Later on , a factor different from this , though not unrelated to it , came into the forefront ? the enormous and dazzling prizes offered to successful endeavor in the fields of business enterprise , the overwhelming prominence given to the pursuit of wealth at a time when fortunes unheard of in former days gave a position of power and of popular eminence such as no other form of success seemed to offer . Add to this the rapid growth of luxury and the rise in the material standards of living , and you have a situation in which a life devoted to intellectual effort , with small material reward and with little stimulus from the interest and respect of the community at large , would not often present itself to a young man of talent , energy , and high spirit as the natural goal of ale ambition . Indeed , it might be said that the social atmosphere of America has constituted , in the case of our young men , an environment comparable  --  though , of course , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ages surrounded young women as regards their intellectual ambitions . It is not nearly so much the presence of absolute hindrances as it is the absence of encouragement ? and incentive , that accounts for that lack of intellectual achievement on the part of women which , until our own time , was ascribed almost universally to inherent incapacity . To this potent cause of deflection of young men of high intellectual endowment from fields of intellectual endeavor for which they are by nature and temperament peculiarly fitted , there must . in our judgment , be added another which seems destined to play a greater and greater part in producing this effect . We refer to that exaltation of " service " as the only worthy aim of an intellectual life which has , within the past dozen years , been coming more and more into fashion . It should hardly be necessary for the Nahum to protest that in entering an objection to this tendency it is not actuated by any deficiency in its admiration of the man who makes his scholarship an instrument of " service " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not object to praise of the scholar in politics or of the scholar in social betterment or in economic reform ; we object only to the preaching of a gospel which leaves all other scholars out in the cold . If , on the one hand , you offer all the shining outward rewards of effort to those who do not go into , intellectual pursuits at all , and , on the other-hand , you reserve ' all appreciation and praise for such intellectual achievements as bear directly on the improvement of political and social conditions , you can not expect the life of the scholar and thinker and writer in other domains to present to aspiring youth that fascination which is the greatest factor in determining the direction of his ambitions . In the speeches at the dinner given in New York in honor of the completion by Prof. E. R. A. Seligman of twenty-five years of admirable work as scholar , teacher , and citizen , it , was natural that stress should be laid on the connection between scholarship and service to the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to find . But nearly every speaker gave voice , either expressly or by impliCation , to the doctrine that only by such service can scholarship be truly justified ; and one can not help asking whether the president of Columbia University , for example , really thinks in his own heart that those who pursue studies and researches far removed from such service ? Greek , for example , or the more abstract departments of pure mathematics ? are mere drones , survivals of an outworn tradition that continues among us only on sufferance . We are perfectly aware that a tenuous justification might be made for these intellectual luxuries even from the " service " standpoint ; but turn and twist as you ' will , the kind of talk that we refer to is simply incompatible with the spirit of a whole-souled devotion to the things of the mind . And yet it is precisely that spirit  --  the spirit of Copernicus and Galileo and Newton and Darwin  --  that has not only illumined the world but has furnished one of the chief refuges from the deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all means , but preserve tor pure intellectual achievement its own place of distinction and regard . De the one , and applaud it , but leave not the other undone or unhonored.
