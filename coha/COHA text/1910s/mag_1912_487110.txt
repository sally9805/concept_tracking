Sin : Anybody who guesses on elections is subject to rude awakenings and unwelcome comment ; and I do not complain that the Nation entertains unfavorable views both of the result of the recent Presidential contest and of an analysis of those returns which I made in the New York Tames of November 10 In fact , ahem a kind but unknown friend sent me the clippings from your issue of November 14 , I was for a moment overwhelmed with a sense of the blunder that I must have made  --  so strong is still the terror of the Nation upon ordinary mortals . I was afraid that the umpire had at last caught me playing offside . It is therefore a cause both for astonishment and for relief to discover that the statements which you so derisively criticise are true , or as near true as was possible with the incomplete returns then available . The statement which you most contemn is ? " The scanty returns show Roosevelt votes in every Southern State , with a total of between 500,000 and 600,000 . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of that vote can not be had by the Republican party . " You seem to have difficulty in understanding what is meant by " the South " ; but I can not admit that your private definition of the South as " eleven , States " is binding , either on the geographer or on the analyzer of Presidential votes Two useful maxims of law are , that wards are to be taken in their ordinary sense ; and that a construction which reconciles two statements is to be taken in preference to a construction which makes one of them absurd One would think that a paragraph writer might discover from my totals that I was dealing with fifteen States instead of eleven . I will acknowledge one general statement which is not mistaken , but is really less favorable to my contention than my figures warranted The total Roosevelt votes in fifteen Southern States ( including West Virginia , but not Delaware ) was not " bctw een 500,000 and 600,000 , " but stood at 610,000 when my statement was made up That is a splendid start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions clear Southern votes ( in thousands ) deleted table You scoff at my statement that the " greater part of that vote can not be had by the Republican party . " Good heavens , if it could be had , why was it not had in the last election when it was so much desired ? Why did the Taft vote , which , in the fifteen Southern States , was 1,342,000 in 1908 , sink to 583,000 votes in 1912 ? What you call in Your editorial " so gross a blunder  --  due to no , arithmetical slip , " is an exact , truthful , and accurate statement , upon which the opponents of the Progressive party may dwell profitably . The Republican party lost 750,000 votes in the South from 1908 to 1912 The Progressives came up from nothing to 610,000 How many of that 610 , - 000 votes will ever be had by the Republican party ' , So , with reference to my statement that in Texas the Progressive " choice of delegates to Chicago corresponded to the strength of the Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Texas in the election of 1908 was 66,000 , in 1912 it was 36,000 , and the Roosevelt vote was 38,000 . Probably Roosevelt got some Democratic votes  --  on the other hand , some of the Taft votes of 1908 were not cast at all in 1912 . It is a valid inference that there were more Roosevelt voters behind the Roosevelt delegates and contestants than Taft voters behind the Taft delegates to Chicago from Texas last spring It is not so demonstrable , but it is a reasonable inference , that the Nation is so hurt and disappointed at the leap of the Progressive party to the second place , pre-sag-mg the downfall of the Republican party , that it can no longer see straight or write straight I am perfectly familiar with your ' little- habit - of tying a can of nitroglycerine to the end of letters of protest such as this , And have no doubt that you will find new grounds for posting the writer as a fool ; but I cheerfully leave it to the umpire  --  that is , to the reading public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this controversy . ALBERT BUSHNELL HART . Cambridge , November 26 The passage referring to the Southern vote , in Professor Hart 's letter to the Tames , was as follows ' Up to last June the Republican organisation still had the opportunity to appear a second time as the protagonist of great moral ideas , to appeal to the justice of the nation , to rouse the young voter . It could have succeeded in 1912 on that basis , but it could not succeed indefinitely because the name Republican repels the voters in the South who would otherwise act with Northern brethren . The scanty returns show Roosevelt votes in every Southern State , with a total of between 500,000 and 600,000 That is a splendid , start in the South , but the greater part of that vote can not be had by the Republican party . It seemed plain that the Southern States here intended were that group of States , south of the border States and usually referred to as the Solid South , in which the Republican party has hitherto been a hopeless minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the 500,000 or 600,000 Roosevelt votes represented something new and peculiar in the region referred to  --  votes which had previously been unattainable by the Republican party . Kentucky , Maryland , Missouri , and West Virginia , which it now appears that Professor Hart meant to include , are of a wholly different character from the eleven States of the Solid South . In each one of these four States , the vote has for many years been pretty evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats . Kentucky went Republican in the Presidential election of 1896 , Maryland in 1896 and 1900 , Missouri in 1904 and 1908 , - and West Virginia was carried by the Republicans in the four consecutive Presidential elections of 1896 , 1900 , 1904 , and 1908 . And neither in these four States , nor in the other eleven , was a " splendid start " made by Roosevelt in any other sense than that in which he made a splendid start in all the other sections of the country  --  z. , e. , the division of the Republican vote . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or . the fifteen States , we find the sum of the Taft and Roosevelt votes in 1912 materially less than the Taft vote in 1908 . ? ED . NATION . VERSE TRANSLATIONS IN THE LOEB CLASSICS . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR . I should like - to add my emphatic protest to that of your correspondent against the use of verse translations in the Loeb edition of classical writers . That edition will be used , I suppose , mainly by general readers like myself , who make no pretension to classical scholarship , but have endeavored to keep up their acquaintance with the original text of the Greek and Latin writers , believing that few things in life are better worth while Such readers wish to avoid the drudgery of a lexicon , not only because it is drudgery , but because it tends to destroy the current of pleasure which comes from the swift following of the text itself . All that is required is to be able to turn from a difficult passage and by a momentary glance to catch the word or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely , as I understand it , that the Loeb editions are issued , and for this purpose a verse translation , that is , one which necessarily distorts the literal meaning to an extreme degree , is most unsatisfactory The barest , baldest prose , clinging close to the word-for-word sense , is- far more useful Indeed , any attempt at independent effects of style is objectionable , as distracting the attention unduly from the sole point of real interest , the original . I sincerely trust that in dealing with Sophocles , .4zEschylus , and Pindar the verse method will be abandoned GAMALIEL BRADFORD , JR Wellesley Hulls , Mass , November 23 . TO THE EDITOR OP THE NATION . SIR . In comment on the letter of Elizabeth Knights Tompkins anent the Loeb Library , will it be of interest to record the impression of one who , having read his Greek authors for twenty-five years in the original , feels justified in saying that he does not need the translation ? His regret is that so fine a work as Lang , Leaf and Myer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keen pleasure in reading Mrs Drowning 's versified renderings of the choral odes of the " Prometheus " ; Pollard 's " Odes from the Greek Dramatists " is a source of constant joy to him ; and he has found , in his classroom , that the translation in verse invariably carries the day with an average class of American young men and women . So that he for one hopes for more verse translations in the Loeb Library It seems a pity indeed that in translating the works of the Greek genius , one of its most essential qualities , that of plastic form , should be omitted . CHARLES ST . CLAIR WADE . Tufts- College , November 22 ART IN EDUCATION . TO THE EDITOR OP THE NATION . SIR Your notice ( November 21 ) of the pamphlet published by the Princeton University Press on " The Study of the History of Art in the Colleges and Universities of the United States " calls attention to the fact that less than one-quarter of our colleges give courses in the history of art , while barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great as is the improvement shown even by this state of affairs over that which existed ten years ago , the fact remains that the history of art is a subject regarded as unimportant in the academic world of the United States , ) This is a comment on American college and university ideals of culture not pleasant to face One wonders what the reason may be . Is it that three-quarters of our colleges lave presidents and faculties , regents and trustees , so obsessed with the notion of advancing only those subjects which lead - to what may be called profitable utilities that they have lost faith , if they ever had it , in culture as an end in itself , not to say a vital power in society ? In this opening of the twentieth century , when our institutions of higher education are giving their strength and resources so undividedly to the making of chemists , botanists , zoologists , school teachers , journalists , and cooks , the fruits of sc:ence and Pedagogy , there is of course little room left in the curriculum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating subjects which relate to " the mysterious forces of the spirit " ? art , music , poetry The answer to this difficulty is easy Start with a good man , and give him what you can for equipment If he is a really good man , he can instruct and delight his students , broadening their intellectual and ms-thetas horizons , quite apart from any great collection of photographs , lantern-slides , and casts Nothing is more dangerous than too much equipment , since the history of art courses may easily become picture-gazing " snaps " for the student , and lecturing " snaps " for the professor , everything being called into service but brains . The point is that a small equipment need not cost much , and that a small equipment is plenty to start with . Because we may not be able to command a library of one hundred thousand volumes , it by no means follows that we can not learn much from one hundred . It is so with the possible equipment of courses in the history of art Surely it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred Afnerican colleges from giving such courses No man ever did so much in this country to vitalize and keep alive an interest in the history and meaning of art as Professor Norton , and it is doubtful if any man ever had a smaller equipment than he for years and years ALFRED M BROOKS University of Indiana .
