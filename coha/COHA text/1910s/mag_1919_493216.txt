Our Share in Drugging China 0 F the millions who associate opium and China probably only few know , beyond a vague impression of England 's part in an " Opium War , " that from the very beginning , the responsibility for the introduction and spread of the use of narcotics lies with foreign nations . Few know how repeated and consistent have been the struggles of responsible Chinese authorities to prevent the importation of the drug , nor the obstacles that officials of other nations have thrown in their way . Even when poppy growing became general throughout the Empire ( and there is no denying that it did ) , fairness compels the acknowledgment that the Chinese had reached the conclusion that since it was impossible to prevent the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a share in the profits themselves . In 1906 began the last great campaign against the growing of poppies and for the total eradication of the drug habit , cooperation of Great Britain regarding the importation of opium from India being secured . Even the foreigners who are most pessimistic regarding the capacity of the Chinese to carry through any general reform make an exception of the anti-opium fight . The vigor with which it was conducted wasequalled by the ingenuity and skill with which offenders were detected and dealt with . What accomplished in five years speaks wonders fo1 to capacity of Chinese administration when it isle earnest , and for the adaptability of the ChiaeBe people . There are few instances in history whe n such a sweeping reform was carried through 9 ' rapidly and thoroughly . Belatedly and under the pressure of critic 's and in opposition to the protest of business ay.c 0 , " sentimentalism , " other countries agreed to oo operate with China .

And the use of these forms of " dope " is spreading so fast that they are likely to outdo the ravages , of opium at its worst . Opium smoking is expensive . It is an indulgence now confined to the wealthy . The use of the syringe is as cheap as that of the pipe is dear . Injections can be had for three coppers a " shot " and the profit to the dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opium-smoking was an aristocratic vice ; the needle reaches the coolies . It was not difficult to discover the opium-users . The dweller in any large city of the United States does not need to be told how difficult it is to detect the seller of forms of modern dope . Ingenuity when Profits are at stake is not less in China than in America . On every hand one hears of the tricks employed in smuggling and distributing morphia and heroin . The sale is made easier because the Chinese are great takers of medicines , and the licensed practitioner in our sense hardly exists . opium derivates are sold in all kinds of pills , and itinerant pedlars introduce pills and injections without the ignorant victim knowing what he is getting until after the habit is well fixed . And the weight of evidence is that the effects of morphia , cocaine and heroin are more completely demoralizing to the body , mind and character of the average dope user than were those of opium-smoking . Add the comparative minuteness of the dose for injections ,  --  single case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over twelve million " shots "  - -  and it is easy to see that the new menace ' s worse than the old . , Since , however , the drugs now reach China only by the medium of smugglers , it might be thought that there is no longer national responsibility for r ? reing this evil on China ? that it is now simply a ! natter of the individual wickedness of the smuggler and dealer . Unfortunately for the good repute of the western nations , such is not the case . rutting it mildly , carelessness and neglect in draw- g and enforcing regulations regarding manufac- tilure , transportation and exportation of opium pro- duets are such as to make the nations accomplices in guilt . In 1912 an international convention for- ha , ce the further exportation of morphia into c ruina . Before this time the exportation from iZe.at Britain into Japan was 30,000 ounces a year . This was a large enough amount in all conscience , acr. the most of it undoubtedly found its way to 601na . By 1917 it had jumped twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty tons got from Scotland Japan in four years , these figures being official e rtisto statistics . It does not have to be pointed , ? ? 11t that both the British and the Japanese govern- lee , nts knew that this amount was infinitely above gLtinlate needs-6r that its destination was China , REPUBLIC to which country exportation was nominally prohibited . But division of moral responsibility was at work . The British were far from the retail trade and the ultimate consumer . Their profits were in Indian revenue where the opium was raised , in Edinburgh the manufacturing centre , and in the shipping trade . The Japanese did not have ( at that time ) the responsibility for producing and exporting ; they merely served as intermediaries . It is easy in such circumstances to pass on blame , and difficult to make an effective appeal to conscience . Only international cooperation would work . The Hague passed excellent resolutions ? and Great Britain , the offender at the source , declared that she would put them into force when every other nation did . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British government was sufficiently strong , so that regulations were put into effect by which opium derivatives could be shipped into Japan and its leased territory in Manchuria ( the latter being one of the chief centres whence morphia reached the Chinese ) only when licenses were given to the exporter . And these licenses were to be given only after receipt of a certificate from Japanese officials that the morphia was for medical use only , and was destined for consumption in Japan itself or its leased territory . The latter proviso ' made Japan an underwriter that the goods should not reach China . The next year there was a great falling off . Still in view of the fact that Japan was by this , manufacturing more than enough to supply , its own medical needs , it is disconcerting to find that one hundred and fifty thousand ounces were imported into Japan . The fact argues an easy conscience somewhere . But this statement does not cover the ground . In the first place , Great Britain exacts no such license for exportation by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry stuff for a hundred thousand injections . British subjects in China accuse their home government of wilful omission and evasion . In the next place , the British authorities in both Hong Kong and Singapore farm out the opium product business , receiving in each place two millions of revenue annually for the concession . Now there are well established facts proving that the concessionaire can make his business pay only by getting contraband into China proper , it is obvious that no one would pay two millions a year for the privilege of making opium to he sold only in the city of Hong Kong . So many facilities are given to the concessionaire for smuggling into China that there are those who say that the British licensing regulations for the Japanese trade were adopted not for moral reasons but to protect the " opium farmers " who were having difficulty in meeting Japanese competition in contraband and who appealed to the British Government for protection in their rights . So much for Great Britain 's share . As to Japan . Leaving out of the question the neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charges that advantage was taken of the lessened British trade to encourage poppy growing in Japan and Korea , there is the fact that for Japanese territory on Chinese soil , namely in the leased territory of " Darien and vicinity " and in Tsingtao , licenses are issued by minor officials and irresponsible officials . In a single year there were imported " for medical use only " in " Darien and vicinity " sixty-six thousand ounces of morphia . The figures are conclusive that the Japanese administration was an accomplice to making its Manchurian territory a point of departure for sending contraband into China . In general Japanese control of the retail and distributing trade has of late years become so complete that they have gradually come to be regarded as the chief if not the only sinners . One cause of present anti-Japanese feeling is found in the fact that Shantung has now become a centre for distributing dope . Now enters the American participation in the crime of poisoning China . The British require no license for exportation to the United States . Our laws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports it is only necessary to put the goods into bond for transhipment to avoid payment of duty . And while the morphia could not be directly exported under our own laws into China , our laws regarding transhipment make no inquiry into the nature of the goods . They need only be described in a general way . All the morphia now manufactured in Scotland could readily pass through the United States into Japan thence to reach China illicitly if labelled " pharmaceutical products . " Remember they could not go direct to Japan from Great Britain . If this is allowed to continue after the attention of our custom officials and of Congress has been called to it , we share with Great Britain and Japan the burden of sinning against China . But not all our guilt is indirect . The morphia seized in the recent smuggling case in Shanghai was all manufactured in Philadelphia ? a fact verified in open court by a lawyer of the International Anti-Opium Association . It would be a criminal offense to ship this direct to China . But there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two channels of British goods in bond and our own products has reached vast proportions already . The official statistics show that for the first five months of the current year , twenty-five thousand ounces of morphia reached the port of Kobe from American ports . But the Japan Chronicle , published in Kobe , is responsible for the statement that the manifestos of ships arriving in robe during the same period show about ninety thousand more ounces not appearing in the custom house returns . The conclusion is certain . This amount was transhipped in Kobe harbor to be smuggled into China . That this shows gross connivance on the part of Kobe port officials may be argued . But the primary responsibility is with the laws and administration of the United States . We have become a large partner in the contemptible business of drugging China at the time when China is making heroic efforts to emancipate herself from the narcotic evil . Our holier than thou attitude towards Great Britain and Japan must be abandoned . We have as yet no vested industrial and commercial interest possessing great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the evils of the traffic and a slight amount of energy to frame laws and administrative regulations that will compel adequate registration of all opium products reaching American ports , and make it a criminal offense to transport such goods for re-export . We can easily take steps that will make it impossible for morphia and heroin of American production to be exported to Japan thence to reach China . We can see to it ( as we do not do at the present ) that our post-office at Shanghai can not be employed for sending narcotics into China by parcel-post , thus making ourselves criminal accomplices in the breaking of Chinese laws and the poisoning of the Chinese people . The International Anti-Opium Society has worked out plans which if adopted would effectually cog " trol the whole nefarious traffic not only for Chins but for the world . These plans start from the fact that control from the side of retail distribution and the ultimate consumer are so difficult as to be almost hopeless . But control at the source is simple . The growth of poppies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain of raw opium that leaves them be accounted for and traced . It is possible to determine the amount of narcotics that is required for legitimate medical use . The manuf3e " tore of this necessary amount should be put under government licensing and constant inspection . Then by serial numbering of uniform packages and rec " ords of sale all distribution could be traced . No opium products are to be shipped anywhere to the Far East except upon receipt of a requisition fr ? 51 , the importing country certifying to the intended " , use , and upon prior notification to that country 01 the nature and date of the shipment meeting the order . Our own interest is not a purely altruistic one ' nor is it confined to doing our obvious duty by China . We have the drug evil with us , and its growth in our country is one of the most disconcerting of present events . We can not insure ourselves against this evil till we take the measures that will guarantee China against it . The laws and regulations for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale merchandizing that are needed to protect China from our partnership in the crime of undermining , her life are the exact means of safeguarding our own health and morals . Until we have cleaned our own house we can not take the part that we should take in urging upon other nations , especially Great Britain and Japan , effective international action . The Paris Conference promised China that the League of Nations would take up the opium and morphia traffic . Shall the United States continue its partnership in crime until forced by outside action to abandon it ? Shall it enter the deliberations of the League of Nations Assembly with unclean hands ? JOHN DEWEY . Peking , October 6th . Letters from a Miner 's Wife October 29 , 1919 . DEAR SIS : ? Just received your letter . Well , people here talk awful of the President . They say now la the time he can show his true colors . Some think we Will be off a long time and others say a week . Of course , You ca n't tell . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as always just before a strike . Said they did n't have the time . The men said , " ' Well , we have n't the time to load railroad ears then . " So they had to let us have it , as much as we could pay for . We got about seven tons . , No , the majority of miners have absolutely nothing ? ; ust depending on the storekeepers to carry them . We Kaye a good deal of fruit and beans and a barrel of flour and four hogs , so we can live a little while , I guess . Yes , we get the Mine Workers ' Journal . Is n't Lewis a man ? Everyone is crazy about him . Yes , the mines are working good now ? just before strike , You know . augh Willis made a speech here last night . He told the men to sit still and hold their hands , there was seven 4 ; iiillion dollars for them and to use no violence . It seems all We think of is coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got no clothes and never have far that matter , tho . Agnes S Jule is sitting here trying to eat your letter up h 1,37 is making airships of it . You should hear him call er Agnes Jule . She is growing so fast and her hair did n't t ale out and is as black as coal . Mrs. Jones declared she io ? Iced just like you . to Well , the weather is fine , lots of rain , we still got : aatoes and beans out of our garden , so you know the weather has n't been very cold here yet . Yes 1 , the men know all about the agreement . Well , it 0 alcs to me as tho the men would wake up to the fact that in order to live a miner should have his own store . Each local should have its own store instead of trading with /Ili lazy merchants . Make them go to work ? to my Ila , c1 that is the only way for a miner to live . Like a tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it upon himself to see how the miners live and if they needed a raise and he went back to report and said , " Why , the miners do n't need a raise . Some of them own their own homes and some of them even have their toilets in their houses . " They told that at the local meeting and one fellow got up and said , " Yes , that is our big men that we pay and that 's why we need a raise , to keep them up in style . " 0 , well , you know they ca n't make a miner work and no one could take their places and the operators are up against it this time for they will have to yield . Lewis said there was one way for this strike to be averted and that was for them to come across . They 've sure been making the money out of us . We do the work and they get the money , that is , the most of it . They only run the mines so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we eat up what we 've made the days we work . They never give us a chance to get ahead . I guess it does cost to live . Our store bill runs $50 and $60 a day ? how 's that for two weeks , and that 's not feeding six children any too much either . The police in Boston are sure having a time , are n't they ? Well , I guess we will all live till we die anyhow . Mary says tell you she would welcome any kind of a dress now as she sure does need it . When do you think you can come home ? The railroads talk of coming out with the miners . The men are making pretty good money now , you know how it is just before a strike , they run the mines full time so they can stock up with coal and hold out all the longer against us . Of course , that lets us , make a little more , but what does it amount to , paying twice as much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it did n't amount to much in a family of eight . Raising wages do n't seem to do any good the way the cost of living goes up , but then it would go up anyway and it seems all we can do is to try to keep up with it , tho we never can . If we only had steady work we might have a chance to live , but this thing of working four days this week , two the next and three the next and then weeks of no work ? well , we just ca n't live , that 's all .
