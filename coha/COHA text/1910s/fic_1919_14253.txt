SCENE : A gaudily furnished room in a New York apartment house . One enters the hall through a door upstage left . Below the door a davenport ; in back of the davenport a small table holding a lamp . At the back , to the right , a row of windows and a window-box of cyclamen . A door , leading to Riccardo 's study , left back . Between this door and the windows a Victrola . Upstage left , a third door . Madame 's grand piano is at the left of the room , so placed that the key-board can not be seen by the audience . A small , low table in the centre of the room , and a console table downstage left . A chair to the right of the centre table , one near the windows , and a third in the curve of the piano . Photographs of musical celebrities adorn the walls . Bric-a-brac wherever there is room for it . ( When the curtain rises , Honore , wearing a very elaborate negligee , is seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished looking American of about thirty-five years of age . Her low eye-brows give her face a frowning expression , and she appears to be cold and austere . But she possesses a great deal of magnetism . In an adjoining room , Riccardo is singing the Addio alla madre from Cavalleria Rusticana . Honore is quite in-different to his singing . She has finished her breakfast and is dreamily smoking a long Russian cigarette . A heap of letters lie on the table beside the tray . Almost immediately her maid , Clara , bursts into the room . She carries a newspaper . ) CLARA excitedlyOh , Madame , did you see what the paper says of Signor ? p. 3 HONORE suddenly very alertQuick ! The review of my recital . CLARA I have n't seen it yet . HONORE Beast ! CLARA reading " Signor Bommarito was superb . For once we saw a Cavaradossi for whom Tosca might truly have committed murder . And he sang  --  " HONORE Stop ! Find my notice . Snatches the paper from Clara . CLARA thrilledLike a god ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  HONORE I ca n't find my criticism . CLARA Shall I ? Honore throws the paper at Clara ; paces back and forth . HONORE Quick ! Or I 'll die of heart-failure . CLARA I find nothing , Madame . HONORE You dare to say that the great Lazenby played last night and the filthy paper does n't give her a column ? L ' me noire . CLARA The war , Madame , takes so much space . HONORE The war ? What is the war ? Lazenby played last night and there is no notice . Turns and faces door leading to room in which Riccardo is singingStop it , stop it ! p. 4 CLARA Ah , here it is . HONORE turningTrickster . You would have me die . SitsWell read , why do n't you read ? CLARA reading " Honore Lazenby-Bommarito , wife of Riccardo Bommarito  --  " HONORE explodesOh ! It writes of me so ? Huh ! They mean Riccardo is the husband of Honore Lazenby . CLARA But that 's the same thing , Madame . HONORE It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it should have been . " HONORE Oh ! How dare he notice that ? If he did how dare he print it ? CLARA Shall I read any more ? HONORE Of course , you fool . CLARA reading " Honore Lazenby-Bom  --  Bom  --  ahem  --  gave one of her charming piano recitals in Carnegie Hall last evening . " HONORE " Charming . " Too mild a word . " Epoch-making " were better . CLARA reading " Her program included compositions by Schoenberg , Stravinsky , Ornstein , Debussy  --  " p. 5 HONORE I know what I played ,  --  only the moderns . Read on . CLARA But that 's all there is . HONORE I 'll slap you . CLARA drawing backIt 's true . HONORE rises with queenly dignityWhat ? CLARA It does not tell how you played ; only what you played . Furiously Honore grabs the paper and reads . Riccardo begins the Siciliana . Clara is immediately enraptured . HONORE How dare you bring this paper into the house ? Looks up ; notices Clara 's expression . CLARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sh " me ? With an exclamation , Honore crumples the paper and flings it across the room , rushes to the piano and wildly pounds out Paderewski 's Polonaise Militaire , almost drowning Riccardo 's voice . Clara covers her ears with her hands . Truly the duet is most unplesant . Honore listens with one ear , expecting that Riccardo will stop immediately . But he sings on . Clara is ready to weep ; she picks up the paper and smoothes it . Failing to stop Riccardo , Honore rises . She 's even more angry than when she sat down. p. 6 HONORE What are you doing with that paper , bte noire ? CLARA timidly I thought Signor would like to see it . HONORE Mon Dieu ! Signor ! Signor ! Always Signor . No one thinks of me . She appears to be about to weep . CLARA puts paper on tableShall I get the rest of the morning papers ? HONORE now far from tearsI would n't look at another for Paderewski 's scalp . Honore goes to the Victrola , finds a record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's singing of the Siciliana . Like a round is the duet by Caruso and Riccardo . Clara is aghast when she realizes what Honore has done ; she picks up the breakfast tray and flees . Honore takes the letters , sits , and feigns to read . But she is listening intently , expecting Riccardo to stop singing immediately . She has n't long to wait . He enters , from the back , in a terrible rage ; rushes to the Victrola and stops it . He is a tall , beautifully built animal in his early thirties , with little strength or intelligence showing in his face . RICCARDO You  --  you  --  pauses , catches his breath  --  you ' ave insult me ! Pretending to pay no heed to him , Honore hums the Siciliana. p. 7 RICCARDO You play det box ven I re'earse . HONORE Just a little coaching from a real tenor . RICCARDO Real tenor ! Laughs artificiallyDio mio ! TragicallyYou are my vife an ' you treat me so .

Vat else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at another paperGlorious . They say of me what Scudo said of Thalberg : " Her scales were like perfectly strung pearls falling on scarlet velvet . " Overjoyed , Honore tosses the paper into the air , moves to the piano and plays Rachmaninoff 's Prelude in G minor . As she plays " When Bommarito sings the critics have n't time to go to Madama Lazenby 's recital . " So ? " The greatest woman pianist . " " Like pearls falling on scarlet velvet .
