txt The Marquis of Lansdowne and Andrew Sonar Law , both of whom now occupy seats in the coalition ministry , explained to their followers at a meeting of the Unionist members of both houses of Parliament , held at the Carlton Club today , the reasons why they decided to join the coalition Government . Mr. Bonar Law read a letter from the Prime Minister , in which the Premier suggested- a coalition , saying : " After long and careful consideration I have definitely come to the conclusion that the conduct of the war to a. successful and decisive issue can not be effectively carried on except by a Cabinet which represents all the parties in the State . I need not enter into reasons sufficiently obvious which point , - to. - : . this as the best-solution , teMts of the country of thepro'blem 's which the war now presents : nor does the recognition of its necessity involve any disparagiment on my part of the splendid service which in their several spheres my colleagues have rendered to the Empire . " In this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands , and I am therefore in a position to invite you and those who are associated with you to join forces with us in a combined administration , in which I should also ask the leaders of the Irish and Labor Parties to participate , whose common action , without prejudice to the future prosecution of our various divergent political purposes , should he exclusively directed to the issues of the war . " Lansdowne Waives Objections . i ord Lansdowne . in opening the meeting . said that ordinarily lie disliked coalition Governments , but tile conditions at present were extraordinary . " The country . " he said , " is making the most stupendous effort it has ever been called upon to make . We do not even yet know what dimensions the effort may prove to be . New theatres of war unfold themselves before us : new developments , some of them of the most sinister and horrible kind , are taking place day by day , and we must all of us be convinced that at such a moment nothing but a supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to meet the difficulties and th- ; opposition in front of us . " The country , continued Lord Lansdowne . had already experienced not a few disappointments . There had been shortcomings , miscalculations ? some probably excusable , some of them perhaps not . There had been something amiss with the national organization of the country . " We are not sure , " said he , " that we are getting enough men , or if we are getting the right men . As to munitions . I will not dwell on that painful chapter . But it is a matter of common knowledge that the failure in the supply of essential munitions , not once , but many times , has interfered with the due progress of the military operations . If this , or half of this is true , it means that the staying power of the country is going to be taxed as it never was taxed before , and if we arc going to pull through it must not he by the efforts of one party or another party . but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Responsibility . Lord Lansdowne explained that the Unionist leaders considered that a general election would have been a national disaster of the first magnitude , and , although their unofficial advice had been accepted by the Government , thus throwing some of the responsibility on them , they felt that their share of the responsibility should be full and complete . Andrew Bonar Law said that just as the Unionists had decided that there must be a change , he had received a letter from the Prime Minister , suggesting coalition , and had immediately replied acepting the invitation . He expressed regret that John Redmond had not joined the Government . which , if it was to succeed , must be a national government in reality as well as in name . The only chance of success was that every member should act as a loyal colleague and without any idea that that result was to be got by a compromise on any question  --  Home Rule , the Welsh Church , or anything else which they regarded as vital . They must put aside everything until the war was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to deal with . The meeting adjourned without the adoption of any formal resolutions .
