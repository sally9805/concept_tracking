txt MRS . JAY QUITS . Announces She Will Lead No More Uprisings Against German Art . To the Editor of The New York Times : Peace has come at last ! Germany is on her knees before outraged but forgiving humanity . Since our entry into the world war I have stood firmly and consistently against the performances of German opera , German plays , and German music . The committee and league which I founded uncovered ample evidence that German propaganda lurked in these apparently harmless entertainments , while victory was in the laps . of the gods and a " soft " peace was a remote and unfair possibility . . Now all is changed . No further protests against the German productions , whenever and wherever given in the United States , will come from me , for I know that henceforth : materialism will weigh too heavily against a pro-German attitude , and I pray that the former friends of German Kultur will uphold the principles of freedom , honesty , and justice , which they now see triumphant and everlasting .

To the Editor of The New York Times : In the issue of Tug TIMES of the 27th there was , published an item from Paris about the gold seal ring the President used for his seal in signing the peace document . As It was incorrect , may I venture to give you the truth about it ? In October , 1915 , the President of the exposition , ( Mr. Moore , ) at San Francisco , sent me on to the President as the representative of the Board of Directors with an invitation to him to visit the exposition . I brought with me three young ladies representing a petition , ( a monster , ) of the school children of California . One of the young ladies was Dorothy Starr . Hof father was the manager of the Empire Mine in Grass Valley , Nevada County , California . He met us at Colfax en route with the most exquisite specimen of gold ever taken from the minO to present to the President for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourn , principally , and is the oldest mine in California . So it was not the State of California that presented the gold to President Wilson . I wee chosen to bring the invitation because I was a member of the Woman 's Board of the Exposition . GEORGIANA STONEY . New York , Juno 29 , 1919 . His Occupation Gone . To the Editor of The New York Times : Born in Trieste , when that city was under Austrian rule . I suffered unjust prison sentences because of my feeling toward that Government . The blessed country of America offered justice and liberty , and I decided to make the United States my home . Since arriving here thirty-four years ago I have been making a good living as a wine salesman until yesterday . I have been honored to be a citizen of this country for twenty-seven years , and during all the Liberty Loan drives was enlisted with the " Four Minute Men , " and endeavored to work for the best possible interest of the Government . In return for loyal services , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to Trieste , which is now under the just government of Italy . America Is mocking the symbolic Statue of Liberty . It would be better to return the glorious statue to France , which has always championed its principle . GUSTAVO TOLENTINO . New York . July 2 , 1019 . Vermont 's Admirals . To the Editor of The New York Times : I read with much interest an editorial article In a recent issue of Tun TIMES which called attention to the remarkable record of Vermont in furnishing Admirals to the United States Navy . In connection with the conferring of the degree of Doctor of Laws upon Admiral Mayo by the University of Vermont , It was stated that such a degree had not been conferred upon Admiral Dewey . This is not correct , as on the occasion of Admiral Dewey 's visit to his native State in October , 1899 , following his return from the Philippines , the University of Vermont conferred upon him tile degree of Doctor of Laws , although the ceremony did not occur at the regular commencement season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vermont , Burlington , July 1 , 1919 . The New York Times in Europe . To the Editor of 771e New York Times : Since my return from Europe a few weeks ago It has been my aim to congratulate the editorial management of Tim New Y011 TimES for its worldwide news efficiency . As one of your constant readers and advertising patron-5 , I feel privileged to express my appreciation of the high position held by TUE TIMES in European countries . Your editorials and special news exploits are quoted by foreign editors more extensively than those of any other American newspaper . My work among newspaper men irr England and France afforded me an opportunity to gain this information , which might not be news to you . I also learned that Tug NEW YORK TIMES 13 held in high esteem by leaders of tile industrial and political world . A member of Parliament who had once paid a lengthy visit to the United States told me that he reads TILE NEW YORK Timm regularly , so as to keep in close touch with everything American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
