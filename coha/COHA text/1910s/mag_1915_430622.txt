THE memory of its winding streets , its ancient houses . gabled , arcaded , mottoed , had lingered with us since opportunity , one long-ago winter day , gave us two or three unexpected hours in the quiet city . We had thought it charming , even in its snow-mantle ; unpretentious yet unmistakably prosperous ; gravely contented and dignified ; self-absorbed , yet not self-conscious ; and we had always meant to see it again , and more thoroughly . When , then , an ankle painfully twisted upon a steep Malines stairway made our projected walking tour in the Harz Mountains very dubious , Munster appealed at once as a convenient and alluring half-way house in which to rest . It is an eight-hour railway journey from Malines to Munster , with two customs-houses to pass en route . It must be stated promptly that neither Dutch nor German inspectors made any trouble for us. and the scenes in the examining rooms were rather entertaining than tiresome ; but after one " passes customs " four or five times within a week , the funniest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rides is entertaining , but not striking . Much of it is rich farm land , and farm land in June is lovely , wherever one may be ; and we had seen this particular stretch of the Netherlands many times before . There was no novelty , which justifies our being very tired when we drove through Munster in the dusk one Saturday evening . MERRY-MAKING IN MUNSTER . June dusk in northern Germany , where the space between twilight and dawn is in summer so brief , means bedtime for early risers , and we were thinking drowsily of a dark , quiet room when our carriage turned into the Prinzipal Markt and stopped in a blaze of light . Munster was celebrating Jahrmarkt ( annual market or fair ) ? the German version of the Dutch Kermis ? and although the trinket booths and " shows " were clustered in the Dom Platz , the crowd of merrymakers , furnished with noise-producing implements , overflowed into all the adjacent streets . We had no reason to be ruffled . We had chosen that hotel for its situation upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our windows , we could lazily watch the ebb and flow of the town 's life here at its heart . If the town chose to be especially lively during our stay , we should have been all the more  | grateful ; but I am not sure that we were . Did we think longingly of the quiet , luxurious caravansary at the station ? Perhaps so . One always has to choose , in the smaller European towns at least , between the luxuries of the " best " hotel , with remoteness from the Sehens.ciirdigheiteu ( objects of interest ) , and the quaintness in situation or structure of its older inns , with a walk to the station . NEW HOTELS AND OLD ONES Of course , there are usually omnibusses , carriages , even occasionally motor-busses and taxicabs , to bridge the distances . The newest and finest hotels are usually built close to the station , upon that ring promenade , very likely , where once was the city 's wall and beyond which the railroads never intrude : but the older inns cluster in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient palaces , oftener yet the town 's ancient hospice , entertaining travelers since the days of pilgrimage and crusade . While less luxurious than the newer houses , they are in themselves vastly more interesting , while their windows , small though they may be , look down upon livelier scenes than even the path to a railway station may offer . o elemental quaintness nor fragrant history lingers , however , about this particular hostelry upon Munster 's Markt neither does it house any of the discomforts of primitive times or inns . Less picturesque than many an other , it compensates with great comfort , and perhaps that noisy evening we were more pleased to observe its thoroughly modern furnishings than disappointed in its lack of " medieval atmosphere . " So comfortable were we that , in spite of noise from steam-piano , carrousel , horn , whistle , and drum : in spite of the glare of thousands of lights just beyond our broad windows , we soon fell asleep . STREET-CLEANING DONE PROMPTLY Sunday morning dawned with wet streets and threatening skies . We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent street . Had we dreamt all the noise and gaiety of the night ? The pavements , shining with wet reflections , were clean ; no trace of litter , no peanut shells , no fruit rinds , no tattered ribbons or crushed flowers , such as usually remain for hours upon home streets after an outdoor festival , were anywhere visible . Either Munster does its streetcleaning promptly or keeps its streets clean . The Prinzipal Markt , upon which our windows opened , is not , as its name suggests , a great open square , but an arcaded street , one link in a chain of curving streets and markets , which incloses the cathedral , the university , and other ancient buildings . To the right we see the tall , delicate tower of the Lamberti Kirche thrust forward where the Roggenmarkt turns out of sight behind the tall gables . To the left , beyond the jutting balcony of the ancient weigh-house , the Rotenburg curves from view ? a jumble of steep gray gables and scarlet roofs . We can not decide which way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very quiet . A few early church-goers hurry under cover of the arcades to the cathedral or to St. Lamberts . A little girl trips by , in her arms a loaf of bread almost as long as herself . A small detachment of soldiers go down the center of the street with long , quick strides , turn a corner , and are gone . In the middle of the open space before the church a clog sits , yawning dismally . Is this all the " liveliness of the marketplace " that we came to see ? Minster sleeps late after its revels of the night , just gone . Across the way are some charming houses , four or five stories tall , gray and gabled : some frankly old , other manifestly " restored . " The ground floor is a shop , but the upper stories of the house extend above the pavement , resting upon pillars and arches ; the effect is very pleasing to the eye , and in stormy weather the arcade is , for foot-farers , a great comfort . Watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a strange town can pardon such lapse of good manners ; any one too sensitive about such matters must not read the next lines .  | As we looked over the rims of our coffee-cups at the delightful sky-line made by those curving , leaping gables , as we puzzled over the quaint text of the mottoes beneath them , we became aware that other eyes were looking over other cups toward our own . Munster , like us , was taking its morning coffee , and a little later Munster began , in spite of promised rain , to water its flowers . FLOWER-BOXES AT EVERY WINDOW All German towns can boast charming window gardens , but none ? and saying it I recall very well the magnificent cacti of Rotenburg , Braunschweig 's luxuriant geraniums ( although that is not what she calls them ) , Quedlinburg 's roses ? are so lovely , so rich in bloom , as those of Munster . Fancy a high , narrow facade of smooth , cool gray stucco dripping with purple blossoms from attic window to arched ground floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , seen from our window , color and flower shape are the same . Every window is massed with it , the long tendrils swinging and swaying in the light wind , the greenery almost hidden by the mass of bloom . , Beside it a gayer building , gleaming with new paint and " restorations , " finds its fresh colors rivaled by the pink blossoms in its window gardens , and beyond it a structure of dark gray stone makes a delightful background for a wealth of scarlet flowers . And here and there behind each flowery screen one catches a glimpse of moving hands , of shining watering-cans , and sharp pruning-shears , sometimes of a friendly face . Usually the face is masculine ; the master cultivates the flowers while the mistress is busy in the kitchen . Sunday dinner is too important to be left in a maid 's incompetent hands . Here and there are little blond childish heads bobbing behind the flower screen , and as the morning grows there are more and more of them peering down at the street , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have its " church promenade ? " New York still throngs Fifth avenue after service , and Philadelphia once walked sedately to and fro upon Walnut street between Holy Trinity and the Philadelphia Club ; Munster crowds the short space of its Prinzipal Markt of a Sunday morn , exchanging greetings and salutations . READY FOR THE PARADE But upon this Sunday of our story something more exciting was in prospect than the ordinary " church promenade . ' In spite of frequent vicious showers throughout the morning , carriages containing remarkably costumed young men rolled past our door , too swiftly for more than a glimpse of a white feather or the flash of gold lace , but frequently enough to keep our curiosity very high . Long before service was over people began to gather in the shelter of the arcades ? people with arm-loads of flowers , whop stood patiently , but persistently , holding their vantage ground in the front ranks . in spite of the increasing crush behind them . Then bands of young students commenced to pass up and down the market . each group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wearer 's school and class . Muuzten are military-looking caps of odd shape , black visored , most of them ; but the cloth crowns of every conceivable color ? pale blue , scarlet , sea-green , yellow ; or , when dark , with a vivid band . Each class of a gymnasium ( secondary or higher school and each university student organization ) has its peculiar cap . In a university town , where also are several gymnasia or preparatory schools , the rainbow scarcely furnishes enough variety of shades for all the caps . and where a group gathers together the bobbing heads look like grotesque flowers . OUT OF THE CHURCH INTO THE RAIN When the church doors opened after the last mass ? Munster is devoutly Roman Catholic , her harrowing experience under John of Leyden having given her apparently more than enough of Protestantism ? and the congregations poured out from the cathedral and St. Lambertus into the already crowded street . every vestige of pavement was lost from sight in the swaying sea of heads . Up and down the laughing , chattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until music heard in the distance drew nearer and a narrow lane opened with difficulty in the center of the street . Just then my chambermaid came into the room upon some errand and said that the " Veterans " of ' 70- ' 71 were parading that day , and that the student corps had joined the parade . " Will the procession pass here ? " we asked eagerly . " Certainly , " answered Gretchen with emphasis ; " all parades pass here Mow stupid of us , to be sure . And why do the students parade with the veterans we ask timidly . We are feeling a little ashamed of our ignorance now . " Do n't says Gretchen : they just like to ! They are always parading ! " Plainly , Gretchen does n't think much of students . Probably her sweetheart is a soldier or policeman . ALI , HONOR TO THE BAND ! A blare of trumpets and the band appears curving in from the Rotenburg past the old Rathaus , just beyond us ? a civilian band , attired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trombone , the reins of a restive horse , one 's music card , and the heavy instrument in one 's hands , and a gusty wind whirling around unexpected corners of a winding street ! All honor to that band ! It played well : no German band would dare do otherwise . Audiences are critical , and not a man lost his hat or his dignity . Although it was the veterans ' parade , the students appeared first , riding each in solitary state in an open landau drawn usually by two , occasionally by four , horses . Each wore a medieval costume , velvet apparently , and a soft velvet cap decorated with a long white plume , and each bore the banner of his corps , gorgeous affairs of silk , satin , velvet , gold lace , and embroidery . As the long line of carriages slowly passed , the meaning of the arm-loads of flowers became apparent ( see page 114 ) . Very few large bunches or tied bouquets were presented , but each student received from his friends along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a handful of carnations , then a tiny bunch of sweet peas or pansies or a couple of stately lilies . The students thanked each giver with a more or less gracious and graceful bow ? as the banners were very heavy and awkward to manage , one must not be too critical ? and laid the blossoms in the open top of his carriage . There were favorites in the university as elsewhere ; one man had his carriage heaped with flowers , while another would have scarcely half a dozen tokens of good-will and popularity . THE VETERANS ARE MARCHING By Long before the last gay carriage passed , the rain fell in torrents , velvet and feathers were draggled , summer frocks drenched ; but neither paraders nor observers flinched . After the students came the veterans , a little somber group , passing along on foot , quietly and slowly , pathetically , like other " veteran corps " we have seen at home . There were neither banners nor flowers for their share , although it was their parade . We were glad that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted them all along the line as they marched bravely bv . All the participants had shared in an especial service at the Dom before parading ; that accounted for the hurrying carriages earlier in the morning . Now , after a circuit of the old town , the procession would break up in front of St. Lambertus and carriages and veterans find their way home through the crowded , dripping streets . An hour later and the market was as quiet as in the early morning . Minster was dining . Then it would nap , and then drink coffee , after which it would be ready for church and amusement once more . Being merely Americans , we thought it best to use the sunshine which greeted us after dinner for a little sightseeing . SURE SIGNS OF MARRIAGE For an hour we had the streets quite to ourselves , but later smiling family groups began to pass us ? father , mother , and a troup of chubby children ; young couples arm-in-arm , newly engaged or married ( one knows whether it is " en- gaged " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the man 's right or left arm ) ? going to the parents for the sociable coffee-drinking , an every-day function , which upon Sunday receives a pleasantly , leisurely , holiday flavor and offers convenient opportunity for offering light refreshment to one 's family and friends . From our vantage spot on the balcony we had noticed now and then some passer stop and gaze intently at St. Lambertus ' tall tower . Several times our eyes swept its tall height : yes , it was undeniably lovely , graceful , altogether satisfactory , as it soared upward from the market , but these people who looked longest did not look like students of picturesque architecture . Finally we discovered the objects their eyes were seeking three long iron cages swinging just above the clock face on the tower . They recall Munster 's most harrowing days , those when she went mad with frenzied religious zeal and followed blindly the vicious teachings of John of Leyden . It is unjust to saddle upon a sect the evils practiced by its leaders , but all Anabaptists suffered in reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excesses there indulged in by this John of Leyden and his associates . The wild orgy ended with John 's overthrow . He and his chief intimates , Knipperdollinck and Krechting , died by torture and their bodies were exposed in these iron cages upon the stump of St. Lambert 's older tower , for this present graceful structure has scarcely been finished a decade . A CITY WITHOUT A TOWER In the brief period of John of Leyden 's rule , all of Munster 's church towers were demolished by his order , so it is said ; only St. Lambert 's was stout and strong and could not be entirely destroyed . Very recently some one spoke of Munster as the " city without a tower , " and that may well have been the case in the years directly after this religious upheaval , but not today ; Munster boasts many graceful towers and spires . Beside St. Lambertus is a charming little fountain , a children 's fountain , its basin carved with quaint nursery rhymes and a ring of chubby marble children , not cherubs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splashing water . Usually it is encircled by living children as well , scrambling and clambering up the basin 's sides , dabbling eager hands in the pool , or gazing openmouthed at their marble representations . The Ludgerus fountain by the cathedral is more celebrated , but this one in the Lambertus Platz is our favorite . Munster has several beautiful churches besides the Dom , the largest and finest church in Westphalia , notably LudgeriKirche , older yet than the cathedral in part , and the beautiful Gothic Ueberwasser-Kirche , more rhythmically the Church of Our Lady . The cathedral ( St. Paul ) was built in the thirteenth century upon the site of an earlier church , traces of which may still be found by antiquaries ; but the later additions made in the sixteenth century are far more apparent . From some corners of the great tree-shaded Domplatz the edifice is very beautiful , from others unimpressive but the whole space about it was so crowded with booths that we scarcely saw it fairly . MUNSTER KEEPS THE SABBATH The booths were all closed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as buying , selling , and noisy merry-making is concerned . A few fakirs plied their trade in the cathedral 's shadow . The most popular was a man selling small flutes , upon which he played folk-songs to attract buyers . He drew a sweet , bird-like note from the tiny thing and with such ease that his wares found many sales . It was very amusing to watch the interested faces in the group about him and the sheepish glances buyers cast about them as they essayed to try the toy for themselves . Munster 's old walls and gates are all gone . One or two plain old towers alone remain of all her stout fortifications . Her " Rampart-promenade , " a ring of small parks crossed at intervals by wellpaved city streets , takes the place of walls and moat , and from it American cities could well learn the art of landscape gardening within narrow limits . Nowhere are these parks of great  | width , yet frequently they give the impression of distance , and beautiful breathing places they make for a population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Water fowl find homes in the rippling pools that adorn them , ducks and swans so entirely at home and unafraid that , after an inquiring glance up and down a street , they do not hesitate to cross it upon their way from pool to pool ( see page 116 ) . SUNDAY THRONG Flowers and shrubbery , smooth green turf , and thick-foliaged trees lined the quiet walks ; sweethearts and little romping children ; old people , slow and patient of step ; parents with growing families ; soldiers ; students , bold and assertive ; coquettish nursery maids out for an airing school girls , blushing and giggling ? all to be met with on a holiday afternoon . Adjoining the ring of promenades is a stately Schloss , once the residence of Munster 's proud prince bishops , but now belonging to the crown , and beyond the promenades are Munster 's most charming residences , each with its garden , large or small , but always flower-filled and always with a tiny veranda , or arbor , where the family are drinking coffee this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well housed . In the older town are some very stately ho f e ? literally , courts or courtyards , but actually very handsome sixteenth-century residences built on three sides of a grilled court . There is a museum with pictures , but Munster 's best pictures are not in her gallery ? they are in her streets and markets . Of course , it is not always fair time . There are not so many flags and flowers ; very rarely one sees a costumed peasant or such lively crowded streets . The Westphalian costume is fast disappearing ; it is remarkable rather than pretty , and will be no great loss save for the element of individuality and quaintness it gives to busy market-places . Very rarely one sees it in Munster , not frequently even in the villages . On Monday morning market was in progress under the arcades and by the curbs of the Prinzipal Markt , but a drizzly rain was falling , the sky was murky gray , the flags were twisted and tangled , everybody wore their dull worka-clay clothes ; the Jahrmarkt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise were renewed , but we did not wait for it . " Will it rain all day ? " we asked the porter anxiously . " Surely , " said that worthy positively . So we packed our bags , cast one lingering glance at the blossoms and mottoes across the way , and went on to Hildesheim , ere sober reality dulled the brightness of the holiday . BEAUTIFUL HILDESHEIM And Hildesheim is assuredly a jewel of a town , well calculated to make one forget another 's charms . Who shall truly picture her delightfulness ; her winding , narrow streets ; her tall-timbered houses ; her market - place , walled by stately dwellings , by Rathaus and Amthaus ; her open places ringed by bewildering gables ; her tall , grave churches and grim old towers . How many fascinating legends , churchly and pagan , one may hear there . Who can forget the rose bush of a thousand years or the bells of the Kehrwieder ( turn again ) tower ? Who does not fear " the Huckup " ? Admitted to intimate acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her rivals . Yet there are a score of towns which might readily dispute with her the right to be remembered , and , with Munster , all claim to our title . Braunschweig , for instance , more of a city , more flagrantly modernized , has nevertheless had the grace to preserve much of her ancient splendor . For entirely personal reasons we love her better than any other gabled town , and , except when we are in Hildesheim , think her by far the loveliest ; less of romance gilds her , perhaps , but much stately history clings to her old burg ; while Till Eulenspiegel 's merry pranks and incidentally his owls and and very modern plumbing of Braunschweig 's best hostelry inform you that the town is distinctly up to date , there are also , not five minutes  | distant , curving streets and dusky corners where one may readily walk hand-in-hand with the sixteenth century . Talltimbered houses rise , one story overstepping another , until scarcely a strip of blue shows between the gables . Small casement windows open in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; allegorical figures , imps , monsters , angels , and hobgoblins creep , crawl , or pose wherever they may find foothold . Look down from your window . In the square the bronze lion will recall that Henry the Lion whose town this was , and with the name more stirring history than one can well compress into a morning . And after Hildesheim and Braunschweig there are Goslar and Halberstadt , Osterode , Ouedlinburg , Wernigerode ? all close neighbors , all many-gabled , to dispute Munster 's claims . After these Harz towns , far to the southward , the unforgettable glories of Nurnberg and Rotenburg , of Wurzburg , Regensburg , and Ulm . Now , indeed , we feel that we have been overbold ; in friendliness we have been unfriendly .  | THE GABLED CITIES OF THE HARZ Better known are all these cities to the average tourist than Munster . Either they lie upon traveled highroads or they make definite demand for attention , or they are set in a loveliness that will not be ignored . All about the green Harz Mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills that afford such pleasant summer journeyings . Buttressed by hoary history , golden with romance , rich in beautiful architecture and in the wisdom to cherish it , readily reachable from Hannover or Berlin , what wonder that Hildesheim 's jewel , the Knochenhauer Amthaus ( p. 122 ) , Braunschweig 's Burg , Wernigerode 's Rathaus , are the traveler 's familiar friends ! More familiar still are Nuremberg 's stately gables , the scarcely less pretentious ones of her neighbors . Rothenburg has become a show place , a museum ; Nordlingen has been discovered ; even Dinkelsbiihl has its visitors , and its gables appear upon post-cards . I should have known better than to give the title to Munster ; Munster , so off the beaten trail , so unbefriended by nature , so slighted by romance , so inconspicuous in history ; Munster , which rarely sees the foreign traveler , never the tourist , and is profoundly indifferent about it . Yet let her keep the title . Have we not already remembered her gray houses through a score of years ? Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , on ZVurzburg 's stately bridge , in Nuremberg 's market-place , we have recalled right pleasantly her dim , shadowy arches and tall gables . Yes , let her keep the name .  |
