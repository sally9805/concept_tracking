A drawing-room in the HADENS ' house in London . It opens to the hall at the back , and to other rooms at either side . Bridge tables have been arranged and deserted . HARRY CHARTERIS , a distinguished-looking young man , pale , rather delicate in type , is sitting at the piano , playing very well  --  but listlessly , as though not concerned with the music at all . He watches the central doorway anxiously . LADY WILDERING enters presently . She is obviously agitated , although she is doing her best not to appear so . HARRY stops playing instantly and rises . She comes toward him quickly , leaning over the piano as they speak . CHARTERIS In a low voice . How are things now , Edith ? LADY WILDERING Also in a low voice , hurriedly . Dreadful ; I left Charlotte upstairs with Helen  --  trying to talk some sense into her . But do n't stop playing , Harry , please . Go on . She indicates the emptiness and silence of the house about them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly , and talking at the same time . I know what you mean . . . . Your husband is in there walking Haden up and down  --  trying to talk some sense into him . But I 'm afraid it 's no good . p. 3 LADY WILDERING With a glance toward the door of the room that he has indicated . I 'm afraid it 's all no good . But where is he ? He did n't go , I suppose ? CHARTERIS Ironically . Our young American friend , Mr. Thayer ? Oh , no ! I did n't think he would . The beautiful Mrs. Leslie has him in there  --  trying to talk sense into him . LADY WILDERING With some distaste as her glance goes toward the other door . Someone ought to talk some sense into her . And I think she 's a very mischievous woman , as well as a very silly one . CHARTERIS I agree . Personally , I care very little for either of them . But they 're really not bad , I suppose . LADY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong people , has taken up so many who have been so much worse ? They agree that she has , by half-grave , half-smiling confidential nods . A very pretty and extravagantly dressed woman enters from the left , smoking a cigarette . CHARTERIS Here 's Mrs. Leslie . . . He goes on playing. p. 4 MRS . LESLIE Uneasily . How are things now , Lady Wildering ? LADY WILDERING Lady Helen is still upstairs . MRS . LESLIE Impatiently . I think I 'll go . Lady Helen and Sir Bruce have succeeded in making everybody extremely uncomfortable tonight . I 'm not coming again soon . LADY WILDERING Of course you know a great many people here now . . . and I suppose you 're very busy . . . The music fills in an awkward pause . MRS . LESLIE Apologetically . Oh , I realise that you must be thinking that I 'm very ungrateful after all that Lady Helen has done for me . Of course , I owe her a great deal . I 've met most of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly embarrassing for me to come here now because I introduced Ned Thayer to her . Sir Bruce knows that , and of course he blames me , and  --  LADY WILDERING Bluntly . Sir Bruce may seem to have very little intelligence , but he has too much to blame anyone for any of Lady Helen 's enthusiasms . CHARTERIS Who has left the piano and comes toward them . Besides , no one cares what Haden thinks . It 's Lady Helen who happened to be kind to you , is n't it ? And just for your own sake , Mrs. Leslie  --  if serious trouble should come from this , now or presently , do n't desert , too frankly , the first friend you had in London . CHARLOTTE ASHLEY enters from the hall , and closes the doors behind her , as if someone might be listening. p. 5 ASHLEY Edith  --  LADY WILDERING Yes , Charlotte ? ASHLEY Quickly , hopefully . Go up and talk to Helen . She 's begun to laugh now and blame the new cook for Bruce 's temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one whenever the mutton is cooked too long or the fish not long enough , and both happened tonight . Helen admits that under the circumstances Bruce did fairly well , only she 's sorry , of course , that she was not  --  as usual  --  the sole object of his wrath . She drops into a chair half-turned away from one of the card-tables , and relaxes a little . I never played a scene on the stage better than I have played the rle of peace-maker tonight . My defence of Bruce was a masterpiece  --  especially so because I did n't believe a word of what I preached . What a man ! Her energy comes back and she straightens up . And here we are  --  all of us  --  trying to keep them together when we ought to beg her , if she has either any pride or any courage left , to leave him , at once , forever ! LADY WILDERING But what would she do ? What could she do ? ASHLEY Desperately . Heavens , she could do something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely ! p. 6 CHARTERIS Do n't forget that you 're talking , and thinking , as a woman who can make a jolly good living on the stage ; but there is nothing , nothing at all , that Helen can do . And there is nobody  --  who has the right  --  to give her anything . And she does n't know  --  and will never learn  --  the difference between a pound and a shilling ! ASHLEY She knows that a pound is something you give the matre d'htel , and a shilling is something you give the taxi-driver . Helen thinks that 's what actual money is for ,  --  tips ! MRS . LESLIE Whose presence they 've almost forgotten . They say she is the most extravagant woman in London . ASHLEY In the world , probably ! MRS . LESLIE But could n't she marry again ? There is a sharp pause . ASHLEY Impatiently , rising and walking about . If she were divorced , certainly ! MRS . LESLIE But is n't that just what you want her to do  --  get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention divorce , Mrs. Leslie . p. 7 ASHLEY Oh , no ! There 's no possibility of a divorce ! MRS . LESLIE But if he treats her so badly  --  ? Surely one can get a divorce from a brute ? ASHLEY Not in England . Not even when your husband is a drunken brute of a butcher  --  MRS . LESLIE Sir Bruce was n't really a butcher ? CHARTERIS The most successful butcher in the Empire . MRS . LESLIE I never knew that . So that is why he has a title ? CHARTERIS You 'll find England as quick as America to acknowledge success in business , Mrs. Leslie , even if we 're not so quick to acknowledge failure in matrimony . MRS . LESLIE Defensively . Of course , it seems immoral to me that a woman has to live with a man who acts as Sir Bruce does . LADY WILDERING The law does n't make her live with him . She can leave him any time she likes . MRS . LESLIE Not recognising their fine distinction . But if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody else . p. 8 LADY WILDERING No , she has n't a chance in the world , as the matter stands now , of marrying anyone else . MRS . LESLIE Complacently . Of course , I 'm not defending women who keep on getting divorces and marrying again . My husbands  --  both of them  --  died . CHARTERIS Drily . They were more considerate than Haden has ever been willing to be . MRS . LESLIE But why did she marry him in the first place ? CHARTERIS More to himself than to her . I suppose that he was one of her practical whims . LADY WILDERING And he was much more attractive then than he is now , of course . CHARTERIS With an undertone of bitterness . And a hint of the barbaric seems to appeal to most women . He rises suddenly . I think I 'll go up and speak to Helen , Charlotte , unless Edith will go . LADY WILDERING No , you go . I 've said everything I possibly could . CHARTERIS To CHARLOTTE . Do n't you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might woo Haden back to bridge ? p. 9 ASHLEY Drily . I 'm willing to do my best with the well-known charm , but I wo n't be his partner again . However , there are two tables and . . . I 'll try . She smiles , deciding to make the best of it . CHARTERIS Right-o . He goes . ASHLEY Sitting down again at the bridge table . There 's no hurry . . . Helen wo n't come down immediately . LADY WILDERING Sitting at the same table . I begin to feel hopeful , and a little relaxed . I 've been like this  --  she holds out her hand in a gesture of tensity  --  for an hour . I was perfectly certain that the smash had come . MRS . LESLIE From a chair at the other table , where she sits , gathering up the cards , and shuffling them absently . You can imagine how I felt , of course ! ASHLEY Not too sympathetically . Of course . Pause . MRS . LESLIE Suddenly , archly , insinuatingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Charteris might be in love with Lady Helen ? p. 10 LADY WILDERING I suppose that it has occurred to everybody who has ever known either of them that Harry Charteris has been in love with Helen Haden all his life . MRS . LESLIE Amazed at their frankness . Oh ! Has he ? ASHLEY Yes  --  hopelessly , wonderfully , unselfishly , beautifully in love  --  all his life ! MRS . LESLIE Oh ! She 's never mentioned it . ASHLEY She would n't . LADY WILDERING Changing the subject , feeling that MRS . LESLIE has been sufficiently snubbed . Now , about Mr. Thayer ? MRS . LESLIE Rising . I 'll go and try again to get him into a good humour . It may take some time . He 's very difficult . She goes . A little silence follows her . ASHLEY I detest that woman ! LADY WILDERING So do I , and I should n't mind her so much , I think , if I were not an American , too . But she 's a type that particularly annoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes one meets them like this . They are always living in hotels , always apparently on the wing ; always good-looking ; always beautifully dressed ; their friends are always people they 've just met ; they 're agreeable enough , frequently they 're amusing ; they never have such things as husbands or relatives or children ; and they emerge from obscurity , as detached from any background whatever as silhouettes cut from black paper , and pasted on a blank page . However , why I 'm wasting words on Mrs. Leslie and her kind I do n't know ; particularly when I have Helen so much on my mind . p. 11 ASHLEY It 's all very well for us to talk of dragging ourselves back to bridge , and getting through the evening somehow  --  and we may manage it this time ; but the next , and the next ? LADY WILDERING I do n't know . . . . I do n't know . . . . Things seem to go from bad to worse for Helen . They always have . ASHLEY One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDWARD THAYER ,  --  a very attractive young man . She is vivacious ; he , a little sullen , but rather boyishly so . MRS . LESLIE Here he is . He 's promised to be a good child . THAYER Hesitantly . I apologize . I 'm sorry that I acted badly . I should have gone quietly , and afterward , perhaps  --  if Sir Bruce  --  He pauses and changes the subject . I 'm particularly sorry to have caused Lady Helen all this  --  this trouble ; but he  --  He finds it too difficult to continue . LADY WILDERING Gently . We understand . Unfortunately , Sir Bruce is quick-tempered , and often unfair . MRS . LESLIE But to accuse a man of cheating at cards just because he 's jealous  --  p. 12 THAYER Hurrying to interrupt her tactlessness . Sir Bruce had a right to his opinion , of course . If he thought I was making a practice of looking over his shoulder  --  He shrugs , and again fails to finish what he is saying . But  --  ASHLEY Interrupting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , even if he really believed what he was saying , to speak as he did . We quite appreciate that . THAYER I ought to have gone . I would have gone if Lady Helen had not insisted  --  I 've been waiting , only to speak to her , to thank her . . . . MRS . LESLIE A little impatiently . The thing to do is to settle ourselves now and start again just as if nothing had happened . Is n't it , Lady Wildering ? LADY WILDERING It seems to me the only thing . I think people are expected for supper later . And I hope that you will help us to make the best of a very awkward situation , Mr. Thayer . . . . Miss Ashley and I are going to try our wiles on Sir Bruce  --  Mr. Charteris has gone to fetch Lady Helen , and  --  and you wo n't try to make things more difficult , will you , Mr. Thayer ? p. 13 THAYER But it was so ridiculous of him ! I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . But there are only two things that you can do  --  overlook the matter , for this evening , at least ,  --  and smile and do your best , for all our sakes . . . or go . . . now . . . . LADY WILDERING Quickly . And if you go , you know what that means . You will smile and do your best  --  ? THAYER Suddenly . Yes , I will . I promise . LADY WILDERING That 's splendid . Now we will find Sir Bruce . She turns to go , but THAYER 's voice stops her as he speaks quickly , with a rather shy , hesitant smile . THAYER Everyone tells me that your husband is a great diplomat , Lady Wildering ; but I suspect you of being his unofficial chief . . . . I hope Washington will be your next stop . LADY WILDERING Thanks . It does n't seem likely  --  at this time . But . . . THAYER As she hesitates . But one never knows , you mean ? Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . One never knows . She turns away again , to join CHARLOTTE , who is standing near the door of the room on the right , when the door from the hall at the back opens and HARRY CHARTERIS returns . CHARTERIS Quickly . Helen 's coming down . Before anyone can answer , SIR EMMETT WILDERING and SIR BRUCE HADEN enter unexpectedly from the room at the right . SIR EMMETT looks the successful diplomat , SIR BRUCE the successful butcher . Some sort of peace seems to have been decided upon , but SIR BRUCE is still in a vicious mood . He and EDWARD THAYER avoid looking at each other . LADY WILDERING  --  Ah ! We were just going to find you . ASHLEY To SIR BRUCE , charmingly . Edith has proposed herself as your partner  --  against us her quick nod indicates SIR EMMETT quite unscrupulously , without cutting . Is n't the challenge irresistible ? You 'll have to do your best , you know . Emmett and I are very good . You 're not afraid ? She sits down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling at SIR BRUCE gaily. p. 15 SIR WILDERING Sitting opposite her . Of course they 're not afraid ! Not yet . . . . It ought to be an interesting game , Haden . SIR HADEN Ungraciously . I 'll play . But he looks around , unable to conceal his distaste but not in here . The butler enters , followed by a second man with a tray . They start to set out a small table with whisky and soda , glasses , et cetera ; but as they hurry SIR BRUCE breaks the pause by turning to them , and as he addresses the butler , secures for himself the first drink , ignoring his guests . SIR HADEN Sharply . Brandon ! SERVANT  --  Yes , Sir Bruce . Whisky and soda , or brandy , sir ? SIR HADEN  --  Brandy . And Brandon  --  I want my table moved into the other room  --  He indicates the room at the right , the door of which stands open . Then , as he regards the glass that BRANDON anxiously fills and hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Yes , Sir Bruce . Very good , sir . p. 16 SIR HADEN  --  At once , you understand ! He drains his glass . LADY HELEN enters . She is curiously aflame , but she drives her voice guardedly . It is easy to surmise that she has heard her husband 's command , as she checks the butler and his assistant quickly , in their hurried act of carrying out his order . LADY HADEN  --  And then , Brandon , after you have served the others , you may move the other table into the other room . SERVANT  --  Very good , my lady . The first table is quickly disposed of ; nobody wishes to be served with anything , and BRANDON and his assistant move the second bridge-table into the room at the left , and return for the small chairs to put them in place , while LADY HELEN , roving the room impatiently , makes her friends smile as she talks a streak of easy hurried nonsense to no one in particular , her eyes alert , watching for the servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling Edith a while ago about having my fortune told today . It amused her enormously . Zellito . She 's the new Spanish dancer in that review at the Gaiety . She 's a real gypsy . She does n't tell fortunes professionally , you know . Dancing is her real work . Fortune-telling is just a sort of gift . She 's the seventh daughter of a line of seventh daughters , it seems . Edith thinks it 's nonsense  --  believing her . But she wo n't tell you anything unless she takes a special interest in you . It 's immensely flattering to have her take a special interest . It makes you feel so important  --  psychically , as if you had a destiny , or something of the sort . Zellito wo n't say what she sees in my hand . . . . Some sort of spectacular doom , I suppose she smiles down into the palm of her open hand I wonder ? I never believe doctors , and I never believe lawyers . But I always believe fortune-tellers. p. 17 SIR HADEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mad Varicks . LADY HADEN With a laugh but with a significant glance , both of pity and contempt , at her husband . The mad Varicks will soon trouble the world no longer . Then she turns with nervous gaiety to MRS . LESLIE and EDWARD THAYER  --  and talks rapidly , lightly to them as she moves about , smoking and playing with the pearls that hang in many long strands from her throat  --  all the time keeping an eye on her husband , for whose benefit there is something a little like a theatrical performance in her words and manner . I suppose you do n't know about the mad Varicks ? There were once quite a lot of us , and now I 'm the only one that 's left . We were at our best about five hundred years ago . But even then we were a little mad , too , I suppose . And we kept on being gay and mad through some of the soberest days that England has ever known . Sometimes we lost our heads ; sometimes we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the King , and knew all the secrets of the Queen ; but there never was a battle fought for England , by sea or land , in which some Varick did not offer his gay , mad life . Perhaps that 's how we got the habit of dying . We 've always died . . . I think we 've rather liked dying  --  just as we 've always liked our ghosts and our debts and our hereditary gout , and our scandals , and even our white sheep . We do admit an occasional white sheep in the family  --  one every century or so  --  You may go , Brandon  --  The servants obey and quietly leave the room . And now  --  before we attempt to play again she grows stern and takes them all by surprise I think that my husband wishes to apologise to Mr. Thayer , before all of you , for what he said to Mr. Thayer , before all of you , in this room , a little while ago . p. 18 SIR HADEN Furiously , as he advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen , please  --  SIR WILDERING Going to BRUCE , quickly . Be very careful , Haden  --  do n't lose your head again  --  or  --  LADY WILDERING To LADY HELEN , anxiously . My dear  --  just this once , do n't insist  --  ASHLEY  --  Helen , Mr. Thayer does n't insist  --  MRS . LESLIE  --  Oh , is it going to start all over again ? LADY HADEN Unmoved , to her husband . You accused one of my friends , a young man who is a stranger in this country , and who came to this house on my invitation , of trying to cheat you at cards . You can not prove your statement  --  but on the other hand he can not disprove it . There is no way of getting at the truth , apparently . But , in this case , even if I had never seen Mr. Thayer before  --  even if I did not know him incapable of your charge  --  I should insist , as I insist now , upon giving him the benefit of the very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 SIR HADEN  --  I tell you , my suspicions  --  LADY HADEN Stopping him . Wait a minute , Bruce ! You were very headstrong a moment ago in calling this friend of mine a cheat and a liar , and ordering him from the house ; and I know you well enough to know that the story would have got about , even if everyone else in this room had kept decently silent . . . . Oh , I know ! SIR HADEN  --  Well , I let him stay , did n't I ? There he is ! I 'm willing to say no more . LADY HADEN Losing her temper for the first time . You  --  let him stay ! Because I would have left this house just as surely as I 'm standing here  --  if you had not retracted . And you did n't want that ! God knows why you did n't , but you did n't ! SIR HADEN  --  I tell you I 'm willing to say no more  --  if you want to let the matter drop now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm willing . LADY HADEN  --  But I 'm not ! Not until you 've said to Mr. Thayer that you apologise ! SIR HADEN After a slight pause , going toward THAYER , half-humorously , half-ironically . Do you want me to apologise , Mr. Thayer ? Will that do any good ? p. 20 THAYER Steadily . All things considered , Sir Bruce , I think that it might do some good . SIR BRUCE takes the time to light a cigarette . He has had enough to drink to make his movements rather unsteady . SIR HADEN At last , brutally . Considering I 'm a little bit drunk , you mean ; and maybe a little bit jealous  --  and ca n't prove anything  --  LADY HADEN Turning about suddenly . Good night , all of you ! She starts a little blindly toward the door at the back . SIR HADEN Wait ! Helen ! LADY WILDERING  --  Helen ! My dear  --  THAYER  --  Lady Helen  --  LADY HADEN Turning at THAYER 'S low cry , and speaking in a low , hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I beg of you , please  --  do n't make me feel so responsible ! I would n't for the world have caused you any trouble . LADY HADEN  --  I know that . And you must know the very great regret I feel for having exposed you to insults against which you are as defenceless as I. I will let you know , later , where I am. p. 21 THAYER  --  You are going , really  --  because of what 's happened here , tonight ? LADY HADEN  --  I should have gone sometime . It is n't your fault  --  so do n't worry . For any stranger invited to my house I should have asked the simple justice that I have asked for you . A fantastic love of justice happens to be one of the things for which the mad Varicks have died . This she flings half-humorously , half-disdainfully at SIR BRUCE , who is watching closely , sobered and troubled . SIR WILDERING Taking a hand . But , my dear , just suppose that your husband does believe himself in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with some hesitation at first , then with reckless anger . To accuse is so easy that it is infamous to do so where proof is impossible ! And to damn a guest , a stranger , in this particular fashion is a thing so grave that I can not forgive it  --  even though my husband happens to be a little drunk  --  and a little jealous  --  and a little more brutal than usual . I 'm sorry . Good night . She turns and leaves the room . Perfect silence follows her , but as she is about to pass from sight along the hall at the back , SIR BRUCE turns violently to THAYER , arresting LADY HELEN 'S progress by his loud words. p. 22 SIR HADEN  --  By God ! I ca n't have my wife doing a thing like this for you ! He hurries to the door . Helen ! Come back ! I  --  I will apologise ! She stands stone still , hesitating . Come back ! She comes slowly back into the room , closes the door behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest pause he speaks in a suddenly matter-of-fact manner , but carefully , heavily . SIR HADEN  --  You 've all heard . . . . Well , she 's right . I was wrong . I 'm very sorry . I apologise to Mr. Thayer ; I apologise to my wife ; and I apologise to you all . I 'm not a very pleasant sort , I suppose , but  --  well , I apologise ; and I hope that everyone here realises I spoke hastily and unjustly , and that I 'm very sorry . LADY HADEN Quickly , warmly . That 's splendid of you , Bruce . That 's just what I wanted you to say . She smiles at him radiantly . She is a little touched . He pours himself another drink , however , turning his back , in some embarrassment , to the others . HARRY CHARTERIS , who has been standing by the piano , once more begins to play , lightly , nervously , but with great relief . LADY WILDERING and CHARLOTTE ASHLEY are suddenly laughing about nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breath with an easy laugh  --  managing to seem nonchalant . SIR EMMETT goes , smiling , toward LADY HELEN . BRANDON enters p. 23 SERVANT  --  Miss Timmins wishes to know if she might have a word with your ladyship ? Even BRANDON detects the change in the atmosphere and a certain dog-like concern for his mistress is turned into something happier as he scents her more comfortable mood . LADY HADEN  --  Certainly ; ask Miss Timmins to come in here , Brandon . BRANDON goes . A murmur of conversation hums through the room , accompanied by the low , gay music that HARRY CHARTERIS continues to play . MISS TIMMINS enters , as if she had been waiting just outside the door , with scarcely an instant 's delay . She is a middle-aged spinster in black and both affection and concern for LADY HELEN are in her hovering manner and plaintive voice . MISS TIMMINS  --  I 'm so sorry to disturb you , Lady Helen ; I told Brandon not to speak to you if you were playing again . . . . LADY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Significantly . It 's quite all right , Miss Timmins . . . . MISS TIMMINS smiles back , with a sharp sigh of relief . LADY HELEN continues . What is it ? p. 24 MISS TIMMINS  --  A message has just come from Buckingham Palace . Their Majesties will attend the bazaar on Thursday , and the Queen wishes you to know that she was delighted to learn that you suffered no ill effects from your fall , last week . SIR BRUCE has turned , and is listening . LADY HADEN  --  Thanks , Miss Timmins . She includes SIR EMMETT in her next remark . That 's splendid , is n't it  --  that their Majesties are coming ? Her nod dismisses MISS TIMMINS , who leaves the room ; SIR EMMETT joins SIR BRUCE , as LADY HELEN turns to speak very casually to MRS . LESLIE , who has just approached . I ca n't desert my bazaar on Thursday to lunch with you and your Jewish friend . He will have to have me some other time . MRS . LESLIE  --  He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Could you make it Friday , dear ? LADY HADEN  --  No . . . . Sometime next week . She turns abruptly away , finds a cigarette , and goes to the piano , where HARRY is still playing . MRS . LESLIE To everyone in general . We were speaking of Rudolph Solomon . He 's the man who buys Rembrandts . Of course he buys other things , too . He 's just bought a Velasquez that the British Museum wanted . I suppose you 've heard of him ? Her question is focussed on CHARLOTTE ASHLEY , who is nearest. p. 25 ASHLEY  --  Oh , yes . . . yes , of course . CHARLOTTE joins LADY WILDERING . They light cigarettes . SIR EMMETT includes them in a question that he puts to SIR BRUCE . SIR WILDERING  --  And now , do n't you think we might have our game ? SIR HADEN  --  The sooner the better , I say . He turns abruptly and goes into the room at the right . SIR WILDERING With a glance back at CHARLOTTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LADY WILDERING  --  In just a moment , as soon as we 've finished our cigarettes . SIR EMMETT goes . HARRY CHARTERIS stops playing . Then after one instant he begins again , but he is playing a wistful air now , instead of a gay one . LADY HELEN leans against the piano , listening . MRS . LESLIE joins EDWARD THAYER , who is standing in front of the fire , looking down into it , his back to the room . LADY WILDERING To CHARLOTTE , in a low tone . I thought she 'd gone too far . . . . What desperate recklessness. p. 26 ASHLEY  --  It 's been a good lesson for Bruce . LADY WILDERING  --  Possibly ; still  --  She decides to say no more . MRS . LESLIE To THAYER , also in a low tone . They arranged it . You and I will be partners . THAYER  --  I 'd rather not play tonight . MRS . LESLIE  --  Nonsense ! It 's been arranged , I tell you ; everyone wants to play again . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Charteris . THAYER  --  I 'm not in the mood . I should think you would understand that . MRS . LESLIE Drily . Give me a cigarette , please . He obeys her request . Then he goes to the table and pours a drink for himself . ASHLEY To LADY WILDERING . Shall we go ? LADY WILDERING Still smoking . I 'm not in the mood . I should n't think anyone would be . ASHLEY  --  However , it 's been arranged . p. 27 LADY WILDERING  --  Oh , I 'll go through with it , and as I 'm to be Bruce 's partner , I wo n't dare to play badly . She puts her cigarette on an ash-tray , and they move toward the door at the right . LADY HELEN joins them , however , detaining them an instant . LADY HADEN  --  Well  --  ? Bruce was in great form tonight , was n't he ? ASHLEY  --  So were you , Helen . LADY HADEN  --  Yes , I know I was . I was very upset . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can always know that I 'm a bit desperate . It 's the one thing he still likes about me  --  being a mad Varick , I mean : though , of course , he always pretends to scorn it . LADY WILDERING Of course . LADY HADEN But I think he thinks I 'm the maddest of the lot . We had had a discussion earlier in the day  --  about a few bills that seemed particularly mad to him . Bruce believes in being extravagant economically . He 's made a fine art of it . . . . His apology was very pretty , I thought  --  prettier than anyone could have hoped for , under the circumstances . LADY WILDERING Yes ; I think he said just the right thing . p. 28 LADY HADEN With sudden gravity . Thank God , he did . It 's not supremely jolly  --  being married to Bruce , but I do n't know what I 'd do if he threw me over , or I had to throw him over . Run a hat-shop or something , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a booth in a bazaar  --  I 've managed , in some mysterious way , to be in debt to somebody as a result . No , I 'd have no luck with hat-shops , and things like that . It would be easier to sell a pearl every day or two  --  until they were all gone  --  ASHLEY Yes ? And then ? LADY HADEN With a shudder and a smile . Then  --  ? I suppose I 'd become dclasse , in time  --  and the Queen would n't care whether I was hurt by a fall or not . . . . I love that Deserted-Fisher-Girl song Harry is playing ; only it 's like  --  like rain and ghosts  --  and the moors in winter  --  and last year 's styles  --  and photographs of one 's self  --  at seventeen . There 's no doubt about it  --  it 's depressing . But do n't let me keep you , when my lord and master is waiting ! She walks with them toward the door at the right . LADY WILDERING Au ' voir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of you . . . . Bless you . LADY WILDERING and CHARLOTTE go . HELEN looks after them a moment ; then , seeing THAYER standing alone by the table , she joins him . To THAYER , gently . Of course , you 're in no mood to play again . THAYER Not  --  not exactly . Not tonight . HARRY CHARTERIS has stopped playing and is coming toward them . MRS . LESLIE Who has been listening . What are you saying ? Are n't we going to play ? She throws a note of childish disappointment into her voice . You want to , do n't you , Mr. Charteris ? CHARTERIS I ? To LADY HELEN . What do you think , Helen ? MRS . LESLIE Significantly , looking at THAYER . I think we ought . They may think it funny if  --  LADY HADEN Quickly . I suppose that we might as well as not . CHARTERIS Going to the door at the left and opening it , and speaking to MRS . LESLIE , who follows him . Your game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm . p. 30 THAYER With a wry smile to all of them . Somebody will have to be clever for two tonight . I know I shall be no good . MRS . LESLIE The thing for you to do , my friend , is to back up . Come along . . . . LADY HADEN In a moment . She moves to the table where the drinks are . THAYER follows her . MRS . LESLIE , after a glance at the backs of the two of them , goes with CHARTERIS into the room at the left . THAYER To LADY HELEN . What can I get for you ? LADY HADEN A glass of barley water . It 's in that pitcher , I think . He pours it for her . She barely touches it and sets the glass back . Their eyes meet . There is a little pause . She speaks slowly , softly . I 'm so sorry  --  about tonight . THAYER I 'm sorry , too . But I could n't help it . LADY HADEN I know you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful for my husband to say when he 's in a bad mood  --  or jealous . THAYER Unhappily . I suppose  --  at least , according to the tales one hears  --  that he 's had occasion to be jealous a great many times . p. 31 LADY HADEN With a laugh , yet grave . He 's thought so . But I think he 's learned a lesson tonight . THAYER You were so wonderful ! . . . If I did n't know better I might have thought that you really cared for me . LADY HADEN What I said on your behalf tonight , just as I told my husband , I would have said on behalf of any stranger in the same situation . THAYER Oh ! LADY HADEN But it would n't have meant so much to me , of course , if it had not been on behalf of a person I cared for . THAYER Doubtfully . Look here . . . . Do you care for me ? LADY HADEN You know . THAYER I wish I did know . LADY HADEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , why bother about it ? She smiles , but a penetrating person would detect the emotion in her voice . THAYER One should n't bother about it . You are right . After all , I 'm just an incident in your life  --  just someone who happened to interest you for a month or so , one spring out of all the other springs . Last year it was someone else , and next year it will be another , and after that another  --  p. 32 LADY HADEN Still smiling , but with a catch in her breath . So , you do n't mean to let yourself care for me one little bit more than you think I care for you , do you , Ned ? He does not answer ; she continues , lightly . You think you are just one of my caprices , do n't you ? He nods his head " yes " ; again her tone is light but very tender . I suppose , after all , there was someone whom you thought you cared for last spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be someone this time next year  --  ? And perhaps she will be the right one , and will have all the other springtimes , as well . I hope so . And I hope that she will have a very firm hand  --  for she will need it with you , my dear ; and a very tender heart , and a very wise head  --  you are not very wise , yourself , you know  --  And I hope that she will be young and lovely , and that you will be always very happy together , and very sad apart ,  --  as long as you both live . THAYER That 's a strange way to talk . LADY HADEN Poor Ned ! Has n't anyone ever wanted you to be happy before ? THAYER Not anyone who pretended to be in love with me . She laughs and then she frowns. p. 33 LADY HADEN Love is something that not many of us know much about  --  and I 've never pretended to love you , Ned  --  Love is a word I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ago  --  I do n't understand you ! LADY HADEN My dear , you are stupid . THAYER You wrote me such wonderful letters from the country . Is it stupid to think you cared for me when you wrote them ? LADY HADEN No , I do n't believe that the stupidest person could doubt that I cared for you when I wrote them . . . . But let 's not talk about what we feel or do n't feel , tonight . She shows weariness for an instant , but he is impatient and does not heed her appeal . THAYER Arguing his case against her , more to himself than her . And then , this last week , since you 've come back , you 've scarcely let me see you at all . Of course , everybody says that you get tired of everybody and everything , that you 're always taking people up and then dropping them , so I suppose you 're tired of me , now . . . . I was sure of it when I came here tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  after all ; then  --  p. 34 LADY HADEN Come here a minute . Sit down . She sits , and makes him sit beside her . Now listen ; it is n't really important whether I care for you or not , or whether or not you care for me . If you were Tristan and I were Isolde , and we 'd drunk a deathless love potion , there would be nothing that we could do about it  --  nothing . Do n't smile . There are some things one can do nothing about . One is being born . One is love . And one is death . Oh , yes  --  Tristan and Isolde could go into the wilderness for love , perhaps , but not you and I. At least , not together . I do n't know about you . You are younger ; less sophisticated , not so restless , I hope ; but you are selfish ; and you are comfort-loving , just as I am  --  and , after all , there are no wildernesses any more , are there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall I call it , like Juliet , " this bud of love " should prove a beauteous flower , it could bloom only to be trampled in the mire , and I do n't want that . I 'd rather  --  She breaks off , the catch in her voice again , but a certain amusement , more at herself and at Fate than at him , in her smile . THAYER Soberly . I wish I could believe that , at least , you 'd like for things to be different , and we could begin all over again together . p. 35 LADY HADEN With touching grave earnestness . I do n't know what I wish for myself , Ned . My life is like water that has gone over the dam and turned no mill wheels . Here I am , not happy , but not unhappy , as my days run on to the sea , idly  --  but too swiftly  --  for I love living . But you  --  oh , I want something very fine for you ! I want to be so proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I think of you . And so I want you to go away , my dear . London is no place for you . You 've told me something of your life in that small American city  --  how you hated it  --  how you drifted to New York after your father 's death  --  of your idleness there  --  of this aimless trip to London  --  of your half-formed dream of going to South Africa in search of a fortune . Last week when I was in the country , I thought a great deal about all you had told me . Why do n't you go to South Africa , at once ? THAYER Slowly , not quite believing in her sincerity . I have n't much philosophy , I suppose , but I believe in living and letting live , and if I want to stay in London as long as I can afford it , I do n't see why you should object . I 'm finding London a pretty jolly place . Besides , I 've had some good business offers lately  --  LADY HADEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was one , yes . He 's a big man , in America . LADY HADEN But rather lonely in London . I know . . . go on . THAYER Yes , I know all that , too . You 've taken me up , as they say , and Rudolph Solomon thinks you might do the same thing for him if he paid me a salary . But  --  even that  --  would n't be so bad as  --  I never told you , did I , that I went to Alaska once ? I was educated to be a mining engineer . I went out there thinking all I had to do was to remember what I 'd read in books . I stood it for two years ; then I came back . Good God ! You do n't know what those places are ! The loneliness , the dirt , the cold . You 're just an animal living in a world outside the world  --  where nothing ever happens , except your own misery . You read newspapers half a year old , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even behind the bars of a jail  --  than to hang on any longer to a life that is n't a life . . . . The thought of a dinner in a decent restaurant makes you limp with homesickness . Oh his voice changes suddenly , and he is apologetic for himself it 's only that I have n't the stamina for that sort of thing , I suppose . I suppose I 'm really no good , maybe , but I 've decided that my future , if I 've got one , is going to be spent in the pleasantest places I can find . p. 37 LADY HADEN Rising , with a laugh . I 've been fantastic again . After all , as you say , why should n't you stay in London ? THAYER Yes , why should n't I stay in London ? He rises and stares into her eyes . LADY HADEN And there will always be Mrs. Leslies to make even the pleasantest places more pleasant ! THAYER With genuine amazement . Mrs. Leslie ! I thought  --  LADY HADEN With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'm not jealous , Ned . THAYER But do n't you like her ? LADY HADEN She 's very pretty ; she 's amusing sometimes ; and she plays admirable bridge . I 'm not jealous , but I think I might like her better if I liked you less . THAYER But she 's nothing to me ! We met on the . She 's absolutely nothing to me  --  LADY HADEN I believe that . . . . Well  --  we must n't keep her and Harry Charteris waiting any longer , must we ? She starts toward the door at the left. p. 38 THAYER She 's a good sort , but you 're tired of her , just as you 're tired of me , now . She told me only today that you 'd be throwing us both over , soon . LADY HADEN You make me feel a thousand , sometimes , Ned ! Do you really believe that I 'm tired of you  --  when I upset all my lack of principles in order to give you good advice ? THAYER What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send me to South Africa , a million miles away from you ? LADY HADEN Gently , indulgently , but with wistfulness . Believe it , then , my friend . Believe anything you want to believe . That 's what most of us do . But if , in the future , you do n't see a great deal of me , and your healthy suggests now and then that you 're not a young man whom a woman ought to get tired of , just remember everything  --  everything  --  that I 've said  --  or not said  --  to you tonight . You 're very young , my dear ; when you 're , I 'll be  --  oh  --  never mind ! She laughs just wryly enough to make him smile and leads the way into the next , quickly . The door closes behind them . The stage is dark for an instant to denote the passage of an hour or so . Then the room flashes back , just as it was before . Suddenly MRS . LESLIE , abject and trembling , enters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror , near the door to the hall , as if powerless to go on . HARRY CHARTERIS , grave and alarmed , after an instant follows her. p. 39 MRS . LESLIE In a frightened whisper . What  --  what is she going to do ? CHARTERIS Curtly . I do n't know . LADY HELEN enters from the same room , in so furious a rage that she wears the superb aspect of a violent goddess walking on wind . EDWARD THAYER follows , helpless , humiliated , and in despair . LADY HADEN Looking at him , and shuddering away  --  intense bitterness in her voice . Oh , God ! THAYER As he sees her contemptuous , angry smile . Do n't  --  do n't  --  do n't  --  do n't ! LADY HADEN Harry  --  it was absolutely undeniable , was n't it ! CHARTERIS Absolutely ! LADY HADEN Looking from EDWARD to MRS . LESLIE . You fools ! Fools ! God knows what you thought ! To THAYER . God knows why you should have done this a second time ! You must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was insane ? Did you think I had such supreme faith in you that I would n't believe the evidence of my own eyes ? Not when your miserable signals  --  She pauses , growing rigid with the thought . Or has dishonesty become such a habit with you that you 've got to cheat whenever you get the chance ? Is that it ? You 'd better go , Mrs. Leslie . Do n't try to speak to me . Just go ! p. 40 MRS . LESLIE Yes , yes , yes , I 'll go ! I 'll . . . You could n't understand  --  Her words end in a sob . LADY HADEN Interrupting . You 're quite right ! I could n't possibly understand , thank God !  --  Let her out , will you , Harry ? HARRY leads the way from the room , silently . MRS . LESLIE 's sobbing ceases , but as she pauses in the doorway to the hall , she turns a look of envy and hate on LADY HELEN and speaks bitterly . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed of ? There is insinuation in her vicious tone , her glance sweeps both THAYER and HARRY and she continues . Well , if you ever do I hope you 'll find people just as merciless as I 've found you ! LADY HADEN I hope that I will find them just as merciful , Mrs. Leslie . I shall never mention your name to anyone again , and I do n't believe that Mr. Charteris will , either . CHARTERIS Perhaps not , if Mrs. Leslie gives up bridge . He turns to her , as he opens the door . Are you ready ? p. 41 MRS . LESLIE Yes . They go . LADY HELEN and EDWARD THAYER face each other . LADY HADEN Unsteadily . This  --  this is the first time I 've ever caught anyone cheating at cards , and it 's made me  --  a little  --  ill . She moves , her eyes closed , toward the table , and manages to pour some water into a glass . THAYER starts to help her , but she holds him off by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to go too , I suppose ? Well , good night and good-bye . LADY HADEN Not yet . THAYER There 's nothing I can say now  --  except that I 'm sorry . LADY HADEN You must say that to my husband . THAYER To your husband ! LADY HADEN Yes . . . . He said it to you . You must say it to him ! THAYER You mean  --  to tell him ? LADY HADEN Of course . THAYER You wo n't ! p. 42 LADY HADEN I will ! THAYER But why ? You 'll only be putting yourself into a hole . You 'll only be admitting that you were wrong . And I wo n't ever come here again . I 'll keep out of your way  --  but you ca n't  --  you ca n't tell him ! LADY HADEN He was right . . . . I was wrong . Of course , I 'll tell him ; and I expect you to apologise to him before everyone who heard him apologise to you . THAYER I wo n't ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of man he is . He 'll tell his story all over London and it wo n't stop there . They 'll know it in New York . It will ruin me for good and all . . . . I am sorry . I 'll never do it again . I needed the money . . . . It did n't seem so awfully wrong to fake a bit in the beginning and win off people who did n't need it  --  and who did n't mind much whether they lost or not . Then it got to be a habit  --  it got so I could n't resist a chance  --  just as you said . But I 'll never do it again  --  only , for God 's sake , let me go  --  without the scandal that your husband will surely make ! Charteris will keep quiet if you ask him . . . . Turns to her . But life wo n't be worth living if everybody knows ! LADY HADEN Is that all ? Have you never heard of fair play ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turn now ! p. 43 THAYER After a pause . You do n't dare . LADY HADEN I do n't dare ? Dare what ? Admit that he was right and I was wrong ? THAYER You said tonight that if he kicked me out of the house , you 'd go out of it , too , forever . Very well ; I say that if he kicks me out , you will go out of it , too , forever . LADY HELEN 'S expression is one of utter bewilderment . He continues , desperately , recklessly . You do n't get what I 'm driving at , do you ? I mean that I 've got letters of yours  --  LADY HADEN What ? THAYER I 've got letters of yours . I 've got them right here . If you tell on me , I 'll tell on you . If you 're so keen on playing fair with your brute of a husband , I 'll play fair with him too ! You 're willing enough to see me sent to the devil , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LADY HELEN turns to him , indicating the door at the right . LADY HADEN Open that door , will you , Harry , and ask Bruce and the others to come here at once ! THAYER Wait  --  ! But at a gesture from LADY HELEN , HARRY goes to do as she has asked . There is a pause while he disappears . Then he returns , followed by the others , their cards still in their hands. p. 44 LADY HADEN To the amazed group , and particularly to her husband . I 've something to tell you  --  all of you  --  about Mr. Thayer . You were right , Bruce  --  and I was wrong  --  quite  --  quite wrong . He . . . THE CURTAIN FALLS AS SHE IS SPEAKING @x Three years later . The lounge of a hotel in New York , where , at a little after six o'clock on the afternoon of a winter day , people are still idling over the tea-tables . There is a wide doorway from the foyer at one side , and at the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a sort of balcony at the top , to which there is another entrance , to another foyer , on the opposite side from the one below . SIR EMMETT and LADY WILDERING and CHARLOTTE ASHLEY are here , and there are several other groups scattered about . The orchestra ( at the end of the balcony opposite the entrance to the foyer ) is playing the last number of its tea-time programme . Presently the musicians put their instruments away and go out . Waiters move about ; a man and a woman rise and depart ; there is a low hum of talk not quite lost in the sound of the music , and presently the voice of a young woman is heard addressing her companions , a young man and an older woman at the same table . YOUNG WOMAN Suddenly arrested , as she has turned to glance about curiously . Do you know who that is ? It 's Charlotte Ashley . YOUNG MAN The actress , you mean ? YOUNG WOMAN Yes , she 's playing the leading part in the new Shaw play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLDER WOMAN You 're wrong , my dear . That 's not Charlotte Ashley . She 's much darker . I saw her when I was in California last winter . She was pointed out to me several times . YOUNG WOMAN Do tell me about her . They say that she  --  of course they talk about everybody , but  --  She and the young man lean a little closer to listen ; their companion smiles and shrugs , and begins in a voice that is now only a whisper . SIR WILDERING Quite unconscious of the glances that are directed by the gossips at his table . Just how long have you been in America , Charlotte ? ASHLEY Eleven weeks . . . . The play has been running seven , now . SIR WILDERING It 's the first time you 've been over for several years , is n't it ? ASHLEY Four . . . . May I have some more tea , Edith ? At a third table a man and a woman , with quiet interested voices , are speaking of the WILDERINGS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England ? WOMAN It may not be Sir Emmett Wildering . I think it is , but I do n't know him . However , I 'm sure about its being Lady Wildering . I know her quite well , by sight . She 's an American , you know . Everyone says she 's charming . p. 47 MAN He 's quite the most famous man they 've ever sent over . WOMAN I know ; I 've read his books  --  not all of them , of course . MAN You mean the political and historical ones , I suppose . . . ? She nods , and he continues . . . . But did you know that he 's also a great authority on butterflies , and has written a large volume  --  which is n't so well known as it ought to be  --  on the subject ? I must send it to you . WOMAN How interesting . . . . It 's almost half-past six . I must be going . They glance again at the WILDERINGS as they rise , and pass them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-off look in her eyes . I wonder how my dogs are . . . ? ASHLEY With a smile , and also a far-off look . I wonder how my children are . . . ? LADY WILDERING They both looked jolly well when they came to say good-bye to me two weeks ago . ASHLEY Oh , they 're well cared for  --  I know that ; but when the time comes for me to leave England and leave them at home , I almost wish that there were n't such a thing in the world as a play , or a theatre , or such a place as America . p. 48 LADY WILDERING I know what that feeling is . I used to wish that there were n't such a thing as an education when the time came to send our boys away to get one . There is a little pause . SIR WILDERING In a low voice . You have noticed , have n't you , that Harry Charteris never mentions Helen Haden ? ASHLEY Oh , yes . There is a bare pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in America . ASHLEY He 's come in for some money since his uncle 's death , of course . LADY WILDERING Yes , but I 'm afraid it 's much less than one might have expected . Do you ever see Helen , Charlotte ? ASHLEY Haltingly . No , I 've not been over very long , and I 've not  --  I  --  I do n't believe I 'd know what to say if I should meet her . LADY WILDERING I 'm afraid it would be awkward  --  almost painful  --  meeting her . What could one say ? And it would be just as difficult for her . What could she say ? ASHLEY One would be thinking of all the things one knew , or did n't know ; and she would be thinking of all that she knew one knew  --  or did n't know . p. 49 SIR WILDERING Very quietly . I should be seeing ghosts  --  ghosts of the mad Varicks racing their phantom horses down the winds of eternity ; swift riders with their plumes streaming and their armour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great race  --  warriors , courtiers , sportsmen , riding into oblivion . . . and Helen , the last of their line , following ,  --  a ghost of tomorrow . The Varicks should have made a better ending . At this instant LADY HELEN HADEN appears on the balcony at the back . She is radiant and childlike , delightfully dressed , and there is no outward sign , at least , that Fortune has not dealt gently with her . As she enters she is seen by the group at the first table . YOUNG WOMAN There 's Lady Helen Haden . She bows , but LADY HELEN does not see her . YOUNG MAN She does n't seem to know you . YOUNG WOMAN Oh , I suppose she is so used to being cut that she never looks at anyone any more , but I met her when she first came over  --  with some very nice people  --  and I always speak to her . OLDER WOMAN What a fool she was to let herself get so completely dclasse ! She 's really the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't give a dinner party without her in London . LADY HELEN catches the attention of the matre d'htel , who hurries up the steps toward her. p. 50 LADY HADEN Has anyone been asking for me , Jean ? JEAN No , my lady . LADY HADEN What time is it ? She looks at her wrist , but remembers that she has no watch . She laughs at her futile gesture . I 've no watch ! JEAN Twenty-two minutes after six , my lady . LADY HADEN So late ? Order some tea for me , Jean , while I 'm telephoning . I 'll have that table . There should be five or six of us if the people I 'm expecting turn up . JEAN Very good , my lady . She goes out and he sets about supervising the arrangement of her table . Another woman , followed by a man , enters , passing LADY HELEN going out . LADY HELEN recognises her , and gives her a short swift nod as she hurries by , but the woman with great pompousness turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend the steps speaks in a low , troubled voice . MAN She spoke to you , did n't she ? WOMAN With malicious satisfaction . Yes  --  I cut her . You know who she is , do n't you ? MAN No . She looked  --  all right . p. 51 WOMAN With a shrug . She 's Lady Helen Haden . MAN Lady Helen Haden ! But  --  what 's she doing over here ? WOMAN Have n't you heard ? Just going about with all sorts of queer people and living by her wits , I understand . Oh , here 's my cigarette-case ! I told you I left it here . . . . Having found the object she mentions , on a recently deserted table , she puts it into her bag , and the two go out again , but by the other doorway , at the side . There is an instant 's quiet . Then CHARLOTTE ASHLEY 'S voice is heard . ASHLEY I shall never forget her rage against that unfortunate young man who did cheat at cards , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his giving Sir Bruce those letters ! SIR WILDERING Just at a moment when peace might have been made for all time between them . Haden had been very much impressed by Helen 's fairness . LADY WILDERING But only an hour later , after we 'd gone and he had read the letters ,  --  every one ,  --  she walked out of the house , picked up a taxi , and drove to Claridge 's , just as she was , without even a shilling for the driver . They paid him for her , of course , at the hotel . She sat up all night , she told me , waiting for her maid to come in the morning to undress her . p. 52 SIR WILDERING And read one of my speeches , I remember . LADY WILDERING Yes , one that she found in a newspaper that had been left in the taxi . SIR WILDERING And a week later , when I saw her for the first time afterward , she seemed more upset by certain passages in that speech  --  with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles . ASHLEY Has anyone ever heard what happened to the young man ? His name was Thayer , was n't it ? SIR WILDERING He might have died that night for all I 've ever heard . Even Haden must have held his tongue about what happened . LADY WILDERING With a shrug . His pride , I suppose . Otherwise he would never have been so delicate . ASHLEY Whatever Helen had written in the letters , she evidently had written nothing that gave grounds for divorce . He did n't even mention them in his suit , a year later . SIR WILDERING He did n't need to . . . . LADY WILDERING Yes ; whatever she wrote , there could have been nothing in them to convict her of faithlessness , or her husband would not have waited a year to divorce her . That was why I was anxious , at one time , to see if things could n't be patched up between them . But she would n't hear of it . He would n't have her back , she insisted . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost school-girly , and they had turned up just on top of some sillier bills that had already spoiled Sir Bruce 's suavity for one day ; and no husband , Helen maintained , could have been expected to forgive both these letters and those bills in the same twenty-four hours . p. 53 ASHLEY I suppose it was a case of " Oh , my daughter . Oh , my ducats ! "  --  Except that it happened to be his wife instead of his daughter . That was another grievance , of course  --  that there was n't even a daughter . SIR WILDERING Well , that 's changed . The new Lady Haden , it is announced , has just achieved twins ; both boys . ASHLEY And with that dazzling event Sir Bruce passes out of Helen 's sorry tale forever , I suppose . Their thoughts silence them for the moment . There is a chatter in the doorway off the balcony , and ZELLITO and ALICE VANCE enter . ZELLITO is a handsome Spanish woman who has the look of a gypsy in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is wistfully lovely . They enter quickly , feeling that they are late , but hesitate on the balcony as their eyes search for someone whom they do not see . Presently JEAN hurries to them , and leads them to the table he has prepared for LADY HELEN HADEN . They are instantly under discussion by the group at the first table . YOUNG MAN There are two celebrities  --  YOUNG WOMAN Of a sort . YOUNG MAN Do n't be a cat . p. 54 OLDER WOMAN Recognising them . Oh , Alice Vance , and Zellito . They say she 's a dope fiend  --  Zellito , I mean . YOUNG MAN Impatiently . How can anyone be a dope fiend who has to keep herself in condition to dance ? OLDER WOMAN Defensively . Do n't ask me  --  I was never either a dope fiend or a dancer . YOUNG WOMAN As for Alice Vance , she was chamber-maid in a hotel in Chicago , they say . I believe she was in the habit of stealing ; they say the Chicago police have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say she still takes things . YOUNG MAN Why should anyone " take things "  --  as you put it  --  when Rudolph Solomon takes care of her ? YOUNG WOMAN I do n't believe that he takes care of her . She has n't any jewelry or furs  --  and she does n't dress particularly well . Besides , she may be just a pathological kleptomaniac . YOUNG MAN There 's nothing under heaven that you ca n't hear in New York . ZELLITO and ALICE VANCE , in the meantime , have settled themselves at the table reserved for LADY HELEN HADEN ; but while ZELLITO , speaking in French to JEAN , is ordering cigarettes brought immediately , ALICE VANCE recovers a bracelet that falls , unnoticed , from ZELLITO 'S wrist as she jerks off her glove . She stares at it for an instant after the waiter has gone , and then hands it to ZELLITO , speaking quietly. p. 55 VANCE This came off with your glove . If I had not seen it fall to the floor it might have been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ florid Spanish accent in both her French and her English . Oh ! What good fortune ! Merci , chrie ! It is of great value . I must see why the catch so easily gives away . She holds it up , and then kisses it as she speaks , continuing with shining eyes as ALICE VANCE laughs at her emotion . It is beautiful , is it not ? Jewels ! Ah , but they are my passion ! And you say you care for them nothing ! Is it really true ? You mean that ? VANCE It is true , I care nothing for them , Zellito . ZELLITO Replacing her bracelet on her arm , testing the clasp , and becoming intimate and practical as she leans across the table . You are foolish , chrie . You should , at least , pretend a longing for them ; you should want this , and want that , and get many fine ones from your friend ; for jewels are like money . As ALICE is about to protest , she hurries on , cynically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but even a rich man finds it pleasanter to give jewels than money . A fortune of jewels you should get from him ! p. 56 VANCE Dreamily . I care nothing for diamonds and pearls and money , Zellito . Rudolph knows that . ZELLITO With a shrug . He would better like you if you did ! VANCE Thousands of women do . They are not difficult to find . ZELLITO Half amused , half impatient . Ah , sweet little fool ! Do you think really lives the man who has appreciation of the woman who asks nothing but love ? Eh , bien , live he may , but he is not Rudolph Solomon . VANCE Quietly . You do not know him . ZELLITO I know men . VANCE He is not like other men . ZELLITO And when he tires ? You do not dream he is not to tire ? What then ? VANCE It will not matter . Her voice is profoundly sad . ZELLITO With unction . I thank the good God that a lady he did not make me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , in the Bank of England alone I have a hundred thousand pounds . And my jewels make another fortune . Let us smoke these abominable cigarettes , chrie , though one would say that they were made for babies when they tire of milk . However  --  She lights one of the cigarettes that the waiter has just brought . RUDOLPH SOLOMON , an important-looing man , middle-aged , a Jew of great distinction , enters through the doorway on the balcony . Both JEAN and his assistant see him at once , and hurry to meet him. p. 57 JEAN A table , Mr. Solomon ? SOLOMON Has Lady Helen Haden been here this afternoon ? JEAN Yes , sir . This is her table , sir . She 's ordered tea  --  He leads the way , and places a chair for RUDOLPH SOLOMON at the table with ZELLITO and ALICE VANCE . Their greetings are a murmur lost , for the moment , in the gossip of the group of busy-bodies near by , who of course are watching him with great interest . YOUNG WOMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Alice Vance . What did I tell you ? She was here a minute ago . YOUNG WOMAN That does n't mean anything . Lady Helen Haden was here a moment ago : probably he 's come to meet her . . . . They say his new house cost two million dollars . RUDOLPH SOLOMON , who has n't yet sat down , is about to do so , when , glancing toward the doorway as if he might go in search of LADY HELEN HADEN , he pauses , arrested and amazed at finding himself face to face with EDWARD THAYER , who has just entered hurriedly , but who , to the eye at least , is a far more impressive figure of a young man than the EDWARD THAYER who cheated at cards , at LADY HELEN HADEN 's house , three years ago. p. 58 SOLOMON Thayer ! Edward Thayer ! THAYER Oh , Mr. Solomon ! How do you do ? You 've not forgotten me ? SOLOMON Certainly not . THAYER I supposed everyone had . SOLOMON But where have you been all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOLOMON I want to hear it . THAYER You 're very kind . I do n't know that it would interest you . It 's a pretty dull story . SOLOMON Are you in a hurry ? He indicates the tea-table . THAYER Reluctantly . Yes , I 'm sorry ; but I must catch a train in fifteen minutes . I 'm looking for the man who is going with me . He 's not here  --  so  --  SOLOMON I wo n't keep you . When will you be back ? THAYER A week from today . SOLOMON Dine with me that night . He finds a card which he gives THAYER . THAYER Thanks  --  I  --  p. 59 SOLOMON At my new house . About eight . Here 's the address , on this card . THAYER Thanks . Eight o'clock . A week from tonight . I 'll be there . SOLOMON And if you 're still looking for something to do  --  THAYER Thanks  --  that 's ever so good of you  --  but I 'll tell you about that later  --  They touch hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he entered . SOLOMON sits . The waiter brings the tea . SOLOMON Half to himself , glancing after THAYER . Curious , is n't it , how one is always meeting people ? That young man , for instance : I was thinking of him this morning for the first time in months . I met him in London several years ago . I liked him , but I was n't very sure how he 'd turn out . I 'm glad that he looks as if things had gone well with him . . . . Why did I think of him this morning , Zellito , and see him today ? Do your fortune-telling gifts explain coincidences of that sort ? ZELLITO I will tell you , but  --  She leans toward him , and talks with considerable animation . HARRY CHARTERIS , who has entered by the balcony doorway , like a man hurrying in a dream , goes quickly to the WILDERINGS ' table , leans over a chair , and speaks in a grave , low voice. p. 60 CHARTERIS Well  --  I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they look up , startled . Helen ? CHARTERIS Yes , Helen . It is as though he were still seeing her  --  not his companions . ASHLEY Really ? Where ? When ? CHARTERIS An instant ago  --  going into a telephone booth . She did n't see me . He sits . There is a slight pause , then he continues , half angrily , half bitterly . What are we going to do about her ? ASHLEY There 's nothing we can do . . . is there ? LADY WILDERING I 'm afraid she would n't want us to do anything . CHARTERIS You mean she tries to avoid old friends ? His tone is ironical as he pronounces the last two words , but CHARLOTTE hurries to speak , gently , persuasively . ASHLEY I think so , or she would have looked me up at the theatre . LADY WILDERING She 's never written to any of us since she came to America . Yes , I 'm afraid she would n't want to see us. p. 61 CHARTERIS If she does n't , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even know where she lives . . . . But Helen 's an Englishwoman and our own kind , and although she 's tried  --  in every possible way  --  to cut herself adrift from us , there 's nothing  --  nothing in the world  --  that I would n't do for her  --  SIR WILDERING But it 's just because she is an English-woman and our own kind that we must be stern with ourselves about her . She had a great name , great traditions , great charm , great gifts , and in God 's name what has she done with them ? For her personal misfortune one might be sorry  --  one is sorry , sorry beyond all words ; but as an Englishman , and as the representative of my King , I can not forgive an Englishwoman for making , in a strange country , a sneer of her class , a joke of her rank , and a miserable adventure of her life . ASHLEY As if she had been listening to her own thoughts instead of to his words . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bridge . We were all there , and now we are all here . How strange ! CHARTERIS And Helen is out there alone , trying to find someone , I suppose , to have a cup of tea with her . . . . Good God ! As he has glanced toward the door while speaking , LADY HELEN HADEN has appeared on the balcony . But she comes forward , not noticing anyone in the room until his gaze seems to draw hers . Her voice as she recognises him is a cry  --  but a sudden radiance , more moving than tears , brings the tears with it to her eyes as she looks from one to another. p. 62 LADY HADEN Harry ! Charlotte ! And Edith ! And  --  all of you ! It 's too wonderful . . . There is a bare pause . A sudden panic of shyness sweeps over her as SIR EMMETT rises slowly , his face grave . But as he looks at her he indicates his own chair . SIR WILDERING Sit here , my dear . LADY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Charlotte  --  Edith  --  bless you ! LADY WILDERING Helen , dear  --  ASHLEY Oh , Helen ! LADY HADEN One never knows how much one loves England . . . She does not finish , but lays her hand for an instant on SIR EMMETT 's , and then turns quickly to the others , talking rapidly . This is like home , is n't it ? How does it happen that we are all really here ? Of course  --  to CHARLOTTE  --  you 're easily explained . I 'm so glad your play is a success . I 've been to see you five times ! How are the children ? They 're at home , I suppose ? And so grown up that I would n't know them any more  --  the darlings ! ASHLEY Yes , they 're at home and very grown up  --  the darlings ! I must show you their pictures . Will you come and dine with me , soon ? p. 63 LADY HADEN Rather ! ASHLEY When ? LADY HADEN Any time at all , except a week from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own thoughts . I really have an engagement a week from tonight . . . . Then she hurries away from the irony of what she is saying  --  and turns quickly to LADY WILDERING . I read that they were sending Emmett over . It 's a good thing , too . Is n't it a pity that England has n't enough Emmett Wilderings to go round ? She can only send him one place at a time . When did you arrive ? LADY WILDERING Only today at noon . LADY HADEN Oh , that accounts for my not knowing ! I always read every name on the list of passengers that every ship brings . How are the Lepidoptera , Emmett ? ASHLEY The what ? SIR WILDERING That 's what we scientists call butterflies  --  among ourselves ! I 've had to neglect the Lepidoptera these last few years , my dear . LADY HADEN I was afraid so . You see , I 've read all your books as they 've come out , and all your speeches , and I knew you 'd had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'm glad it was only the butterflies and not Edith . She does n't look neglected , does she ? But I think you 're wrong about our policy in Egypt . We ought to  --  She laughs and stops . No , I have n't the courage to argue with you any more about anything . I have n't even seen England for two years . I do n't know what we ought to do ; only certain things have looked very mysterious from a distance . Then there 's the labor question ; and there still is , always was , and always will be , Ireland ! I worry a lot about Ireland . p. 64 SIR WILDERING Shall we have a long talk and thrash it all out ? LADY HADEN Yes , rather . SIR WILDERING When are you going to dine with us ? LADY HADEN Any time  --  you 're probably frightfully busy . I suppose you 're going straight through to Washington . SIR WILDERING Yes . Our train leaves in less than an hour . But we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're dining with me Sunday . You 'll see Helen then . LADY HADEN Am I dining with you , Harry , on Sunday ? CHARTERIS If you will . LADY HADEN Quietly , as she tears the tea-card and writes on half of it . I must give you my address and my telephone number . Then you can let me know if you want to change your plans  --  or if anything happens . ASHLEY Nothing is likely to happen before tomorrow , in any event , so shall we say my hotel  --  the Plaza  --  at seven ? I must be at theatre early , you know . LADY HADEN Laying the card that she has written on the table before them ; and flashing her answer at CHARLOTTE swiftly . Seven . The Plaza . Thanks . . . . Now I must be going . . . . p. 65 LADY WILDERING But you have n't had your tea . Let us order some for you . LADY HADEN No , no ! It 's been enough for one time  --  seeing all of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you how I  --  how I 've loved it . She moves as if to rise , but does n't ; then her impulse of sudden shyness passes , and she hurries on , with a sort of breathless gaiety , turning to LADY WILDERING . You have n't told me about the dogs yet , but you must next time . I still have Plato . You gave him to me when he was a pup , remember ? He will want to know all about his relatives at home . Plato and I have talked a lot about you  --  Plato and Blossom and I. You remember Blossom  --  my maid ? She 's still with me . . . . Poor Blossom ! She stops short , then turns to HARRY , speaking quietly , gently . I have n't tried to tell you and I did n't try to write  --  how sorry I was to hear of your uncle 's death . It was a great pity . He was n't old , or tired of living , or unhappy . . . . CHARTERIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to the very end . He thought it was  --  on the whole  --  a very good show . LADY HADEN I know . Englishmen are like that . They love life more and value it less than any other people in the world . . . . I wo n't say even au ' voir . . . . Again she moves as if to go , but a great reluctance prevents , as she talks on and on , nervously , gaily , in an exquisitely husky voice that has nothing to do with the words it is saying . Zellito 's waiting . You remember Zellito ? The Spanish dancer at the Gaiety who used to tell fortunes in my booth at every bazaar ? What fun they were  --  those bazaars ! And we used to think them bores  --  at least , I thought I did . . . . She still tells fortunes sometimes , although she will never tell mine . She pretends that she ca n't make out whether I 'm to live on forever , or die eventually as most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Three Wonderful Waltons are coming to tea . They 're acrobats  --  p. 66 ASHLEY Acrobats ! LADY HADEN Smiling at her amazement . Oh , yes . Zellito discovered them in one of her music-halls . They 're Croatians and they have splendid characters . They send their money home for their relatives to buy goats with . Their only immorality is cream-puffs . Cream-puffs are not for acrobats , but they admit that they ca n't resist them . She finds RUDOLPH SOLOMON 's eyes meeting hers and signals a greeting to him with a little wave of her hand , as she hurries on . And Rudolph Solomon . . . . You must have heard of Rudolph Solomon  --  the American rival of the British Museum ? He 's a wonderful person really , even if he used to seem a bit too keen on knowing us . And , Harry ,  --  you 'd really like my friend Alice Vance . She 's a Broadway celebrity , but she has a real voice , and she 's a great dear . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 's there ! " . . . Only it is n't April , is it ! I suppose it 's snowing in the fens . . . . I wo n't say even au ' voir . . . . This time she rises . The others do the same . ASHLEY A bit unsteadily . I ought to go  --  LADY HADEN There are my acrobats now ! THE WONDERFUL WALTONS have entered  --  squat , swarthy men with bullet-shaped heads , dressed to the very tip-top of fashion , with somewhat alarming results . They conduct themselves in their best public manner  --  a manner which is not without navet and charm . They are not exactly disconcerted at seeing their hostess talking to her friends at another table , but when they see her rise they know it is more correct to stand while she is standing , and they wait in rigid formation for her to join them . LADY HELEN continues swiftly . The poor darlings  --  they 've gone and dressed themselves in their best ! Perhaps that 's why they 're so late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with the iniquitous cream-puffs . . . . So  --  She hesitates just an instant , her voice again deep with feeling , her eyes bright . I wo n't say even au ' voir  --  bless you . She turns quickly and hurries to greet THE WALTONS . CHARLOTTE ASHLEY and LADY WILDERING , followed by SIR EMMETT and HARRY CHARTERIS , go up the steps and disappear through the door that leads from the balcony p. 67 LADY HADEN To THE WALTONS . How do you do ? I 'm very relieved at seeing you . I was afraid that you had been tossing one another about too carelessly at the matine . Do sit down . She sits , nodding to the others . Have I been long ? I 'm sorry . I hope you 've had your tea  --  and that there 's some for me . Oh , thanks  --  ALICE VANCE gives her a cup that she has just poured . But you have n't met , have you ? Mr. Rudolph Solomon  --  the Three Wonderful Waltons . The introduction excites THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brothers . THE FIRST WALTON Millionaire ! He rises promptly and makes his best stage bow with his best stage smile , addressing SOLOMON . I am delightful . THE SECOND WALTON Also . I am delightful . THE THIRD WALTON Also . I am delightful . They sit . It is obvious that they do not bore LADY HELEN . LADY HADEN To SOLOMON . And are n't you delightful , too ? They 've their best English out for your benefit . p. 68 SOLOMON Directly to LADY HELEN but with a smile for THE WALTONS who are beaming at him . I am as delighted as you 're delightful . LADY HADEN To THE WALTONS . Tea ? THE FIRST WALTON No tea ; no coffee . Ver ' bad for peoples in our professions . LADY HADEN Then what shall I order for you ? THE THREE Together . Milk . LADY HADEN To a waiter hovering for the order . Milk for three  --  and pastries . THE WALTONS put their heads together and whisper about something . SOLOMON To LADY HELEN . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briefly . Yes . SOLOMON He 's a very great man . I 'm glad that England has sent him over . It is obvious that he is interested in the WILDERINGS , but she is not eager to discuss them. p. 69 LADY HADEN He 's a great dear  --  they both are . . . . I want you to meet Harry Charteris , Alice . She has turned to ALICE VANCE . I was just speaking to him about you . He 's very musical . I think he knows all the folksongs in the world . I 've often heard him play the one you sing about the fisher-girl . ZELLITO Ironically . It is a sad song about love , I suppose . All Alice 's songs about love are sad . LADY HADEN Sad  --  but beautiful , too , Zellito . Especially the music . Although I like the words too . She recites the words , quickly , carelessly , but with a sudden far-off look of patient pain in her eyes , as if somehow they had a special meaning for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why fares my lover never forth Any more at eventide To walk the beaches by my side ? " For has he ridden out to sea , On some sea-wind , forgetting me ? Or has he wandered to the town To some girl in a silken gown ? THE FIRST WALTON Who has been bursting with importance , breaking the sharp pause that follows by addressing SOLOMON . We wish that we place moneys in your hand . We wish that you take money  --  make more  --  keep some , and give to us fortune . His brothers nod violently in agreement. p. 70 THE SECOND WALTON We give ten thousand you . THE THIRD WALTON You make fifty maybe , maybe hundred thousand . We go home then like kings . THE FIRST WALTON You take money ; we trust you ; no writing . LADY HADEN To SOLOMON . You probably never received a greater compliment in your life . . . . Ah , here are the cream-puffs and the chocolate clairs and your milk . . . . The waiter serves THE WALTONS . SOLOMON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lose your money ? They again put their heads together  --  this time eating and drinking as they whisper . To LADY HELEN . I hope you 'll bring your friend  --  Charteris was his name , was n't it  --  to dine next Friday . Alice is coming later , after the theatre and they might try some of their folksongs together . LADY HADEN Thanks ; I 'll ask him . SOLOMON As if aware that she is careless about dates . Friday  --  a week from tonight  --  remember ! ZELLITO In a panic . Zis is not Friday ! p. 71 SOLOMON Yes , it is Friday , Zellito . ZELLITO Bouncing up from her chair . Mon Dieu ! And I thought it was Tuesday ! I have no head for such things ! I can not remain one moment longer . I have an engagement of great importance . LADY HADEN But it 's rather late if you 're going on for tea somewhere else . ZELLITO Tea ! It was a dinner , chrie , at seex , wiz a millionaire from Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's only  --  ZELLITO Interrupting . Do you think it possible to dine  --  like zis  --  wiz a millionaire ? I am not a fool . I do not neglect opportunities . He has seen me dance in Paris  --  and I must at least be chic . I will get at once to a telephone and then make quick haste . Be an angel , Alice , and drop me from your motor . I have quite lost my head ! VANCE Of course . I 'll meet you at the door . ZELLITO I will be just one instant at the telephone . Au revoir , Lady Helen . She turns to SOLOMON . Au revoir , mon ami , he is not so rich as you , but it ees my type he happens to admire . . . . Friday  --  and I thought it was Tuesday ! With a nod to THE WALTONS she hurries away . ALICE VANCE rises. p. 72 LADY HADEN But must you really go , too ? VANCE I 'm afraid so . RUDOLPH SOLOMON has risen . SOLOMON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't bother  --  But he has followed ZELLITO through the door to the right . LADY HADEN Holding ALICE 's hand an instant as if to detain her . Next time we 'll begin earlier . . . . And I hope you 'll sing for me alone again soon . VANCE I will . May I telephone ? LADY HADEN Yes , rather . VANCE Au revoir , then , and thanks so much for asking me today . You  --  you always seem so  --  so kind . She moves away quickly , but meets RUDOLPH SOLOMON returning . They speak for an instant in a low , intimate voice . LADY HELEN is aware of them , although she does not turn her head , and there is a look of troubled speculation in her eyes as she thinks of them . THE WALTONS have reached some decision and are now energetically finishing the last of their pastries. p. 73 VANCE To SOLOMON , casually , yet with great wistfulness . Shall I see you tonight , Rudolph ? SOLOMON I 'll telephone later . VANCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go straight home after the theatre , so come if you like  --  though I wo n't let myself really expect you . SOLOMON With sudden gentleness . I think I must make you promise to go straight to bed , and straight to sleep . You 're looking tired . I 'll telephone in the morning and find out if I 've been obeyed . How 's that ? VANCE Looking away from him and seeing beyond the doorway . There 's Zellito . Please go back to Lady Helen . Good-bye . She goes quickly without giving him a chance to answer . He stares after her an instant , then he resumes his seat at LADY HELEN 's table . THE FIRST WALTON Instantly to SOLOMON . You take money ; make fortune maybe . Maybe lose money ; all right ! THE SECOND WALTON Yes , all right . THE THIRD WALTON Yes , all right . We decide it . p. 74 THE FIRST WALTON You think and decide , too . We bring ten thousand to you tomorrow what hour you like . SOLOMON Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk it for you come to see me between ten and one . Here 's the address . The Croatians beam with pleasure as SOLOMON gives them a card . THE FIRST WALTON rises and makes an elaborate bow . THE FIRST WALTON Thanking you , Gentleman ! The others do the same . THE SECOND WALTON Thanking you , Gentleman ! THE THIRD WALTON Thanking you , Gentleman ! Then they turn to LADY HELEN . THE FIRST WALTON Repeating his bow , kissing her hand . We go now  --  thanking you for delicious supper , my lady . THE SECOND WALTON Doing the same . Very much thanking you , my lady . THE THIRD WALTON Next time we spik more in new Englees , maybe . Thanking you , my lady . LADY HADEN It was charming of you to come . Good-bye . THE WALTONS assemble as if for a curtain call , to bow a farewell to SOLOMON. p. 75 THE FIRST WALTON At stylish function you give maybe sometime Wonderful Waltons will perform free for you , gentleman , many superb acrobatic acts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one airy kiss from the finger-tips of their hands , they smile once more , and then march with high , elastic steps through the door at the right . LADY HADEN Turning from watching them back to SOLOMON , laughter in her eyes . You 'll feel like Trimalchio  --  or some other opulent old Roman  --  when my Croatians do their superb acrobatic acts for your especial benefit . You must promise to let me be there to see them . SOLOMON Quietly , with a note that is faintly warning in his voice . You 're very child-like , Lady Helen . LADY HADEN Is that why you are looking at me so sternly ? Are you thinking that I 've got my frock very soiled ? SOLOMON I 'm thinking that you 've played very hard , and been very reckless . LADY HADEN So I have . It 's sometimes very difficult to realise that this is a serious world  --  and that life is something more than a hilltop in the sun , with an adventure lurking back of every flower . There are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one grows , and the more one is alone , the oftener one smiles to one 's self . I do n't say that they are always happy smiles  --  but just the fact of being alive is rather gay : " For to admire and for to see , For to behold this world so wide "  --  only an Englishman would have thought of saying that . . . . She breaks off sharply and then resumes . Thank you for the set of Conrad 's books . I love them . Do you know the South Sea Islands ? We cruised among them all one winter . The stars are very wonderful . We lived on the yacht , and put in at every port that took our fancy . You should do that sometime  --  if only for the stars and the big strange nights . Where are the cigarettes ? She pauses . He lights a match for the cigarette that he gives her . She draws at it , thoughtfully , suddenly silent. p. 76 SOLOMON Go on . LADY HADEN There 's nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bored you ? He looks at her without answering . She smiles at his intentness . Now , what are you thinking of , my friend ? SOLOMON Slowly , quietly , almost coldly . I was thinking of a shooting star , Lady Helen  --  a star that I once saw fall from the sky into that dark garden of water that lies between New York and the outer ocean . She smiles ironically , understanding his meaning . He continues . I was a newsboy , and I had sold all my papers ; I was lying on the grass in Battery Park because that was better than going to the place that I called home . I was half asleep when I saw the lightning of the shooting star . . . . LADY HADEN Looking at him again as he pauses . And now what are you thinking of ? SOLOMON I was thinking that there are better things in life than cruising beneath the stars on the South Seas , even . LADY HADEN It is very beautiful  --  cruising beneath the stars on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance ; the progress of one 's spirit upon a pilgrimage of achievement ; the building of one 's life after the plan of one 's dream . . . . When the grass of Battery Park was my bed , an earl , to me , was as legendary as the Santa Claus that drove his reindeer down the chimney of more fortunate children at Christmas-time . An earl 's daughter was as remote as the farthest star in the night . Yet here we are , Lady Helen  --  you and I. p. 77 LADY HADEN Yes , here we are ; you and I. . . . SOLOMON I suppose that I seem to you very conscious of all that I have got from life ? Well , I am conscious of it . It 's a great satisfaction to have got what one has wanted ; and I 've not stopped , you know , at getting money . I know the world , and all its finest things  --  its cities , its music , its literature and all its enjoyable games . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my house there are marbles and swords and fans , souvenirs of popes and emperors , warriors and queens , and immortal courtesans . I 've touched the future , too . My money is building projects that will benefit generations not yet born . LADY HADEN It 's power that you 've really wanted  --  and have got , is n't it ? SOLOMON Power  --  and the flavour of life at its rarest ; and to know that , there is one thing more that I must have . I want you . LADY HADEN With uneasy irony . But I 'm no longer a sufficiently precious object for the golden cabinet of your very successful life ! SOLOMON Quietly . But I want you . . . . LADY HADEN That 's rather ambiguous . p. 78 SOLOMON I want an ambiguous thing  --  romance . LADY HADEN Oh , I see ! There is a pause . A smile plays about her lips . He watches her closely . Presently she meets his eyes , and speaks a little sternly . But there is Alice Vance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HADEN It means nothing to you at all , I suppose , that she cares for you ? SOLOMON Very sincerely , then with lightness . If she does , I 'm sorry ; but that 's the usual tragedy of the heart , is n't it ? Caring for someone who does not care for you ? LADY HADEN With quiet and smiling irony as she quotes his words . I believe that it is  --  " the usual tragedy of the heart . " And one tragedy , more or less , in a world of tragedies , does n't matter . . . ? SOLOMON Choosing not to answer her directly ; with delicate insinuation . We might go very far together  --  you and I. LADY HADEN And I 'm not likely to go very far alone , I suppose . p. 79 SOLOMON I do n't know . I ca n't say . To me you seem singularly in need of someone to take care of you  --  to take care of you devotedly . I do n't want you to disappear into the darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I can save you , always . LADY HADEN Poverty , you mean ? SOLOMON Yes . You 're very wonderful now , Lady Helen , but there 's " tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow . " LADY HADEN I know . And old age around the curve , and just one more pearl . . . . She looks at the ring on her finger , and laughs a little . SOLOMON One more pearl ? LADY HADEN That 's a joke you 're not supposed to understand . SOLOMON Suddenly . Tell me  --  do you feel that I 'd be a dull or repulsive companion on another cruise , for instance , on the South Seas ? LADY HADEN It is n't what sort of companion you 'd be . It 's that I should have to cruise forever  --  among unknown islands , and on uncharted seas , if I once left port with you upon that journey . SOLOMON I see . Then try to think of me as the companion of more discreet pleasures ; as a friend , very much at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 80 LADY HADEN After a pause . I wonder if I could . I 'm afraid not . SOLOMON I wish that you 'd be frank and explain to me just where the fine lines of your code are drawn . LADY HADEN Is n't it sufficient that they have been drawn so carelessly that you make me this ambiguous offer ? SOLOMON You resent it ? LADY HADEN Oh , no  --  no . . . . You probably know exactly what most things in the world are worth  --  even romance . Well  --  whatever is ahead for either of us , we have found life a strange adventure , have n't we ? We 've each come a long distance . The little newsboy has come a long way from his bed on the grass in Battery Park , and the child who was christened Victoria Helen Alexandria Varick has come a long way from the arms of that gracious Queen who was her godmother . SOLOMON And no one knows how much farther each of us has to go , Lady Helen , " tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HADEN No , no one knows ; but it 's a part of the adventure to keep one 's courage , and not to care too greatly how the wheel of fortune turns ; for we must all go from the game , empty-handed at the end , and if we 've played fairly I do n't believe that we will mind , really , when the moment comes to blow out our candles , and sleep . p. 81 SOLOMON You mean  --  ? LADY HADEN I mean , my friend , that I am going to refuse your ambiguous offer , and all that it might lead to . And I really like you very much . And it 's a temptation , too , to think of the sheer decency of having enough money again for one 's whims  --  which seems so much more important , somehow , than one 's needs . But it is n't quite cricket , according to my topsy-turvy ethics , to take away a woman 's lover  --  though I suppose I should n't hesitate a moment if you were her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about love  --  true love  --  that 's very touching to me ; something at which even I can not smile . . . . Another cigarette , Monsieur , s'il vous plat . . . . Again he lights a cigarette for her . He watches the flame of the match burn down ; then he speaks quietly . SOLOMON You must have been very much in love , once . LADY HADEN I was . SOLOMON And you must have been very much hurt . LADY HADEN I was . SOLOMON And then  --  what happened ? LADY HADEN Smiling again , making an effort to veer away from the mood of emotion that has established itself between them . I ran very hard , and played very recklessly , and fell down and soiled my frock , and that 's all . p. 82 SOLOMON Did n't he care for you ? LADY HADEN Not the least bit in the world . SOLOMON And that was why  --  ! LADY HADEN Cutting him short . Oh , no ! That was n't why I played hard  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did n't care for me . I knew , at least , that the way he cared was nothing to the way I cared for him . So I had made up my mind to do what was best for him . I was married , you see . She pauses . Then she speaks again with a smile and a shrug . I had made up my mind never to see him again  --  just to be a " good influence " in his life ! SOLOMON Do n't tell me any more if you do n't want to ; but I  --  He touches her hand . I do want to know , because I do care for you ,  --  what happened then ? LADY HADEN Then ? Oh , then he cheated at cards . I could n't bear that . SOLOMON And that ended it , of course ? LADY HADEN It should have , but it did n't . That 's all . SOLOMON How long ago did this happen ? p. 83 LADY HADEN So long ago that it 's not real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've stopped thinking of him ? LADY HADEN Oh , I still wonder sometimes why it was that I  --  of all women , should have cared for him  --  of all men . I have stopped trying to explain to myself ; but now you know why I could never kill something in another woman 's heart that might be as beautiful as the thing that life killed in mine . . . . You told me over the telephone that you had an early dinner engagement . Ought n't you to be going ? SOLOMON Looking at his watch like a man who has been a little lost in his own thoughts . Yes , I should have gone before . May I take you or send you anywhere ? LADY HADEN No , thank you . Good-bye . SOLOMON Do n't forget that you are dining at my new house , a week from tonight . LADY HADEN I wo n't . SOLOMON Rising and bending over her hand , evidently conquering a desire to be less casual . We have not finished talking yet ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Some day we will say it . For you and I  --  we have , each of us , something of the incommunicable technique of magnificence . . . . Good-bye . Although I had hoped to see you quite alone today , I enjoyed your tea party , Croatians included , very much . . . . I will telephone . . . . He leaves her quickly , going through the door at the right . The orchestra returns and assembles itself on the balcony . A waiter hovers near LADY HELEN . She signals to him. p. 84 LADY HADEN Bring me some more cigarettes . He moves away quickly , knowing quite well , evidently , the sort she wants . The orchestra begins to play . She listens . Very quickly the waiter returns and places the cigarettes before her . WAITER Anything more , my lady ? LADY HADEN No . . . l'addition . He presents the account . She makes a movement to open her purse . Then she notices the amount of the bill . She holds out her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . After hesitating one instant he furnishes it ; then while she is writing her name he hurries to speak to the matre d'htel who is passing . WAITER Her ladyship asked for a pencil . The orders are not to let her sign here any more . From the corner of her eyes LADY HELEN sees them whispering . She is playing with the check , worrying it into a tube as she rolls it nervously between her fingers . Presently she catches the eye of the matre d'htel and signals to him . He comes slowly , apologetically , pleasantly , casually . LADY HADEN I wanted to speak to you about my maid , Jean . She 's an excellent maid . I 've had her for years ; but I think she could get a great deal more money if she went to someone else . They pay much more over here than we do at home , do n't they ? p. 85 JEAN Some get very good wages , my lady . Does she want a place in New York ? LADY HADEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but she ought to take one . I pay her only fifty pounds a year  --  how many dollars is that ? JEAN Not quite two hundred and fifty , my lady . LADY HADEN Well , she can do much better than that . I 've told her so : but she 's not very ambitious and if I try to find a place for her she thinks it 's because I want to get rid of her . If you hear of anyone 's wanting a maid you might telephone me . You ca n't recommend her too highly , Jean . . . . I do n't know how I shall get along without her . JEAN I 'll not forget , my lady ; and I 'll telephone if I hear of anything . LADY HADEN Thanks , Jean . Do you like America , Jean ? JEAN Slowly . It is n't Paris , and it is n't London ; and it is n't Cairo , my lady ; but I do very well here . I ca n't say that I 'm not glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one never forgets . It was in Cairo that I first served your ladyship , and her party . LADY HADEN Was it ? It 's been so long . . . . Yes , there 's something about Cairo that one never forgets . . . . The world and his wife will be coming in to dinner soon , I expect ? p. 86 JEAN Yes , my lady . We 'll begin to fill up very quickly , now . LADY HADEN Slipping a ring off her finger and round the check which she has rolled into a small cylinder . I 'll give this to you  --  and will you give my waiter his tip for me ? JEAN Taking the check with the ring about it , amazement and concern in his eyes . Certainly , my lady ! Good evening , my lady . She rises . He picks up her gloves that have fallen to the floor . She accepts them with a smile . LADY HADEN Good evening , Jean . He is still bowing , his eyes on the ring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  through the door at the right . THE CURTAIN FALLS @x An evening , a week later . A room , designed and furnished in the style of the late Italian Renaissance , in RUDOLPH SOLOMON 's house . At the back are two wide doorways , magnificently curtained ; one leads to the hall ; the other to a drawing-room . At the left is still another doorway , opening into the music-room . At the right are two windows , the medival iron shutters of which are set ajar so that one sees outside a lamplit area of upper Fifth Avenue . ALICE VANCE is standing at the end of a long table , talking to RUDOLPH SOLOMON . VANCE With some difficulty , not looking at him . So you see  --  I 'm going away  --  She breaks off . SOLOMON Quietly . I see . VANCE Suddenly moving as if to leave him . And that 's all , I think . SOLOMON Wait  --  She pauses . He continues after an instant , rather hesitantly . You will let me help you in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VANCE Oh , yes . . . . She smiles. p. 88 SOLOMON Remember ! His voice is compassionate . VANCE Quickly . Do n't be sorry for me , Rudolph ! These things always end . I never expected anything else but this some day . He does not answer . She continues lightly , casually . And now I 'm going to have a good time at your party . I 'm sorry I could n't come earlier , but I stayed to rehearse the girl who is to take my place in one of the scenes that she 's a little bit afraid of  --  Are there many people here ? SOLOMON Most of those who came to dinner have gone ; but I suppose others will be drifting in from other parties presently . VANCE Lady Helen and Mr. Charteris are still here , of course ? I 'm to sing for him , and he 's to play for me . SOLOMON Yes , they are here . And the Wilderings . Miss Ashley came after her play , and I was expecting another friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met the other day so unexpectedly at the Ritz , if you remember . He was to come to dinner , but he could n't get here ; however , I hope he 'll turn up . It will probably be a pleasant surprise for her to find another old friend among those surrounding her tonight . p. 89 VANCE You think of her always now . But after I am gone  --  you will think of me too sometimes , Rudolph , wo n't you ? SOLOMON I will , of course . I will think of you very often , Alice . LADY HELEN enters with LADY WILDERING and CHARLOTTE ASHLEY from the drawing-room at the back . LADY HADEN To SOLOMON . I 'm racing Charlotte about the house on a very impressionistic tour of inspection . To ALICE . I 'm so glad you 've come . You 're going to sing ? To the others . Do you know Miss Vance ? LADY WILDERING Oh , yes . Good evening , Miss Vance . VANCE Good evening , Lady Wildering . ALICE and CHARLOTTE exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must show you at once , Charlotte . She goes to the doorway of the music-room , and stands directing CHARLOTTE 's attention to something on the far wall beyond . Look at it from here . ASHLEY Oh , the Gainsborough ! How amazing ! p. 90 SOLOMON Have you ever seen that particular picture before , Lady Helen ? It 's from the Kingston collection . LADY HADEN Well , rather . . . . It 's my great-great-grandmother . I 'm always meeting my relatives on other people 's walls , and sometimes I have to be introduced to them  --  if they were sold off before my day , I mean  --  but not to Georgiana , Duchess of Staffordshire . She was our greatest favourite  --  and we kept her as long as we could possibly afford her , until I was six or seven at least ! Edith and I have found something else that will interest you , Charlotte ; King James ' chair . ASHLEY King James ' chair ! From Varick Hall ? LADY HADEN Turning to SOLOMON . Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall one time , and everything went so merrily that he sent for the court painter to come and do a portrait of him , to be presented as a souvenir to his host ? He was painted sitting in that very chair , and for three hundred years the chair stood against the wall , just under the picture . SOLOMON I should like to have the portrait , too . Where is it now ? LADY HADEN I do n't know . SOLOMON I should like to have it hang above the chair . p. 91 LADY HADEN Gaily . If you really want it , my friend , you 'll get it ! ASHLEY Where is King James ' chair ? SOLOMON Let me show you . LADY HADEN And take a look at the tapestries in the same room , Charlotte . I maintain that they are not good . They are almost the only things in the house that are n't , I admit , but take a glass and examine them , and see what you think . SOLOMON Lady Helen and I have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is right . I hope not . This way  --  CHARLOTTE follows him through the doorway at the left . LADY WILDERING is examining through a reading glass some drawings from a portfolio on the table . LADY HELEN sits on the carved walnut bench in front of the table , and leans against it as if a little tired ; ALICE VANCE , who has been listening , comes and sits at the other end . VANCE To LADY HELEN . It seems to me that you know something about everything in the world , Lady Helen . LADY HADEN Oh , no . Englishwomen are n't educated , you know ; our brothers are , but we are n't . My father used to say that my education cost him less than his oysters. p. 92 LADY WILDERING Looking up . But his capacity for oysters was unlimited . LADY HADEN Even so , I do n't believe that I was ever educated three hundred pounds ' worth in my life . That is  --  how many dollars ? VANCE About fifteen hundred dollars ; yet you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my child . I 'm a very ignorant woman , as you 'll find out in good time , if you see me often . VANCE I 'll probably keep my illusions about you , then  --  for I 'm to sail next week . I 'm going to Paris to live . LADY HADEN Slowly . You are leaving New York ? VANCE Quietly . Yes . I gave in my notice at the theatre a week ago . LADY HADEN But is n't that a very stupid thing for you to do  --  to leave when you 're such a success ? VANCE Singing every night is hurting my voice , and I want something more than a musical comedy career . I 'm restless here . So I 'm going back to my teacher in Paris , and the next time I 'm a success I hope it will be as Mimi or Butterfly . She is very quiet and impersonal . There is the barest pause as LADY HELEN looks at her searchingly . ALICE adds lightly , rising . Do n't you want some supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LADY HELEN catches her hand and detains her an instant p. 93 LADY HADEN The very best of luck  --  Butterfly  --  " one fine day . " ALICE smiles at her steadily . VANCE Thanks . She goes quickly . LADY WILDERING finishes with the drawings , and rises . LADY WILDERING A charming girl , is n't she ? Emmett and I must be going ; he 's very tired . One gets no rest in New York . LADY HADEN Rising and standing at the end of the table , looking down at it , speaking a little shyly in her warm , husky voice . I want to tell you , Edith , how sporting it was of you and Emmett to come tonight . Rudolph Solomon has everything except friends ; and he loves giving parties , even these nondescript affairs to all sorts of odd people . I like them , myself , but I know , of course , that you and Emmett have n't my passion for odd people ; and neither has Harry nor Charlotte . . . . So  --  thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Helen ; you know that . Besides , your friend is a very remarkable man . Meeting him has been a great pleasure for us . LADY HADEN Oh , Edith . . . . I understand what you 're all about  --  bless you ! p. 94 LADY WILDERING A little self-consciously . What are we all about ? LADY HADEN It 's a conspiracy . You 're determined to send my stock up so high that Rudolph Solomon will do me the honour of asking me to be his wife , although he does n't want to in the least . Do n't deny it , Edith ! There is such a conspiracy ; I know it , perhaps I will join it myself . . . . There 's " tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow " to be got through with , somehow ; and one must get used to the idea of the setting sun . She becomes conscious of the table which her finger-tips are touching . This table came from the Palazzo Cavalli . . . . The sun sets for cities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her greatness now . And the families that were glorious when she was glorious are only the ghosts that haunt her lagoons . . . . There is a suggestion of reverence in the way her fingers play on the wood . All her mocking gaiety is gone , and she speaks with deep feeling . I 'm not very modern , I suppose . I love old things , things that one seems to share with time . . . . It gives me a strange , warm , homesick feeling to see my **25;731;TOOLONG picture there on that wall . She goes to look at the picture , through the doorway into the next room . How young she was once  --  my great-great-grandmother ! The sun never set for her . She fell from her horse , in the hunt , and died when she was thirty , soon after Gainsborough had made her immortal . p. 95 LADY WILDERING Where is Sargent 's portrait of you ? LADY HADEN Hurriedly coming back from the doorway . It was sold . I believe that I 'm hanging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , how far and wide the winds of Fate sometimes carry the leaves from the same tree . CHARLOTTE and SOLOMON return . ASHLEY I 've seen the famous chair . LADY HADEN Gay again . You must have taken a very casual look at it . I suppose you did n't sit in it  --  as I did , for the first time in twenty years . It was rather thrilling  --  to sit there , thinking . . . . My brother and I used to play King and Queen in it  --  when we were children . We were a very royal pair and believed in having everybody flogged and thrown into the egg-shaped dungeon of our forefathers  --  particularly a religious aunt who was one of our rare white sheep , and was very much given to worrying about our poor little souls . . . . SIR EMMETT and HARRY CHARTERIS enter from the drawing-room at the back . SIR WILDERING To LADY WILDERING . Oh , here you are . Are you ready to go ? p. 96 LADY WILDERING I have been waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult to take one 's self away from this delightful house of yours , Solomon . We 've just been looking at the Chinese jades . I hope you will let us come again . LADY WILDERING To LADY HELEN . Do n't forget about our plans for the summer  --  but we will see you before we return to Washington , of course . LADY HADEN Lingeringly . I wo n't forget , Edith dear . . . . LADY WILDERING To SOLOMON . And I hope that we will see you again  --  in Washington , perhaps . SOLOMON Thanks ; you will , Lady Wildering . LADY WILDERING To others . Good night . CHARLOTTE AND HARRY Together . Good night . LADY HADEN Good night , Edith  --  Emmett  --  bless you . SIR EMMETT also nods to the others as he shakes hands with SOLOMON , near the doorway to the hall. p. 97 SIR WILDERING Au revoir , then , and thanks again for the pleasure of seeing your beautiful house . SOLOMON Au revoir . The WILDERINGS go , attended by a servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SOLOMON turns to CHARLOTTE ASHLEY . But you 've had no supper , I believe , Miss Ashley ? ASHLEY I was just going to ask you to take me in and give me some . SOLOMON To LADY HELEN and HARRY . Perhaps you will come , too ? LADY HADEN Not  --  just now . She sits on the bench again , glancing at HARRY ; it is obvious that she wishes to talk to him . SOLOMON Lingering an instant . There 's nothing you want ? LADY HADEN Nothing . Oh  --  I would like some champagne , I think . SOLOMON You shall have it , at once . To CHARLOTTE . This way  --  They go . There is a pause . LADY HELEN motions HARRY to sit beside her . He does so. p. 98 LADY HADEN Laughing suddenly as HARRY 'S troubled glance makes her a little self-conscious . Harry dear , I do n't know whether I am more amused or touched by this deep , dark plot to get me properly married and taken care of ! It makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But why do you all take so much trouble about me ? I 'm not a dbutante  --  and Rudolph Solomon is neither a shy nor an impressionable youth waiting for someone to give him his cue . He knows perfectly well what he 's about  --  and he , too , knows that I 'm not a dbutante . CHARTERIS There has been no manuvring . It is true that we are concerned about you , and that we 've not hesitated at showing our affection for you ; but why should n't we wear our hearts on our sleeves , for your sake ? A servant enters . LADY HADEN Quickly . Here 's the champagne . I 'm frightfully thirsty . Do n't you want some ? They are served . She glances at the servant , speaking with an assumption of carelessness . You might leave it there . SERVANT Yes , my lady . He leaves the tray , with the bottle , on the table , and goes . LADY HELEN drinks rather eagerly. p. 99 LADY HADEN It 's very good , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house . There is the sound of dance music somewhere in the distance . LADY HELEN talks swiftly , a little hectically  --  as if to forbid certain emotions that might intrude upon the moment . They 're going to dance . But I 'm in no mood for dancing tonight ; however , one evening not long ago I was . I do n't know why , but I wanted to dance , and it always seems to me rather shabby not to respect one 's own mood . But I had no one to dance with , and nowhere to dance . Then I remembered how shocked Blossom had been because the telephone girl at some hotel where we had tarried a few days had suggested their going to a place where you bought a ticket , and got a partner with it  --  an " instructor , " he 's called . I always remember things , so I remembered the name of the place  --  you could n't very well forget it  --  it was known as the Garden of Eden . It 's closed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was still open the night I went . CHARTERIS You do n't mean to say  --  LADY HADEN Interrupting . Oh , yes ! I went and danced until five o'clock in the morning , and got a prize ! CHARTERIS A prize ! p. 100 LADY HADEN Yes , for dancing longer than any other woman in the room . I danced for hours and hours and wore out three partners , and I was n't a bit tired when everyone else , even the Swedish couples , had finished . The prize was a purse  --  not in the best of taste , of course , but it made the black girl who comes to wash the steps outside our flat every morning quite happy . I gave it to her as I was going in . I 'd gone to breakfast at Child 's with my last partner  --  a little boy from the Argentine who 'd never been in New York before , and who was homesick for someone to talk Spanish with . . . . The black girl always calls me " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A great many people chew a gum in America , I notice . I 've tried it . It makes me feel rather like a cow . . . . Another glass , please . He pours the champagne . She adds in a very different voice . You , and Charlotte , and Edith , and Emmett , are all great dears  --  bless you . . . . CHARTERIS Oh , Helen  --  I  --  She sets down her glass , her eyes compassionate at the hurt in his voice . LADY HADEN Quietly . What is it ? Tell me , my dear . CHARTERIS Hopelessly . You know I 've always loved you . She is silent ; he continues . But I 'm not a magnificent person  --  and magnificence is in your blood . I ca n't afford you . Only  --  I ca n't bear to see you drift , like this . You 're like a lost child in an uncaring crowd . You think it 's fun  --  being lost in a crowd ; but after a while night will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  He breaks off and tries to laugh ; then resumes . I suppose I 'm very sentimental , but  --  If only you were safe ! Not drifting , not lost ! I ca n't bear it ! Again he breaks off. p. 101 LADY HADEN Quietly . Do n't bother about me . I 'm very clever at taking care of myself . CHARTERIS That is n't true . I know all sorts of things you 've done that prove that you know nothing about taking care of yourself . I happen to know that you sold some pearls in London for a few hundred pounds or so , when they were worth thousands . What you 'll do when they are all gone  --  LADY HADEN Interrupting with a smile , trying to answer lightly . Let us hope that I 'll buy others . The ones I had from Bruce could n't have had any deep sentimental associations . CHARTERIS Very well , then , let us hope that you will buy others ; but if it happens that you do n't  --  after your last pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widening eyes , but he does not see her moment of panic . He is looking instead , with bent head , into his clasped , empty hands , as he continues . I 'm sorry that I ca n't offer you myself and all my worldly possessions with something of a fine flourish , but  --  there are n't any worldly possessions , as I 've told you , to speak of  --  and  --  LADY HADEN Interrupting warmly with sudden tears in her eyes and a smile . And if there were do you think I could ever litter your life with the broken-up fragments of my own  --  even if I drifted for ever  --  ? p. 102 CHARTERIS Still not looking at her . I used to dream that some day you might let me pick up the pieces . LADY HADEN Harry  --  I 've a very great , a very real affection for you ; but if I were your mother I would n't let you marry me ! I would n't have let you do it even when I was a girl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other reasons than my extravagance and my  --  my recklessness . Some men can afford such extravagances , and cope with such recklessness . . . I thought Bruce was one ; but not you , my dear  --  CHARTERIS Passionately interrupting . If Rudolph Solomon is one  --  then in God 's name marry him ! But do n't go on like this  --  He breaks off . LADY HADEN Another glass , please . He pours the champagne for her , frowningly . She continues quietly in answer to his look . Yes , the time has come when I sometimes take the unnecessary glass . But do n't frown . . . I will make port if I can , and drift no longer . Suddenly she lifts her glass , her voice thrilling as she speaks . To England ! CHARTERIS Repeating solemnly . To England ! They drink ; her eyes are shining and her lips quivering a little as she puts down her glass . RUDOLPH SOLOMON enters p. 103 LADY HADEN To SOLOMON , turning away from HARRY , who finishes draining his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to avoid their notice . Have the Wonderful Waltons come ? And have you provided milk and pastries ? SOLOMON Smiling as he comes and stands before her ; she has not risen from her seat on the long bench in front of the refectory table against which she leans as she smiles up at him . I 've told you before that you are very childlike , Lady Helen . LADY HADEN I remember  --  the soiled frock , and all the rest of it . SOLOMON You do remember the rest of it , then ? LADY HADEN Yes  --  all of it . SOLOMON You remember an offer  --  LADY HADEN An ambiguous offer ; yes . SOLOMON Which you refused ? LADY HADEN Yes  --  though I admit to you frankly that I was tempted . It quite dazzled me to think that I should never have to bother about bills again , or try to do sums in dollars and then do them all over again in pounds . p. 104 SOLOMON Not smiling . You remember the reason that you gave as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That reason no longer exists . Alice Vance sails next week , to remain in Paris indefinitely . LADY HADEN I know . She told me . SOLOMON Well . . . ? LADY HADEN Quietly . You seem in hot haste , my friend , to be off with the old love and on with the new . SOLOMON Sitting on the bench , at the other end opposite her and speaking deliberately . I have thought of you , and you only , for months . I know you very well ; at least , I think I know you very well . You fascinated me from the moment I met you three years ago , in London  --  when you used to let me invite you to luncheon sometimes  --  and nearly always forgot to come . . . or  --  when you came  --  forgot my name . You never could remember whether it was David or Abraham or Solomon . He smiles ironically . LADY HADEN I have always been stupid about names . p. 105 SOLOMON His smile goes . Particularly about your own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues quickly . Oh , I know that if it were not so , you would still be forgetting mine ; but if mine were yours , would you be as careless of it as you have been of your own ? She stares at him ; he stares at her ; each searches the other 's eyes . His voice is low and insistent . Would you ?  --  I wonder ? LADY HADEN Gravely . If your name were mine ? Are you asking me to marry you ? SOLOMON I want to ask you to marry me . But  --  I 'm very proud of my name . That may seem a little silly to one whose ancestors have written themselves down , generation after generation , in the history of England , but I am proud of it . And it hurts me to give it into the keeping of one who has been as careless of the traditions and glories of her own  --  as you . LADY HADEN In a low voice . This is a strange wooing . SOLOMON Yes , it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes both her hands and , crossing them , holds them a little roughly ; there is an angry , impatient note , too , in his voice as he continues . I 'm not a sentimentalist ; and I 'm not a weakling . When I 've thought of marriage I 've thought of a mother for the children that I 've hoped to have . Health and dignity and simple goodness  --  these were to be her characteristics . I 've known women well enough to realize that most of them determine their fates according to their temperaments . But you , Helen ,  --  what sort of woman are you ? A mother who never had a child ? An artist without a talent ? A courtesan born to the purple ? What are you ? p. 106 LADY HADEN Simply . It does n't matter . SOLOMON Decisively . But it does matter ! For I love you . And I think you ought to be my wife . She looks at him , startled for an instant . He is still holding her hands , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant neither speaks ; then he continues , more to himself than to her . I did n't know I loved you until that day when you refused  --  He breaks off , and then continues . But for a week , now , I have known , ever since that first intimate moment together when I found you capable of deep and exquisite feeling ; when he lifts his eyes to hers , and he smiles ironically as he adds I looked into your heart and found there your love for another man  --  the thing , I suppose , that cut you adrift from your kind , and sent you , soiled and broken , to me . There is deep pain in his mood , not only for her but also for himself . She feels this , and although she answers gently there is something of the pain of a cry in her voice . LADY HADEN No , no  --  it was n't that ! It was n't love for anyone that cut me adrift . Whatever has happened , it was n't that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very beginning , one of these mistakes that sometimes happen . No one is responsible  --  except myself . . . and I do n't think it would be very wise of you to marry me , really . p. 107 SOLOMON Hush ! No other woman belongs here  --  in my house  --  except you . . . . Who was the man ? LADY HADEN What man ? SOLOMON The one you cared for ? LADY HADEN It does n't matter , does it ? . . . A name means nothing . SOLOMON You are right . It 's only the fact itself that is important . But do you  --  do you ever see him now ? LADY HADEN No . I do n't even know where he is . I have never heard of him since that dreadful night when he cheated at cards . Everything ended then . And if ever I should see him again we would not  --  we could not  --  even speak ,  --  not as strangers speak , even . SOLOMON All the same he is the ghost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ever you should see him again ? LADY HADEN With greater concern for him than for herself . Rudolph  --  it was such a little love  --  it died so soon , that it was like a child from that Never Never Land where nothing is quite real . . . . And if its ghost has walked in my heart perhaps that is because ghosts have a way of haunting empty places . She is smiling. p. 108 SOLOMON With sudden resolution . Will you marry me ? She does not instantly answer . He continues , humbly , anxiously . Do you care for me  --  at all ? LADY HADEN Hesitantly , being very honest . I  --  I like you . I 've great respect for you . And I can see how life with you would be very easy  --  very easy and very beautiful . I do , really , and of course you know that if you want me to marry you I should be quite mad if I refused . SOLOMON 'S silence and the glance between them indicates that he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he takes a key from his pocket , picks up a small metal box from the table , opens it , replaces the key , and holds the box toward her , trying to speak casually . SOLOMON You 've been selling these , one by one . They were given to you by your family  --  not your husband  --  and you kept them as long as you could . Put them on again . LADY HADEN In a low , astonished voice as she lifts a string of pearls from the box and , bending her head , winds it about her throat . Thanks . . . . SOLOMON Again seizing her hands . You will be good , wo n't you ? You 're so reckless ; but you will take care  --  wo n't you ? And let all the old miserable gossip die ? p. 109 LADY HADEN I 'll take care ; I promise . I will be good . I 'll be quite a reformed character , Rudolph , if you talk to me like that ! SOLOMON In a low voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , afraid to let him see her face , and read all that she feels at the moment . The introduction of the Fisher-Girl song , played on the piano , floats out . LADY HELEN , to steady herself , reaches for her glass of champagne . SOLOMON sees the gesture , and whispers No , dear . . . as he catches back her hand and lifts it to his lips . She is content to let him hold it so for an instant . The music fills the pause . Suddenly she lifts her head . LADY HADEN Poor Harry ! She releases herself from his handclasp and rises , her eyes filled with tears as she whispers . I 'll be back  --  in a moment . She goes swiftly out through the doorway into the hall . ALICE VANCE begins singing . . . . As the first stanza of the Fisher-Girl song ends , CHARLOTTE ASHLEY enters from the door of the drawing-room at the back . ZELLITO follows her presently . SOLOMON Rising . I hope you " did yourself well , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much too well , Mr. Solomon . A woman 's first business these days is not to do herself well . She moves toward the music-room . That was Miss Vance singing , was n't it ? SOLOMON Yes . ASHLEY And Harry Charteris is playing for her , I 'm sure . She goes into the room at the left as ZELLITO strolls toward SOLOMON . The second stanza begins . Both SOLOMON and ZELLITO are gripped by its poignant beauty . ZELLITO As the song ends . Poor Alice ! SOLOMON looks up . SOLOMON She will be an artist some day , Zellito . ZELLITO So , you are letting her go ? SOLOMON She wishes to go . ZELLITO You know why . Eh bien , everyone can not be loved ; but if you can not make her happy , you can at least make her rich . That is something . SOLOMON A little awkwardly . She knows there is nothing I would not do for her . ZELLITO That is good . I , myself , prefaire generous men to faithful . But Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes into the music-room . A servant enters from the hall. p. 111 SERVANT Mr. Edward Thayer . SOLOMON turns , a little eagerly , as EDWARD THAYER enters . He wears business clothes , and his general appearance is that of strength and manliness . SOLOMON Thayer ! I 'm delighted . I was afraid you would n't get here . THAYER I 've come direct from a fourteen-hour day at hard labor . I have n't had time to dress , you see , but I thought you would n't mind from what you said over the telephone . SOLOMON Of course not . . . . But you must tell me something more about yourself than I had from you in that telephone conversation this morning . THAYER Hesitantly . There 's nothing much to tell . I 've been in South Africa all this time  --  and I found I could stand the heat better than the cold . He puts in as if by way of explanation . Once I went prospecting in Alaska  --  but that was no good . He smiles to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went seeking my fortune I happened to find it . That 's all . SOLOMON In true romantic fashion : a diamond mine , you said . p. 112 THAYER Yes . SOLOMON Curiously . What sent you out there ? When I met you with Rena Leslie in London , you seemed a pretty soft sort of chap to me  --  attractive , and all that ; but scarcely one to go through the South African grind . THAYER Again hesitating as he speaks . You 're quite right . Certain circumstances sent me there  --  things that you must n't expect me to explain ; and I went , hating it . I went because it was my only chance . For a while I drifted about , then I began to work . I worked at anything and everything  --  wherever a man was needed . After a while I found that some of the things I 'd learned at the Boston Tech were useful after all ; and then one day I stumbled upon my mine . It took time to work it  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , on my knees , for the money needed to develop it . It just happened that they thought I 'd made a pretty good record down there . I got the money and I 've other mines now . And  --  that 's all . . . I heard someone singing as I came in . Who is she ? She has a lovely voice . SOLOMON With a start , evidently deeply impressed by THAYER 'S story . Alice Vance . I 'm forgetting that you 've been away so long that you probably know none of my guests . By the way , are you hungry ? p. 113 THAYER Very . SOLOMON Then come with me and have some supper first . There 's one person here , however , to whom you will not have to be introduced . THAYER Who is that ? SOLOMON Proudly . You had the privilege of knowing her rather well in London once . Lady Helen Haden . THAYER Lady Helen Haden ! SOLOMON You remember that I first met her with you and Rena Leslie ? THAYER Flushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pauses , self-consciously . SOLOMON Quietly , quickly , misunderstanding his confusion . I do n't know what you 've heard . But Lady Helen was divorced from Sir Bruce Haden some time ago , and is to become my wife  --  very soon , I hope . THAYER After a pause , also quietly . I am glad that I am to have the opportunity of meeting Lady Helen again , and of offering her my congratulations and best wishes . I hope that you will both be very happy . p. 114 SOLOMON Thank you . You will see her presently . Shall we go to the dining-room now ? He leads the way . THAYER follows slowly , like a man a little lost in the maze of his own thoughts . The room is empty for an instant , then laughter is heard behind the curtains in the hall and a footman appears , ushering before him MRS . LESLIE , accompanied by a very young man  --  an Italian , obviously , who seems vastly amused and entertained by all that she does . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is all right ; there 's no one here . We 'll wait while you tell Mr. Solomon . SERVANT What name , Madame ? MRS . LESLIE Just say a " mysterious lady in black , " and hurry . SERVANT Yes , Madame . He goes . YOUNG MAN How jolly you are ! To drive by a house and stop just because you see lights ! That is American . MRS . LESLIE Only half pleased by his attempt at a compliment . It is n't American exactly , but it is Rena Leslie . Of course , everyone ca n't do that sort of thing ; but I  --  SOLOMON enters , a little puzzled , but he smiles as he sees who is waiting . She breaks off speaking and stretches out both hands to him. p. 115 SOLOMON Ah , Rena ! MRS . LESLIE Rudolph ! Count Paolo del Magiore , Mr. Rudolph Solomon . The men bow . She hurries with her chatter . I 've just been back a week . I 've been in the Orient , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up fifty times a day . You 've been very wicked not to come to the telephone , but I know that you were out of town  --  or something . Somebody told me this was your new house , and the Count and I were passing , and decided to drop in on you . Are you having a party ? And is it the sort that I can come to ? Or have you a lot of queer people ? If it 's very disreputable you must invite me to stay . The Count wants to meet some American chorus girls . SOLOMON My dear Rena , I shall be delighted to have you stay  --  MRS . LESLIE Interrupting . Then why did n't you ask me properly , a week ago ? SOLOMON I thought you 'd only been back a week ? MRS . LESLIE Yes , I have  --  and I want to make some money right away . You must give me some tips on the market . What shall I buy ? And how much shall I pay ? And what shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to get it ? She breaks off as he laughs . What a gorgeous house ! You ought to like this room , Paolo . It 's Italian enough . I suppose everything in it is real ? She looks around with sharp , quick glances of inspection. p. 116 SOLOMON I hope so ! But if you want some tips you 'll have to wait until  --  MRS . LESLIE Oh ! Her sharp utterance halts SOLOMON 'S words . He turns about and , following her glance , see that LADY HELEN has entered , followed by HARRY CHARTERIS . As they advance MRS . LESLIE is like a snake coiled for defence or attack . There is a sharp pause . SOLOMON Pleasantly , seeing for the instant only LADY HELEN . You know each other , of course ? LADY HADEN Yes , it 's Mrs. Leslie , is n't it ? How do you do ? MRS . LESLIE does not answer at once , nor does she see HARRY CHARTERIS a little distance beyond LADY HELEN . SOLOMON after an instant detects the strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you know Lady Helen Haden , Rena ? MRS . LESLIE Also sharply , staring at LADY HELEN . No , I do n't ! Then she turns to SOLOMON . I think I understand your not asking me to your party , after all . One hears a great many things in New York in a week . Come , Paolo ! She makes a movement as if to go , but the young Italian has advanced quickly to LADY HELEN with a deep bow. p. 117 THE ITALIAN Lady Helen  --  you do not remember me ? LADY HELEN turns to him ; her face is like marble , but her eyes concentrate upon him , gently , in a vain effort to remember . He hurries on charmingly . But how should you ? When I was nine years old , you were my first love , Lady Helen . You came to Roma with my sister one Christmas from Switzerland where you both went to the same school . MRS . LESLIE I am going , Paolo ! CHARTERIS As she turns toward the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognises him ; he speaks sternly , angrily . If you do not remember Lady Helen Haden , perhaps you remember me ! I was Lady Helen 's partner at bridge the night that you  --  LADY HADEN Swiftly . Harry  --  it does n't matter ! MRS . LESLIE To SOLOMON , desperately . I do n't know what these people are going to say , but must your old friends be insulted because they do not choose to recognise every woman who happens to come to your house ? SOLOMON Quietly . Unless the lady who is to be my wife chooses to invite you to this house , Mrs. Leslie , you can not expect me to be greatly concerned about the treatment you receive when you intrude . p. 118 MRS . LESLIE Oh , so you 're going to marry her ! I have put my foot into it . Well , I 'm sorry ; and there 's nothing more I can say , is there ? Except good night . Again she makes a movement toward the door , but is intercepted by HARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry that I cheated at cards three years ago in Lady Helen Haden 's house in London . " You can say that , Mrs. Leslie , or I will take the trouble to tell the story to everyone who will listen to it in New York . You can promise also never to mention Lady Helen 's name again , in return for her generosity in keeping silent about your  --  shall I call it your " mistake " ? RUDOLPH SOLOMON stares at LADY HELEN at the mention of cards . She faces him steadily , as if scarcely interested in what MRS . LESLIE is being made to say . MRS . LESLIE Bitterly , parroting HARRY . Very well , I promise . I wo n't mention her name again , and I am sorry that I cheated at cards three years ago in Lady Helen Haden 's house in London . Is that sufficient ? CHARTERIS It will be when you have apologised for your rudeness to her tonight . MRS . LESLIE Haltingly . You 're very difficult . But !  --  I apologise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody ! HARRY turns away  --  as one who has finished a disgusting bit of business. p. 119 COUNT DEL MAGIORE Good night , Lady Helen . He lifts her hand and kisses it with profound sympathy . LADY HADEN With the ghost of a smile . Good night , little Paolo . MRS . LESLIE From the doorway , venomously . You were quite right to call it a " mistake , " Mr. Charteris ; and Lady Helen 's friend , Mr. Edward Thayer , was to blame for it , entirely . CHARTERIS One can not judge of that . MRS . LESLIE , followed by PAOLO , leaves the room . HARRY looks at LADY HELEN , who stands pale and trembling at one end of the long table ; then at SOLOMON , who is as silent and rigid as she . He speaks first to one and then to the other . Well , that 's done . I think she 's learned her lesson and will remember it . . . . And now , good night . I wo n't wait for Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I must be about early in the morning . As there is no response from either of them , he hurries on , awkwardly . There 's a ship sailing at noon and I 'm going home . So this is good-bye as well as good night . You know , of course , that you have my best wishes for the best of luck , both of you . p. 120 SOLOMON Gravely ,  --  realising at last what he has heard . Thank you , Charteris . I think we both want Helen to be happy . CHARTERIS Right-o . That 's it . They shake hands ; CHARTERIS goes to HELEN . Good-bye . LADY HADEN Good-bye , my Don Quixote . And I do n't think you 'll have to worry about one lady in distress , any more . She laughs a little . CHARTERIS Sharply . Do n't laugh ! This is  --  forever . He bends and kisses her ; then goes quickly from the room . SOLOMON After a pause . So it was Edward Thayer . . . ? LADY HADEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty . Lady Helen  --  His tone is formal . She glances at him with sudden apprehension . LADY HADEN Yes ? The word is barely whispered . SOLOMON I am going to say something which may seem strange to you . . . . I think it would be a mistake for us to go through with this marriage . . . . Her head goes up . He adds quickly . You do n't understand  --  but you will in a moment . There is someone else who can explain better than I. Wait here  --  He goes toward the doorway , but she checks him with a gesture and a smile. p. 121 LADY HADEN Do n't bother to explain , my friend . It is n't necessary . I can imagine so many more reasons than anyone could possibly tell me . Good night  --  and I shall never regret those few moments when I felt that I knew a remarkable man very well indeed , and when I had the novel sensation of feeling safe and at peace . She bows her head again , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , but he detains her before she reaches the door . SOLOMON Wait . . . . It is not always enough for a woman to feel safe and at peace . Do not go ; there is someone here whom I want you to see . Please wait one moment . LADY HADEN If you insist , of course . SOLOMON In a low voice , hesitantly , with deep feeling . And I want you to know that  --  it was very difficult  --  for me  --  to do  --  what I am doing . He goes out quickly . Left alone , LADY HELEN stares straight ahead of her , slightly bewildered . An orchestra begins to play for ZELLITO to dance in the music-room . LADY HELEN goes to the doorway and looks in . She is impersonal enough to appreciate the moment . A servant enters and approaches her , offering his tray. p. 122 SERVANT Some champagne , my lady ? LADY HADEN With sudden weariness . Yes , please . Then she continues as he fills a glass for her . And will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wait to say good night ? SERVANT Certainly , my lady . With a bow he leaves her , and continues on his way to the music-room . LADY HELEN moves toward the table like a person groping his way in a fog . Suddenly she sees the box from which SOLOMON took the pearls . She sets her glass , untouched , on the table ; then , with a slow wintry smile , unwinds the pearls from her throat , drops them into the box , snaps it closely shut  --  and with one last lingering look about her  --  her head high  --  goes from the room , through the doorway into the hall . The music continues . EDWARD THAYER enters from the dining-room , looking for somebody . He is perplexed at not finding her . He goes to the doorway of the music-room , and looks inside , but turns away disappointed ; then goes out through the door by which he entered . The music continues . RUDOLPH SOLOMON enters quickly . He is disconcerted at not finding LADY HELEN waiting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returns , as the music stops and there is a loud sound of hand-clapping from the next room , from which ALICE VANCE presently enters . He does not notice her until she speaks p. 123 VANCE Pausing as if only for a word on her way into the hall . Good night , Rudolph . SOLOMON Turning quickly . You 're going ? VANCE Yes . SOLOMON Do you know where Lady Helen is ? VANCE I saw her there in the doorway a moment ago , while Zellito was dancing . SOLOMON With relief . Oh , I was afraid she 'd gone . ALICE turns to go . He watches her to the doorway , then he calls her back in a low voice . Alice . . . Come here . She comes toward him slowly , a little amazed . He speaks awkwardly . I only want to tell you  --  I 'm very unhappy , muself  --  that I 'm sorry if you 've been unhappy , too ; you deserved better than you 've had from me . VANCE Hopelessly , quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . I knew that . . . . Only  --  I wish I could hate her , Rudolph . It would make it easier , I think , but I ca n't . SOLOMON Do n't try to hate Lady Helen , my dear . Her life will soon concern neither you nor me. p. 124 VANCE What do you mean ? SOLOMON She was not for me . Like a fool I thought I was the arbiter of her destiny ; and all the time Fate had happier plans for her . Fate has brought the one man she has ever loved , here , to my house , of all places in the wide world , to find her again . VANCE Drawing a sharp breath . Rudolph ! But  --  She falters at the look on his face  --  her voice breaks with anxiety as she continues . But  --  that 's why you 're unhappy , too ! It 's all right for me to be miserable  --  but I ca n't bear it when you look like that . SOLOMON Do n't worry . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the music-room . ALICE turns away quickly , and walks to a window , staring out , trying to check her tears . SERVANT I was to give you a message from her ladyship , sir ; she wished me to say that she was tired and would not wait to say good night . SOLOMON She 's gone ! SERVANT I think so , sir . Is there anything else , sir ? SOLOMON Wearily . Have you any champagne there ? p. 125 SERVANT Yes , sir . Shall I pour it , sir ? SOLOMON No  --  just leave it . SERVANT Very good , sir . He sets the tray on the table . CHARLOTTE and ZELLITO appear in the doorway of the music-room , laughing and talking . ALICE screams suddenly . VANCE Oh , my God ! SOLOMON What is it ? VANCE Staring out . A woman  --  run over ! SOLOMON hurries toward the window . The servant runs into the hall . ZELLITO and CHARLOTTE run to the second window . CHARLOTTE AND ZELLITO Speaking together . What ? Where ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there  --  VANCE Hysterically . Yes , yes ! I saw her go down ! She was crossing the street for a taxi  --  but she was n't quick enough ! Good God ! They ran over her and did n't even stop ! There are some people now  --  ! ASHLEY Peering out  --  ZELLITO moves away to the other side of the room , her face in her hands . They 're lifting her up ! p. 126 SOLOMON Moving away toward the door . I must see what can be done for her . VANCE They 're bringing her in here ! SOLOMON Calmly to all of them as they turn toward him . Try not to think about it ; I 'll see that she 's taken care of  --  The servant appears in the doorway , white-faced and trembling . SERVANT Oh , sir  --  ZELLITO In a low , wailing voice , looking up , her eyes sombre . It was she  --  Lady Helen ! I knew it was to happen some day ! SERVANT Confirming ZELLITO 'S cry . Yes , sir  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good God ! There is the sound of low , tortured laughter , and another servant enters carrying LADY HELEN , white and limp , in his arms . Her garments are torn and soiled , her hair is disarranged , and carries the damp and dirt of the street in its falling strands . Yet she is reassuringly composed as she directs the servant to place her on the bench in front of the table. p. 127 LADY HADEN Just arrange me with my feet down , and my head up , please , so I can sit , like this . I do n't want to lie down . He does as she directs . There  --  now I 'm very comfortable . I 've two perfectly good arms . She extends her arms along the table at the back and holds herself in place . The others , alarmed still and nervously concerned , recover a little from the sense of shock that for the moment bereft them of all power of thought and action . SOLOMON To the SERVANT . Telephone for a doctor at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now , sir  --  and somebody in a car went to find one , also . He goes out . ASHLEY Oh , Helen dear ! Are you suffering ? LADY HADEN With a sharp laugh and a long-drawn breath through tightly shut teeth . Well  --  rather ! She almost falls backward  --  for an instant her head drops forward . SOLOMON hurries to her and forces some champagne from a glass on the table between her lips . There is grave concern about her . SOLOMON Helen  --  come  --  drink this ! She lifts her head obediently and drinks , but does not seem to understand for the moment what is happening about her . A SERVANT enters p. 128 SERVANT A doctor will be here at once , sir . SOLOMON Have a bed made ready  --  SERVANT Yes , sir . He goes . LADY HELEN slowly comes out of her daze . SOLOMON To the others . I think you 'd better wait in another room . She ought n't to talk . The orchestra begins to play  --  a swift delicate air from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the music has roused LADY HELEN to an understanding of what he is saying . LADY HADEN No  --  please  --  let them play . I love it . Mozart 's so gay . SOLOMON With a significant glance at the others . Then  --  let them play . ALICE hurries from the room , and although the music is suddenly softened as if at her suggestion , the gay dancing air goes on and on . LADY HELEN happens to see ZELLITO staring at her with brooding eyes . LADY HADEN With a twisted smile . So this is what  --  what you were keeping from me , Zellito , all the time ? p. 129 ZELLITO Uneasily . This  --  this is nothing  --  chrie . LADY HADEN I never believe lawyers and I never believe doctors  --  but I always believe fortune-tellers ; only you might have warned me , Zellito . . . . I would have picked out a handsomer motor than that little noisy taxi  --  though I do n't believe a Rolls-Royce , with two men in front , could have done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some champagne  --  I 'm getting  --  Her voice weakens . SOLOMON is quick to hold a glass against her lips . ZELLITO with a sob hurries from the room . CHARLOTTE hovers near the doorway . LADY HELEN sees her , and calls faintly . Charlotte . CHARLOTTE comes near her . LADY HELEN turns her head ever so little toward SOLOMON . Will you give me a cigarette  --  and light it  --  please ? Still very casually , although her voice is weak , to CHARLOTTE while he is doing so . Do n't worry about me . I hope it 's the end . It ought to be , at any rate  --  it would be such a regular Varick ending ! and one ought to have something in common with one 's family  --  even if it 's only one 's death . . . . Open that door a little wider , Charlotte dear , so that I can see my great-great-grandmother  --  there  --  across the river . . . . Where 's my cigarette ? CHARLOTTE , choking back a sob , opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LADY HELEN smiles up at SOLOMON . It 's very considerate of you to have invited Georgiana , Duchess of Staffordshire , to meet me tonight . . . . THAYER , who has appeared in a doorway at the back , in time to understand all that has happened , now comes forward , trembling . She sees him and cries out . It 's  --  Ned ! He flings himself down on the bench beside her , and covers his face with his hands. p. 130 THAYER In a whisper . Helen ! She moves her arm painfully to let it rest on his hair . LADY HADEN Ned  --  I do n't understand  --  is it a dream , my dear ? It must be a dream . SOLOMON You are not dreaming . He has come back . LADY HADEN Now I understand why you  --  She looks at SOLOMON with sudden tears in her eyes . SOLOMON He 's come back  --  a different man . THAYER Lifting his face . Yes  --  I 've come back  --  a different man  --  a man who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the right thing for me  --  and oh , my God , I do n't dare to think of what I did for you ! LADY HADEN Do n't think  --  now . Tell me  --  more  --  ? SOLOMON goes quietly out of the room . THAYER Not now . LADY HADEN Yes  --  tell me . THAYER Humouring her , but trying to be brief . I went to South Africa  --  but it does n't matter where I went or what I did . The only thing that matters is that you saved me . I 've worked . I 've been honest . I 've made good  --  and I do n't know what I would have been except for you . And I 've been in torture whenever I 've thought of you . And one day  --  when I 'd heard bad news of you  --  I decided to come and find you , if I could , and ask you if you 'd forgive me  --  and marry me  --  and go back with me  --  She seems to bend her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurries with all the things he is eager to say to her , not realising that , for the moment , she hears nothing . Of course I did n't know about Rudolph Solomon then . . . but I was glad when he told me you were going to marry him , for that set everything straight . You see , you were right , for I 've found the girl you told me I 'd find some springtime  --  only  --  you 'd never have known about her if I had found that you needed me  --  He halts , a little confused at finding her so unresponsive , and looks up . Alarm is in his voice as he calls to her . Helen ! Have n't you heard ? SOLOMON returns , impatient and anxious , a glass of brandy in his hand. p. 131 SOLOMON Uneasily . How is she ? Here 's some brandy  --  it 's stronger than champagne , and ought to dull the pain a little . Helen  --  ! THAYER Frightened . I 'm afraid she 's fainted . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the brandy to her lips . SOLOMON Helen  --  drink ! She obeys . Again she becomes conscious . LADY HADEN In a very small voice . Ned  --  what were you telling me ? I 'm all lost . You came to find me , my dear . . . . What else ? It 's so wonderful . . . . You said  --  ? THAYER Steadily , realising at last all that it means to her . I said that I 'd come back to ask you to be my wife . A glance of understanding passes between him and SOLOMON . LADY HADEN Forcing back her pain ; forcing back her emotion . One more cigarette  --  and just one more glass of champagne  --  and  --  Rudolph  --  SOLOMON Catching up her limp hand , and holding it for an instant . Yes ? p. 132 LADY HADEN Life with you would have been very easy and very beautiful , I know that ; I was quite disappointed when you threw me over tonight . I did n't know it was because Ned had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold my hand . . . . We 're drifting away together . ZELLITO , ALICE , and CHARLOTTE have come back and have drawn together in a frightened , huddled group . LADY HELEN is smiling . SOLOMON is at one side of her and THAYER at the other . She speaks quite naturally but not very easily . Where 's the champagne ? You 'll have to hold it , I 'm afraid , Ned . My arms are tired  --  Hold it high . It 's a toast . To England ! . . . THAYER holds her glass so that she can touch it with her lips . She continues . " Oh , to be in England  --  now that April 's there  --  " Only it is n't April  --  is it ? My cigarette keeps going out . THAYER takes the glass from her . She clings to him convulsively , staring straight ahead of her . Just you  --  and my young great-great-grandmother , in her big hat  --  there  --  across the river . And the gay music ! Everything else  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they turn out the lights before the curtain rises  --  on the next act . . . . Her heads falls forward . The last shudder tears her breath from her lips. p. 133 ASHLEY With a cry , as she looks on . Helen ! SOLOMON Helen ! But there is no answer . THAYER Whispering . Helen ! There is a sharp pause . He bends his head . SOLOMON Tell them they can stop the music now . ALICE , who is standing in the doorway , signals into the next room by lifting her hand , and the music stops sharply , leaving a phrase broken . CURTAIN
