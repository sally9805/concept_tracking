txt Converted to Protection . As an everyday reader of your paper I was much impressed with en article in your magazine section last Sunday by an English protectionist . Being a Democrat from habit and opposed to a high tariff , the article in question set me to thinking : What 's the other side to the question ? You have not answered it . Are the arguments advanced unanswerable ? At the present moment , anyway , I have about decided to vote for Stimsen and the entire Republican ticket . I have shown the article to many ' Democratic friends and they were as much impressed by it as I was . Give us the other side of the question , so we can vote more intelligently . AS It Is I am glad I do n't live in free trade England . I get fair wages , have a thrifty wife , and the high cost of living has not yet bit me.
