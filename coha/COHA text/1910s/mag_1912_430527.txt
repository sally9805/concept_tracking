 |p586  NOT so very long ago there passed through New York a seven-yearold boy who , although the general public had heard little about him , was an object of considerable scientific curiosity . His name was Miguel Alberto Mantilla , he was the son of a Mexican banker , and he was then on his way to Europe for a pleasure tour with his father . There was nothing about his appearance to suggest that he was in any respect an extraordinary boy . But , as certain scientists had been informed , and as they were eager to verify for themselves . The possessed a singular mental accomplishment , rare not only among children but among fullgrown men and women . And , to make his " case " more interesting , this accomplishment had first manifested itself with dramatic unexpectedness . Briefly stated , the story that had preceded him to New York , backed by the weight of affidavits sworn to by judges , lawyers , educators. and prominent business men of his native too n of San Juan Bautista , was as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was six years old , little Miguel 's life had been that of the average child , a life made up mostly of eating , sleeping , and playing . No attempt had been made to educate him , except that he had been given some elementary instruction in reading . On the evening of February 1 , 1910 ? that is , two days after his sixth birthday ? his father was discussing with his mother the advisability of keeping open , on at least one of the three holidays that would occur in February , the bank of which he was manager . " I think , " he observed , " that I will close it on two of them , but keep it open the third " ? naming a date . Miguel , playing on the floor , looked up sharply . " But , father , " said he , " you certainly will have to close it that day , for it will be Sunday . " " That is true , " responded his father , after a moment 's thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why , that was easy for me . I can guess many things much more difficult than that . " " In that case , " said Mr. Mantilla , smiling , " perhaps you can tell us on what date the first Sunday of April will he in 1918 ? " What Day of the Week was January ? 4 , 1839 ? To his amazement , the child , after an interval of only a few seconds , named a date which investigation proved to be correct . Other questions of a similar character followed . Always the right answer was given . Astonished , perplexed , and possibly a little worried , the Mantillas called in some of their neighbors . Again the boy was questioned ; again he displayed an unerring knowledge of the intricacies of the calendar . " What day of the week was January 24 , 1839 , my birthday ? " asked one neighbor , Professor M. Maldonado , of the Institute of Juarez . Thursday , " came the prompt and correct reply . And the same date in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equally correct answer . Other leading Bautistans examined Miguel in the course of the next few weeks , and so impressed were they with the seemingly supernatural character of his " gift " that they decided that a report should at once be made to the American Society for Psychical Research . In : he statement accompanying their affidavits it was stated that : " He has the rare and surprising faculty of resolving as quickly as he is asked , and with entire precision , such questions as , What days of the week coincide with the date of a known month and year ? ' What dates of a month correspond to a day and year determined upon ? ' What years will have , in a month indicated , a certain date which coincides with any given day of the week ? ' This alike in regard to years past as well as those in the future , taking into account leap years . He has been asked repeatedly on what date falls , for example , the second Sunday of a month and year indicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hesitation . " Seven-Year-Old Miguel is Put through the Third Degree Tested in New York by Professor J. H. Hyslop , of the Society for Psychical Research , the boy fully bore out this glowing report from Mexico . In a long examination he made but two mistakes , ? barring one slip , which he immediately corrected , ? and both of these errors referred to dates in the sixteenth century previous to the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar . He named correctly the days of the week on which would fall such a variety of dates as Jul , 4 , 1876 ; August 18 , 1854 ; September 10 , 1910 ; October 1 , 1901 ; and June 6 , 1900 . He gave 1522 ( incorrect ) , 1910 , 1916 , and 2000 as years when February 4 would fall on a Friday ; and 163o , 1799 , 1805 , 1811 , 1822 , 1901 , 1907 , 1918 , 1929 , and 2002 as having December 15 on Sunday . All of these and other days and dates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception in less than a quarter of a minute after each problem was put to him . And this at a time ( May of last year ) when he was not eight , and was barely able to read ' Now , what is the explanation of such astounding mental mastery of the calendar , especially in one so young ? Is it necessary to assume that Miguel Alberto Mantilla is the happy possessor of a supernormal faculty denied to the vast majority of men ? Is it that his peculiar ability is perfectly normal , but the result of an exceptional inheritance ? Or is it merely that he utilizes a power common to all mankind but not commonly drawn upon ? And , in this case , would it be possible for others , by appropriate training , to develop the same " gift , " or one analogous to it ? For myself , after a somewhat prolonged study of the whole problem of " lightning calculation , " I am strongly inclined to answer both of these last two questions in the affirmative . I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy wonders " of the Mantilla type as products of a bizarre heredity ? and hence inexplicable on any developmental theory ? is simply the result of neglect on the part of scien-  |p588  tists to inquire closely into the life histories of such prodigies . The few really stimulating investigations that have been made ? notably those by the Englishman F. W. H. Myers and the Frenchman Alfred Binet ? have attracted scant attention from the scientific world . The average scientist , almost as much as the average layman , regards the lightning calculator as a freak of nature , a thing to be marveled at but not understood ? as presenting , for that matter , a riddle the attempted solution of which can only be a waste of time . Whereas , for reasons that I shall endeavor to make entirely clear , there actually is warrant for the assertion that few problems in any field of scientific inquiry , from a practical no less than a theoretical point of view , are more deserving of systematic , thorough , and extensive research . Lightning Calculation a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that the mental processes of lightning calculators like little Miguel Mantilla differ not at all from those of ordinary human beings ; that the only difference is an unusual facility of access to resources shared by everybody of normal mentality ; and that this facility of access , in turn , depends on a factor utilizable by all . I believe , further , that the performances of lightning calculators are essentially , if in a low degree , manifestations of what we call " genius , " and that , through diligently studying the mechanisms operant in their feats , we shall gain not merely greater insight into the nature of genius , but assistance in enabling us to approximate more  |p589  and more closely ourselves to the achievements of men of genius . Assuredly , plenty of material is available for the work of investigation . Authentic records are extant of more than a score of lightning calculators , several of whom , it is worth noting . are or at one time were calendar experts on the order of the Mantilla boy . When William James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years has been astonishing his instructors by his really profound grasp of mathematical principles , was a child of five , he could similarly state almost offhand on what day of the week a given date would fall . This , by the way , was his sole accomplishment in the realm of lightning calculation , just as it seems to be young Mantilla 's vale accomplishment . On the other hand , mental juggling with dates is but an item in the repertoire of Jacques Inaudi , one of the best known and most spectacular of present-day professional calculators . The Sjt'ctacular Performances of an Italian Peasant Inaudi. who was born on an Italian farm forty-five years ago , grew to manhood quite uneducated , not learning to read or write until he was nearly twenty . None the less , he was only six when he first manifested a passion for figures . and at the tender age of seven he was nonchalantly executing mental multiplications of two numbers each containing five figures . He was not much older when his brother took him on an organ-grinding tour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pennies , and to try to coax in a few more by giving exhibitions of his arithmetical dexterity . In this way he was brought to public notice , and in due course graduated from the road to the cafe and from the cafe to the variety-hall . At twenty-four , while performing in Paris , he was examined by a number of scientists , including Chariot , Darboux , and Binet , who confessed themselves staggered by the rapidity of his calculations and the extent of his memory for figures . At the close of one sitting he was asked to repeat the figures used in the different problems set him during an examination of upward of two hours . These totaled two hundred and thirty , a careful record having been kept . Inaudi , Binet declares , went through the entire list without a mistake . At another sitting he was given a number containing twenty-two figures ; eight days after , having meanwhile been giving his daily performances in the theater , he was unexpectedly asked to recall this number , and , to the general amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number 27 , he gave the correct response in ten seconds . Three seconds after the last word had fallen from the lips of his examiner , he gave the exact number of seconds in a period of thirty-nine years , three months . and twelve hours . He gave the square root of four-figure numbers in from one to three seconds , and multiplied five-figure numbers in forty seconds . Yet Inaudi 's rapidity of calculation is , after all , not more impressive than that of the majority of first-class performers in the same field ; and many have attacked successfully problems much more complicated than he essays . Arthur F. Griffith , " Marvelous Griffith , " the Syracuse , Indiana , calculator , who died last Christmas at the age of thirty-one after many years ' service or the vaudeville stage , is credited with having raise : a number to the sixth power in eleven seconds . and with having multiplied two rows of nine figures in considerably less than half a minute . Some Questions Answered by a Six-Year-Old American Child Great rapidity also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who attained fame as a professional calculator before he had passed his seventh birthday . Here are a few of the mathematical questions correctly answered by him when he was a child of six : " Assuming that a clock strikes 156 times in one day . how many times will it strike in two thousand years ? " " What is the square of 1,449 ? " " Supposing I have a corn field in which are 7 acres , having 17 rows to each acre , 64 hills to each row , 8 ears to a hill , and 15o kernels on an ear ; how many kernels in the corn field ? " " What sum multiplied by itself will produce 998,001 ? " The answer to this question was while in ten seconds the given in four seconds , answer was given to the question : " Admitting the distance between Concord and Boston to he 65 miles , how many steps must I take in going this distance , allowing that I go three feet at a step ? " " If You Will Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seconds " Henri Mondeux , a French calculator of the same order , specialized , as a child , in rapid reduction of time to seconds . It was through his ability in this respect that he first became a pub-  |p591  character . Walking . one day , a ragged , baretoot urchin , across a field near Tours , he fell into conversation with two young ladies , strangers to him , and , after answering their questions regarding the neighborhood , astonished them by saying to the younger of the two : If you will tell me your age in years . I will tell it to you in seconds . " " I am nineteen , " said she . " Then you have lived 5g6,184,000 seconds . " Noting his reply , which was given without an instant 's hesitation . the young ladies showed it to a schoolmaster in Tours , who verified it by working out the calculation for himself . Profoundly impressed , he sought Mondeux , found he could not read or write and knew nothing of arithmetic as taught in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . From Tours , at fourteen , he was taken to Paris . %%here his powers as a ready reckoner were tested by a committee of the Academy of Sciences . This committee , besides ascertaining that he undoubtedly could in a very few moments reduce to seconds any given number of years , discovered also , in the words of its report to the Academy , that he " easily executes in his head not only diverse operations of arithmetic , but even , in many cases , the numerical resolution of equations ; he invents processes , sometimes remarkable , to solve various questions which ordinarily are treated with the aid of algebra . " Problems of the most puzzling kind were answered by him with an ease that amazed his every questioner . Thus , on one occasion he was asked : The Problem of the Fountain " In a public square there is a fountain containing an unknown quantity of water . Around it stand a group of people with vessels capable of containing a certain unknown quantity . They draw at the following rate : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the second , 200 quarts and i- of the remainder ; the third . 3O0 quarts and - A-  ; and so on until the fountain is emptied . How many quarts were there in it ? " Without so much as touching pencil to paper , and after only a few seconds ' deliberation , Monanswer . Small wonder that the superstitious peasants of his native village of Neuvy-le- Roi suspected him of being in constant touch with an evil spirit that whispered the answers to him . Had he lived in the Middle Ages he surely would have been hanged or burned as a wizard . Vito Mangiamele , a Sicilian , was another calculator quizzed by members of the Academy of Sciences . H e was even younger than Mondeux , and totally lacking in education , when he appeared before that learned body ; yet he was able to entertain it with several startling arithmetical feats . In half a minute he found the cube root of 3,796,416 , and in little longer time the tenth root of 292,476,249 . He also solved the equation x5 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly answered the question : " What satisfies the condition that its cube plus five times its square is equal to fortytwo times itself increased by 40 ? " Mangiamele was then only ten years and four months old . Mental Multiplication in 100-Figure Numbers But more remarkable than any of the foregoing was the German calculator Zacharias Dase , who began giving public exhibitions at the age of fifteen . His ability to retain and men-  |p592  tally manipulate vast masses of figures has never been equaled by any other calculator on record . Most calculators , for example , have found it impossible to multiply in their heads two numbers containing more than ten or fifteen figures apiece . Excepting Dase , only one ? that eighteenth-century marvel , Jedediah Buxton ? has thus multiplied as high as two forty-figure numbers . Dase , however , went far beyond this , for at least once he mentally multiplied two one-hundred-figure numbers . Besides which , he once extracted , entirely by mental processes , the square root of a sixty-figure number , and another time that of a hundred-figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost always , in fact , no matter how large the sums with which he had to deal , his calculations were performed in less time than would be required by the average mathematical expert working on paper . Most Lightning Calculators Lack All-Round Mental Ability Oddly enough , outside of calculation , Dase was a sad ignoramus . Still , this has to be said of most lightning calculators . Of the more celebrated , only five , so far as the records show , have displayed anything like a high all-round mental ability ? Truman Safford , George Bidder and his son of the same name , Andre Ampere , and Karl Gauss . Of these , Safford , like Colburn , the son of a Vermont farmer , became in 1876 professor of astronomy at Williams College , where he remained until his death in 1901 . He was a child of less than three when his parents discovered " the grand bias of his mind " toward mathematics , and by the time he was six he was able to calculate mentally the number of barleycorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight he had begun to study algebra , geometry , trigonometry , and astronomy ; and in his tenth year he published an almanac computed entirely by himself . He was , too , like Inaudi , Mangiamele , and the rest , an extremely rapid calculator , even then multiplying one row of fifteen figures by another of eighteen in " not more than one minute , " as has been testified by the Rev. H. W. Adams , a mathematician who put him through a grueling three hours ' examination . The elder Bidder , son of an English stonemason , received his " first and only instruction in numbers , " at about six years of age , from an older brother who taught him to count up to a hundred . At ten he was answering such questions as : " Suppose a cistern , capable of holding 170 gallons , to receive from one cock 54 gallons , and at the same time to lose by leakage 30 gallons , every minute ; in what time will the cistern be full ? " " How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each cubic inch to contain 4,685 drops , each gallon 231 inches , and a pipe 126 gallons ? " At the age of eleven , some of Bidder 's admirers raised a fund to place him in school , and eventually he attended the University of Edinburgh , where he had a brilliant career . Afterward he became one of the great engineers of England , his most notable work being the construction of the Victoria Docks at London . His son , somewhat inferior to him in calculating ability , won honors as a student at Cambridge , and , entering law , quickly made himself a successful barrister . A Three-Year-Old Child Corrects His Father 's Reckoning It is in Ampere and Gauss , though , that we find the most distinguished representatives of the fraternity of calculators . The former will always be esteemed for his discoveries in the realm of electro-dynamics , the latter for his important contributions to the progress of mathematical science . Both were unusually precocious as children , . His father " ? I quote from Prof. E. W. Scripture ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week , and to add on the pay for overtime , which was reckoned by the hour at a price in proportion to the daily wages . After the master had finished his calculations and was about to pay out the money , the boy , scarce three years old , who had followed unnoticed the acts of his father , raised himself and called out in his childish voice : Father . the reckoning is wrong ; it makes so much ' ? naming a certain number . The calculation was repeated with great attention , and , to the astonishment of all , it was found to be exactly as the little fellow had said . " At nine Gauss ' entered the arithmetical class of the local school , where he startled ? and annoyed ? his teacher by writing down on his slate the answers to problems almost as soon as they were stated to him . A year later he was engaged in the study of higher mathematics . and it is said that by fourteen " he had become acquainted with the works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of Newton 's Principia . ' " His memory for figures must have been at least equal , if not superior , to Jacques Inaudi 's , since it is claimed for him that " at once , or after a very shor : pause , he was able to give the properties  |p593  each of the first couple thousand numbers , " and " if he could not answer a problem at once , he stored it up for future solution . " The Power of Rapid Calculation Latent in All Normal People Such , in bald outline , are the principal lightning calculators of whom we have authentic knowledge . They clearly fall into two distinct groups ? mere " reckoning machines , " like Inaudi , Mondeux , and Dase , and a far smaller group possessing accomplishments over and above the faculty for mental calculation . The natural inference would be that these two groups are essentially different in their native mentality , the latter being blessed with innate endowments superior to those of the former . But I believe it can be shown that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , the two groups start , so far as inherited ability is concerned , at about the same level ; and that if in-the end the members of the one achieve more than the members of the other , it is by reason of external rather than internal influences . More than this , I venture to affirm , as I have already hinted , that the unusual ability for calculation exhibited by both groups is but the result of a peculiar development , through the force of environmental circumstances , of powers latent in all normal men and women . Most Lightning Calculators the Children of Ignorant Peasants Certainly , any serious scrutiny of the facts in the lives and antecedents of the calculators soon reveals the impossibility of explaining them adequately on the basis of hereditary transmission of their singular talent . In the case of the Bidders the power for rapid mental calculation was , to be sure , manifested not only in father and son , but also , in a partial form , in two of the elder Bidder 's grandchildren . Mangia-  |p594  mele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the average person . Inaudi 's mother is said to have been much occupied in financial calculations just before his birth . Otherwise there is absolutely nothing to suggest the operation of heredity in the making of the calculators . With extremely few exceptions , they were , in fact , the children of ignorant peasants , men and women of good enough mentality , no doubt , but with little or no education , and whose ancestors , so far as they have been traced , were similarly conditioned . If anything , then , the majority of lightning calculators have entered life handicapped rather than favored by heredity . It is of importance to notice also that in many cases they were decidedly handicapped , in childhood at all events , by physical defects . Safford suffered from a form of St. Vitus ' dance . So did Colburn , who was , in addition . afflicted with the abnormality- of an extra finger on each hand and an extra toe on each foot . Miguel Mantilla is deformed with a club-foot . Grandmange , a French calculator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without arms or legs . Luigi Pierini , an Italian ten years Inaudi 's junior , had frequent epileptic attacks while a child . Others were troubled with lesser but annoying bodily ills , particularly of a neural character . The importance of this lies in the fact that their lives as children were thereby narrowed and restricted in comparison with the lives of other children . They could not romp like others , they were thrown largely on their own resources for entertainment , their interests from the start were less varied than those of the average child . And , besides this , in several instances they were , while yet very young , set at tasks which , though still further narrowing their interests , must have had a direct and powerful influence in turning their thoughts to and concentrating their attention on problems of calculation . Boy Shepherds Who Became Lightning Calculators I t is no mere coincidence that Inaudi , Mangiamele , Mondeux , and Pierini were , in their earliest boyhood , sent into the fields to tend sheep day after day . Whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to count in order to make sure that none had strayed ; and if they were obliged or chose to master the first principles of counting for themselves , it would not be extraordinary did they , out of sheer delight in their accomplishment and as a relief from the monotony of their occupation , develop an uncommon interest in reckoning . This interest , again , would naturally be intensified if they found a way to make a plaything of their counting . as Mondeux , for instance , is known to have done . In his lonely hours in the meadows , possessed of none of the ordinary toys of childhood , this little fellow used to amuse himself by incessantly counting over heaps of pebbles and arranging them in different ways to represent sums in addition , multiplication , and subtraction . In the same way the influence of environmental conditions is plainly discernible in the case of other calculators . as is the fact that they learned to calculate through plan . Ampere , like Mondeux , used pebbles for his self-education . Young Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to calculate dates , had been given several calendars by his father , who wished to familiarize him with the uses of numbers , and for a long time these calendars were his principal means of amusement . The little Mantilla boy similarly played with calendars , as the ordinary child does with picture books or blocks , for about a year before the discovery of his strange power . And the elder Bidder , whose interest in calculation was undoubtedly awakened by the lessons he received from his brother , taught himself multiplication by means of self-devised toys . Learning the Multiplication-Table with a Bag of Shot " Having , " he says in an autobiographical statement , " acquired the power of counting up to one hundred by ten and by five , I set about , in my own way , to acquire the multiplication table . This I arrived at by getting peas or marbles , and at last I obtained a treasure in a small bag of shot . I used to arrange these in squares of eight on each side , and then , counting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-four . By that process I satisfied my mind , not only as a matter of memory , but also as a matter of conviction , that 8 times 8 were 64 ; and that fact , once established , has remained there undisturbed until this day . . . . In this way I acquired the whole multiplication-table up to to times to , " In other words , as this passage suggests , whether teaching themselves by means of pebbles , marbles , peas , or shot , by counting on their fingers , or by a wholly mental process , as Inaudi did , these children developed , solely because of an intense interest , a rich store of subconscious memory associations along a definite line , Herein , I am convinced , we have the clue to their achievements as calculators .  |p595  Most children are drawn hither and thither by a variety of interests . They have a real interest in nothing ; they diffuse their energies : they concentrate their attention scarcely at all . In this they are encouraged by their parents , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are of the opinion that sustained intellectual effort must inevitably be harmful to the mind of a child . As a result , the average child grows up more or less " scatter-brained , " with habits of superficial thinking , and , worst of all , without the ability to utilize in any markedly effective degree its subconscious memories and powers . Making the Subconsciousness Do the Work The lightning calculator is differently situated . Born , as a rule , of poor parents , left much to his own devices , and often debarred from the society of other children because of living in an isolated home or because of physical infirmities , he craves , as all children do , playthings and pleasure . Circumstances arouse in him an interest in numbers , not as a study , but as a form of entertainment . No other diversion presenting itself to stifle this interest , calculation soon becomes to him as truly " fun " as a game of ball . His interest in it augments with the applause he receives upon the discovery of his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and works out , or hits on , short cuts in mathematical methods . These he preserves in the depths of his mind , whence , likewise because of his colossal interest in the subject , he can draw on them freely whenever the occasion arises . He has , in effect , " harnessed his subconsciousness , " and is so thoroughly in control of it that not infrequently it directly solves his problems for him . As one investigator has testified of the elder Bidder , in describing how he could determine mentally the logarithm of any number to seven or eight places : " He had an almost miraculous power of seeing , as it were , intuitively what factors would divide any large number not a prime . Thus , if he were given the number 17,861 , he would instantly remark it was 337x 53 He could not , he said , explain how he did this ; it seemed a natural instinct to him . " And we have Bidder 's own testimony : " Whenever I feel called upon to make use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rapidity of lightning . " Bearing out the theory that the power to calculate rapidly is not an exceptional trait of inheritance , but is developed so amazingly only because external conditions have inspired in the calculators an unusual interest in numbers , is the curious circumstance that it disappears , in whole or in part , as soon as they become interested in other things , to the extent that they cease to practice calculation with any regularity . That , however , its disappearance does not necessarily involve a weakening of the control its practice has given them over their subconsciousness , is strikingly evidenced by the examples of Safford , Ampere , Gauss , and the Bidders . These men , to the end of their days , retained a superlative power for executing mental tasks of the most exacting nature . Yet the only difference between them and calculators of the **25;390;TOOLONG type , so far as one may assert with any positiveness , is that , whereas the former were led at an early age to interest themselves keenly in matters other than mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too late for them reallv to acquire new interests ; and they were , indeed , through the cupidity of those who had them in charge and dragged then from place to place for exhibition purposes , encouraged to concentrate their minds on calculation , and on calculation alone , until at last they could think of scarcely anything but figures . Griffith , for instance , " could not hold an ordinary conversation for three minutes without getting brain-fag , but he could talk for hours about mathematical problems , " and calculation was such an obsession with him that , even when taking a walk , his mind was wholly occupied in . " calculating simultaneously the distance , time , and energy consumed , the distance being calculated in inches and the time in seconds . " Inaudi , according to Professor Binet , is so absorbed in numbers that he pays little attention to what goes on around him , and is strangely absent-minded with regard to the affairs of everyday life . Often he even fails to recognize towns in which he has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard III " Of Buxton it is recorded that when he went to church he came away without remembering a word of the sermon , " having been busied in dividing some time or some space into the smallest known part . " Once , during a visit to London , he was taken to Drury Lane Theater to see Garrick in " King Richard I I I . " I t was noticed that he followed the play with the greatest intentness , and after the curtain had fallen on the last act he was asked how he had liked it . " Splendidly , " he replied . Somebody spoke of an especially dramatic scene , but he said that he did not remember it . Then the astonishing discovery was made that ,  |p596  so far as plot , action , and dialogue were concerned , he might as well not have been in the theater . From first to last he had been engaged in counting the number of times each actor came on and went off , the number of steps taken by each , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew nothing . . Yet , ? and most significant , ? in the case neither of the one-sided nor of the many-sided calculators , does the constant strain they put on their minds seem to have been in the slightest injurious . Not one broke down mentally . Not one , so far as I have been able to ascertain , died before thirty , and only four ? Griffith , Colburn , Dase , Mondeux ? before forty . Ampere lived to sixty-one , . Safford to sixty-five , Buxton to seventy , the elder Bidder to seventy-two , and Gauss to seventy-eight . The average age . too , at which their power for rapid calculation was first observed was six ? which means , of course , that their minds must have been more or less occupied with problems in calculation long before that time , or at the age probably of four or five . Gauss and Safford we know to have been calculating as early as three . Obviously , all of this implies one of two things : Either these calculators were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them suffered ? with a mental equipment vastly superior to that of the average healthy child ; or else their unusually early start in vigorous and systematic thinking had of itself the effect of enabling them to use the mental faculties common to mankind with an ease and fullness that would have been impossible had the process of real thinking been postponed until a later day , as it is with most children . How Arithmetic Ought to be Taught Admitting this second explanation to be the correct one , ? and , for myself , I am firmly persuaded that it is , the lightning calculator at once becomes an object of the utmost interest Owen Johnson 's . new serial , " The Sixty-first Detective Burns ' great story , The Mystery 01 to all parents and educators . From him they may learn , for one thing , the urgent desirability of beginning the work of education at a much earlier period in the life of a child than is now the rule . From him , also , they may learn that it is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly exercise their intellects ? will train and develop their powers of observation , concentration , and reasoning ? as it is to interest them in the multitudinous useless activities common to the children of to-day . It is only a question of modifying the environment , of skilfully kindling the child 's curiosity , appealing to his instinct for knowledge , and setting him thinking for himself . It is not a question , however , of " forcing " the child to study . The lightning calculator never studies . in the sense of mastering calculation as a set task . He acquires its principles in play , as was said above . He learns the meaning and uses of numbers because he finds it " fun " to do so . And any parent , I have not the least doubt , if only he will go the right way about it , can inspire his own child with the idea that he can get as much " fun " out of learning calculation , reading , history , or any other subject , as out of playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that by so doing he will injure his child 's mind . On the contrary , as the lives of the calculators prove , so long as a really vital interest ? the sense of enjoyment ? is maintained , there will be no tax on the mind , but an ever-increasing growth and control of the mental powers , conscious and subconscious alike . The one danger to be guarded against will be an excessive development of interest in a narrow field . No parent would wish his child to be an Inaudi rather than a Gauss , a Mondeux rather than a Bidder . Yet such undue , such one-sided development may after all be easily prevented .
