FOR some years past the magazines and , newspapers have been publishing scathing exposures of political corruption and yet the public does not seem to he convinced . If the decent people of the country really believed the stories that are told , with such a wealth of damning evidence , they would " Ere this . . . have fatted all the region 's kites " with those who are corrupting the electorate and subverting the will of the voters . The trouble seems to be that the significance of the exposures does not get home to them . It does not occur to the honest voter in Texas that he may be in any way responsible for the political conditions in Pittsburgh , or to the voter in Maine that he is to blame for corruption in San Francisco . The trouble has been that the exposures have all been local and the principles involved obscured by accounts of personal graft , deals , and the pernicious activities of rapacious corporations . For this reason it may not be unprofitable to attempt a broad review of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ap plied . Students of pathology tell us that even the most loathsome diseases have an orderly development that is just as interesting to the student as the normal functions of the body . A study of political corruption reveals the fact that however much local con ditions may vary a few simple principles are involved , and per haps if these were properly understood it would be easier to find and apply remedies . These principles are almost axiomatic in their simplicity and for that reason they are seldom considered worth dwelling on by writers who are excited by the specific cases to which they are giving attention . All who are engaged in practical politics understand them and apply them in their work ; but it is surprising to find how ignorant the average voter is of the means by which his political activities are rendered absurd or made to have the opposite effect from that intended . One does not need to probe very deeply to find that the vast majority of the voters of the country are honest : they also know that the  | vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find how helpless they are in trying to ef fect reforms . They know they are cheated and defeated at every election , and yet they do not see that the responsibility rests at their own doors . It never seems to dawn on them that the honest partisan is the greatest asset of the political cor ruptionist . It is because the majority can be handled without being bought that it is so easy to swing an election . The greater the number of honest partisans the easier it is for the corruptionist to attain his ends . The great danger of making sweeping statements about buy ing elections is that they defeat themselves by their vagueness . They suggest a wholesale corruption of the electorate which even the most superficial observer knows to be untrue . The trouble is not that the privileged classes buy so many votes , but that we make it necessary for them to buy so few . By our faith in parties either old or new we make it ridiculously easy for those who wish to control the legislative machinery of the coun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been an honest election of any importance in either the United States or Can ada in the past twenty-five years , and yet I have been assured by skilled and experienced politicians that , taking the country over , First : not one voter in fifty sells his vote in a general elec tion ; Second : not one voter in twenty is approached by bribers or sees any real evidence that money is being wrongly used . The vast majority are justified in believing that every elec tion is decided on its merits and are justified in resenting the sug gestion that the party to which they give their allegiance is cor rupt . As a matter of fact there are very few really bad men in public life , though there are altogether too many bad methods and deluded men . It is nonsense to charge wholesale cor ruption in an election whose result does not please us . The day of wholesale corruption is past . Leaving out the honest voters , I doubt if more than a small percentage of those who are eager to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their votes are not needed . The work of swinging an  | election where all the people are engaged is too expertly done for any money or wickedness to be wasted . Thanks to the straight party man who can always be relied upon to vote the party ticket , political corruption has been reduced to an exact science . Every dollar is placed where it will count and the wonderful thing is how few dollars are needed . In local elections the case is somewhat different and corruption may be - nore rampant , but the principles involved are the same . Without referring in any way to specific elections , let us examine briefly how our election machinery works . We have two great parties , the Democratic and the Republican . These parties differ radically on several important points of public pol icy . Because of this each can claim the honest support of a great number of thinking men . Add to this the number of those who are either Democrats or Republicans " by birth " and think it a disgrace to go back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great mass of voters normally divided into two hostile camps that can be depended upon to vote in the same way in any election . But besides these party voters we have a small class of voters who are either independent or indifferent or corrupt . Although the number of voters in this class is small , it is usually enough to swing the election . If its support can be secured for the Democrats , the Democrats will win . If it can be secured by the Republicans , the Republicans will win . The result is that those who wish to control the elections pay no attention to the straight party men . So long as they vote the straight party tick ets , they are useful only inasmuch as they reduce the number of those whose votes must be secured by the campaign managers . Every campaign really centres around the class of voters who do not belong to any party . The honest independents must be won by eloquence and sound arguments , and the indifferent and venal by influence or money . But all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an election . Our partisan politics works out so beautifully that only a small portion is needed . A major ity of those who are hunting for bribes can not get them and are not to be blamed if they join the honest voters in saying that no  | money was used . Their corrupt votes are not required . In order to understand how this is possible we must take a closer glance at the working of our electoral machinery . Under present conditions our constituencies are marked off without any reference , except for gerrymandering purposes , to the number of Democrats or Republicans there may be in a given constituency . The only thing considered is the needful population . The result is that we have many constituencies where the Democrats are in a vast majority and others where the Republicans are similarly placed . Now let us proceed with the work of eliminating unnecessary votes . Where either party has a normal majority of , say , a thousand , it would be useless to try to swing this election , for no normal constituency has that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican or Democratic majority it is useless to try to do any swinging . To get control in Congress it is only necessary to put a majority of one party in power . The consequence is that in a general election all the Democratic and Republican strongholds are crossed off and the work of swinging the election confined to widely scattered constituencies . In these the straight Democratic and Republican voters are crossed off and the campaign confined to the class that may be influenced . In each of these close constituencies the capture of a hundred votes will usually suffice to swing an election . No money is wasted in the party strongholds on illegitimate practices , but in the close constituencies it is possible to pay fancy prices for votes if there is a sufficient campaign fund . If only one party is provided with funds the amount required would be merely a trifle to a giant corporation or combination of corporations that wishes to secure special privileges for raiding the resources of the country . With a grateful party in power they can quickly get back their expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the necessary arrangements with the individual members of the party in power . All they need to do is to make the proper deal with the " practical men " of the party and the majority of the members of Congress canbe depended upon to vote along straight party lines . The little " jokers " that are slipped into the laws to pay political debts usually look very  | harmless until they have been interpreted by the courts . No man need go back on his party because of them . This unwav ering fidelity gives the corruptionist who has secured control of the party machinery a chance to do further effective and clean work . He is never afraid to see men of tried honesty and high principles nominated for office . Instead he is apt to seek such men for his ticket and while they are denouncing all kinds of po litical crookedness on the platform , he and his silent cohorts go about buying the necessary votes to elect them , secure in the knowledge that they will always vote with their party when elected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to do with these incorruptibles who owe their positions to corruption . A case in point is that of a member of the Supreme Court of a western State who began his career by running for Congress . The story was told to me by one of the workers who secured his election . " One day the candidate met me , " said my informant , to whom I had been introduced by a practical politician , as he took me into his confidence and began to talk as one briber might to another , " and asked me how things were going in a certain district . " Fine , ' I replied . You will have a good majority there . ' " I am not surprised , ' he said enthusiastically . When I was speaking there I made the best speech that I made in the whole campaign . ' " The worker nudged me as he said : " It cost us just seven thousand dollars to win that particular district for him and he thought his speech did it . " No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muckraker or a court of investigation , it will be found that it all springs from the ease with which the bal ance of power can be secured when two parties contend . Care ful investigators and practical politicians agree in placing the corruptible vote of the country at two per cent . of the whole . But as things have developed it would be better to say that under normal conditions of party warfare it would be necessary to cor rupt only two per cent . to swing a general election . Of course in the constituencies on the firing line the percentage would be  | much greater , but the percentage is lowered at once when we add the many constituencies that are party strongholds and where corruption is unnecessary . Of course the natural result of this extraordinary value of the corrupt vote to those who wish to control elections was to induce the venal voters to be organized so that they could secure the full advantage of their strategic position . Political organi zations that could secure favors for the floating , corruptible voters became inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an amazing and hideous charitable organization . The charitable side of these organizations wherever they exist is the very breath of their being , even though it takes the form of furnishing free whisky to the fallen souls of society who have lost all except their votes or their power to personate a voter . By a bitter irony of fate our free institutions can be controlled by the outcasts of society and those who prey on it . By band ing together , or rather by following some leader who can dole out to them the means of debauchery and protection for mis deeds , they can subvert the will of the ninety-eight per cent . of decent citizens who put forth party platforms , expound funda mental principles of government and discuss abstract justice . Their leaders are quickly able to entrench themselves and increase their misbegotten charities by getting their own creatures appointed to office and in that way securing control of the po lice and the administration of justice in the courts . The condi tions that prevail in organizations of this kind are inconceivable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver votes are true philanthropists to their wretched followers , who can not be blamed for being loyal to the only persons who stand between them and the world with which they are at war . No one who studies these conditions can help coming to the conclusion that the organizations that subvert elections arc in their nature a just punishment to society for the harshness with which it has treated those unfortunates who arc unfit for the struggle of life . Their misfortunes force them to grasp at the only straw that is offered to them and instead of denouncing them in unmeasured terms we should rather airs - by sane laws and human sympathy to relieve them of the miseries which force  | them for self-protection to run the courses we denounce . The forces that give power to the political bosses can all say with one of the most tragic of prisoners : " I know not whether laws be right Or whether laws be wrong , All that we know who lie in gaol Is that the walls are strong . " And they know from bitter experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them or open the doors of their prison house is the political boss at whose bidding they are willing to vote , to repay him for his Christian charity . It would be much better for us to understand these conditions than to denounce them . With the rise of the great corporations that need special legislation to secure for them the privileges they desire , the corrupt leaders with their wretched following were able to command greater prices for their influence than they could extort from the ordinary campaign managers who were willing , for the benefit of their high-minded party organizations , to stoop to deal with such people . The little bosses were bought up by the magnates of business life and the big bosses who carried out their will came into being . By the number of votes they controlled these bosses were able to take command of the parties and the decent citizens who wished to serve their country had to come to them hat in hand . With the advent of business men came the advent of business methods and the corrupt organizations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens that has ever been developed . Politics became an essential part of Big Business instead of the study of decent citizens . And all the while the honest partisans have stuck to their parties and helped more than any of them dream to make free government a farce . With all voters honest , or in a position to be honest , the party system of government would be admirable , for it would at all times have the Government checked and criticised by an honest and decent Opposition ; but as matters have developed it has become nothing short of a crime for a man to be a partisan . If  | he makes corruption possible he should bear the blame or at least share it with the weak or wretched people who sell their votes . One amusing outcome of the power that has been gained by the corrupt elements of society is that in some cases they have temporarily put an end to corruption by their extortionate de mands . Even Big Business could not afford the prices they in solently demanded , which shows that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the existence of the honest partisans , reducing the number of those who must be corrupted , that make bribery and the politics of the underworld possible and profitable . While the vast majority are sufficiently partisan to allow the balance of power to rest with the corrupt , corrup tion will continue . The science of political corruption has been developed to a point where it can be defeated only by a new conception of citizenship . How this end may be attained it is not the purpose of this article to suggest . Its sole purpose is to lay the blame for existing conditions where it really belongs , and that is at the door of the honest partisan . Let him bethink himself how his house is to be put in order . All parties are alike capable of being controlled by the combination of the underworld and the Higher Sphere of Finance . Between these upper and nether millstones of corruption the rights of the peo ple are being ground to extinction .  |            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
