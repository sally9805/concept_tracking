txt Why does this country tend always to belittle its wealth , its works , its men , and its power to meet calamity ? It does , and yet we are thought ? to be a people unembarrassed by modesty . Yankee boastfulness is a proverb in the world , but no Yankee ever told quite all the truth . He never dared , and , besides , he could not make himself believe the whole length and depth and breadth of it . Distrusting their own judgment , the American people ? lack confidence in their great estate . The temperament is rich in daring , faith , and optimism , but poor iri confidence , which is a quality that comes with time . A young people perhaps should not have i-c . It is not good to have everything . When a great man dies among us we are all somehow surprised that his greatness happened here , as if it had . been an accidental diversion of genius from other employment , a , bit of fine Providence misplaced .

When it is a figure whom everybody sees and knows it is thought the part of good social practice while he lives to keep him in order by pressure of suspicion and by threat of political interference ; and then , when he dies , it is feared that his works will disintegrate for want of a successor . The man having never been correctly appreciated , the stability of his works remains to be discovered . A generation ago the death of a big financier or railroad man , a Vanderbilt or a Gould , was a visitation which in the minds of speculators entailed panic and.ruin . It frequently did produce panic : the ruin never followed . What is created by one man 's imagination is a permanent addition to the stock of his country 's wealth , and survives him . Even the panic seldom happens any more . In the preceding generation the death or the elder J. PIERPONT Moncas would have been in Wall Street an event almost volcanic .

E. H. HARRIMAN 'S death produced immediately a very Violent effect upon prices , but that was owing to the mood of the day and to the fact that a wild speculation had just been taking place in his stocks . When the shock subsided in Wall Street the properties were exactly as before , except for the distrust with which any " successor " was bound to be received . For months there was a lot of silly talk about the Harriman mantle , for which no one applied . At last what became of it does not matter . Mantles are worthless . It is what a man does .

The Morgans and Harrimans and Hills of the future are doing their work in their own way , more or less unappreciated , and they have such materials of opportunity to work with as Men have never had before in the world . As ' with our men so with our other resources . We shut up the Stock Exchange and are apprehensive about the obligation to pay .
