txt The published rates of the Underwood schedules had already made it plain that the Democrats are to give the country a. competitive tariff . In its formal report introducing the bill the Ways and Means Committee frankly declares that the purpose is " to introduce in every line of Indus " try a competitive tariff basis , pro " viding for a substantial amount of " importation . " . The profits of the home manufacturer arc not to be protected , no monopoly of the home market is to be assured , and it is intended that the American manufacturer shall " meet honest competition . " Benefits will accrue to the consumer " by the " probable change in prices resulting " from the removal of excessive rates " in the present law . " But the manufacturer is comforted with the assurance that if he has to fight at home to control his market , if he is compelled to develop his business " along the best and most economical lines , " he will thus strengthen himself for the extension of his business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that " the future growth " of our great industries lies beyond " the seas . " None but those who have greatly prospered under a system of protected profits and find it exceeding hard to dispense with that favor will dispute the soundness of this reasoning . The Committee has evidently intended to give to the people the sort of tariff they have asked for . How soon or to what extent prices will be reduced under the stress of competition with the " substantial amount of importation " which the Committee thinks it has provided for remains to be seen . Even if in such commodities as articles of clothing made of wool there is no considerable reduction of price , the consumer will at least be in a position to demand better quality . Pure wool should be , and through the effect of increasing aversion to shoddy and Sham fabrics doubtless will be , more extensively used by our weavers ; and the same is doubtless true of American silks , which there is reason to believe bare been shockingly overweighted with chemicals by many Manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and garments made in large part of " wool " derived from old and worn fabrics do not give the purchaser the worth of his money . The Treasury experts estimate the revenue from all sources under the Underwood bill for the first year at $926,000,000. and the expenditures at $994,790,000 . The deficit of $68,790 , - 000 is to be made up by the income tax , the earning power of which for the first year is estimated at $70,125 , - 000 . For the first time we have a detailed and classified guess of the number of incomes upon which this tax will fall . In all , it is estimated that there are 425,000 : ncomes which will be reached by the tax , yielding the required revenue of $70,125,000 . It is interesting to note the incidence and ?  --  ' file yield of the tax in their relation to the wealth of the contributors . Men enjoying an income not in excess of $25.000 are not considered rich in this icountry . Of persons whose incomes exceed $4,000 annually , but do not exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According . to the rates of the proposed income tax these persons would pay to the Government $15,480,000 . The other $54 , - 636,000 of the estimated $70,125,000 would be contributed by the 33,500 individuals whose income exceeds $25 , - 000 a year . That is to say . a little over 3-100 of 1 per cent . of the people would pay $54,636,000 of the tax , and less than 4-10 of 1 per cent . would pay the remaining ** Together , less than one-half of 1 per cent . of the population of the country is to bear the burden of the entire $70,000,000 levied . Several popular principles of taxation are distinctly violated in this plan for the easy raising of revenue . The principle of " taxing wealth " fails , since less than $55,000,000 will be ' squeezed out of the rich . Manifestly , the rich are too few to bear the burden of supporting the Government ? there are only 33,500 of them reached by . thio income tax . The 391,500 Others with incomes between . $4,000 and $25 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do men with incomes of $2,000 , and so on up to $4,000 , belong to this class . The great bulk of all taxes comes from the middle class , yet this income tax is levied only upon a small fraction of that class . As the limit of exemption is lowered the number of the taxable increases rapidly . So would the unpopularity of the tax , and for that reason  --  the Democrats have most unjustly established the exemption limit at $4,000 . What the country may expect is plainly pointed out by the Committee 's report : With other sources of revenue rel. wised to an honest and fixed basis , and the income tax a permanent part of our revenue system , and at all times affording a substantial amount of revenue , Congress could , and if necessary should , annually raise or lower the Income tax rates in such a manner as would prevent either a deficit or a surplus in the Treasury . A more direct invitation to Congressional extravagance and a better arrangement for meeting its demands could not well be devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , every method of filling the gigantic " pork barrel " ' win be resorted to by Congress , eager to establish the popularity of Members in their home districts , and if deficits impend , the income tax will be raised . The one-half of 1 per cent . of the people upon whom this tax falls will be made to give up of their substance to foot the bills of wantonly wasteful legislation . This chosen one-half of 1 per cent of the people is the rock of credit from which abundant streams of revenue will flow . whenever Congress chooses to smite it , and we may be sure that it will be smitten hard and always harder , until the National conscience , if there be such a thing , revolts against the inequality and injustice of such a plan of taxation .
