txt Alexander Legge of Chicago , who has been with the War Industries Board for some time , has been made manager of the board , ranking directly under Bernard M. Baruch . At the same time , the importance of the position occupied by J. Leonard Replogle lull been measurably increased . Mr. Replogle is in full control of the steel industry , and while some of the requirements he has made have been drastic , as , for instance , the requirement that every Government need shall be met before any private orders are taken , the steel people are accepting all his orders without any complaint , because they are aware that he knows the business from the ground up . Mr. Replogle rose from office boy in the Cambria Steel plant until he became vice-president , and at one time was offered the presidency and declined it . Later he purchased the control of the company , but sold it some time afterward . The steel men recognize in him a man who not only knows the business and all branches of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As steel director he has obtained everything the Government needed , without friction or resentment . All the managers of steel properties have signed the pledge to give the Government 1005 : - . Incidentally , Mr. Replogle has turned to use even/ pound of steel that is available . In some cases where an industry was short of the kind of steel it had been using , he has been able to get them a supply of steel , formerly regarded almost as waste , but now rendering good service . The large volume of unfilled orders is being reduced gradually , and the chief limiting factor at the present time is man-power . The new " work or fight " draft regulations are helping this man-power situation to some extent in the steel industry , but there is a marked shortage of labor .
