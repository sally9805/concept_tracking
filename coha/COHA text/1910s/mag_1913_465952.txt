T is now known that everything which we see , and indeed many things which we do not see , such as air , are composed of atoms . Till within a few years it was believed on indirect evidence that this was so ; now we know that it is . What is an atom ? The meaning of the word is " uncuttable , " " indivisible . " For the origin of the conception we must go back to the times of the ancients . What we know of ancient literature is confined to the writings of the Assyrians , the Egyptians , the inhabitants of India , of Greece , and of Rome . But their writings treat of history or of poetry , as a rule ; the only scientific pursuits of the inhabitants of these countries were politics , ethics , and mathematics . Distinction was to be gained in the forum , in the temple , or on the battle field , not in wresting secrets from nature . Some of the ancient Greek authors , however , speculated on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empedocles , Epicurus , and Aristotle . One of the questions which they discussed was whether the matter of which they believed the world to consist was able to fill space entirely , or whether it consisted of particles . So far as our senses tell us , water or glass is a continuous whole ; whereas sandstone or snow consists of particles which can be seen by the unaided eye . The question was whether water , if it were possible to magnify it enormously , would not be seen to consist of minute particles , similar to those seen in sandstone , except that the water - particles would be mobile . On the whole , the verdict was that matter must consist of particles . Down to the Middle Ages the question still occupied men 's minds . In the time of King Charles II. , who , by the way , was the founder of the Royal Society for the Promotion of Natural Knowledge , his apothecary , N. Lefebure , stated clearly the arguments adduced by those who preferred the idea of a continuous instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you ask of what a body is composed , you will be told that that has not yet been settled by the schoolmen ; that ? if it . is a body it must have quantity , and therefore must be divisible ; it is clear that bodies must consist either of things divisible or indivisible ? that is , either of points or of parts . Now a body can not consist of points , because a point is indivisible , for it has no quantity ; and a point can not convey quantity to a body , seeing it has no quantity in itself . It must , therefore , be concluded that bodies must be composed of divisible parts ; but the objection to this view is that if this is so we ought to know whether the smallest part of such a body is divisible or not . If it is divisible , then it can not be the smallest part , because it can be divided into others still smaller ; and yet , if this smallest part is indivisible , there would always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could not convey quantity to a body , not having it itself ; for divisibility is the essential feature of quantity . " The argument may be summed up in the Latin saying , De minimis non est disputandum . In 1804 John Dalton revived ? the atomic hypothesis to explain the fact that when elements unite they do so in definite proportions ; and when they form more than one compound with each other the elements are present in multiple proportions . To give an instance : carbon burns in oxygen ; if there is plenty of oxygen , twelve parts of carbon are added to thirty-two parts of oxygen ; if there is excess of carbon , then the compound contains only sixteen parts of oxygen for each twelve parts of carbon . Dalton 's explanation was that in the first compound , carbonie-acid gas , one atom of carbon is united with two atoms of oxygen ; whereas in the second , one atom of carbon has united with one atom of oxygen . This hypothesis proved of the greatest use ; it gave definiteness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have developed . Still , it was a theory ; no one had seen an atom ; nor was there any direct evidence of the existence of atoms . It came to be evident , about the middle of the last century , that , in order to explain certain facts connected with the relative weights of gases , matter must not merely consist of atoms , but that these atoms must have the power of uniting in small groups . In forming a compound , indeed , this must be so ; for instance , carbonic-acid gas must consist of one atom of carbon which , along with two atoms of oxygen , forms a small group of three atoms . The novelty of the conception was in the notion that oxygen itself , in the state of gas , as it exists , for example , in the air , consists of small groups of atoms ; in this ease , two . To such small groups of atoms was given the name molecules . A molecule is that portion of a substance which can exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An atom generally exists in combination ; but atoms may , and sometimes do , exist separately ; in which case they also are termed molecules . Now , can molecules be seen I Is their existence a mere assumption ? The answer to that question is : no , they can not be seen ; but artificial molecules can be made which correspond so closely in their behavior to real molecules that the existence of real molecules is practically certain . Moreover , although no one has ever seen a Molecule , still the track of a molecule moving through space has been seen ; and just as Robinson Crusoe was right in inferring the existence of Man Friday from his footstep imprinted in the sand , so the real existence of a molecule may just as certainly be inferred from the track it leaves . How that has been done we shall now proceed to explain . Our atmosphere consists of a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen , together with small quantities of other gases , of which argon is present in largest amount . Airis somewhat lighter than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , air is nearly fourteen and one-half times as heavy . Now , the atmosphere presses on the surface of the earth , owing to its weight ; the pressure at the level of the sea is about fourteen pounds on each square inch ; it is generally measured by the height of the barometer , which , at sea-level , is thirty inches in fine weather . If we ascend a hill , the barometer falls ; there is no longer so much air pressing on the earth , for there is less air above us . To halve the pressure we should require to ascend nearly foin- miles ; this is not quite so high as the highest of the Himalayan Mountains . There would then be as much air below us as above us . Suppose now that the atmosphere consisted not of air , but of hydrogen ; how high would it be necessary to ascend in order to halve the pressure ? Evidently , in order to have the same weight of hydrogen pressing on us as we have air , the atmosphere would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure we should need to ascend , not four , but fourteen times four , or fifty-six miles . The pressure of a column of gas , be it air or hydrogen , depends evidently on two things : first , on the relative weight of the molecules of the gas ; and , second , on the number of molecules in the layer of gas that is pressing on us . It is supposed , in the calculation which we have just made , that when the number of molecules is equal , then the pressure is equal ; and this can be easily proved . So that a quart of air , at four miles up , would contain as many molecules as a quart of hydrogen at fifty-six miles up . From this it follows that if we knew the height at which the density of gas would be halved , and if we also knew the number of molecules of air in a quart at the height where its density is halved , we should be able to calculate the number of molecules in a quart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jean Perrin , one of the professors in the University of Paris ; and they constitute one of the most remarkable feats that have ever been accomplished . Perrin made what may be called " artificial molecules , " by pouring a solution of gamboge , the ordinary water-color paint , into water . The gamboge separates as a milky cloud ; and , Been under a microscope , the cloud consists of small , round particles of different sizes . Months were spent in separating out a lot of uniform size . This was done by a method of settling them ; the larger grains settle more quickly than the smaller ones . But the process was slow , before a sufficient number of equal size had been collected . Next , the density of the grains had to be found ; this was not difficult ; a known volume of the suspended grains was weighed in a flask , and the weight of the solid in the water was found by evaporating of ? the water and weighing what remained . To find the diameter of a grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing some of ' the suspension to dry up ; a lot of grains , which could be counted , often lay in a row the length of which could be measured . Of these grains , 125,000 would lie along an inch ; and each grain was about one and a fifth times as heavy as water . The next step was to make a kind of atmosphere of these grains , and to find nut at what height their number would be halved . The emulsion was accordingly put into a small glass dish and placed below a photographing microscope . The microscope was focused on one of the lower layers , and a photograph was taken ; naturally , only those in focus appeared on the plate . The microscope was then shifted to a known distance , so as to take a picture of the grains higher up ; and this process was repeated until the numbers at different heights in this " atmosphere " of gamboge granules had been measured . Now we come to a sum in proportion . The height at which the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the density ; thus , as already stated , because hydrogen is fourteen times less dense than air , it is necessary to go fourteen times as high in an atmosphere of hydrogen before its density is halved . So that by comparing the height required in the " atmosphere " of gamboge with that required for hydrogen or for air , their relative densities are determined ; and as it is known that equal numbers of molecules , at the same temperature , exert the same pressure , and as the number of particles of gamboge in a known volume had been counted , it follows that the number of particles -- that is , of molecules ? in the same volume of air or of hydrogen can be reckoned , for it is identical . An ordinary thimble holds about three cubic centimeters ; the number of molecules of air which fills it is expressed by one followed by twenty naughts , or a hundred million million million . And knowing the relative weights of the same volume of hydrogen and of gamboge particles , exerting the same pressure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hydrogen can be calculated ; there are four followed by twenty-six naughts in a grain weight . Such figures convey little ; they only show us what extraordinarily small things there are in this world of ours . But the fact that " visible molecules , " as we may term these particles of gamboge , behave in a manner exactly similar to molecules of gases such as hydrogen , or of the oxygen and nitrogen of which air consists , makes it absolutely certain that such invisible molecules really exist , and that their real , not merely their relative , weights can be determined . So much for molecules ; now for atoms . Every one has heard of radium , the wonderful metal discovered by Madame Curie . Among its other remarkable properties it has the one of breaking up , or disintegrating ; one of its products is a gas named wilon , and at the same time it expels an atom of helium , a gas discovered by the writer of this Article in 1895 . The breaking up of an atom of radium is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is that the atom of helium is shot off with enormous velocity indeed , at a rate of about 12.500 miles a second , which is about the fifteenth part of the velocity of light . The breaking down of radium into helium was the first known instance of the decomposition of a chemical element , or of one element changing into another ; it was discovered by Mr. Frederick Soddy and the writer in 1903 . The rate of motion of the helium atom thus expelled was first measured by Professor Thither ford . To Mr. C. T. R. Wilson , of Cambridge , we owe the astonishing feat of mapping the trail of the moving helium atom ; and we shall try to give a description of how this wonder was accomplished . deleted material of the helium particles with the air molecules , and the consequent stoppage of their motion . The photograph reveals a number of short , straight lines radiating from the particles of radium from which the helium atoms are escaping ; these consist of lines of vapor condensed on the ions of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly moving helium atoms . Again , although we can not see atoms , still their paths can be traced and their presence revealed . Until recent years it was believed that there are some eighty kinds of matter which can not be simplified ; to these were given the name " elements . " Water , for instance , can be changed , on passing an electric current through it , into its constituents , oxygen and hydrogen ; from glass it is possible to produce its constituents , namely , silicon , calcium , sodium , and oxygen ; all these were , and are still , termed elements , for out of none of them was it possible to obtain any simpler form of matter . To each of these elements an atomic weight has been ascribed ; thus , taking the weight of an atom of hydrogen as unity , that of oxygen is 16 ; of silicon , 23 ; of sodium , 23 ; and of calcium , 40 ; these are the relative weights of the respective atoms . Here is a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 ; helium , 4 ; lithium , 7 ; glucinum , 9 ; boron , 11 ; carbon , 12 ; nitrogen , 14 ; oxygen , 16 ; fluorine , 19 ; neon , 20 ; sodium , 23 ; magnesium , 24 ; aluminium , 27 ; silicon , 28 ; phosphorus , 31 ; sulphur , 32 ; chlorine , 35 ; argon , 40 ; potassium , 39 ; calcium , 40 , etc . If these numbers be compared , it will be seen that they follow a certain order ; thus , the eighth element after helium is neon , like helium an inactive gas ; the eighth eleinent after lithium is sodium , a soft , white metal like lithium ; similarly , magnesium resembles glucinum ; aluminium resembles boron ; silicon , carbon ; and so on . Argon , again , is the eighth element after neon , which it resembles , as it also resembles helium . There is another noticeable point . Niton has been mentioned as one of the products into which radium changes ; the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been very carefully determined ; it is 226 . As the loss of an atom of helium VOL . CXXVIL ? No. 750. - 46 of atomic weight 4 changes it into niton , the atomic weight of niton should be 226 minus 4 , or 922 ; and the result of experiments by Dr. Whytlaw - Gray and the writer showed that that is the atomic weight of lawn . We have here a clue to the structure of one element ; and it is worth while seeing if other elements can not be caused to change , and whether one of the products of the change will not be helium . Radium changes spontaneOusly ; how can other elements be induced to imitate it ? Let us first think of compounds all of which are decomposable . Most compounds change into the elements of which they are composed if they are raised to a sufficiently high temperature , or if they are made to conduct an electric current . Elements , on the other hand , stand the highest temperatures which can be produced artificially without changing their nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid elements melt , and then change to gas ; but the element remains essentially the same ; on cooling , the original substance is recovered . What may happen at the enormously high temperature of some of the stars is another thing ; there is evidence , which can not be treated of in the present article , which gives rise to the presumption that in the hottest stars many of our elements have no existence . Again , elements either refuse to allow an electric current to pass through them , like sulphur , or they conduct the current , like copper , and are not altered thereby . Heat and electricity in motion are forms of eneigy ; and the problem is how to impart a very large quantity of energy to a small quantity of an element . The most potent form of energy which we know ? that is , the greatest amount of energy in the smallest space ? is that afforded by the spontaneous decomposition of niton , the first product from radium ; it is capable of raising two and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or , by volume , twenty-foUr million times in about a month ; for it takes about that space of time to " disintegrate . " A gram , about the thirtieth part of an ounce , of niton will give off as much energy as five horses would if they worked for a month . But no one can obtain a gram of niton ; the amount with which the writer worked was only the millionth part of that quantity ; it represents the work which would be done by a horse in twelve and a half seconds . Still , the space occupied by the niton is infinitesimal ; a little tube no thicker than the finest hair and an eighth of an inch long would amply hold the niton . Now , niton , it will be remembered , changes spontaneously ; it expels atoms of helium moving with enormous velocity . Just as bombardment with the stream of bullets from a machine-gun destroys any object on which the bullets strike , so it may he conjectured that the stream of helium atoms may destroy the atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some niton was dissolved in water ; it was easy to prove that the gases produced consist mainly of oxygen and hydrogen , the elements of which the water consists . It was also easy to detect the helium produced from the niton ; but it was with considerable surprise that it was found that the element neon was mixed with the helium . Nature sometimes aids us in making experiments , although as a rule she places hindrances in our way ; in this case she was kind . Mineral springs often contain niton , and gases escape from the water in large quantity . An investigation of the gas escaping from the mineral springs of Bath showed the presence of helium , as might have been expected , due to the disintegration of the niton ; but the amount of neon in these gases greatly exceeds that of the helium . Again , when niton is dissolved in a solution of sulphate of copper , some of the atoms of copper appear to be broken up by the rapidly moving helium atoms , and another element , lithium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the elements silicon , titanium , zirconium , and thorium , as well as lead , when treated with niton , yield carbon as one of their products of decomposition . In fact , it must be inferred that just as there are elements which spontaneously change into others , so many of the ordinary " stable " elements can he broken down by appropriate treatment . " Appropriate treatment " means the communication to the element to be changed of a large dose of concentrated energy ; and the next step was to try if electric energy would have a disintegrating effect . Every one knows nowadays that it is possible , by means of " X-rays , " to photograph the bones , and indeed the heart and the stomach , inside the body . An X-ray bulb is a glass flask with three metal plates in its interior , connected to the outside by wires . From one of these plates negative electricity in the form of cathode rays is made to stream ; these rays hit another plate , placed at an angle , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these which are used to take photographs . The third plate is the positive electrode . These bulbs are " run " for months before they become useless , hence they have received large doses of energy during their lifetime . Now , on examining the gas from the interior of several of these bulbs , old from use , it was found that helium was present . The air contains some helium ; and it was not impossible , though unlikely , that it might have entered the bulb through the glass . But that idea was negatived by experiments made quite independently by Professor Norman Collie and by Mr. Hubert Patterson ; each of them passed a stream of cathode rays through hydrogen ; the rays impinged on the glass vessel ; and after five hours both helium and neon were found in the gases pumped out of the bulb . Again , the helium , and the neon might conceivably have entered from the outside air ; but that was disproved by surrounding the bulb with an external vessel from which all air had been removed ; helium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been exposed to the cathode rays ; none could have entered from without . On interposing a plate of aluminium , so that the cathode rays did not strike the glass , no neon was formed ; the glass of the vessel appears to be essential to the formation of neon . Now , glass is a compound of silicon , calcium , sodium , and oxygen ; presumably it is the oxygen which leads to the production of neon , although that has not yet been conclusively established ; both Professor Collie and Mr. Patterson found that if oxygen is present along . with the hydrogen in the bulb , and if the mixture is treated with cathode rays ,
