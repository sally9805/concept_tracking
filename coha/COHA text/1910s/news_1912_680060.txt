txt BALTIMORE , Md. , June ** Bryan a Candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination ? Can a duck swim ? A Philadelphian was overheard this morning saying to himself : " Oh , Bryan will hog it , of course he will . I claim that a yellow dog could be elected now , in view of the Scrap at Chicago , though I would prefer a white one . " Could Bryan carry the country if he should be nominated ? Possibly so , but it would be the first time in sixteen long and weary years . Could he beat Taft if he should be nominated ? Why should he ? There is a good deal of feeling among the more conservative members of the Democratic Convention because of the rather dictatorial quality of the Nebraskan 's letter of instructions to the Presidential candidates , and there is a growing disposition to do to him here what the Taft people did to the other Colonel at ' Chicago . It might have been better to name Senator O'Gorman instead of Judge Parker for Temporary Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so , as that would have " evened up " conditions in the Democratic and Republican Conventions ; but why should the convention at Baltimore be , ev.n in the appear ' once of evil , anything like the convention at Chicago ? What candidate has Bryan elected ? If he could not save himself , how could he save others ? Underwood was not asked what he would do about It . Harmon was not asked . These are the two really strong and safe men who have been mentioned for the nomination . Here , again , was manifested the ever-present disposition of Bryan to make a personal matter of it , to hold the Democratic Party to himself , or subject to his orders . This is perfectly clear from a statement made this evening by a member of the Democratic National Committee , who said that up to the time the vote was taken by the sub-committee on the question of the Temporary Chairmanship not one word of counsel had been received from Mr. Bryan . The member of the committee from Nebraska said that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question on his own responsibility and without having heard a word from Mr , Bryan . No sooner , however , had the Commoner been advised of the action of the sub-committee than he began immediately to make trouble , and there will be plenty of it if the few signs that have been observed do not fail . It was said by a very careful correspondent fresh from the field of slaughter at Chicago that the Democrats here were getting ready to treat Bryan very much as Roosevelt was treated in the Windy City . In the opinion of Clark Howell , the Georgia member of the National Committee and a most faithful follower of the Nebraskan until he could really follow no longer , Mr. Bryan is heading for the nomination . Josephus Daniels of North Carolina does not think Bryan is a candidate , will be a candidate , or shoald be a candidate . He ' said to-day : " I think it is going to be a long convention and stubbornly fought . There will be no change in the two-thirds rule ? the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more votes than Wilson and he will aold them for several ballots ; but they are not like the Old Guard . There are many Clark delegates who are not in for the finish and after several ballots they will , of course , fall away . The fight will be in the National Committee on Monday . The Sub-Committee on Arrangements vote was a tie for Parker . being eight for him and eight scattered among several candidates . " A recommendation will he made to the full committee in favor of Judge Parker . Those who favor a progressive candidate for Temporary Chairman will hope to unite upon a conservative who will command the full vote of the progressive members of the committee , and if they can unite on one man they will have a small majority and can elect him . That is their difficulty . The Clark men will , not like to vote for a Wilson man and the Wilson men will not like ' to vote for a Clark man . The complication is whether they can agree on a man who will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The first fight may take a long time . I think the convention will begin to vote Thursday afternoon . A large majority of the convention is progressive , of course , and an attempt is being made to get all the votes on a candidate united . The New York end of it will probably vote for Gaynor on the first ballot , then for Harmon , then for Underwood . When these are all elim 1-nated. as they will be , it will be up to the New York and other delegations who are for a conservative more than for a progressive candidate to decide whether they will take Wilson or Clark . If the antagonism between the Clark and Wilson people should make it impossible for them to unite , Marshall should command more strength than seems possible now . " It is to be regretted that there is to be a contest for the Temporary Chairman . It should not have been precipitated . The progressive members of the Committee of lArrangements prefer that some man - should be selected whom all can recommend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent man , the fact that he has the reputation of being the attorney of Ryan caused members of the committee to ( noose his selection . They ' proposed several men whom they thought acceptable to all the committee , but the New York organization demanded Parker and would not accept any other candidate for the position . This precipitated a fight on the Temporary Chairmanship . Some people thought that there was in the selection of Parker a desire on the part of the New York organization to favor the candidacy of Harmon : and while they knew that Judge Parker would act fairly in the chair . they did not like to have a Chairman whose election would be claimed is helping the Ohio candidate , " Norman Mack , Chairman of the National Committee , said this afternoon that Parker would be made Temporary Chairman ; that he wished to make this statement and prediction as strong as possible . Mr. Mack 's opinion appears to he shared by a very large and important element in the convention . Mr. Bryan is expected to reach Baltimore to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight he will find , if the counsels of the peace-at-any-price contingent do not prevail , all the fight he wants . To-day there was a great opening at the Armory , so that all the inhabitants could see the battlefield before it is mussed up by the charging legions . Delegates are coming in by every train , and it will strain the hospitality of this town to take care of everybody . One of the most conspicuous signs on a leading thoroughfare to-day was this : " Welcome , Democrats . Hotel bar . " But so far the crowds are well behaved . ? S. C. H. .
