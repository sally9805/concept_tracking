txt The Secretary of the Admiralty begs to state that a report has been received from - the Captain of H. M. S. Centurion to the effect that his ship collided early this morning with a small steamer , name unknown , off Portland Bill . After the collision the steamer was seen astern . ' but was lost sight of in the funnel smoke and was not sighted again , al-though search was made for about two hours until after daylight , and search-1 lights were used . " No one on board the Centurion was injured , but the battleship received certain damages . " In these measured , cold , official words is contained the story of a tragedy of the sea , the sudden destruction with all hands of a ship by a dreadnought , rushing at the rate of 19 or 20 knots through the water and the night on a speed trial . So sudden was the disaster that none in the doomed vessel escaped , No indication of her name or nationality remains except a port light which was found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecastle . As the Centurion 's bow rises to a height of about thirty feet above the water the light must have been carried in the vanished steamer at or about that height . This is indirect evidence that the lost vessel was of some size . The ' following account of the collision is given by one of the Centurion 's crew : " The Centurion was steaming on a westerly course at a speed between 19 and 20 knots . The weather was fairly calm , the sea moderate , the , wind only from four to five knots . It was a very dark night , but the lights of the oncoming vessel were made out at some distance . She was seen to have stern and side lights burning brightly . Apparently she attempted to cross the bow of the Centurion , which struck her with great force . " The battleship 's starboard bow struck the steamer on the port side well forward . She is believed to have been sunk at once . The collision occurred at 5:38 A. M. Nothing was seen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her beam ends by the blow and at once toppled over and went to the bottom , " The Captain of the Centurion had the collision mats out , as it was found that the battleship was taking in water to some extent . The sea boats ' crew were called , and they manned the ' boats , but although the Centurion cruised in the vicinity until daylight , nothing was seen either of the steamer or of wreckage . " Judging from the shock , which was felt all over the warship , the vessel struck was a fairly large one . Whether she was a passenger vessel or a tramp steamer is not known . The shock roused those of the crew who were below asleep , and they hurried on deck , fearing the great vessel had gone ashore . Only a few minutes sufficed for the watch below to reach deck , but by that time the steamer had disappeared . " Others of the crew believe the ship sunk was a tramp steamer , and deny that she was seen from the Centurion till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man was made out on her deck , and that he Jumped and made a desperate effort to reach the deckrail of the Centurion . He almost touched it , and then fell back between the two ships . He was seen no more . though the searchlights were switched on and played on the spot . The Centurion was traveling at such speed that she covered a considerable distance before she could be stopped . The Centurion arrived at Plymouth this afternoon . An examination shows . that her starboard bow struck the unknown steamer a glancing blow . The impact was sufficient to - snap one anchor and drive the shank of the second anchor through the plating on the starboard side . Two months will be required for repairs .
