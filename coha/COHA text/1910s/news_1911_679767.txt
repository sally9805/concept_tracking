So ' far as can be judged beforehand , an unusual number of citizens this year are in a ' state of mind where they would very much like to cast their votes so that they would do the greatest good without reference to ! party bias . What are the real chances of their being able to carry out their wish in any satisfying degree ? Most voters of this class have fixed their attention more upon the election of Assemblymen than on any other matter . It is felt that in this there is the best show of accomplishing something , of rebuking misconduct in the late session , of rewarding good service , of securing certain of the general in , terests of the community .

The fact is that , so far as the vast interests of this city of five millions population are concerned , its citizens ought to have the right and the power to manage their own affairs and to do this by a far simpler method than is now available .
