WITHIN the narrow limits of this article I wish to consider the Indian Government and its ideas ; that is to say , the men and the laws by which they govern . First , take the personnel , for there is no complaint more insistent on all sides than that the officers of to-day are not the same as those of fifty or more years ago . They are out of touch with the people . It was for some time supposed by Government that this was only partially true . That Government itself , that is , the Secretariats , were out of touch , was felt and avowed . But it was supposed that this arose from the specializing of function . The work of Secretaries had become so difficult , so special , so different from district work , that instead of there being interchange of officers , the Secretaries usually passed all their official lives away from actual contact with the realities of the people . Orders were passed that in future this was not to occur ; men were to come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then secretarial work , bringing to the latter knowledge gained in the former . But it was quickly seen that this had little or no result . If the Secretaries were out of touch , the district officers were hardly less so . Government as a whole had separated from the people . English and Indians were divided ; nothing was gained . What then was the difference be . tween the men of the past and those of the present ? Let us consider . They went out younger in those days ; sixteen , seventeen , and eighteen , were the usual ages . The usual age for cadets was twenty . Clive , Warren Hastings , Nicholson and John Lawrence went out at eighteen , Henry Lawrence at seventeen , Meadows Taylor at fifteen . Many of the administrators were soldiers first , and they too went out young . Lord Roberts , for instance , was sixteen when he landed in India . Addiscombe cadets joined at sixteen or seventeen . When Haileybury was established the average age was raised to twenty-three or more , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year in India is also spent in training , out there a man is now not far from twenty-five before he is allowed to act independently ; he used to be twenty-one or less . This is a great difference . In England the age when a boy attains his majority and has full freedom before the law is twenty-one , and in order to elucidate this question I have tried to discover why the law of England fixed twenty-one . In Rome a boy was legally of age as regards his person at fourteen , though he had a curator over his property till he was twenty-five . Therefore this age of twenty-one does not come from Roman law . It seems to have arisen from a general consensus of observation that at twenty-one the average young man is fit to be free and should be free . There seems to be about that age a critical mental stage of adolescence corresponding to the physical stage at fourteen . However this may be , there seems to be no doubt that to keep a won , man in tutelage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad for him . The powers of initiative and the sense of responsibility which mature at twenty-one atrophy thereafter if not fully used . And no book-learning can replace them . Thus nowadays tutelage is too long continued . Again , education began later in those ( lays than now , and there was less of it . Boys ran wild far more than now , when they are cramped up in schools and conventions at a very early age . Thus the men of old had individualities ; they had not been steam-rollered flat by public school and university ; their boyish enthusiasm and friendliness were still in them . They had no prejudices , had never heard of ' the Oriental mind , ' were not convinced beforehand that every Oriental was a liar and a thief , but were prepared to take men as they found them . They were willing and eager to learn . Their minds were open as yet to new impressions . They had not been ' fortified by fixed principles ' to ' safeguard them ' against acquiring any sympathy with Eastern peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will read the records of the past you will see this in a most marked degree . Englishmen had Indian friends ; how rarely do they have such now ! They knew the people 's talk , their folklore and their tales . They looked on them as fellow humans . And the feeling was reciprocated . See , for instance , how they kept the same servants throughout their service . Nowadays there is a general howl of the badness of Indian servants and their untrustworthiness . It was not so then . One of the most pleasing features of that old life was the affection often shown between masters and servants . Dickens has noted it . How much of that do you find now ? Not much . A little still there is ? who should know better than I ? And if now it is so rare , where is the fault ? Good masters make good servants . And it requires so little goodness in the master , ? only a little consideration , a friendly word sometimes . They give back far more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who makes them bad ? Their masters ; those with whom they began their service , who did not know how to treat them , how to help them , how to keep them . At Arcot the sepoys gave the rice to their officers and took the conjee themselves ; how many regiments would do that now ? There may be one or two . I do not say that there was ever close personal intercourse between English and Indian ; there was not , and in the nature of things there could not be . But there was mutual consideration and respect . ' We have different ways and customs ; we have different skins . But underneath it all we are both men . ' So they thought in the old days . Thus in the old days the embryo official came out young , free from prejudices , full of enthusiasms , ready to learn : to read , mark , learn , and inwardly digest all phases of Oriental life about him . Even thirty years ago , when I first went to India , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it their duty , as it was their pleasure , to study the people in order to understand what lay beneath their customs . It must be thirty years ago that an old civilian turned on me sharply when I made some ignorant remark about some Malabar custom and said , ' The custom has arisen out of the circumstances of life , and no peculiarity of nature in the people . All peoples are much alike in fundamentals , and great apparent differences are but superficial and arise from environment . ' The absurd doctrine of the ' Oriental mind ' had not then arisen to be an excuse for ignorance and want of understanding . Nowadays it is supposed to be the mark of culture to talk of it ; to the old officials it would have been the mark of a fool ; they thought it their duty to study the people . But it is not so now . Young civilians come out with their minds already closed , and as a rule closed they remain . The harm is done in England before they start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a young civilian joins , to send him to a district headquarters for six months first , to learn his way about before posting him to any specified work . One such was sent to me ten years ago , and if I give an account of him it will do for all . For nowadays they are all turned out of the same mill , have all the same habits of mind and thought , and their personalities are submerged . If anything , he of whom I speak was above the average in all ways . He was a very nice young fellow , with charming manners , and I greatly liked him . He became an officer of great promise and would have risen high , but he is dead now , and therefore what I say can not offend any one . Besides , I have nothing to say that would offend . He was , I think , twenty-three years of age , of good people , educated at a public school and Oxford , and was as nice a boy as could be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said to be clever , and as regards assimilating paper knowledge , he was able , but his mind was an old curiosity shop . He had fixed ideas in nearly everything . He was full of prejudices he called principles , of facts that were not facts . He had learned a great deal , but he knew nothing ; and worse , he did not know how to obtain knowledge . He wanted his opinions ready-made and absolute first , and only sought for such facts as would support those principles . He had no notion how to make knowledge by himself . He wanted author . ity before he would think . Give him authority and he would disregard or deny fact in order to cling to it . I will take a concrete instance . There is among Englishmen in Burma a superstition that the Burmese do not and can not work . They are ' lazy . ' The men never work if they can help it , and all the work that is done is done by women . How this idea arose is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need not enter into that now . The idea obtains universally , and is an acknowledged shibboleth . My young assistant was not with me many days before he brought it up . ' Oh , ' he said , ' the Burman is so lazy . ' ' You are sure of that ? ' I asked . He stared at me . ' Why , every one says so . ' ' Every one said four hundred years ago that the sun went round the earth , ' I answered ; ' were they right ? ' ' You do n't mean to tell me , ' he said , ' that the Burmese can work . ' ' I do n't mean to tell you anything , ' I answered . ' Here are a quarter of a million Burmese in this district . Find out the facts for yourself . ' The necessity of having to support his theories with facts seemed to him unreasonable . ' But , ' he objected , ' I can see they are lazy . ' The Burman is lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it ? He did not say this , but undoubtedly he was thinking it . However , at last he did find what he considered a fact . ' You remember , when we rode into that village the other day about noon , the number of men we saw sleeping in the veranda ? ' ' True , ' I said . ' Does not that show it ? ' ' Suppose , ' I said , ' you had got up at four o'clock in the morning alit work-ed till ten , in the fields , would you not ? ? a rest before going out at three alum , o'clock again ? ' ' Do they do that ? ' he asked . ' You can find out for yourself if they do or not , ' I answered . He looked at me doubtfully . ' But , ' he objected , ' it is notorious . ' ' So is the fact that the standard of living in Burma is very high . How do you living the two ? Laziness and Comfort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only apparent . ' ' A rich country , ' he said . Is it ? ' I asked . ' Look at the dry bare land , of which nearly all the district and most of Upper Burma is composed . Is it rich ? You have eyes to see . You know it is not rich ; why do you say it is ? ' Ile shook his head almost as if I had hurt him and searched about for a defense . But Lower Burma is rich . ' Certainly ; and if you look at the export returns you will see the enormous amount of rice it grows and exports . Is that rice the product of laziness ? ' ' But , ' he said at last in despair , ' if this laziness of the Burman is untrue , how did the idea become general ? ' Ah , ' I answered , ' that is another matter . Let us stick to one thing at a time . We are concerned now with whether it is true or not . Decide that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work , and I think you will had it is sufficient . You have the opportunity of judging , and unless you use that opportunity you have no right to an opinion at all . ' Ile said no more at the time , but a few days later he returned to the sub- ject . A high official had been opening a public work in Mandalay and had made a speech . Much of the labor for the work had been Burmese , where usually such labor is imported Indian , and he referred with satisfaction to the fact . ' I am glad to see , ' said the High Official , ' that the Burmese are taking to hard work . ' My assistant brought this up . ' Here is authority , ' he said . ' Certainly , ' I said , ' there is authority on one side ; now let us look at fact on the other ; whether it is better to be a peasant proprietor on your own land , or a day laborer ? ' . ' The proprietor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a bad year in some districts . Crops have failed . You can read that from the weekly reports in my office . Many cultivators have had to abandon their holdings and turn to day labor . Is that good ? Are they to be congratulated on it ? ' The boy looked downcast . ' No , ' he admitted . ' Well , then , ' I asked , what will they think of a government which says such things ? ' He reflected for some time . ' But , ' he said at length , ' when one authority ( the high official ) says one thing , and another authority ( you ) says the reverse , what am I to believe ? ' Then came my opportunity . ' You are to believe nothing , ' I said . ' You have eyes , you have ears , you have common sense . They are given you to use and see facts for yourself . The facts are all roundYou You will never do any good work ' if you refuse to face facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your salt as an official you will have to work by sight , not by faith . ' He laughed . At first he seemed puzzled ; then he was pleased . He had been educated to accept what he was told and never to question . His mind had been stunted and the idea of exercising it again delighted him . To judge by himself was a new idea to him entirely and he welcomed it . He began to do so . For the first time since childhood he was encouraged to use that which is the only thing worth cultivating : his common sense . But even yet he could not emancipate himself . Some time later a new subject came up . This time it was the disappearance of the Burman . He is supposed to be dying out . The Indian is ' outing ' him . Before long there will be none left . My assistant had read it in the paper and heard it almost universally , therefore it must be true . I said nothing at the time , but that day when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two Census tables with a short note . Will you kindly , ' I wrote , ' make out for me the Burmese population in 1891 , and the same in 1901 , district by district , and let me know where there have been decreases , also increases , and the percentage of increase . ' The next day he came to me with an amused expression on his face and a paper of figures in his hand . ' I have made them all out , ' he said , as you wished . Here they are . ' Then , ' I said , let us take the districts with the decreases first . Please show me them . ' ' There are none , ' he answered . They all show increases . ' Large ? ' I asked . Yes , large , ' he said , ' from a population of about nine million to ten million in ten years is a good increase . The Burmese are peolific . ' But , ' I remarked also , ' I thought the Burman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that ? ' He laughed ; he had taken his lesson . And again , another point . I had received an order from Government which I thought was mistaken , and I said so . He was a Government official also , and I could say to him what I could not say to others . Then you wo n't carry it out ? ' he asked , surprised . ' I am here to carry out orders , and of course I shall carry it out . ' But why then do you criticize it , if it must be carried out ? ' Look here , ' I said , before very long you will be sent to a subdivision of my district to govern it . I shall send you many orders , and shall expect you to carry them out . ' Right or wrong ? ' Right , or , as you may think , wrong . You must do as I say . Without this , government is impossible . But I do not want you to think as I do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to you issued from a miscon. ception on my part , you must not refuse to obey , but I should expect you to tell me any facts that would lead me to better knowledge . Your business is not merely to carry out orders , but to furnish me with correct information how to better those orders . You are not merely to be part of the district hand but of its brain too . I should want you to criticize every order in your mind , try to understand it , and if you disagree with it , examine your reasons for disagreement and see if they are good . ' And let you know ? ' Whenever you are sure that I am wrong , and the matter is important . ' But would n't criticism be " cheek ? " ' Not if it is true and valuable . You would be doing me a valuable service . It is what I want . How do you suppose we are ever to get on if opinions are to be stereotyped ? Thought must be free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't care for either . Give me facts , and be sure of your facts : see , ' he said . You can be quite kind about it , you know , ' I suggested . ' Is that what you are to Government , ' he asked , ' when you disagree with them ? ' ' I try to be , ' I said . ' I put myself as far as I can in their position and give them what I would like to receive . ' Again it was quite a new idea to him that any one should want criticism . He had been educated to believe that any doubt of what authority said was a sin , perhaps inevitable sometimes , but anyhow always to be concealed ; and he had been told that every one , from the Creator down , resented criticisms and would annihilate the critic . That any one should prefer knowing the truth , even if it prove him wrong , seemed to him impossible . He did not like ever to admit that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas it is comparative and always growing . He had , unconsciously , the mind of the Pharisee in the Temple . Now , these three instances will point out what seems to me to be wrong in the previous training of young men sent to India , and in fact in all training . Their minds instead of being cultivated are stifled . They are taught to disregard fact , and to accept authority in place of it . They are not only to do what they are told , which is right ; but to think what they are told , which is wrong . And they do . They are taught to repeat in parrot manner stock phrases and imagine they are thinking . And this habit once acquired is difficult to get rid of . There is throughout nearly all English officials ( and non-officials ) in India not only a disregard of facts about the people among whom they live , but a cant of any real sympathy with them , which is astonishing . They often like the ' natives , ' they often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do their best for them , but that is not sympathy . Sympathy is understanding . It is being able to put yourself in another 's place . I could tell many stories illustrating this want of understanding . One will suffice . An official I knew well ? an excellent fellow , kindhearted , humorous and able , holding a good position then and a high one now , with a charming wife , living among the Burmese and ruling them , with Burmese servants , clerks and peons , and continual Burmese visitors of all classes ? called his dog ' Alaung . ' Now , Alaung ' means something very similar to Messiah ' and is a sacred word . A parallel would be if , say , a Parsee in England called his dog ' Christ . ' I have seen this official 's servants wince when he called out to his dog . Yet I am sure it never struck him that there was anything out of the way in this nomenclature . I am sure he never dreamed he would hurt any one 's feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He certainly intended no jeer at the religion of his subordinates . It was simply that he wanted understanding . Now , sympathy is inherent in all children , and is the means whereby they acquire all the real knowledge they have . A girl being a mother to her doll , a boy being a soldier or hunter , is exercising and training the most valuable of all gifts ? imaginative sympathy . It is the only emotion which brings real knowledge of the world about you . Without it you never understand anything . II THE TRAINING OF A CIVIL OFFICER Therefore there is a wide difference between the men as they came out in the old days and as they come out now . Then they were young , not very well instructed , but capable of seeing , understanding and learning ; nowadays they are so drilled and instructed that they can deal only with books , papers and records , whereas life has been closed to them ; they can enforce laws , but not temper them . After they come out the difference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , for instance , they picked up the language quickly and well . The time to learn a language is when you are young , the younger the better . We learn our own language as children . The older we grow the harder it is , because it means not merely learning by heart a great many words , not merely training the palate and tongue to produce different sounds , but adopting a new attitude of mind . Nothing definite has been discovered as to the localization of faculties in the brain , therefore nothing certain is known , but it has always seemed to me and to others whom I have consulted that when you learn a new language you are exercising and developing a new piece of brain . When you know several languages and change from one to another , you seem definitely to change the piece of brain which actuates your tongue . You switch off one centre and switch on to another . You will always notice in yourself and others that there is a definite pause when the change of language is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaken an unused part of the brain and bring it into active use , and to begin at twenty-three is late . True , languages are taught them at Oxford before they come out , but the result seems nil . You must learn a language where it is spoken . Moreover , the way they have been taught Latin and Greek is a hindrance , for living languages are not learned that way . A child , for instance , learns to talk perfectly without ever learning grammar . I never heard that any great English writer had a grounding in English grammar . There is no real grammar of a living language , because it grows and changes . you can only have a fixed grammar of a dead language . The fact is that correct talking is the outcome of correct thinking , not of arn mechanical rules . You must think in a language before you can speak it well . But at twenty-three it is far too late for the ordinary man to learn to think in Hindustani or Burmese or Tamil . Of course there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually spoken is dreadful . I could tell tales about myself as well as others , for although I worked very hard for years , I never knew Burmese well , nor yet Canarese , nor yet Hindustani . Yet who will doubt that it is very important , the most important acquisition in fact that you can make . Without it you can never really get near the people . So that in this way the old-time civilian had again a great advantage . Once upon a time there was a district officer and there was his district , and for some reason they did not seem to agree . At least the district did not like its Head . It felt uneasy and it became restive , and at last it complained . It took up many grievances and amongst them was this : ' There is a good deal of building wanted in various parts , and there is timber and there are sawyers , but no licenses can be obtained . When the Head comes round on tour we ask him , but he always refuses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer went to inquire , and he began with this complaint . Why do you refuse them sawpit licenses when on tour ? ' he asked . I do n't , ' the Head replied . They say you do . ' But they never even applied ; so how could I refuse ? ' he answered . Very well , ' said the inspecting offs- ecr , ' let 's see the file of your petitions received . ' A clerk brought it out , and there , written in Bjrmese of course , were many sawpit applications , and below each , written by the Head , was his indorsement , ? ? ' I can not allow more guns to be Then the machine of government was far less perfected than it is now . There were of course laws and rules , and there was supervision , but to nothing like the present extent . The district officer then had a personality . lie was required to have one , for local conditions differed more than they do now , and he had far more latitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal upon his personal influence to keep the place quiet and get things done . He could not ask for orders because there was no telegraph , and he could not get help quickly because there were no railways . Therefore he was obliged to acquire a personal knowledge of people and peoples , of individuals and castes and races , which he thinks is not so necessary now . The result was that all laws and orders passed through his personality before reaching the people , thus acquiring a humanity and reasonableness that is now impossible . He studied his district , and used his powers , legal and otherwise , as he found best . If he found a law harsh , ? and in the last resort all laws are so , ? he would ameliorate its action . Nowadays he can not do that . Formerly he administered , as best he could , justice : now he administers the law , a very wide difference . Thus he was forced by circumstances to acquire a knowledge and sympathy which are unattainable to-day ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district officers were known personally by name and by reputation all through their districts . The people looked to them for help and understanding and protection as much against the rigidity and injustice of the laws as against other ills . But nowadays , except the government officials and headmen , I do not believe that any one in a district knows who the head is . At all events it makes practically no difference , because the application of the laws is supervised and enforced and the district officer must ' fall into line . ' If any personality has survived his schooling it must now be killed . Now , few men , I think , learn anything except from two motives : a natural driving desire , or necessity . But a natural desire to study the people round you is scarce , and the necessity of other days has passed away . A district officer can now do his work quite to the satisfaction of Government and know next to nothing of the people . In fact , sometimes knowledge leads to remonstrance with Government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept into secretariats a cult of energy and efficiency , and a definition of these words which acts disastrously upon the district officer , both when he is under training and subsequently . Now the proper meaning of an efficient officer is , I take it , one who sees the right thing to do and does it quickly and effectively ; and probably Government really has this in its mind when it uses the word . This is what it wants ; but very often what it gets is almost the opposite , and it is as pleased with this as if it got what it expected . In fact , it does not seem to know the difference . An example will explain what I mean . There is , we will say , in a district a good deal of cattle theft going on , and the thieves can not well be detected . Cattle graze in Burma in the fields and in the jungle on their outskirts ; they roam about a good deal , and it is easy enough to steal them ; detection is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India , a provision of the Village Regulation which is called the Track Law , and it is substantially as follows : If cattle are missing their tracks can be followed . When they pass out of the area under the jurisdiction of the village wherein the owner lives and enter another village land , that village becomes responsible . The tracker calls the headman of that village and shows him the tracks , which he must follow up and demonstrate that the cattle have not stopped in his jurisdiction , but have gone on . In this way the tracks can be followed till they are lost , when the village in whose land they are lost is considered as being the village of the thief , and is therefore responsible for the lost cattle . It can be fined , and the owner of the lost bullocks indemnified . This act is taken from a very old custom common to most of India and also , I believe , to places in Europe ; and several hundred years ago , when villages were widely separated by jungle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either that the stolen bullock had been taken to that village , or that some of the villagers had seen it pass . The thief would probably have stopped there for food or rest , as it was a long way on . But nowadays , in most of the country , village fields are conterminous , with little or no jungle between ; there are many roads , and except where the tracks actually go into the village gate the presumption does not arise . Cattle are common , and the villagers are not expert trackers . Moreover there is a very strong premium on dishonesty , or at least carelessness in keeping to the right tracks . Suppose the right track lost in a wet place , or a dry bare place why not pick up some other ? Most cattle tracks are very similar . The owner wants his compensation . Yet the ' energetic ' officer will be expected to work this act a pied de Is lettre . ? I saw a good deal of its actual working at one time , when I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be tracked , and the village where the tracks were lost had to pay . It made no difference whether there was any reasonable presumption against the village , ? there the law was . The tracks might be lost two miles from the actual village , simply crossing its boundary ; the law was there . I remember one village had a bad time because it was near a frequented road , and when the tracks got on this road they were always lost , as the surface was hard . So the village had to pay . Yet what evidence was there against the village ? None . I had the curiosity for some time , whenever a case wherein a village was fined was subsequently cleared up , to find out what village had been fined and see if that village had been in any way cognizant of the theft . It never had . The fine was purely gratuitous , was worse than useless , for it was wrong . Yet it is a government rule ? not I think actually laid down , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culprit is arrested , a village must be held responsible . Now the points that I wish all this to illustrate are these . Men at the headquarters of Government , out of touch with real life , read the Track Law , think it most useful and just , and insist on its being enforced . Officers on the spot , accustomed to accept all law as the epitome of justice , follow the act without thinking . The responsibility is really on them , as Govern- ment tells them to judge each case on its merits ; but they fear that if they reported that no case under the Track Lass ever had any merits they would be written down as ' wanting in energy . ' Moreover not having been trained to think for themselves they do not do so . They fulfill all the requirements of the act and are satisfied . Moreover , subsequently , to justify their own action they must praise the act . Therefore a vicious circle is created . Government says , ' District officers praise the act , therefore have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And district officers say , ' Government declares this to be an admirable act , therefore I must enforce it . ' No one ever investigates the facts . If a district officer have doubts he discreetly smothers them as babies , lest they grow . And this is but one instance . I might mention others , but even many instances would not expose its whole evil . It is the spirit that renders such things possible that is disastrous . So are officers trained to believe that when anything untoward happens they must do something ; they must punish somebody . The idea that if they act without full knowledge the something they do will be wrong , and the persons they punish will be innocent , is not allowed to intrude . They will of course always act by law , but then , suminum jus , summa injuria . In the old clays this could not have happened . In the first place , Government trusted its officers , and its trust was not misplaced ; now it trusts its laws ; vet there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except those who believe in them . In the second place , officers with the personality and knowledge of the men of former days would have insisted on seeing for t hemsell es and judging for themselves . They would have cared nothing that VOL. - . CO. 3 they might be supposed not to have energy . ' They would know that they had something better than that ? they had understanding . The possibility of making our laws and our government generally endurable to the people depends on the personality of the district officer . Nowadays he is sent out with his personality crushed , and it gets still more crushed out there . He becomes in time , not a living soul , but a motor engine to drive a machine . Whatever knowledge he acquires is of the people 's faults and not of their virtues . When you hear an official praised as knowing the Indian ' or ' the Burman , ' you know that it means that he knows his faults . He knows the criminal trying to escape , the villages trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than this . Some do , especially among the police and the forest officers , but then , they have no influence . III COURT REFORMS The regeneration of India must bring forth great changes in the penal law . The pressing need in criminal procedure is , I think , a change in the treatment of an accused person when he is arrested . The first instinct of an offender is as I have said to confess , even if an understanding person is not available to confess to . He has offended the Law , he wants to make all amends he can by confessing to the representative of that offended Personality . I have seen very many first offenders and talked to them before they got into the hands of pleaders and others , and my experience tells me that a man who has committed his first offence is very like a man who has caught his first attack of serious illness . He is afraid not so much of the results as of the thing itself . Sin has caught him and he is afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does not want to hide anything ; his first need is confession to some understanding ear . Many , many such confessions have I heard in the old days . That is the result of the first offense . But this tendency to truth is choked when it is ascertained that as a result the offender will be vindictively punished and made in the end far worse than he was at the beginning . Naturally the offender says to himself : I am bad now . What will I be after two years ' jail ? Better fight it out . If I win and get acquitted , at least I will have a chance to reform . If convicted , that chance will be taken from me forever . And fighting will not lose me anything . The penitent prisoner who confesses gets no lighter punishment than if he had put the court to the expense of a long trial . Why , therefore , repent ? It will do me harm , not good . ' That is the case now ; under reasonable laws it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he often confesses to the police by whom he is arrested . Now , by Indian law no confession to the police may be offered in evidence . The reason of this is that the police in their keenness to secure a conviction may torture a prisoner to secure a confession , and there have been in fact enough of such cases to cause doubt and to prevent the police being allowed to receive a confession . Therefore , if the offender wishes to confess , he is taken now to a magistrate ; there his confession is recorded . Then he is sent back to police custody . He is visited by his relatives , a pleader is engaged for him . His folly in confessing is pointed out to him and he withdraws the confession , alleging that he had been tortured to confess . His confes sion is not only negatived , but a slur is cast on the police which is hard to remove . Their case and evidence appear tainted , and the accused often secures an acquittal although the snag . istrate knows that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Burma and India , and it is disastrous to allow and to encourage such things as by our procedure we do encourage them . There should be a complete change . When a man is arrested , some such procedure should be adopted as this . He should be told by the police that he is being taken direct to the magistrate who will try the case , who will hear anything that he has to say . He should be warned to say nothing to the police . Then he should be taken direct to the magistrate , who should explain to him fully what he is accused of and ask him what he has to say . Whatever his statement be , the magistrate should tell him that he wit ! himself at once investigate it and sum ? mon witnesses ; meanwhile the accused should be remitted to custody , but not to police custody . That is where all the trouble comes in , and all opportunities for making charges against the police . If there be no jail there should be a lock-up in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not concerned in the guilt or innocence of the accused . The investigating police should have access to the accused only by permission of the magistrate . He should , however , be allowed to see his friends and a pleader if he wish . But I am sure of this , that the first offender would rather trust the magistrate if he were a person who he knew would help him , than any pleader . Further , if a man confess truly , his punishment should be greatly reduced . I do not say that this should be done be- cause he gives less trouble , but because the frame of mind induced by a free and full confession is a sounder frame of mind on which to begin reformation than arc the defiance and negation now inculcated by our system . The trial need not wait till the case is complete . The magistrate could summon the police witnesses at once , and he should examine them himself , allowing the police only to suggest questions if they wish . So with the witnesses for the defense : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be examined by the magistrate himself . No one but the magistrate should be allowed to speak directly to any party to the case . All cross-examination should be absolutely prohibited . If either side have matters they wish brought out of a witness , they should tell the magistrate and he would ask such questions as he thought fit . There is no such curse now to justice as cross-examination by a clever pleader or barrister . It is a sort of forensic show-off by the advocate at the cost of the witness , and frequently at the cost of justice . For naturally no one cares to be bullied by a licensed bully , and witnesses consequently will not come to court if they can help it . When in court they are bamboozled and made to contradict themselves where they have originally spoken the truth . I have often been told that acute cross-examination by a clever barrister is the greatest safeguard justice can have from false evidence . I do not be-New a word of it . A magistrate can , by far fewer and simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the magistrate is intent only on his business , ? to find the truth ; the advocate is advertising himself , and trying to destroy truth as well as falsehood . But if the magistrate did all the questioning I believe there would not be much false evidence . Witnesses will lie to the opposite side , but not to an understanding court . Perjury would disappear . What is its present cause ? Contempt for the court and sympathy with either complainant or accused , which sympathy sees no chance of justice for its object except by perjury . Because a trial is a fight . There is not a human being east or west who would not be ashamed to lie to a court that he knew was trying to do its best for all , parties and public . It is because the courts as at present constituted do as much harm as good that perjury is rampant and condoned . It is so in all countries ; it has been so in all periods . Then , as soon as possible , juries should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially as regards punishment , is greatly altered in accordance with the common sense of the people , but it is an objective to be aimed at as soon as possible . Until the public cooperate with the courts in all ways you will never have a good system of justice . Crime hurts the people far more than it hurts Government . Do n't you think the people know that ? And do n't you suppose they want it prevented even more than Government does ? In any case that is the fact . They hate the courts now because they do n't prevent or cure crime ; they only make matters worse . The only objection I see to this proposed alteration is that it will take more time and so cost more money . At first it may do so , but even then , what the public loses by more taxes it will more than save in having to pay less to lawyers . How much unnecessary money is now paid to lawyers ? Enough I am sure to double the magistracy and then leave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , not for lawyers . And in time crime would so decrease that there would be saving all round . The reform of the civil courts should follow somewhat the same lines . A man should not have to wait to see a civil judge till his case is all made out . He should be able to go to him at once and confide in him , and the judge should send for the other party and try to make an arrangement between them , so that no suit should be filed . Not until that has been done , and not unless a judge give a certificate of its necessity , should a suit be allowed to be filed as it is now . And then , when it is filed , the judge should conduct the case and not the advocates on each side . That is the only way to stop the perjury , which increases and will continue to increase . Magistrates and judges must cease to be umpires of a combat , and become investigators of truth . As regards the laws of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a real representative assembly to make these changes , but even there something could be done . That fossilization of custom described by Sir Henry Sumner Maine should stop . Because a high court proved a hundred years ago that a certain custom existed , there is no evidence that it does or should exist now . To establish precedents of this nature is to stop all progress of every kind ; we have a vision different from the poet 's Why should not fresh inquiries into custom be made from time to time , it being understood that any court ruling should apply only to that time and place and should not bind the future ? Something must be done . Things can not go on as they are . We reproach the Indians for want of progress , but we ourselves arc the main cause of that stagnation . We bind them , and then can not move . As regards land policy , there is this to be said , ? that fixed ideas are a mistake . In Bengal there was at one time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large landowners , and so , partly out of sheer ignorance , panlv out of prejudice , a race of zemindars. was created out of the tax-gatherers to the Mogul Empire . The result has ' been sad . Again in Burma the same idea prevailed for a while , and headmen were encouraged to annex communal waste as their private land . This was unto ! , nate . Then came a reaction , and all large estates were denounced as bad . There was to be a small tenantry holding direct from Government , forbidden to alienate their land , and all leasing of land to tenants was forbidden . This I understand to be the police still . It is a policy of fixed ideas , and as applied to anything that has life , like land tenure , it is unfortunate , no matter what the fixed idea be . If there be one truth above another that is clear in studying land systems , it is that no one permanent system is good . The cultivation of land , like all matters , is subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good to-morrow . The English system of large estates cultivated by tenants did at one time in English history produce the best farming in the world . English farming was held up as an example to all countries , and was so regarded by them . The system of large estates allowed of the expenditure of capital , experiments in new cultivation and new breeds of cattle and variety of crops . It suited its day well . And though its full day has passed there will never be a time when some large estates will not be able to justify them- selves . Even if , as apparently is the caw now in England , ' petit culture ' is that best adapted to the cultivation of the day and the needs of the people , yet there is still room for large estates . .1 dead uniformity of small holdings could not but be very bad for any country . Further , although excessive alienation of land through money-lenders may be very bad , yet stagnation in ownership is bad also . India and Burma are progressive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traders ; city people will like to ret urn to the land . There is an ebb and flow which is good for all . Too great rigidity of system will stop progress . .1 good system of land tenure is that which is in accordance with the e olution of the people it applies to , and assists in that evolution . While recognizing that for the bulk of the people small holdings are best , it will not forbid larger estates ; while admitting that the alienation of land through borrowing recklessly from money-lenders is bad , it will see that the progress of the people from a purely agricultural state toward a state of industrial actiNity is not checked . It takes all sorts to make a state . It may be good for the cultivator to hold direct from Government , but if Government is to be the landlord it must act up to its name . It must give compensation for improvements when a tenant has to relinquish the land . Otherwise no tenant will improve , and the necessity for improvement ? for wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the greatest necessity of agriculture . In my own experience I have seen that the system of state land tenure in Upper Burma does stop improvements . That is the light in which the land question has to be worked out , on broad comprehensive lines which , while acknowledging the present , see also the future ; which , while seeing one form of good , do not deny another . So with an understanding and a sympathetic personnel the administration would be brought nearer to the people , until at length , when their capacity for self-government had developed , they would be able to take over our administrative machine little by little and work it themselves . They could never do that now . If by any chance they did get possession of the machinery now , they would set to work to smash it till none remained .
