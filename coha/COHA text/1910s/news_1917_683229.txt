txt What Are They Trying to Prove ? . It would be interesting to know just what the suffragists are trying to prove by the statements made in Helen C. Mansfield 's letter published May 2S . The eleven States having the highest percentage of enlistments may be suffrage States  --  no one intends to deny this ? but what- possible connection can there be between a woman 's voting and a man 's enlisting in the army ? Are we supposed to infer that in the suffrage States the men are being persuaded to enlist by the more.pa.triotic women ? Perhaps this is true in some cases In all the States , but such an argument would be absolutely contradictory to the theories of the suffrage agitators . For , If women have so strong an Influence over men , why can they not exercise it in questions of politics , instead of demanding the vote for themselves ? ' As usual , the suffragists have forgotten to be consistent . And is . a woman who votes more patriotic than one who does not ? Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to vote , and yet nearly every woman in the country is striving to do whatever lies in , her power to ' be . of - patriotic service . ' Who has ever , as Miss Mansfield states , " made light of the patriotism of . women " ? She ' - seems to : imply ' that this has been done by persons opposed to woman suffrage , but surely most of us would scorn an argument so , unfair . knowing as we do that , since the beginning of this nation 's history , the women have stood by her loyally in every crisis . There are , no doubt , a few weak women who , like Jeannette Rankin , " want to stand by their country " ? conditionally  --  but Mies Rankin is no more a fair representative of America 's women than Senator La Follette and Champ ' Clark are fair representatives of America 's men ,
