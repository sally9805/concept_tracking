COMMUNICATION " The One Idea " S IR : It was an excellent custom of the older statesmen ? Burke , for example ? to stand aside from time to time and examine the state of the nation . Whither , they asked , are we drifting ? What is the prevalent thought or tendency of our times ? Are events shaping themselves to the true advantage of our nation or are they not ? Never was there a moment in our own history when it seemed so important to stand aside from the daily event , to be calm , to examine dispassionately the state of the nation , and to inquire what effect the monstrous cataclysm of Europe may have upon the thought of our country . The period since the close of the Spanish-American war sixteen years ago has been one of the great epochs , in some ways the greatest epoch , in the history of the United States . It is a fact patent to all men that great changes have been going on in the fundamental thought of the American people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " History of Civilization , " " there is some one idea at work which is more powerful than any other , and which shapesthe events of the time and determines their ultimate issue . " We may inquire what this one idea is that has been at work in America during the last sixteen years , shaping the events of the time and determining their ultimate issue . At the close of the Spanish War it was said with some grandiloquence that we had at length attained our majority , had taken our place as a world-power . It was said that the logic of events had now driven us to assume the " white man 's burden " of foreign colonization . Expansion was the thought of the hour . We were momentarily thrilled with the knowledge that the sun never set upon the stars and stripes . But it was soon evident that the " great idea " at work was not the idea of colonial expansion . Neither commercial nor military arguments convinced us . No sooner had we established a stable government in Cuba than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territorial aggression and influence in China ; instead of governing the Philippine Islands and Porto Rico as mere dependencies , we have flouted the advice of the imperialists and have expanded the powers of self-government . And Mr. Wilson , in his Mexican policy , has dimmed the vision of the expansionists of territorial aggression to the southward . It is a remarkable thing in history that a victorious nation , filled with a new sense of greatness and power , should at once turn upon itself and its institutions the remorseless eye of self-examination . The period of exposure and " muck-raking " followed close upon the war . We began to ask ourselves what sort of a nation we really had , what political parties stood for , whether justice was being done in America . Eight or ten years ago I heard J. A. Hobson , the distinguished British economist , who was then visiting this country , say that the most remarkable feature of our life appeared to him to be the willingness , yes , the eagerness , of Americans to know the worst about themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service corporations , the tyranny of riches ? all these things were spread boldly before the people . At first the work was done by private investigators and writers in magazines , but it was soon taken over by well-financed popular committees , by state legislatures , and finally by the Federal Congress and Federal commissioners . It is probable that no other nation ever before submitted itself to such a searching self-examination . This interest and curiosity has shown itself everywhere in our life . We want to know how the other man lives . Consider the flood of books and articles which have appeared during the last ten years describing the life of the poor , the prisoner , the prostitute , the idle rich , the energetic rich , the tramp , the criminal , the foreign immigrant , the negro . Peary 's explorations to the Pole were not more eagerly followed than the early adventures of Jacob Riis and Jane Addams among the tenements . In fiction the leading characters have often been burglars , detectives , tramps , street women , boss politicians , negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investigated , surveyed . This era of self-examination has been curiously unemotional . It was not dictated by hunger or want ; nor has it ever approached physical revolution . The country all along has been relatively so prosperous that to many a conservative it has been a mystery why there should be all this conscience-questioning restlessness . It is noteworthy that in States where conditions were best , most prosperous , where there were the fewest evidences of injustice or inequality , as in Wisconsin , Minnesota , Kansas , California , the movement has been most virile , and that in States where social conditions were darkest , as in Pennsylvania , the desire for self-examination has seemed to be weakest . No , this was the cool self-examination of a full-grown nation . Probably we should soon have begun to look inward even if there had been no Spanish War , for the vast physical and mechanical changes in our life during the past fifty years would have made it necessary for us soon or late to pause and take account of ourselves . But undoubtedly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be profoundly interested in one another , in our institutions , in our politics . We had learned how to struggle and win separately , now we wanted to know how to struggle and win collectively , as a people . When we come to know our neighbors better , it is inevitable that we should desire to live with them and work with them on more friendly terms . The passion of self-examination , then , has naturally resulted in a great body of new laws and institutions , the purpose of which is to make America a more comfortable home for all of us . We are beginning to hold down tyrants of property , beginning to secure a juster distribution of wealth and power . These reconstructive movements , affecting rich and poor alike , were not prompted merely by want and envy and bitterness . There have been revolts , indeed , among the hungry submerged , like that of the I.W.W. come from that element . The revolution , as distinguished from sporadic revolts , has been led by men and women , mostly cultivated men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of injustice in a free country ; who have asked themselves , passionately , " Who hath given to me this sweet , And given my brother a crust to eat , And when will his wage come in ? " In short , during the last few years in America we have been developing with all our energy the highest art of all arts ? the art of living together . I believe this to be " the one idea more powerful than any other " that is shaping the events of the time . Foreign travelers who come to our shores often compare our civilization unfavorably with that of Europe . They charge us with producing no vital art , no literature , no drama , no music . It may be so ; it may not be so ; we can tell better fifty years hence . But should not a nation , like an individual , be judged according to its excellence in the art which it is seeking most sedulously to cultivate ? We are primarily engaged in the business of discovering better ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point at which art or science or education or religion touches this " one idea , " there it is virile and original , there it is making history . Those artists , for example , who are doing the most original work in America are those who are seeking ways of helping men to live together more beautifully . I think we do not appreciate yet the significant work of a group of artists , architects and engineers who have begun to mold the unformed and individualistic cities of America ? the " city-planners . " Burnham of Chicago was an artist of vision and original power , and Arnold Brunner of New York is a worthy successor . These men are trying to grasp the modern city as a whole , and clothe its growth with beauty . Another example may be found in the drama . We may not be cultivating Barries or Shaws , but wherever the drama is really in touch with the " one idea " of the epoch , there it is spontaneous , vital , lives from within . This is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A community creates a pageant or a masque out of the materials of its own life and history , its own citizens do the acting , its own people support the work . Why blame us for not producing a certain kind of drama when we are actually developing a dramatic art of unknown potentiality that is sincerely trying to express the spirit of the times ? For the same reason religion is vital at those points at which it is helping us in our demand for the full expression of the social instinct . ' Wherever the church is preaching the doctrine that by believing certain dogmas a man individually may escape the common struggle and be " saved , " there it is failing ; but wherever it is inspiring men to practice the art of living nobly together , there it is having a new birth . Similarly it is the political party that defends private interests against public interests that is passing away ; while the party with a social vision and a social program which aims to help us along with the " one idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . In education likewise it is not the old college which seeks to raise individuals to a lonely isolation of culture that is growing fastest , but rather the State university , with its virile extension departments , the aim of which is to let no ignorant man escape . Where have American scientists recently been making their greatest advances ? Probably the most notable contributions have been in medicine , that science which lies closest to the " one great idea . " Recall the work of the great sanitarians in cleaning up tropical cities ; think of Gorgas at Panama ; consider the campaign against tuberculosis , hook-worm , typhoid fever , cancer . Such scientific campaigns to make the nation a healthier and therefore a better place to live in were never before known . Such has been the prevailing tendency in this nation , such is " the one idea more powerful than any other " which has been shaping the events of the time . Now comes the explosion in Europe , an unpredictable event which has shaken all the world . What effect will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunities presented by a prostrate Europe where half the people have stopped producing , stopped shipping , stopped trading , have whetted the ardor of that type of mind in America which seeks individual advantage . Here are unique possibilities of fortune and power ; let us seize the trade of Europe while it is prostrate , let us set up new manufacturing establishments to do the work which they have done , let us invade South America and the Orient . Now the danger of all this is that it will damp the enthusiasm with which we have been studying the precious art of living together . Where there is a chance for a man to get rich quickly , for example , he easily forgets his neighbors . He begins to wish to live above them , not with them . And what is true of individuals in this particular is true also of nations . It is in a moment like this that we should stand aside calmly and consider the state of the nation , examine the precious thing we have , and reflect upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
