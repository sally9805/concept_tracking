February 12 . On the train , which at last is bearing its away to the war . My companions are asleep , wearied by a day and night of this endless journey . But I can not sleep for joy . One thought possesses me . I am on my way to fight ! I lad I so wished I could have remained with the general staff as interpreter , but what I crave is action ? the intense , mad action of battle . The enthusiasm of the first ( lays of the war has not . left me , but grew ever greater during the long months I had to spend in training camps , where I learned first to be a soldier , then an officer . But as soon as I received my appointment to the rank of aspirant , I asked for and obtained permission to start for the front . Am I cherishing illusions ? Is it real , this glory of war that makes my head swim ? The sadness of saying good-bye to my mother I have left far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made our triumphal departure from that little snow-covered town , through which we marched with the band at our head and the Marseillaise on our lips and in our hearts , amid the cheers of the people . Just now the train is going through a beautiful bit of country . Never has the valley of the Sinitic that I know so well seemed so fair to look upon . Truly , la doulce France ' is a mistress we may proudly live and die for . Die ? No . I have a conviction that I shall not be killed in the war ; I feel sure I shall be able to do my duty to the end , and once my task is finished , return to my mother and my own life . February 13 . We have just got ( nit of the train . I am writ ing in the kindly warmth of a room sonic peasants have put at my disposal . This morning , in the fog and chill of an early February dawn , our train stopped in the middle of a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for a few clumps of trees . The bugler gave us the signal to detrain by playing the regimental march . Instantly the men streamed out , still heavy with sleep , and benumbed by these two days of traveling . I hurried to the cars of my section , lined up my men , and stacked arms while waiting for orders . Fatigues were detailed at once to get rations and unload the cars . But where were we ? No one but the commander knew our itinerary in advance , for of course it has to be kept secret . We had a vague idea 1 a were bound for Champagne . The station bore a name I did not know : Cuperly. looked on my map and found that this village was right in the field of ChMons , several kilometres to the south of t he villages of Perthes and I I urlus , which have so often been mentioned in the dispatches of late . So we are to be launched in the midst of an offensive ! What joy ! I hastily scribbled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who promised to mail it . As we stood waiting in the cold , our attention was drawn to the auto-busses of a provision convoy going along tin road , phantom-like , through the fog . And we not iced also a dull rumble like a prolonged roll of thunder . It was cannon . ' Sling equipment ! Take arms ! Fours right ! Forward ! March ! ' And the battalion swung into a road that was broken up and covered with mud ? a gray , filthy , liquid mud that seemed to flood the whole countryside . An artillery convoy came by and spat-t creel us badly . It was cold . ' Iwo kilometres farther on we halted at the edge of a village where we were to breakfast . I promptly attended to the kitchens of my section ; two Men from each squad went to get wood , and before long four fires burned merrily . Pans were brought forth from their places above the knapsacks , and soon the portions of coffee and sugar provided us with a juice ' c that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I gacc orders to warm some canned beef in wine for the MOO , and they had a real feast . While our soldiers were resting after their meal , we section mil-islanders , together with the other officers , accepted the hospitality of some artillery officers , who made us welcome with several bottles of champagne . The festivity was at its height when the bugle sounded . It was l inc to start out once again . For what destination ? We did not know . We marched two hours along the slippery road before coming to La ( Aleppo , where we were to await the return of the brigade that was in the trenches . We took possession of our quarters . My section was comfortably billeted in a large barn well supplied with straw , and I chose to make my abode among my pa jilts . I should like to be in closer contact with them ; I am determined to make friends with them . When the regiment left the training camp I was able to procure a few little extras that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner . The artful member of the third squad had succeeded in getting into the good graces of an old peasant woman , who gave him two chickens . The men insisted on my doing the honors , and I accepted with grea pleasure . We chatted together familiarly , and I told them how glad I was to be at the front , and enlarged esi , echilly on the great things I expected of them . ' With you , man aspirant , NNE will go anywhere , ' said a corporal ; and they all applauded . Of course , I was immensely pleased . February 14 . The booming of the cannon all night kept me from sleeping . However , I was snug and warns in my bed of straw beside my dear friend Henry . We are glad to be together at the war after being chums in college . I am on duty this morning with my section . We are posted for police duty at a crossroads , and we are instructed , in addition to keeping order hs the village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What an infernal whirl ! Not a minute passes without something going by  --  a great ammunition train , heavy cannon drawn by motor-tractors , a regiment of infantry returning from the trenches , muddy but triumphant . The poi/us are radiant . We surround them . They give details . Good news ! ' Plot fight , all right , but the Bodies are catching it like fun . ' And then there go our old Paris auto-busses , transformed into meat wagons . Some of them still flaunt their signs , ' Madeleine-Bastille , " Neuilly-Bourse , " Clichy-Odeon ! One is marked Complet , ' and the places , if you please , are filled by huge cattle . 0 auto-busses of Paris , you forget your luxurious existence of Parisian bourgeois , and jolt bravely on through the mud of Champagne , accepting these hardships to save your country . We take olf our hats to you in your coat of THE LIEUTENANT 'S STORY 10 I mud , for you also are doing your duty . Weather still lowering . I tools out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my leisure moments feasting on the exploits of Pierochole . I have brought along a few books that are easy to handle , mostly our great classics that I have been neglecting these latter years . I wish to keep up my intellectual life . This morning found us in t he trenches ? at . last ! The region opposite its was fairly unint cresting ? barbed wire , torn-up earth , skeleton I rtes , and dead men 's bodies . And the enemy was there , within 1.50 metres . I discovered this rather promptly , and , moreover , had a narrow escape . At a certain moment , very early in the morning , I went . into the communication trench that formed the eastern end of my trench . There was a large hollowed-out place through which one could get a better view of what lay in front , of us : at the left , the ruined village , in front , the labyrinth of trenches , and the skeleton wood . Suddenly , as if warned by some instinct , I turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , whistled through my window , one of them gracing my field-glass . Not a little shaken up , I left that dangerous spot .. I soon began to laugh , and I should have enjoyed telling my neighbors , the Boches , that they had missed me . But I was more prudent . after that . Besides , everything was silent except for an occasional shell that passed high above our heads and burst so far away that we could not hear it , explode . Listening-patrols , being useless during the day , were replaced by two sentries for each half-section , who watched through the loop-holes of the trench itself . The men in their warm dug-outs smoked their pipes , ate , read , or played cards . If this is war , thought many of them , it is n't half bad . But like most , good things , it did not last . At nine o'clock a messenger came to tell me t hat t he captain wanted to see me . I went to his headquarters , situated in t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A French attack was to be delivered on t he Bodye trenches north and oast of Pert he s , and We were to sustain it . The object to be gained was as follows : the firing line was far from being straight ; as a result of the vicissitudes of the recent fighting . the German trenches made a salient into t he French trenches ; it was desirable to destroy this salient .. Here is a sketch of our posit ion : We were at . A. To at tack at this point would have been costly , for the distance between the two opposing lines was more than ISO metres . The plan was , therefore , to attack at . and 13 , so that , once having taken the German trenches C1 and 13 ' , t he whole system could be en filaded . Our rule was to put them on the wrong scent , and , at . a specified time , to make as 11111 ( .11 noise as possible with our guns and machine-guns , in order to attract , attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being launched elsewhere . So I went hack to my trench and gave the men the necessary instructions . About ten o'clock we were startled by four loud reports coming almost . simultaneously . It was a ball cry of 75 's , stationed two hundred metres or so behind us . At the same instant , t he shells went whistling over our heads and raised four black clouds in the trench opposite . It was the beginning of the bombardment .. It was very violent . At the start we all clucked , but we gradually got , used to it and learned to distinguish the difference in sound of the French firing . Some of the shells went by at mad speed and burst almost at once . Others took their time , especially our Inflates , nicknamed the ox-cart , ' which seems to take an airing before going to tell its tale to the Germans ? and its tale is generally a terrible one . Posted at . a loop-hole , I watched through my glass the effect . of the bomIntrdment . All the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with constantly recurring explosions . They looked like an uninterrupted line of volcanoes . The noise and the superb masses of earth thrown up into the air fairly intoxicated me . The Boches in their turn began to answer , and , scorning its poor infantrymen , sent their shells far in our rear , in quest of the gunners and their pieces . The chorus grew deafening . The sensation was that of being under a roof of steel ? invisible , but with the voices of all the fiends . And in the midst of all this din , two larks kept . flitting about joyously , and mingled their song of life with the dull chant of the engines of death . New orders came , and I called together in my dug-out my two sergeants and four corporals . We were ordered to fire during exactly four minutes , from one minute past twelve to five minutes past twelve . A supply of cartridges was placed beside each loophole , so that every soldier could fire the greatest number of shots in the given time . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was no longer possible to distinguish the shots from each other . It . was one uninterrupted boom ? the efficiency fire that the Germans calltrommelf arm , or drum-fire . For half an hour the uproar was enough to drive one mad ; my head felt as if it were bound with iron and about to burn ; and yet , in the midst of it all , it was a great satisfaction to think that th , Bodies were having to endure , in addition to the noise , the very deadly effect ' . of our artillery . We were unquestionably better off than they . At ten minutes to twelve every one was at his post , and I also took my place with the second half-section . I had carefully set my watch according to the time that . is telephoned every day at noon and midnight to the various officers ' headquarers . At one minute past twelve the artillery lengthened its range . This was the moment , and I whistled . Immediately the guns began their clatter and the machine-guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cease firing . ' I had no sooner whistled than half a dozen Boche 77 's fell very near our trench . As there was nothing more to be done , every one except the sentries went into the dug-outs . We were hotly bombarded , for the first six shells were followed by others and still others . We had not been looking for this , and the surprise was a trifle disagreeable . We had of a certainty fulfilled our mission well , for we had drawn both their attention and their fire . For two hours we were deluged with shells , and each one that came seemed to be coming straight at us , and in spite of ourselves we shrank together and ducked , measuring anxiously with our eyes the depth of the dug-out . Mine was fairly safe . I stayed in it some time with my sergeants , and we were none of us very happy . To tell the truth , the situation is a stupid one . The role one plays is purely passive , and it is not pleasant for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him a mass of brutish matter capable of an- THE LIEUTENANT 'S STORY 1 03 Militating him . Several shells fell near MY dug-out . One even landed in the lit tle winding trench that led to it , but t he splinters were stopped by its turns . Otherwise , I should have received a visit , from them . But I could not desert my men entirely , so I went around to the various dug-outs . Sitting huddled together , my soldiers were not any more used to t his kind of entertainment than I was , and would doubtless have preferred to be somewhere else ; but no one was hurt and they were glad to see me . On coining in contact with them I resumed my role of chief , and , true to the theory of William James , by pretending not to he afraid , I very soon discovered that . I With not afraid . I chatted with them and cracked jokes , and , all of a sudden , everybody felt better . Then I went back to my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still raining down , but . as none of them had done any harm up to that , time , we bothered no more about them . They fell more especially in front of the trench , in the wire entanglement . That set me to thinking , and together with the machine-gun lieutenant . I examined the situation . The Roches had battered clown the parapet in several places , and the barbed wire was pretty badly damaged . Were they going to amuse themselves by attacking us ? I doubled the sentries and gave orders that as soon its the bombardment slackened , every man should run to his loop-hole . I wondered what was up , as I did not know the result of the flank attack . I had no sooner sent word to the captain and the section commanders on either side , than I saw , through my glass , points of bayonets here and there gleaming in the sun above the edge of the enemy 's trench Opposite . ' Every man at the loopholes ! ' I shouted ; and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . Several of the men were covered with dirt . by explosions ; one even was knocked down by Ihe. impact of a bursting shell ; but no one Was hit . Suddenly from the German trenches , like devils front their boxes , emerged the infantrymen , yelling and running toward us , waving their arms . They were in close formation , three deep , I think , so that nothing could be easier than to mow them down . I quickly seized a gun and fired with the rest . The machine-guns started in immediately , and-hardly more than a minute later our assailants took flight , leaving many of their men on the ground . At . fifty metres from us , forty or more Boches were lying flat on their faces as if waiting for the order to stand up . The machine-gun had done its work well . So the assault was beaten back , but every one remained at his post .. Wounded men dragged themselves painfully to their lines ; others were groaning . No one thought for an instant of firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came a wave of emotion ; I was frightened , but . the joy of having escaped from a real danger made me very happy . ' Now you 're red poilus , ' I cried to my men . Everybody lighted a good pipe and a bluish smoke mount ed up to the God of Battles , like the incense of gratitude . The rest of the afternoon was uneventful . A few disgruntled shells came our way , but we had as an offset the thrilling sight of a splendid aeroplane reconnaissance . Six French ' planes , in a half-circle , flew over t he German trenches . From time to time one of them dropped a spurt of flame into the deepening twilight , a signal for the artillery . Shells flew around our war-birds like a multitude of snowflakes that remained floating a long time in the calm air . But without paying the least attention , the aviators continued their proud flight , and it seemed to us poor buried infantrymen that they were bearing aloft all our pride as Frenchmen , all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time a little moved . Then , slowly , night fell . The order came to detail two men from each squad to go with tent-sheets , under orders of the corporal on duty , to fetch rations from the kitchen . The trench was then organized for the night . Listening patrols were posted in front of the trenches ; it was decided that one squad front each half-section should watch at the loop-holes in case of a return offensive of the enemy . About , ten or eleven o'clock it . was time to think of mending the barbed wire . The fatigue brought a great quantity of the Brun networks , which fold and unfold like an accordion . They are very complicated and are fastened into the ground with a sort of fork . I Wanted to direct the work myself , so , accompanied by six men , I crawled wenty or thirty metres from the trench ; the work went on without a word being uttered . The six rows of wire were placed one behind the other , and in front were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of No-Man 's Land , ' near the German corpses . We could hear the groans of ' the wounded , and some little moving about , which indicated that the Germans were coming to pick up their men . But we made no attempt to molest them , whereas soldiers who are old in the knowledge of this war tell me that German snipers are always trying to put a stop to the work of the stretcher-bearers . This afternoon , everything being quiet , I invited the neighboring section commander to conic and spend a little time with me . In the trenches we rarely have anything to drink but wine and coffee , and , by way of a special feast , I decided to make some chocolate . So I sent for a canteen of water , and poured some of the precious fluid into Inv pan and devoutly emptied in the chocolate and sugar . It was simmering gently on my brazier , and I was just on the point of addling condensed milk , when some one called time from the out .. side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . I invited hint to join us , but at that precise moment t he stupid battery of a 77 began to spit its six shells at us . Two burst so near that my faithful tam pon stumbled in fright and fell headlong , taking with him brazier , saucepan , and chocolate  - -  our chocolate so nearly ready , which our eyes were drinking so hungrily , The poor chap was most unhappy . I laughed ; but I must confess my laugh was a bit . sickly . At , that . moment I detested t he Germans worse than ever . An exciting thing happened last night . It had been snowing , and about one in tile morn Mg , when I was chatting with the machine-gunner , the sentry outside began to fire . At the same moment a voice rang out in the night , Kamerad , Kamerad ! ' I quickly sent up a trench-rocket , and the light showed me a German soldier crawling toward us with a great clatter of tinware . I cried to the sentry to let him alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on . He appeared on the parapet and jumped into the trench . I had him taken to my headquarte ? s and there , revolver in hand , ordered him to disarm . He had no weapons but his bayonet and a belt full of cartridges , but he was loaded clown with canteens . I questioned him in German . lie was a great big Bavarian who had got his fill of the war . Today 's bombardment , absolutely terrible , he said , had determined him to flee . He managed to be detailed for water-fatigue , then made his way to our lines . He had had nothing to eat , for our bombardment had made it impossible to bring up food . I gave him some bread and chocolate while waiting for supper to arrive . I kept him until morning in order to ask him certain questions , especially as to the effect of our artillery on the trenches opposite . Ile told me that the attack of the day before had cost them many men , and furl hermore , pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain little revolver cannon that greatly annoyed us. 1 communicated this information to the artillery , and since then the revolver ra1111011 is silent . I kept the man 's cartridge-belt , and the canteens , rather good ones , which I distributed among my men . In the morning our Roche was sent to the commander . A happy man was he to have said good-bye to war . March 4 . This morning , reveille at eight ; review of arms and clotlUng ? a formality quickly gone through , for the men understand that their gun is their best friend and they take great care of it And in spite of certain accounts in the papers , I he soldier is not , fond of being dirty . Ile does not revel in his mud and filth , but suffers from Some of this misapprehension is probably due to the false derivation credited to the word poitu . It is not derived from the fact , that the soldier is hirsute and unshaven . It is an old word . Under the First Empire they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops . They called brave a troiv ? mils any one Who was worthy to he a gremulier. ' ho-day the word poi/u simply means a good soldier . At last , this afternoon the baggage-master announced that our communications With the rear were open . He brought us a quantity of letters ; I had for my share thirty-two . ' Joy , joy , tears of joy , ' as Pascal said under slightly different circumstanees . ; March IA . ' We returned yesterday to cantonment .. During the last live days , themost terrible I have yet . spent , I have not had a minute of physical or mental quiet to write a single line of my diary . I have run the gamut , I think , of nearly all the emotions afforded by war : bombardment , attack , counter-at tack , ill t he while in a most precarious position , long painful marches through the communical ion trenches , and , above and over all , the mud , t hat terrible enemy , much more terrible than the Roches . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there ever and always , implacable and relentless ? the mud that , keeps you from walking , chills you , clutches you , weighs you down , and drives you to despair . Five days of dragging one 's self ; doing up to the waist . in the horrible , cold , gluey paste . It . began as soon as we left Cabane-traits . Rut first it , was bearable . ' We slipped or got stuck or splashed or splattered , 1011. that was it mere nothing . The terrible part came when we went into the communication trenches . It was fortunate that our knapsacks were at , ! lilt 181 and not on our backs . The chalk of Champagne , when combined with water , rapidly forms it soft , paste in which one plunges up to the waist . And it was necessary to march in this ; in other words , to put one foot before the other , to pull it out with enormous effort. , only to replunge it in the mire , and so on for five kilometres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious 010 ' , butat t he end of t he first . hour the motions became automatic ; all one 's sensations resolved themselves into one dull pain in the whole body . Several times I got . my leg stuck , and had to appeal to the man behind me to help get it out . One of the lieutenants left his shoe in the mud ; he was literally caught like a lark on a lime-twig , and when , by dint of desperate efforts , he brought forth his shoeless foot , a great laugh went round . But a lit tie farther on we were sobered by a terrible discovery . We found the body of a soldier who had perished in the mud ; he had evidently fallen while alone , and was not able to extricate himself from the horrible embrace of the mire . This was the first corpse I had seen and I was much affected . And then the tiniest of obstacles interrupted the march and upset the distances ? a telephone wire getting loose from a crumbling wall , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite direction : those ahead would have to stop and the ones behind struggle to march at the double to catch up with them . A regular march was impossible . At the end of three hours we reached the village of Perthes , or rather , the ruins of Perthes , melancholy wraith of a village ? a few dismantled walls , tarns that looked as if they lay in the path of an avalanche , and a church by sonic in i rade still standing , though all ruinous . Just at that moment we were obliged to halt in the communication trench . The Roches were firing shrapnel . We huddled against the bank . I was 80 tired that I slept a few minutes standing up , leaning on my stick . The sensation that people were moving awoke me , and once more began that slow , automatic , painful advance . A cold rain was falling , which in spite of my mackintosh trickled down my neck to my chest . Occasional spent bullets went grunting over our heads . Each moment seemed eternal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the march more than four hours . Several shells burst near-by . One man had his head blown open , and remained standing . It was necessary to push this ghastly thing against the wall of the trench and nearly climb over it . At last , after a long time , we step .. ped . I went with the guide to inspect my new quarters . The trench was an abomination ? a charnel house I ) dead piled upon dead , on the ground where you walked , above the parapet , , in the walls of the trench , half buried , with either their heads sticking out or their feet or their hands or their knees . We were in a communication trench that had just been seized and hastily repaired to make it tenable . I was horribly agitated , but . I managed to listen to the explanations of the officer I was replacing . We should have to use the greatest care . The trench was caught in an enfilade . Alas , our predecessors had not had a very gay time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pleasant prospect , truly . I went . to get my men , and told them beforehand what to expect , so that they might . he spared the worst of the shock I had had . It was not very cheering , the sight of all these dead , but our sufferings in the mud had dulled our sensibilities . There are no dug-outs of course , and no possibility of digging any in this earth that crumbles at each stroke of the spade . I took my place nearly in the middle of the trench , on what looked like a seat that some ingenious soldier had dug in the wall . As it was rather high , I asked my orderly to dig down a little so that I could sit more comfortably . Several strokes of the pick brought to light the cloth of a uniform . I was sitting in the lap of a corpse . I went and took up my domicile a little farther on . The explosion of a shell knocked down some of the earth of the wall opposite , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corpse . From that moment , this head was my vis- ? - vis , and once the first shudder of disgust bad passed , I thought no more about it . In the end , one gets used to living beside corpses , or maccabees , ' as we call them . They not only cease to make us uncomfortable , but they even make us laugh . Beyond the parapet there were two or three corpses , in the drollest attitudes . One looked as if he were invoking Allah , another was in the midst of a back-somersault . One of my poilus hung his canteen to a foot that was projecting over the wall ; the others laughed and followed his example . The true French spirit was to the fore  - -  -  an extreme adaptability , and , above all , good humor . The odor of the corpses was nauseating , but . pipes soon got the better of it . , ieanwhile , shells and grenades kept pouring in on us . We were obliged to use the greatest care , and keep as near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not very dangerous when t hey fell in the mud , for they either did not burst at all , or they exploded without much force ; but when they went from one end of the trench to the other and landed farther on , they were indeed deadly . Toward noon a messenger came to bring orders from the captain . He was standing in front of me , nearly up to his waist in mud . Suddenly he was without . a head ; he tottered but did not fall ; two streams of blood spurted violently from the headless body and bespattered me . It is hard sometimes not to have the right to have feelings ; my men were all around me and I did not want them to see me blanch . I simply told them to cover his body with a tent-sheet that was lying near , and sent word to the captain . These various shocks hardened me . After that , I was more or less indifferent to the terrible things that happened . I even ate with good relish in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trench . The day passed slowly , full of the anguish of explosions , to say nothing of the pain of moving and the cold that came from sitting motionless in this prolonged foot-bath . Night fell early . Then came orders . In the darkness a trench was to be ( lug , joining the two ends of our position . The men were to start at the same time from the two communication trenches and meet before daybreak . The digging was done from the trench itself , working forward as the new trench advanced . Several times corpses were turned up ; the place was a regular cemetery . The work went on rapidly . The trench was to be only a met re deep and the earth was very easy to dig . But the Roches threw hand-grenades , alai I received for my share a splinter near my right eye . I stopped the bleeding and remained at . my post . At three the morning the crews met . Rations arrived in very bad shills .. The cooks had to make the same long trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts . So I hey brought us the cofte cold , meat all covered with mud , and vegetables that had to be thrown away . The wine alone arrived intact . Instead of its being brought in pails , I had taken the precaution to have it put in tightly stoppered canteens , the same ones the Roche was carrying when he crawled up and surrendered . Although the fatigues had slipped down several times or been knocked down by the impact . of shells , the pinard arrived untouched , to our very great joy . By good luck , every one was well supplied with canned goods . In the morning , although we were exhausted by a sleepless night . in addition to the strain of all our ot her hardships , the order came to attack . There was a good deal of grumbling , but I showed my men that , if our situation was pitiable , the thing to do was to improve it .. It was to the interest of all of us to go across tile way , where we should certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous . We should dash to the assault from the trench dug I he night before , at a moment when the Bodies did not e.xpect . it , and there would be so little ground to cover that the risk would not be great . Besides , it was our duty , and I was certain toy poitus would keep the promise they had made me to follow wherever I should lead . At two o'clock the whole company was to take its place in t he new trench ; t 2.10 we were to deliver the attack . However , things did not happen according to schedule , and the Germans gave us the opportunity to take their trench almost wit hout any losses on our own side , but with many losses on theirs . Toward eleven o'clock , when our bombardment had only just begun , our machine-guns began to clatter , and likewise all the guns at the loop-holes . It was the Roches attacking . They had a hankering alter the trench we had dug during the night , and wanted to launch an assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that we were planning to do to theirs . They came on in full force , but there was time for the machine-guns to mow down 1111111 hers of them before the first ones reached the net ' trench . 1 . ' he ? iucl kept them back , aml the poor wretches made a tragic struggle to get . their feet loose and to hurry . Three successive waves started . The machine-gun at the end of our trench was quickly shifted , and enfiladed our new trench full of Roches , killing nearly all of them . It was horrible but magnificent . But others were coining on . Than I commanded , ' Fix bayonets ! Forward ! Forward ! ' and we dashed against the assailants . The whole company followed my example and rushed forward . Was it to be a hand-to-hand fight ? Our murderous grenades crushed the first row , and in the face of our air of determination the others hesitated , then turned tail . We threw grenades at them and fired at close range . We kept stick- ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity was too good to be lost . We followed them home ; their batteries and machine-guns could not fire for fear of hitting their own men . They had no sooner reached their trenches than we were at heir heels , stopping just long enough to shower in grenades before we junipecl in after them . I had a feeling that some one was aiming at me and I emptied my revolver point-blank into t he head of an Oberleutitant who was wearing a monocle . I did this automatically by reflex act ion . I seized anot her enemy by the throat and struck him in the face with the butt of my revolver . Ile fell like lead . But the hand-to-hand fight did not last long . The forty soldiers who were left quickly surrendered . Quick ! Quick ! ' I commanded . ' Reverse the trench ! ' In other words , pierce several loop-holes and turn the German machine-guns against their own trenches . We stopped up the communication trench , and opened up the ones toward the rear , and the prisoners filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication . We then prepared to ward oil ' the counter-attack . Barbed wire was brought and securely fastened . The Germans proceeded to treat us to reprisal fire , which damaged our newly conquered trench rather badly , but did little real harm . I lost nine men in all , four killed and five wounded . The Germans had been neatly outwitted . By quarter past eleven we were established in our new positions . These events had lasted but a very few minutes ? the hand-to-hand fight just long enough to let me kill two Germans . Nevertheless , the situation was none on cheerful . The German corpses were all about . Our grenades had done their work well , and any wounded were drowned in the mud as they fell . As we walked , the bodies sank in deeper , for the bottom of the trench was literally covered with them , forming a sort of carpet under our feet . In spite of it we were radiant . The commander expressed his satisfaction . The coon ter-a t tack might come at any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells , we laughed at them . Every one gathered trophies . 1 carried off the revolver and field-glass of my Oberleutnant , also his notebook , which I proposed to decipher and hand over to the stall officers . Night fell gradually . The air was very sharp , and it began to rain again . We all looked like Capuchin friars , with our blankets - wrapped around its and our tent-sheets over our heads . No one could sleep , or rather , no one was allowed to sleep ; but as I made my Way with great difficulty back and forth in the trench , I saw several men asleep , holding their guns at the loop-holes . In order to keep them awake I made them fire salutes to the commandment . The bombardment was intense all night , but it was directed more especially against our second lines . That . augured a counter-attack for the next day . At midnight . word was sent that . we should be relieved at 2 A.M. General rejoicing . At last we should be able to get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we had a long wait . in the rain that was falling and in the shells that were falling . It was not until daybreak that the others came to relieve us . And then began anew the fight with the mud . It took us nearly two hours to reach Perthes . There we learned that we were not to be sent to recuperate , but were to reinforce the third line in the fortified dugouts of Hill 100 . Then we left . the communication trenches ? for they were in too bad a state ? and walked in the road , almost in the open . A rather high parapet pro- tected us from bullets and from being seen by the Germans , Who Were about a kilometre to the north . But we had to march bent double , alternately making rapid leapsand stopping . Of course , a few bullets came our way , but the Bodies had not seen us and we were not much molested . Once , when We stopped , I saw lying in the road beside me a dead soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not suffered much . After 300 met res on t he road , We had to go into the communication trench again , that is to say , begin to flounder through the mire . A big German shell had fallen into the twnch without bursting , and we had to climb over it . Dangerous engines those , that a mere trifle may cause to explode . I wonder now how we managed to keep going for another hour , for it seemed at every step that see should drop in our tracks . It had been impossible to send up rations , and we had nothing to drink . Some of the men suffered so great ly from thirst t hat . they scooped up in their hands t he mudd ) - water that was lying stagnant . in the trench and qua lied it with delight . I had a flask of mint , and I drank a swallow that refreshed me greatly . We were so tired toward the last that . We could ( mit her see nor feel , but , stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men asleep as they Went , . At last , we arrived . These dug-outs were a sort or Ca ye made in the side of the hill  - -  -  large galleries well propped with planks , wit h the entrance carefully protected by a regular rampart , of bags of sand . The minute we arrived we I lirew ourselves down and slept . and slept , in spite of t he big German shells that were bursting with a frightful hubbub , in spite of a French battery concealed near by , which kept up an incessant fire , and in spite of our consuming thirst . Ve did not wake up until the commissary arrived , bringing letters and rations . Everybody demanded the letters first . We were in such sore need of a few words of endearment , much more so than of food ! I got five letters , which I read with delight . I also got some eggs which my lit t In godmother managed to send me from Lorraine ; and they were a wonderful feast , sweet as a caress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to sleep again . We ca n't be entirely brutish , since letters bring us such joy . We have killed men , under penally of being killed ourselves , and also because it was our duty , but these combats took place in a sort of frenzy , of act ion , of enthusiasm , and of suffering . I have killed Iwo Germans and 1 am proud of it , and yet , I have not the soul of an assassin . At eight in the evening the major received word that two companies were to be Sent to the trenches . All the troops were jailed , all had labored long and hard ; we drew lots  --  the 11 th and 1211 ) . So I had 10 set out . again . I went to rouse my men . They grumbled a nil tIe but obeyed philosophically , buckling on their equipnent. and folding their blankets . At nine o'clock we set out to traverse in the opposite direction the ground we had C01110 over in the morning : trench , road , trench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was impossible to maintain distances . One section got lost and had to turn back ; then troops were met coming the other way , the ditch was narrow , and it was slow work squeezing through . Order was once snore established as we came near our goal . The night . was full of the uproar of a battle . The machine-guns were emitting in the distance the regular click of a sewing-machine , while the little guns sounded like the sputtering of fish in a frying-pan . A few bullets whizzed by . I heard one of the men say in his utter weariness , ' I hope one of those bullets is for me ! ' I chided him mildly , but it was exhaustion that wrung this cry from him , for the day before at the moment of the attack he had fought with the bravest . We arrived at an empty second-lino trench that we were to occupy and defend , in case of need . But it was very different from having the enemy right before us , and we could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud , or in the dug-outs , where the brittle earth crumbled and fell in tiny frozen pellets . We slept the rest of the night and spent the following day almost without moving , wearily awaiting the moment to depart . We were disgustingly dirty , caked with mud from head to foot . We scraped it off our hands and faces with our knives ; our hair was a strange substance that looked as if it would withstand any possible process of cleaning . Toward eight in the evening orders came that we were to be relieved . They were greeted with a satisfaction not unmixed , for no one smiled as the prospect rose before him of the return trip through those communication trenches . Slowly , with many difficulties , and at the cost of great . efforts , we simile our way once more through the mire ? simple automatons , with very little more notion of time and space than a pendulum on the end of its pivot . We reached Dill 181 and solid ground , solid except for big shell-holes filled with water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fell into them , and had to be pulled out with rifles butts . Shells were falling , so we changed into open formation to march the 500 metres that lay between us and the kitchens . Rot coffee awaited us there , but we could not stop long enough to drink it , as the shells were coming down too fast . It was not until some distance farther on , when the coffee was cold , that we were able to refresh ourselves . The Germans were keeping up a continuous bombardment of CabanePuits , so that we could not stay there , but had to go to B ? le-Chftteau , twelve kilometres beyond . The long column of the regiment wound through the plain four hours longer , with numerous halts and untold weariness . The knapsacks that we had picked up again dragged heavily on our shoulders . From time to time , exhausted men left the ranks and lay down in the road , falling asleep with their packs on their backs . We were very near the end of our tether , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . A long halt was made here , and the stragglers had time to regain their places before we marched into the village . Was it possible for us to shoulder arms and keep step , in our state of exhaustion ? Yes , indeed , and it was sublime . The colonel , before dismissing us to recuperate , wished to have us file before our Hag , our beloved flag , blackened and torn by battles . We had earned this honor , and it made us forget every- thing else . Every man of all the mud-smeared ranks felt . that his very soul was wrapped in the glory of that sacred emblem for which he had suffered so much and so willingly . Now , as a supreme reward , while we still bore upon us the marks of duty well done , we were to perform in the presence of the flag an immense and joyous act of faith in our native land . All the men felt the solemnity of the moment ; and to the ringing notes of the farewell hymn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these worn and footsore men , so covered with grime as to have scarcely a human semblance , defiled before the flag and presented arms as they never had presented them before . And when I saw my men stand up proud and straight to present arms , putting into this act all the strength that was in them , and when it was my turn to salute our colors , I was so stirred that the tears ran down toy mud-stained cheeks . I am happy . I give thanks for all I have suffered , since it has won for me the joy of this moment .
