The Brook Kerith . By George Moore . New York : The Macmillan Co. $1.50 . If one writes well enough ; one may say anything one pleases . A man who takes great pains with his style is likely in the long run to have a devoted following , and to get a hearing , even for his indiscretions and ineptitudes . If he unites with his talent for dulcet utterance a certain instinct for " sex " and salacity and shocking middle-class sensibilities , he is pretty sure to become a celebrity , and he has a fair chance of becoming a classic , in his own lifetime . There is at present a strong demand for the sanction given to the discussion of questionable subjects by an unquestionable style . Mr. Moore knows how to meet that demand . Some people read him for his style , and some people read him for his subjects . And so one was not surprised to hear him hailed , not long ago , as the greatest master of English since Thackeray . The book now before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . The best , work of the " greatest master of English since Thackeray " should be an event of first-rate literary importance . It should , at least , bear " looking into . " It does . We have looked into it rather carefully and with curiosity sharpened by the fine things that have been said about it . An honest and benevolent reviewer ought , however , to indicate clearly from what point of view it will bear inspection . It will be a kindness to readers who , like ourselves , wish to keep in touch with the really " great " living writers to say frankly what sort of readers will not be able to bear looking into it . The first sort are those who accept the traditional view of the Bible and the life of Jesus : to them " The Brook Kerith " can be nothing but an impudent and detestableprofanation of the sanctuary . The second sort are those who , without accepting all the traditional views of the Bible and the life of Jesus , preserve a profound admiration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth and beauty of the Scripture : to them " The Brook Kerith " can hardly fail to appear a licentious and ignoble travesty . There remain George Moore 's followers , to whom every line of his is precious ; and there remain those who , like ourselves , can , in the case of a " great " living writer , put aside their own religious and literary predilections , and yield to their quite unholy curiosity to know what a man like George Moore can have to say about Jesus . The book leaves no doubt that Mr. Moore has for many years done a good deal of  --  we will not say , of thinking . Mr. Moore does not think ; he muses . That , for persons of musing temperament , is the charm of his later manner . He has then , we say , done a great deal of musing about his subject . For some reason , Jesus is a phenomenon that has disturbed his equanimity . The Beatitudes , the Crucifixion , the Resurrection have been obstacles to the equable flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " crown , " " renunciation , " " self-sacrifice , " " redemption " ? all these knotty ideas and symbols of our need of a spiritual life and of the means of attaining it have puzzled George Moore , have annoyed him , have almost forced him to think . But Mr. Moore does not like to think ; it is contrary to the stream of his tendency . And why , he " mutters " to himself , should one do what one does not like ? Why , he muses , should one go against the stream of one 's tendency ? Have not all great artists found themselves by following their tendency ? There was Ddgas , for example . . . . Christian tradition , however dwindled , runs counter to , and thwarts , one 's instincts . Clearly , one can not muse in comfort till one gets this Jesus out of one 's system ! Novelists and dramatists of this generation have tried various means to get the spiritual Jesus of the gospels out of their systems . Oscar Wilde exorcised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exquisite Pre-Raphaelitish esthete who walked in the Garden of Gethsemane . Others have accomplished the same end by repeating to themselves that it was an anarchist , a socialist , a humanitarian enthusiast . George Moore must have mused on these modern literary exorcisms till he became aware that all methods have one common element : any one who desires to rid himself of the obsession of the spiritual Jesus has but to put his own natural instinctive self in the place of Jesus . The substitution brings instant relief from the pressure upon the consciousness of an exacting alien force . Thus , when Mr. Moore has performed this substitution and has converted Jesus of Nazareth into a contemporary Irish sentimental naturalist of our own day , he is no longer troubled by the hallucination of a voice calling : " Follow me . " The voice says now : " Follow your inclinations " ? which , of course , is precisely what he was " getting at . " Mr. Moore creates the Moore-ish Jesus of this curious fiction untrammelled by the spirit or the letter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross , but is removed from it alive , and is slowly nursed back to health in the house of Joseph of Arimathea . It is shortly after the descent from the cross and during the convalescence that the following conversation takes place : Joseph asked , not because he was interested in dog breeding , but to make talk , if the puppies were mongrels . Mongrels , Jesus repeated overlooking them ; not altogether mongrels , three-quarter bred ; the dog that begot them was a mongrel , half Syrian , half Thracian . I 've seen worse dogs highly prized . Send the bitch to a dog of pure Thracian stock and thou'lt get some puppies that will be the sort that I used to seek . This is not the most nor the least quotable of the innumerable passages by which our ingenious author gives to his narration a kind of sex-interest in which the gospel story is quite deficient . When the continuance of Jesus in Jerusalem becomes dangerous , Joseph sends him into the hills by the brook Kerith . There , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out to preach , he dwells as a shepherd for some twenty years , busily occupied in improving the stock by a judicious selection of rams , but finding occasion to muse from time to time on the events of the past  --  composing , so to speak , his " Memoirs of My Dead Life . " In these pastoral musings among the hills , he exhibits all George Moore 's mental manners or mannerisms  --  picks up a definite theme , toys with it , strays from it , loses the thread , drifts off on the stream of revery , and perhaps eventually drifts back again . It is not to be wondered at that this somewhat languid form of mental activity brings him ultimately around to Mr. Moore 's own " intellectual position . " Here is a selection of his sayings and musings on pages 365 and 366 : Repentance changes nothing , it brings nothing unless grief peradventure . . . . I used , he said , to despise the air I breathed , and long for the airs of paradise , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God bade us live on earth and we bring unhappiness upon ourselves by desiring heaven . Jesus stopped , and looking through the blue air of evening , he could see the shepherds eating their bread and garlic on the hillside . . . . His thoughts began again , flowing like a wind . . . In the desert he had looked for God in the flowers that the sun called forth and in the clouds that the wind shepherded , and he had learnt to prize the earth and live content among his sheep , all things being the gift of God and his holy will . He had not placed himself above the flowers and grasses of the earth , nor the sheep that fed upon them , nor above the men that fed upon the sheep . Reviewer 's italics : quintessence of Moore-ish naturalism . . . . Rites and observances , all that comes under the name of religion , estranges us from God , he repeated . God is not here , nor there , but everywhere : in the flower , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . But shall we gather the universal will into an image and call it God ? ? for by doing this do we not drift back to the starting place of all our misery ? We again become the dupes of illusion and desire ; God and his heaven are our old enemies in disguise . He who yields himself to God goes forth to persuade others to love God , and very soon his love of God impels him to violent ends and cruel deeds . It can not be else , for God is but desire reviewer 's italics : was the definition " made in Germany " ? ; and whosoever yields to desire falls into sin . To be without sin we must be without God . . . . Jesus stood before the door of the cenoby , . . . asking himself if any man had dared to ask himself if God were not indeed the last uncleanliness of the mind . Reviewer 's italics : the " daring " of the question reminds one rather less of Jesus than of the talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the positive or " constructive " message of the book . This soft , sentimental , pseudo-pantheism is no doubt really Mr. Moore 's . When he expresses it , he speaks with as much sincerity as the chary gods have vouchsafed to him . It is when he is steeped to the lips in a vague sweet sense that there is no difference between him and a flower  --  it is in such moments that he writes the " delicious " half-pages that persuade even schtine Seelen that he is the greatest master of English since Thackeray . It is when he is in the grip of a vague sense that there is no difference between him and a sheep or , let us say , one of the Essene rams which so much solicit his attention  --  it is in such moments that he writes the sly half-pages which persuade some of us that he is not far from right : that there is probably no very great difference between his religion and that of the sheep . And so one comes back to a sense that a religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flower has a certain usefulness yet . Revenons d , nos  --  let us return to Mr. Moore 's Jesus . His musing by the brook Kerith has a destructive tendency along with its benevolent sentimentality . He muses slowly to the conclusion that his great mission was a mistake ; that a large part of his teaching was fanatical ; that his renunciation of the earthly life was perverse ; that his presentation of himself as the Messiah was imposture . Finally , in the assembly of the Essenes , he confesses his sins . Conducted by a master-confesser , the recital is rather prolix . Here is part of the confession : I fear to speak of the things I said at that time , but I must speak of them . One man asked me before he left all things to follow me if he might not bury his father first I answered , leave the dead to bury their dead , and to another who said , my hand is at the plough , may I not drive it to the headland , I answered : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more violent . It is not peace , I said , that I bring you , but a sword , and I come as a ' brand wherewith to set the world in flame . . . . It seems to me that in telling the story , brethren , I am doing but the work of God ; no man strays very far from the work that God has decreed to him . Reviewer 's italics : this is the genuine gospel according to Moore . But in the time I am telling I was so exalted by themany miracles which I had performed by the power of God or the power of a demon , I know not which , that I encouraged my disciples to speak of me as the son of David , though I knew myself to be the son of Joseph the carpenter ; and when I rode into Jerusalem and the people strewed palms before me and called out , the son of David , and Joseph said to me , let them not call thee the son of David , I answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth the stones themselves would . . . . A day passed in great exaltation and hope , and one evening I ' took bread and broke it , saying that I was the bread of life that came down from heaven and that whosoever ate of it had everlasting life given to him . After saying these words a great disquiet fell upon me , and calling my disciples together I asked them to come to the garden of olives with me . And it was while asking God 's forgiveness for my blasphemies that the emissaries and agents of the Priests came and took me prisoner . The " great situation " in the book is the confrontation of Jesus with the apostle Paul . He staggers into the cenoby of the Essenes one night , full of the " glad tidings of the resurrection " which he has been preaching from Damascus to Jerusalem . He is present through part of the confession of Jesus , but imagines that he is listening to a madman , and is himself seized with a fit in the midst of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is indeed the crucified Nazarene ; but Paul departs utterly incredulous and unmoved , and goes on his way , proclaiming the risen Lord . Jesus had intended to return to Jerusalem , and to destroy his following by exploding his " legend . " But having seen how Paul has set his heart on the resurrection idea , he hates to do it ; he does not do it ; ' he simply disappears , leaving Paul uncontradicted to preach his colossal error throughout the earth ? " because , " as one admiring reviewer has put it , " because in his gentleness he can not give so much pain " ! The sentimentality of this touches the cloudy borders of sublimity . The writer of this notice can think of but one passage in literature which equals it in its special quality . That is the passage in " Tristram Shandy " in which Uncle Toby picks up the fly which has tormented him cruelly all dinnertime : " I 'll not hurt thee , says my Uncle Toby , rising from his chair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'll not hurt a hair of thy head : ? go  --  says he , lifeing up the sash , and opening his hand as he spoke to let it escape ; ? go , poor devil , get thee gone , why should I hurt thee ? ? This world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me . " If Jesus were the sentimentalist that Mr. Moore depicts him , one could imagine him tossing his Irish " apologist " out the window with the remark that Uncle Toby addressed to the fly . Well , our curiosity Is satisfied : we have learned what George Moore has to say about Jesus . We shall let the defenders of religion denounce the book , if they please , as an " impudent and detestable profanation " ; we shall let the defenders of literature denounce it , if they please , as a " licentious and ignoble travesty . " For ourselves , we shall only hint a doubt whether Mr. Moore , though he be the greatest master of English since Thackeray , writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brook Kerith . " CURRENT FICTION . The Rising Tide . By Margaret Deland . New York : Harper &; Brothers . Mrs. Deland has been especially happy , hitherto , in the interpretation of what may be called cap and bonnet womanhood . There are resolute spirits among her Old Chester ladies , but they have their being in an atmosphere of ladyhood . They belong to an age in which one might consent to be a gentlewoman , or an accomplished female , but would not choose to be labelled with the harsh and slightly coarse word , woman . The passage of half a century has changed all that . Ladythood has passed out , womanhood has boldly asserted itself , in its own character at first , and more recently as an estate which is just the same as manhood , only rather more so . But if Dr. Lavender had had the problems of feminism to deal with , among his other problems , he would have approached them , we may be sure , in much the spirit of good-humored inquiry which marks this narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stirring so many humdrum households in our time . She is full of faith in herself and in her sex , and ? bases that faith upon theoretical distrust of the other sex . She is a rebel and a dissenter . She hates shams , and has learned from Shaw and Nietzsche and other timely guides for children that pretty much everything that is old and established is a sham . She is sure that there ought to be a single code for men and women , and signalizes her conviction by aping the vices of men . With it all , she is ordinarily innocent enough and feminine enough , and , if she is lucky and the right opportunity comes , quite happily backslides into the debased and antiquated trade of wife and mother . Fred Payton is badly infected with the fashionable disease . Her mother is a fool and a reactionary , therefore Fred neglects and insults her . Women ought to be independent , economically and otherwise , therefore Fred must play at business , and subject herself to various social perils . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke cigarettes , and flout men , and in all ways prove her superior wisdom and ability . Meanwhile her youth and sex are at work , and easily betray her into love for the good-looking , good-humored young fellow with whom she has been playing at friendship . She thinks he returns her feeling , but he is really attracted to a girl of the old-fashioned type , and Freddy has to pass through deep waters of humiliation . A better mate is awaiting her , in due time , and we leave her with confidence in her reasonably happy and useful future . Mrs. Deland treats all this as a serious problem of the day , recognizing that the tide of woman is rising , and must rise above the " ladylike " levels of the past . If her story shows the folly of current militant and aggressive methods , it does not deny the existence of a goal . The Woman Gives . By Owen Johnson . New York : Boston : Little , Brown &; Co . The author of that flimsy and popular literary Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to stay his hand from further easy profits . The present story , boastfully " featured " in a malodorous monthly , has the same false glamour of white lights and nocturnal feasting , and sex experiment , and shoddy moralizing . Bachelors of both sexes disport themselves here , with pleasing freedom ; and a sensational plot duly unfolds itself for the edification of that youth which owns the newsstand as its alma mater . Our heroine , to be sure , is at the other extreme from the leading lady of " The Salamander " ? which might have been called " The Woman Who Takes . " Inga is a sort of priestess of generosity , and sex is her temple . Artists , she perceives , are a weak lot , always falling beneath themselves , and taking to drink , or worse , on the apparent theory that this sort of thing represents a kind of getting-back-at whatever-has baffled them . It is for Inga to rescue and uplift them by ? the temporary gift of herself . Here in the foreground is a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way indeed . He is a great genius , but he has married a bad woman , and he feels it necessary to be extremely drunken and disorderly , by way of giving fate what-for . Inga takes him in hand , though he does n't care to be taken in hand , and has him on his feet in no time . That is to say , she has to fetch him out of the gutter more than once , but he presently stays out because he loves her so  --  and asks her to marry him . She does not care for marriage , since she thinks of herself as only the doctor , and knows this patient will not need her always , while some other is sure to . She loves Dangerfield , but loves her duty more . So she marries him , with the proviso that she may leave him and follow her star , whenever she sees fit ; and ( here we observe the author 's stern realism in action ) she actually does that , as soon as Dangerfield has fulfilled himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offing .

Doran Co. $1.25 net . Down the steps of his cousin 's house in the Faubourg St. Honore ran Jehan de Reizet , plump into the arms of adventure in discreet black with white cotton hosiery . But this adventure led him , alas ! to the house of his sworn foes , the rich Americans who lived next door to his own hOtel and insisted on trying to buy his garden to play in . But , of course , Jehan had a brother in Eton collars who did not share the family prejudice against rich Americans ; and Sylvia , the daughter of " The Idea , " was exactly the sort of American girl who bears that kind of a name in this kind of a story . Moreover , Madame Petan , the discreet and sentimental dragon in black , mixed up the two brothers in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Due de Petrinac from maturing in the lifelong unhappiness of Sylvia . So that with the help of a flood in Paris and an international spy and a pearl necklace and a French chateau and a great deal of true love , this perfectly absurd story manages to keep the reader turning its pages , in spite of a naive and woful waste of words and such verbal eccentricities as " the unknown quantity is always to be suspicioned.
