WITH some of the vagaries of our censorship the read- ers of the Nation are now familiar . I wonder how many are aware that efforts are being made to extend it to other countries . The other day the Associated Press reported the suppression in Paris of one issue of Le Popu  --  laire , the new radical Socialist daily , " at the request of General Pershing " ? for what reason no one yet knows . Almost simultaneously came the news , via Sweden and Switzerland , of the beginning of criminal proceedings against the Swedish newspaper Aften Bladet , at the re  --  quest of the American Minister to Sweden . The ground of the complaint was that this newspaper had attacked Presi  --  dent Wilson in a way to endanger , the present friendly rela  --  tions between the United Statestnd Sweden . While this report must be taken with some reservation pending abso  --  lute verification , it unfortunately fits in with other develop  --  ments in Sweden . We have no doubt whatever that if the American Minister has taken such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Wilson , whom we hold to be absolutely above such childishness either at home or abroad . But there are curious things happening every hour and it is regrettable that Mr. Wilson permits the men responsible to remain in office instead of making an example of one or two conspicuous ones pour encourager les autres . - yNOTE that the policy of anonymity as to the army in I France still continues . The censor even deleted the other day the name of an army corps which apparently General Pershing himself desired printed in recognition of its ad  --  mirable services . Only occasionally does the name of a general crop out in the news . This seems to be altogether absurd . We know who the German generals are against whom we fight , and they know ours . But it is safe to say that the great public in America knows the names of only four generals , Pershing , March , Bullard , and Liggett  --  the last two now lieutenant generals . So I was glad when the name of an old friend turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John L. Hines . This excellent officer was a major of regulars when the war began and in the short time since has risen by sheer merit to the rank of corps commander . Major Hines was on General Pershing 's staff as assistant adjutant general during the expedition into Mexico , and demonstrated his worth at that time . Accordingly General Pershing took Major Hines with him when he started for France . But Major Hines was not content with staff duties and speedily became Colonel of the Sixteenth Regulars , which is supposed to be the first regular - regiment to have landed in France  --  at least one guesses this in the absence of official informa  --  tion . One of its battalions was the organization which cre  --  ated such enthusiasm in Paris on Bastile Day , 1917 . Gen  --  eral Hines is the best type of the modest , unassuming West Point graduate , not so brilliant as some , but hard-working , devoted , and not in the least militaristic . As a journalist I can not help wondering how in the face of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like General Hines and General Cameron and General Read and others who are doing fine work the credit to which they are entitled . The other day the managing editor of the Nation dropped in on me , almost in despair as he faced the prospect ofmaking up the present number , for the first time without " Andy " to keep everything straight . Thirty-odd years ago the name of Howard M. Anderson stood for five years on the rolls of the United States army . Then he came to New York , and last week he was presented with a gold watch fob in recognition of thirty-two years of faithful service in the ' Evening Post composing room , where he has always been a sturdy , outstanding figure . An old-fashioned printer , who learned his trade long before the- days of the linotype , he has carried over into these later times the finest ideals of the craft . Summer and winter , year in , year out , he has stood at the stone and made up the Nation , with an unfailing intelligence and skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To him as to no other one man has been due the mechanical perfection that has been a distinguishing mark of the Nation . Often , when the dilatoriness of contributors resulted in impossible de  --  mands on the printer , he would express a sulphurously un complimentary opinion of " grown men " who knew no better than to create such a situation , only to add , " Well , we 'll have to do the best we can " ; and somehow the impossible always came to pass , and Tuesday night saw the forms locked and the presses running . The separation of the Nation from the Evening Post has now robbed the former of " Andy . " With him go H. J. W. Harrington , whose ad  --  vertising make-up was a weekly work of art , and George M. Babbage , who in recent years has set almost the whole paper on his own machine ? The contribution of these three has been by no means limited to their technical specialty . Over and over again has each one of them called the editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , sometimes even doubtful points of judgment , that had crept into the proofs . They have been , indeed , valued counsellors . Admirable men and fine printers they are ; - every Nation reader is in their debt . Of such is the strength of our country . THE DRIFTER Correspondence Army English To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sul : Some months ago an excellent fascicle for instruction , in elementary French , of the personnel of the army and navy came under my observation . I was struck by a memorandum of the publishers , regarding the pronunciation of the letter r as follows : " Just one word of caution to the would-be student concerning the author 's original , and so far entirely successful , system of phonetic pronunciation of French . It will be noticed that Madame C ? ends her phonograms of words like le , to , with the letter r . This r must be kept silent in the pronunciation . Its use is to ensure the correct value of the vowel before it , and it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound the final r in words like for , or sooner . In fact it is an English r and not a French one . " At the time these latter statements seemed somewhat amusing , for in spite of an acquaintance with cultured people , in widely separated sec  --  tions of the country , I was not aware that such pronunciation was the vogue , save perchance in or near Boston , certain por  --  tions of Virginia , and more or less throughout the South . Since entering active service it has been my lot to be sta  --  tioned in Kansas , Louisiana , Washington , and California ; in addition . I have journeyed through Missouri , Arkansas , Texas , Arizona , New Mexico , and Oregon . In this experience I have encountered officers and men , in large numbers , from all sec  --  tions of the country . A substantial proportion of the officers have been university or college bred ; and a fair sprinkling , with similar antecedents , has been noted among the enlisted       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
