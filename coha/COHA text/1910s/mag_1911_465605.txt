WE read a book , not long ago , which gave us a great deal of pleasure along with some interesting question . It was called The Skipper and the Skipped , and it was written by Mr. Holman Day , whom we have since found the author of two very lively though more serious novels , but who , we indulge ourselves in thinking , has sensed a truer self in it than in King Spruce or in The Ramrodders . All three of the books are about people in the State of Maine , in and out of the big woods there , and the last deals more particularly with the politics of the people , or at least their politicians . The Skipper and the Skipped also deals with politics , but only in the administration of public affairs in a small country town , and it is more concerned with certain types of involuntary politicians than with the management of parties The principal persons in the rather boisterous drama are a sea-captain who has gone ashore with an unrelenting rheumatism , and a circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has retired to his farm with one of his elephants . Both are of that intense Yankee nature which would like to wreak its passions in unsparing blasphemy , but denies itself actual profanity , while indulging the use of synonymous and analogous epithets and expletives of its own invention . In the exploitation of these persons the author lets himself wildly loose , and takes the reader a joy-ride through divers kinds of grotesque incidents without too widely transcending the bounds of possibility in what happens , and of probability in the people it happens to ; they are all of the New England breed , though it is the wilding growth of Down East rather than the tamer stock of the mother commonwealth of Massachusetts ; there is a difference between the two which the connoisseur can taste with equal relish . But it is not our present purpose to enter into the story of the book , or to amusing book is a doubt which we gladly leave to him . We are sensible , or we seem to be sensible , of a lull in American humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may fitly look ahont us , and challenge the elements as to their intentions concerning it . Sometimes , we will confess , we have been afraid that American humor had possibly overdone itself . There was a moment , baleful or hopeful as the reader may decide , when , just before the lapse of faith , it appeared as if we almost expected to be saved by humor . This may have been quite an illusion , but it was strong enough to prompt the most serious inquiry into the nature of humor , and its place in the spiritual order of things . Clearly , one could not conceive of an angel joking , and , properly speaking , could there be any such thing as joking in heaven ? By that time hell was about being disposed of by popular vote , or by a consensus of newspapers , rather , and it was only of heaven that one could think in the conneetion . Was there not something essentially cruel in humor ? Did not it , in its last analysis , rest upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbecility , and could such things be matter of mirth with the heavenly host or any of it ? The archfiend , before he was blotted out with his followers by the newspapers and the newer criticism , might have subtly or coarsely found those obliquities funny ; Satan might , Beelzebub might , Mammon himself might ; but could Michael , or Gabriel , or Ithuriel , before they too paled in the blaze of journalistic investigation ? In the general substitution of humor for faith as a saving agency , one had to ask one 's self these piercing questions . Their consideration brought to light several facts concerning the nature of humor which one had to subject to the severest scrutiny . At first it appeared as if the broader humor was the kindlier , was , in fact , not at all cruel , since it involved its object in a sort of confession of the general human weakness , and pitied while it laughed , and invited its object to laugh with it . But this inference scarcely bore examination . There is nothing crueler than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergence from barbarism and boyhood into civilizetion and maturity , humor kept too much of both . The joking in Rabelais is not only filthy , it is atrocious ; and when you come to the humaner humor of Cervantes , it is still so abominably unfeeling that it is doubtful whether Don Quixote has not died the death because the fun of the book was mostly so brutal that mankind could no longer bear it , rather than because the books of chivalry which it burlesqued were no longer known to readers , and the burlesque was unintelligible . Much of the humor in Shakespeare is cruel , so cruel that Mark Twain used to say that when it did not bore him it offended him past endurance . Consider what an awful thing the mocking of Malmho was , how heartless the jokes put upon Falstaff ! The one great English humorist who never had credit for the high moral quality of his humor was Swift , who really seldom hurt but to heal , but who got himself permanently imagined a cynical savage by a humorist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came nearest being the purely and entirely humorous humorist we are requiring from the future as a successor to Mark Twain , and he was the most eminent predecessor of Mark Twain in the conscience ( ' humor we must always associate with that great pseudonym . Steele was net really gentler , though Thackeray tries to make him out so , and Pope by comparison was a venomous little viper , loving to bite the little heels of ladies . Out of most things that Swift wrote , the caustic irony has passed , and Gulliver 's Travels remains the harmless delight of boyhood without a suggestion of the political satire it began by being . But , in fact , there has been no English humorist of quite the entirety we have in mind , and of the same measure we ourselves have had none but the one . Sterne came as near being entirely a humorist as any , but Sterne would now have become altogether unreadable if it were not for the nastiness of him . Lamb ? yes , Lamb was almost wholly a humorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many American Lambs , so called , but not . of sufficient vitality to remain easily memorable ; the sweetest of them was Charles Dudley Warner , but he would not like to have been taken for a humorist solely . We suppose that Sir William Gilbert is the purest humorist who has ever lived in England , and it is a pity that he probably will not live forever . But even he is not the fun-maker of national magnitude that we have had several of , and perhaps lie is too fine for it . Mr. Bernard Shaw , yes , perhaps , but he is not universally accepted by his fellow-subjects , and we dare say he might like at times to be taken seriously , though we could not say what times . Our line of national fun-makers began with Artemus Ward , we believe , and he so far transcended the bounds of the republic as to make the British Empire an easy conquest for Mark Twain when he came . There were widely known funmakers before Artemus Ward , the coarser from the South and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell was the most essentially humorous . But he feared being so , and so did Holmes , whose gaiety clung to exclusive respectability , and would fain have been of it in essence as in form , only it was too subtle and too sweet ; and though it " shook against the cold " of the huge continental laughter welcoming it from the whole country , it could not keep itself quite to Boston , or shelter itself in the lee of Harvard . Odd as it may seem now to say it , there was a time when the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table stood next to the Showman of Baldwinsville in the popular delight , and people hardly enjoyed him the less because they enjoyed him more proudly . Of course , of course , not so many people enjoyed him so much ; his pleasantry was too delicate for the handling of the masses , who rioted in Artemus Ward , and yet his acceptance was qualitatively if not quantitatively the same . He was loved even more widely than he was known , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had a national joke , and we have nearly always had a national joker . The joke has been the man we laughed at , and the joker the man we laughed with . Perhaps the first was more unanimously accepted than the last ; certainly he was more popular . The reasons why would be matter of curious and perhaps useful inquiry , and mostly ' they would not be far to seek , as people who like an easy phrase like to say . We are a widely generalized folk , and at the same time a deeply specialized ; we are universal while we are provincial . Some sorts of fun can not get well out of their native sections ; that of New England seems to pass farthest and quickest ; and yet the fine humor which Joel Chandler Harris evolved from the dusky recesses of the soul of Uncle Remus at once became current with us and almost as immediately with the English , who cling more constantly to it still , as they do to the negro minstrelsy now become extinct with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Artemus Ward and scarcely died with Josh Billings , carried their merriment farther and sooner than anything else in it . Bad spelling was something anybody could do , or at least could understand , and in these eminent cases it embodied a great deal of delightsome drolling and toothsome wisdom . It may be said that George Ade sprang to universal celebrity from the rich parlance of the baseball field , but Mr. Ade bad other and finer claims to the love of his fellowmen . He is the making of a universal humorist of the Mark Twain type , though he lacks the bonhomie of Mark Twain , and has gone of presently , but we hope not permanently , to the theater ; for the loss is literature 's . The loss is so great that we can not help hoping some day to have him back , and more Dor Homes and Aram and Pink Marshes from him . If he had continued in their creation we might not now be hardily prophesying the primacy of Mr. Tolman Day . Mr. Ade has the flair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; he knows what we want before we know it ourselves , and his Fables in Slang gave it us even more anticipatively than those books of his we have been naming . But before him was that other sweeter and finer genius who divined a higher need of our nature and supplied it in the quaintness and lovableness of all the fun , that Frank Stockton made . His was the humor of the vast Middle States , claiming for their own all the human nature between the northern line of New York and the southern line of Pennsylvania , and not finding alien to it the American life of the uttermost East and remotest South . It was delicately almost as universally American as the humor of Mark Twain himself ; but Stockton is gone , and we can not hope the future from hint . It is interesting to recognize now that the very factitiousness of Bret Harte 's humor was what gave him instant currency ; most people arc factitious , and they could easily imagine what he meant . Two or three things he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real poet ; and he might have been a real humorist if he could have learned to look at life through his own eyes rather than the eyes of Dickens . Still it was no small thing to have created that grotesque world of a California which self-evidently never existed , and made it laughable and made it pathetic . He was at least not local , and so his fame widened to our horizons and beyond them to England and all Europe . Far more genuine talents have been kept obscure or obscurer by their very genuineness . No truer American humorist ever lived than that gentle lady who lives no longer , but we know most people will hesitate to accord Sarah Orne Jewett as great distinction . She kept her observation and her imagination strictly to her New England , to the hills and shores of her State of Maine . Because New England has flowed or trickled over so much of the West and the Northwest her humor is more appreciable than it might otherwise have been , but it caressed a few types only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The like sort of what we can not call perversity has kept more than one wholly unlike humorist even less imaginable to the overwhelming majority of their fellow-countrymen . Outside of New York the flavor of their wit could not be tasted , and in New York it could be the pleasure it is only to those who know a small condition , the journalistic , the literary , the editorial condition they wilfully or helplessly distil it f tom . But another satirist of the less technical literary conditions has given us lately a keen delight in his two books of essays , Imaginary Obligations and Constrained Attitudes , though we can not more hopefully forecast the succession of Mr. Frank M. Colby as a supreme American humorist than we could That of any of those too deeply localized New-Yorkers . Just at present we can not think of any one on the other side of the Atlantic doing such fine mockery together with such rarely failing good sense and good feeling . It is a mark of our advancing civilization that our humorists do not surpassingly succeed without being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cruel caricature which our poor benighted grandfathers and great - grandfathers thought they enjoyed in the graphic humorists of their dreadful day survives measurably in some periodicals professedly satirical , but even in picture the tendency is to the sweetness of the social pleasantries of Punch . Among the humorists of the pen , as distinguished from the humorists of the pencil , those who are not gentle seldom get above the shoulders of the multitude of the drolling paragraphers ; and , by the way , there seems just . now no such rising Danbury News Man among the country journalists as used to leap flame-like from column to column in his contemporaries and burn for his fitful hour with continentencompassing effulgence . No , so far as we know the humorous field , the primacy in it rests with Mr. Day , unless , indeed , Mr. Irving Bacheller , in his new departure of Keeping Up with Lizzie , is going to dispute it . But if Mr. Day should elect to write more such books as The Skipper and the Skipped , so interpretative and expressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacheller will not find the rivalry easy . Neither , however , need greatly dread defeat , if it should imply merely the loss of our applause , for it must be remembered that we have intimated a low opinion of humor at its best . Mr. Dooley is not in the derogatory competition because he is distinctively a philosophical observer .
