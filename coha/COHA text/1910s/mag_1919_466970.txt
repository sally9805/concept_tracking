HAVE peace politics , there is nothing more discussed in Europe just now than educa ? tion . The English newspapers quote from Milton , " The reform ? ing of education is one of the greatest and noblest designs that can he thought on , For by the want thereof the nation perishes . " Public speakers , whether they know it or nut , spend more than half their energies on problems of instruction . If 1 were asked to state one thing that men say they have learned from war , it would be the unsuspected and incom ? parable importance of education . I do not mean education in any for ? mal , text-book sense . At Aldershot it was a question of making soldiers . At Pol ? der 's End and Barrow-in-Furness , as one walked through row after row of mob-capped working-girls turning shells , the talk was of how they had been taught to work , and how the employers had been taught to teach and handle them . At Issoudun , it was education all day long in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in observation . On the New Zealand front I lunched within sound of a battery , and , eager for storks of the enemy , listened to the general in command while he talked education , how that remarkable little island might get back trained men after the war . Everybody was either learning orteach ? ing on the front . What was the rehearsal of an offensive but concrete education in tactics ? The sanitary corps never made its rounds without teaching care of physique . Back and back again the conversation came to the morale of the enemy , his training bad and good ; how and why he worked harder than we did ; how and why he had less independence of action , less judgment , less humanity ; and the answer was always , education . A young general of the old ' army said atlunch one day : " I am a ' mercenary sol ? dier , ' and therefore I ca n't believe , and do n't , that war is bad for character ; but I would not have military training for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He need not have made concessions to the civilian present . Education for war ? time as one heard it explained and specu ? lated upon in the army was not much nar ? rower than the reform of the human species , making them more intelligent , more adaptable , and more capable in all things as a prerequisite for waging successful war In England , one half of the serious discussions one heard I should classify under education . I do not mean precisely that London in war-time was like a teachers ' association with its gabble of methods , courses , and text-books . On the contrary , although exposed to " shop " of this nature by a university connection , I heard little talk of formal education , could arouse no interest in " the college curriculum after the war " and such favorite subjects , found it diffi ? cult to get a clear idea of just what the British school system had been like , such was the keenness to discuss not the bones , but the blood of education . And vet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisher 's education bill , so hotly con ? tested that even the war yielded front-page columns now and then in its favor . This was a time when you could stir any Britisher to talk ? M. P. , soldier , work ? man , country gentleman , superintend ? ent , I tried them all ? merely by the question , " What is going to happen in English education ? " No wonder they are interested . Effi ? ciency ? and in March of 1918 England saw clearly that she must be efficient or starve ? depends upon education . Propaganda ? and half the writing done in England was propaganda ? is a form of education . The next generation is deci ? mated by the war , and what is left of it will have to make the greatest profit in the briefest time from education . Ger ? many had set the nations at one an-other 's throats , and to thoughtful men there seemed no way to prevent the thing from happening again except by better ( and in Germany 's case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) writing a treatise on education after the war , for the excellent reason that neither I nor any one else knows the terms upon which it will he conducted . But one can not come into active contact with hundreds whose experience , often bitter , has brought them a new sense of values without at least an enrichment of opin ? ion . And the effect upon most men who have taught for a living is to make them crack open every educational idea they possess to see whether it holds dust or moving life within it . England at large is profoundly dissatisfied with her edu ? cation ; and she is right to be dissatis ? fied , for in some respects she was drag ? ging far below the safety line . The crust is cracking everywhere , the dust is blow ? ing away , new blood is throbbing . We shall soon be profoundly dissatisfied ; not with entire reason , for , after all , our suc ? cess in the trying year of 1918 was a suc ? cess for American education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to real ? ize that under stress a boy of twenty was being taught the very complex business of modern war in a quarter the time we allotted to less difficult professions of peace , we are bound to be dissatisfied also . We are bound to wonder whether we have not underestimated American capacity for learning , even when un ? stirred by a grave crisis . And when we thoroughly understand that propaganda ( which is merely expert transmission of ideas ) has turned the heart of nations , while our formal education in ideas , his ? torical , philosophical , or economic , has often sunk only skin deep , we are sure again to he dissatisfied . If we had edu ? cated as well before this war as we have educated for waging it , there might never have been one . If we educate as well after it there will never be another ; or , if there is , we shall win it . This is an essay and not a treatise , and I shall be more than content to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education seems to some of us ; what England has had , and has , that we have not ; what we have grasped that England is still seeking . If successful war is largely a question of national education , and a stable peace is also to depend upon education , then that co-operation which we all hope to see among English-speaking countries may serve us almost best through mutual education . There is , I am well aware , a prevalent belief that Great Britain has little to teach us in education . It is known that her lower schools are good , but probably no better than ours . It is known that her " public schools , " of secondary grade , are wonderfully effective in " stamping " the boys that go through them , but nar ? row and rigid in what they teach ; that there is no wide-spread system of secon ? dary education for everybody such as our high schools afford . It is known that British universities , while still famous for the men they produce , are irregular in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dis ? tinctly behind in many ranges of modern thought and investigation . This was known , and this is measurably true . The Fisher bill , which in effect establishes compulsory high schools that after seven years will keep boys and girls in school until eighteen , seems a step up to , not beyond , America ; and one hears of no radical , far-sweeping changes proposed in the British universities . Why , then , after the stress of war and in the approach to reconstruction , should we be interested in British education ? The answer is to be found in the war itself . Many nations have suffered more than Great Britain ; none of them has had to make such a universal right-about in thought , habits , purposes , de ? sires , down to the last detail of daily life . I can think of only one among all my acquaintances under sixty years of age in England , whose daily life has not been completely upset and rebuilt since the war . And the leaders in this revolution have been in nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of British education ? Oxford and Cam ? bridge , the public schools , the circles of the Workmen 's Educational Association . We thought that our own college system was decadent until the war revealed what fine fellows it was sending , in spite of its faults , to a business world that was , perhaps , too self-centered to appre ? ciate them . And the education that sent forth the dead tens of thousands who led the way for England is not a failure . Neither has it succeeded be ? cause of its faults . The enduring strength of British edu ? cation is its practical grasp of the prin ? ciple that nothing matters half so much as the meeting of minds . There , for all our elaborate systems and doors wide open everywhere , we have been negli ? gent . Its weakness is an exclusiveness , half purposeful , half due to exigency of circumstance . Here much is to be learned from America . I think that my first clue to the mas ? ter idea of British education came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who simply would not talk about " the cur ? riculum . " It was not that they did not know ; of course they knew ; but every question aroused some problem in teach ? ing or research that interested them far more than the typical schedule of the British school , It was weeks before I succeeded in pinning down an authority to a statement of just what the British school did teach , and then I got it in printed form , and found that , when all had been said , what was taught de ? pended chiefly upon what the school wanted ? a scandalous situation , as any well-regulated American would testify . In Oxford , in Cambridge , in Manchester and Edinburgh , in the London schools , in the training-camps , in the commenc ? ing khaki university behind the lines , the same thing always happened . I came away from each investigation with a sense of having talked vitally on educa ? tion and with few " facts " to put into my notes . It was all humorously differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vention I have left in America with a bag leaking syllabi and prospectuses all the way home . There is a close connection , of course , betweenthis British planlessness and both the lack of theoretical science so evident in England at the beginning of the war and the inferiority of technical training in Great Britain . These defects must betaken care of , but there is no need to pause for criticism . The bird f am after is of swifter wing . It is the secret that explains ( for example ) why a slack col ? lege with an eighteenth-century equip ? ment could send men to the front who , not at first , but in the long run , proved themselves the equals in most respects , and the superiors in some , to the far more efficiently trained Germans . It is the explanation of why British educa ? tion , with all its faults , has really edu ? cated . The answer is simple enough , and I shall be merely reiterating in stating it , but this answer has a new significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? plains , I think , why it is hard to interest the Englishman in problems of curricu ? lum . Said the master of an Oxford col ? lege ( we were talking of one of the " young men " of the new England ) : " He was with me for a year One of those wide - reaching , generalize - it - all sort of minds . Would write ten thou ? sand words before he found the fact that ought to have come first . Never would think as I think ; but I had the facts and he did n't . I gave him an hour a day , I suppose , for a year . Do n't agree with his thinking now ; but it was worth while . " " What was he studying ? ' I asked . " Do n't remember , exactly ; history , economics , I suppose . The important thing was his mind . That is what I was teaching . " The principle here is evident . It is the living together of mature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tact or by meeting of minds ; and it is worth while . Such teaching is expen ? sive ; but is expense the first considera ? tion if it results not in subjects partly mastered , but the power to master them completely in wisdom as well as knowl edge ? Is any education too expensive that sinks deep ? " Whatever we can not pay For is too expensive , " the American taxpayer an ? swers , " and we can not pay enough first-rate minds to give personally an hour a dayto all who seek education . " Perhaps not , and perhaps , with adjust ? ment to existing conditions , we can well afford it . Let that point wait ; it is the principle that is important , and this I found alive throughout the British schools and universities , and in the army , whence it is spreading to ours . It would be a curious by-product of the war if it should come to us through education indemobilization , and so home by the military route . I found it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason ) was secondary to what the masters judged was the total mind of the boy . I found it in grammar-schools , where the discussion was always of what the youngster seemed to he good for in actual life , not what he had learned . I heard of it operating in the internment camp at Ruhleben , where every man who knew became the center of a little tutorial group , each member of which afterward formed other groups , until education of that vital kind which comes from self-help under criticism and direc ? tion spread throughout the curious as ? semblage of all kinds and classes impris ? oned together because they were Britons . Can such personal education be adapted to the vast and heterogeneous needs of a democracy ? A group of Fel ? lows , picked men as they are nowadays , living in monastic seclusion in a gray-walled Cambridge garden , with a chosen race of boys exposed , like volunteers in a medical experiment , to culture and intellectual honesty and the desire to know until the infection takes ? such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isms , is sure to produce some remarkable results . But there will be no monastic seclusion for our millions in America ; no period of undisturbed incubation , no high proportion of trained to untrained minds . Is the thing possible or desirable in a democracy ? 1 should not have written an article in war-time on a subject like this if I did not believe that there was the best kind of evidence , of the highest importance for Great Britain , and potentially im ? portant for us , that you can practically educate by the meeting of minds in a democracy . Nothing better proves the vitality of the English idea of how to educate than its reaching out to meet the new conditions of life that , beginning a decade or more ago , are now rushing throughout the British world . I mean the W. E. A. , the Workmen 's Educa national Association , the training-school whence many of the most alert political and economic thinkers in England have sprung or been inspired . Every one should know about the W. E. A. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Books have been written upon it as a successful educa ? tional experiment ; its doctrines and practice have been preached here as well as all over the British Empire ; and those familiar with the currents of British thought know that , in its effects , it is a political force of the first magnitude . Nevertheless , it will bear brief explain ? ing . The W. E. A. is only fifteen years old . I know its founder , a workman , and its first tutors , still youngish men . It began at Oxford , not , like so many " settlements , " to " uplift " the lower classes , but definitely and consciously as a means of bringing together workmen who wanted to understand the eco ? nomic system of which they were a part , and students of economics and sociology who , while teaching the theory of their subjects , could learn the practice from the men and women they taught . Thus the W. E. A. is distinctly a meeting of minds , designed to train the less skilled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women ( never larger than thirty-two ) forms among workers , let us say , in the pottery indus ? tries of the " Five Towns " district . They clinose a course , which will probably be ? gin with a history of industrial condi tions , as of closest kin to their interests , but may lead through politics , science , history , literature , wherever they want to go , provided that it consists of such related subjects as a university might require . The course is three years as a minimum , with an opportunity to spend a week in Oxford or Cambridge or some other university summer school after ? ward , and they must elect the course for three years . There are twenty-four meetings during the term ; two hours each of them , an hour roughly for the tutor 's disquisitions , one hour for free discussion . The tutor comes from the university , the cost is borne by the uni ? versity , by labor organizations , and by the board of education . Books are used freely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no examinations , no work for a certificate or direct means of betterment , because no competition is desired ; but twelve essays must be writ ? ten a year . Where the subject is taken up , how it is developed , what questions are discussed ? these are not to be found in syllabi , but depend upon the intelli ? gence , the previous training , the present interests of the group and the tutor . It is not forced-draught education , but rather the meeting of minds between men and women desiring to increase their power of criticizing life and an in ? structor who , like an earlierEnglishman , would gladly learn and gladly teach . The emphasis is all upon the personal relation . And this simple system has spread widely over Great Britain and Ireland , has captivated " materialistic Australia , " and , through the adoption of its principles in much army teaching , is becoming familiar to the whole em ? pire . The sanity , the vigor , and , most important of all , the political vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broadest and soundest defenders of labor interests in the world , come , most of all , I think , from the ex ? ample of the W. E. A. I have tried to make clear that this is no random philanthropic experiment , but rather a sprouting into new life of a national instinct . This is what makes it worth writing about for readers who have only a general interest in educa ? tion . Essentially , the W. E. A. pu'ts mature but untrained minds into touch with men who care immensely for the intellectual welfare of the community . I saw the same ' principle working in a great factory in the north of England , whose managers had run ahead of the continuation schools proposed by the Fisher bill , and put in schools of their own where working boys and girls were given from three to six hours a week un ? der men and women whose sole interest was in their developing bodies and minds . The very principle of the Fisher bill was not to teach this or that , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the care of those who might wish to develop , not to ex ? ploit , them . I heard a master of ap ? prentices in an old skilled trade that had inherited the best medieval traditions of boy workers say one night : " The onlyway to save England after this war is to have more education for the boys and girls . I do n't care what they teach them , though I should prefer to have it general as well as technical ; the impor ? tant thing is that it should be some ? body 's business to look after their minds . " I believe that this sound instinct for true education has been the chief cause of British initiative and political and intellectual strength in the century past , and I further believe that it explains the surprising strength of Great Britain when , in sudden catastrophe , she was thrown from peace into deadly conflict with a nation far more completely trained than herself . The flat truth is that the German was better educated , in so far as education means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower and middle grade of society ; ? and yet less excellently edu- cated in the things that make for wis ? dom . The British deficiencies ? lack of science , lack of system , lack of a breadth of opportunity ? we have al ? ready avoided . They may be left for home correction , but we must not disre ? gard , as of local concern only , the secret that has made England successful in spite of her faults . War makes men dishonest as regards the future , for the rush of passions tow ? ard desire for victory drowns judgment and common sense . But the intense reality of wa r-time makes us very honest about our past . What American , looking back from 1918 , does not find his estimate of school or college educa ? tion vastly altered ? Experiences he had supposed were not education at all ? adventures , casital reading , personal re ? lationships ? have clearly taught him much . Whole sets of formal training appear as lost motion utterly . Habits formed in work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregu ? larly from the world of knowledge that took root somehow ? these remain . Does he doubt that his best education was self-acquired ? Does he doubt that a steadying hand , a pointing finger , an atmosphere where learning seemed worth while , were the best things that came to him ( if he got them ) from teach ? ing in school and college ? What sheer brain prostitution was most of his " tu ? toring " for examinations ! What un ? necessary boredom the recording of " facts " from innumerable lectures heard and not heeded ! What unspeakable benefit the few " inspirations " from minds greater and sweeter than his , when the spark shot and hit and smol ? dered and is still burning ! Why can we not now be honest about education in America ? Why can we not say that it is too arid , too impersonal , that it is successful only because life in America has itself ' been an education ? Are we too proud to borrow this British secret from a nation that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are we too proud to borrow for our many what has been given to their chosen ones with a success that our best curricula have seldom experienced ? Our technical , , scientific education in ad ? vanced work has been highly individual , and the results are where all can see them . Why is it that in the things of the mind ? in his criticism of life , in his sense of values , in his knowledge of how to use his vital energy the American is still so crude , so youthful in comparison with Englishmen less vigorous and less potential ? It is because his " liberal " education has blown over him in airy precepts , has been fed to him in capsules swallowed but never digested , has come to him wrapped in words instead of active personality . And the difficulties in the way , the ex ? pense , the magnitude of the problem ! The energy absorbed by a week of war would carry an intellectual revolution . A few slight changes in the practice of our American colleges as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important alter ? nations with little difficulty . The ratio of teachers to students was in good insti ? tutions of collegiate grade roughly as one to ten . If each teacher were given a personal responsibility for the minds of , say , ten men , exercised perhaps only in the briefest of weekly meetings , the in ? crease in toil , where there was any , would be balanced by the inspiration of friendly contact , increase in expense there would be little or none . Now we choose " division officers " and ask them to he personally responsible for the in ? tellectual consciences of sixty-odd stu ? dents ; the rest of the faculty need only teach . S ? uch a change would be only a beginning , just a little fresh blood pump ? ing through old arteries ? but we should soon go farther . Already we are beginning one of the greatest of all educational experiments ? an army of youths trained for war who must be prepared for peace while in demobilization . Although the cir ? cumstances are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the W , E. A. Fairly mature minds , of every degree of previous training , are in instances instances to be given quickly and in the midst of distractions what they vitally need to make life more livable . Shall we hand them in lectures the gen ? eral knowledge they require in addition to their ration of technical instruction ; or by personal contact with those who know shall they be made to crave and get knowledge ? The two methods are different ; and the second , though hard , is practicable , and in the long run the cheaper . Very soon now and in a wrecked world we shall fully realize how precious is youth , how essential that not one drop of its energies shall he wasted . We shall direct our courses of study toward the needs of the future , and direct them easily and well , for there we have prac ? tice . But shall we place the emphasis upon courses and systematized depart ? ments of learning or upon the shaping of minds to crave facts and get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different , and without the second the first alone will never meet the emer ? gency . Since the days of Plato men have been saying in every language and en ? vironment : " It was , after all , one or two men who educated me . They set me thinking . " How far in America will we act upon that principle ? How far have we acted upon it ? Consider the text- book , its multitude and its aridity , if you wish an answer . We Americans , however , also have our national instinct in education . It is a commonplace to say that from the founding of the nation we have tried to give equal opportunities to all to be educated . We know what was proposed ; better , perhaps , than what has been accomplished . English observers , now that England is on the way to sudden social democracy i see it most clearly , and are eager to learn of us . Our intense systematization , our standardization of teachers and teaching and subjects and text-books ? that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal instruction ? all this is just a means of realizing our national instinct for democratic education . No other nation in the world , not even highly trained Germany , has tried to open all kinds of education to every ? body ; and if we have made tremendous errors we have also invaluable experi ? ence . England has as much to learn from our high-school system as we from her theory of how to teach . The cry there is , Be practical and con ? sider the taxpayer . And the reply in England is that the taxpayer deserves , first of all , education for his money , and that he must therefore get access to vital education . The cry in America is the same , and the answer should not be different . But unless we learn from one another , both sets of taxpayers , as in the past , will be cheated . A hundred pounds for a child 's education is cheap if you get results ; is dear if the factory takes the child prematurely and exploits him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is little to spend upon a child 's education , if he gets educated . Four years ago an essay like this should have been a treatise on education , or remained unwritten . It should have surveyed at length our schools and col ? leges and those of the English , explaining the methods , criticizing them , pointing out how , by marked changes in our pur- pose and slight ones in our practice in teaching , we could vastly increase our results , pointing out that by more sys ? tem and a restricted standardization the British could extend their benefits to a whole population . The Workmen 's Educational Association , which has ac ? complished both these ends , would have provided merely an adequate introduction . It is different now . In the midst of war we could make noelaborate plans ; but with everything on the move about us we are in the very mood for seizing new principles . Many , for example , have felt for years that a period of productive work in the world should precede the ending of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance . Now the war has flung our boys , many of them half-educated , into the most intense of practical experi ? ences , and we begin to see how youthful service to the state , continued after the war , may be a real aid to education . One hopes that the service may not be exclu ? sively military , that William James 's fine dream , " A Moral Substitute for War , " will find unexpected realization . Two years ago in America we were criticizing the dogmatic character of most of our educating , and wondering helplessly how we could teach the teach ? ers of boys and girls that learning came by working out problems , not by hearing the answers . Then with a sweep our youths were flung into the highly experi ? mental business of war , where all ad ? vance , from the shooting of a gun to food control , was learned only by experimental practice . Will the boy of eighteen who has been through a training-camp and the rough life of the tren ches , wh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities ? will he ever again take sec ? ond-hand statements of theory in history or economics or literature , and think he is being educated ? The answer may be , yes ? if we let him . But will we let him ? For we also have learned by experience , have been grasping new principles . The truth is that everybody is being re-educated now , except those petrified beings who are beyond alteration ; and , where every one is learning , there is no opportunity for one age to impose upon another its sets of crystallized ideas that must be accepted whole or evaded . Education is vital again because it has become a universal experience . I spent a day last spring in the Bull Dog Club on Edgware Road in London , an institution that began as a home for soldiers on leave with nowhere to go , and then extended its care to discharged men whose old careers were lost to them and who needed guidance and help . Everywhere in England one hears the questions : What are the half-educated cighteen-year-olders todo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or profession ? What are the sometime clerks to become after two or three years in the honorable but impermanent pro ? fession of being an officer ? Will they go back ? What are the gentleman rankers to do , impaired in health , without either profession or money , and thrown upon the unsettled labor-market of England after the war ? I was interested , natu ? rally , in an opportunity to get advance information from a club where every day such cases were already being handled . The man with a trade is easily placed , they told me . The men without a trade and lacking in especial intellectual abil ? ity are a grave problem . Of the men with brains and intellectual training , many of them say that they want to go in for teaching . It surprised me then , hut not after I had been to the front and lived longer in France and England . It was minds these men wanted to teach , because their own had been altered . War , as Thu ? cydides said , educates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edu ? cated to understand what a man must know about life . If I were searching for teachers I should choose them in prefer ? ence to others with more knowledge but a less illuminating experience .
