txt Joseph Cassidy , Democratic boss of Queens County and once Borough President , was convicted last night of selling a nomination for the Supreme Court in 1911 to ex-Congressman William Willett . Willett , a week ago , was convicted of buying it . With Cassidy and charged with the same offense was convicted Louis T. Walter , Jr. , a contractor of Far Rockaway , who was for years Cassidy 's chief lieutenant in Queens . In his charge to the jury , Justice Jaycox , in the Supremo ' Court , Brooklyn , described the crime as " an assault upon the very sanctuary of justice . " The case had been on trial just six days when Justice Jaycox finished his charge to the jury at 9:58 o'clock last night . Forty-seven minutes later , at 10:45 o'clock , Stephen S. Powell , the foreman , sent word that the jury had agreed . It was commented upon that the jury in the Willett case took just forty minutes to find that man guilty . The verdict was a terrible shock to Cassidy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a verdict of not guilty would be returned . The maximum penalty is two years ' imprisonment or a fine of $.8,000 , or both . Cassidy and Walter , with their lawyers , Robert H. Elder and Robert M. Moore , were in the law library of the Kings County Court House , when a court attendant informed them at 10:50 o'clock that the jury had agreed . Cassidy turned ashen pale at the news . The quickness with which the jury had reached a verdict he realized could mean but one thing , and that was guilty . Ho was trembling like a leaf as he entered the courtroom a few minutes later . The confident , alMost-saucy , look that ' had never left his face during the long days of the trial was gone . His eyes seemed to have sunk back into his head , and his usually ruddy and very fat cheeks were the color of death . The room was crowded with men , and most of them were followers and henchmen of Cassidy 's from Queens . They murmured words of encouragement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisles to the ' counsel table . Mr. Elder tried to look hopeful , and said something to the wretched man . but it was no use , for Cassidy knew his fate . As for Walter , whose powerful frame towered above Cassidy 's , he struggled to appear indifferent . His face was blood red and there were big punts under his eyes . As he sank back into his seat he clutched the arms of his chair in the effort to maintain his selfcontrol . He even turned his face to the crowd and smiled  --  but it was a halfhearted sickly effort . When the jury entered the room Cassidy turned In his chair and looked at the jurors . He began with Powell , the Foreman , and he looked long and hard at the men whom he believed had adjudged him guilty . His face was a study as he looked at those jurors . As soon as Justice Jaycox had taken his seat Clerk Washburn called the roll ? of the jury , and then asked : " What is your verdict ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words that were tr. follow . The courtroom was still . " Guilty , " answered Foreman Powell . and then he added quickly : " Both guilty . " District Attorney Cropsey. very solemn and appearing not in the least elated as a result of his great legal victory , immediately rose and asked Clerk Washburn to take the pedigres of the men . Cassidy Gives MK Pedigree . " Joseph Cassidy. " said Washburn . looking at the curly haired ex-leader of Queens , " stand up , please . " That was Cassidy 's hardest ordeal . SHhamblingly he made his pay past the reporters ' table to the rail behind which the Clerk of the Court was seated , ready to write the answers that he was to give . " What is your name ? " asited Washburn . ' " Joseph Cassidy , " the convicted man . answered in a voice that was just a bit husky .

Cassidy and Walter will be sentenced to-morow morning at 10 o'clocq . ' Willett will be sentenced at the same hour this morning . Sympathizers Were Many . Mr. Elder and Mr. Moore gave notice that prior to the sentencing of Cassidy and Walter they would make the usual /Motions for the setting aside of the verdict , for a new trial , or perhaps a Certificate of reasonable doubt . Justice Jaycox thanked the jurors and Mr. Cronsov nodded his approval . As soon as the jrors were out of the room and Justice Jaycox had disappeared into his chambers , the friends of Cassidy and Walter swarmed up to the table beside which the depected men were still seated , There were old men and young men , well dressed . poorly clad , and dissipated looking men , and men who looked to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get close to the prisoners to extend sympathy and utter words of encouragement . Cassidy tried to return smile for Emile , and he grasped each hand that was extended . His emotion was too great . however , and for the first time in his life he found it difficult to talk . " it 's a shame . Joe . " said one young fellow , as he grasped the fat hand of the political boss . " Do n't lose your nerve , old man : you 'll win out yet and we 'll make you leader again . " another man said as he patted Cassidy on the shoulder . " No ; I will never I , that a min . " Cassidy murmured hack in a Irrok ? Voice . Walter was not forgotten .

Justice Jaycox 's charge lasted a little more than an hour . It was a very carefully prepared and unbiased charge , in which the Justice time and again impressed upon the jurors to render a verdict only in accordance with the evidence and nothing else . " This case " said Justice Jaycox , ' is s'q111M:ZII1E2EEIEOIL-Sf ' an important one . important to the defendants who may he impressed for two years or fined $ : .4-1416 or both . In the discretion of the Judge . The charge against these men involves an assault upon the very sanctuary of justice itelf. is absolutely essential to the administration of justice that our Judges shall be men of the highest character and the pure , t motives . any any man or men who attempt to assault that sanctuary should he severely punished .

Mr More demurred anti the Justice . rising in his chair , banged the bench with his gavel and told him a second time to sit down Mr. Moore did so . " Counsel for the accused have a perfect Meht to make objections in the protection of their clients . " Mr. Cropsey said after one of the Moore objections . Mr. Moore Rebuked . " It seems not . " Moore said aloud , without rising from his seat . " What is that ? " Justice Jaycox said . Mr. Moore did not reply . " I wish to state that I shall require you to answer for that remark at the proper time , " Justice Jaycox said to Mr. Moore .

The charge upon which Cassidy and Walter were convicted is violation of Subdivision 3 of Section 75 of the Penal Code , which is entitled " Corrupt Ise of Position or Authority .

Cassidy on the Stand . When court convened yesterday morning Cassidy was recalled to the stand and District Attorney Cropsey resumed the cross-examination . On Saturday Cassidy had taken the stand very confident , but yesterday his attitude was that of a man who seemed to have come to a realization that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first question referred to the attitude of a number of Willett 's personal friends in the primary campaign of the Summer of 1911 . " In those primaries , Mr. Cropsey asked , " is it not true that outwardly , at least , Cronin , Hicks , and Cragen , all of whom were friends of William Willett , were opposed to you ? " ' Yes , that is about the way it was , " Cassidy answered . " But were those men really opposed to you ? " asked Mr. Cropsey . " Yes , openly , they were . hut on the quiet they were with me . " Cassidy relined after a pause . " They were riends of Willett. but Harvey was the real leader of the opposition and Gresser was with him . On the surface they were opposed to me , but there was an understanding that they were not to make a real fight against me . You see , in the primaries we do n't campaign on the stump , nor do we use the advertising columns of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have workers In each district , and in the primaries of the year referred to I had from fifteen to twenty men in each district whose duty it was to visit the enrolled voters and urge them personally to come out for the primary fight . Now , the men mentioned had a lot of friends in the opposition . and they were in a position to go to those men , and so they lay low . so to speak , so far as active opposition to me was concerned . That was a hot fight . you must remember , and forces opposed to us were thrown off their guard by Cronin , Hicks and Cragen. and we won . We lost the College Point district , and that may have been due to a similar understanding that Harvey 's people had with supposed supporters of mine , but who , as a matter of fact , were against me . ' Boss Named All Candidates . Cassidy was then asked about ' Willett 's nomination for Congress and he recalled that when Townsend Scudder resigned from Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated to succeed him , but had declined to make the race . It was then that Willett was persuaded to run . the campaign being the one in which Cassidy said de donated $1,000 to VVillett 's campaign fund . Did you name Humphrey for County Judge the first time ? ' Mr. Cropsey asked , his purpose being to prove that Cassidy prior to the Willett scandal . had the power to nominate any man he wanted to , for any office in Queens County so far as the Democratic Party was concerned . ? ? i did Cassidy answered . " And did you not name Daniel Noble for Surrogate ? " " Yes , 1 believe that I had a good deal to do with it . " " As a matter of fact . Mr. Cassidy. did n't the delegates always take your views in such matters and nominate the candidates you favored ? " " Not always , but practically always . " " And generally you waited until the day of the convention before you announced what you wished don . In such matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did. - " Then when the judicial convention of Octoitter , tall , was held you ha d no doubt but that the delegates would take Willet when they found that you were for him ' ! " " No . I did not have much doubt about it . Why , I recall when one Judge was nominated in a convention where , as a matter of fact , every delegate was against hint . That was Justice Scudder . " " Did you take part in that convention ? " " No , I did not . I had been beaten at the primaries , and so I was out of it . " " Was tic. : that the year that a citizens ' committee named six or seven candidates for the Supreme bench and Justice Scudder wits of the number ? " Yes . t hat is t he way they went about it-to timid tit he sent'ment . " Cassidy admitted , rather sheepishly . " Now . when did you make up your mind to nominate Willett ? " " I could n't say exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . with a show of defiance . " Noble had spoken to you about the nomination . I believe you have stated ? " " Yes , that is true . " " Why , then , did n't you tell Hendrickson , Surrogate Noble 's Chief Clerk , when you saw Hendrickson the morning of the convention , that you had decided to nominate Willett ? " " Because It was not necessary , and , besides , that was not the way such things are usually done . " Primary Funds " Personal . " This ended the cross examination and Mr. Elder took Cassidy in hand for a brief redirect examination . " You have never made any accounting for funds placed in your hands fur use in the primaries , have you ? " Mr. Elder asked . ? ? No . I have not. - " Why ? " " Baca use no accounting was ever required in a primary contest.A primary . s a personal fight and the contributions to it are personal to the man who is making the fight for the leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fight is no longer personal but a party matter . " " Did . Maurice E. Connolly , now President of the itorough of Queens . ever say anything to you about a nomination tor the Supreme Court ? " " Yes , I saw him on the first Sunday in October , 11111 , and he told me that he aid not wish to be Borough President and added that he preferred a nomination for the Supreme bench . " Cassidy exhibited a chock for S:00 which he said had been found in his ; Japers since the court adjourned last Saturday . I would like . " said Cassidy , " to exlain to the court the deposit of Sl , Sou in my bank account on Oct. ti , about which I have been asked . on that day I was asked to pay ** on a 10 of mine for ** which was due on Oct. 17 . The : i'ZiOn check was de . ositeil to pay the interest on the note , anti the : 41 , ptut was the payment on the note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rested so far as Cassaly was concerned and Mr. Moore made a similar announcement In behalf of Waller who unlike Cassidy refused to take the stand in his own defense . Justice Jaycox then announced that each of the lawyers for the defense would be allowed two hours to sum up and that Mr. Cropsey would he allowed tour hours to close the case for the State . Mr Moore summed up for Walter first . He referred to the years of friendship between Walter and Willett and he de , lared that it was preposterous to think of Walter as acting as a go-bet wre n between Willet , his intimate freine for thirty years . and Cassidy , who. like W Met , was also an intimate friend 4 , f more than twenty-five years ' standing . Ile called attention toWalter 's standing in Far Rockaway , and argued that no evidence whatever had been produced to connect Walter ? . th any crime In connection with the nomination of William Willett for the Supreme Court . Mr. Eider , who followed Moore , referred to Cassidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found success in the arena of practical politics . lie ridiculed the State 's evidence against Cassidy , and said that not one scintilla of proof had been produced that tended to even indicate that Cassidy had ever been ' guilty of any illegal act . " If Cassidy had gotten the money , and he did not , " said Elder . " he certainly is too shrewed and practical a man to have left a record of it as they cla.m he has done in the matter of these bank deposits . And Cassidy is a business man , a man of large affairs , and certainly he would be expected to nave bank accounts , and that lie would deposit money and withdraw money from those banks just as any other business : Wan would under like conditions . " As a matter of fact , Elder added . it was McCooey and not Cassidy who made the Nomination of Willett possible , for it was McCooey , he pointed out , who consented that one of the three candidates should be from Queens County . Bigger Than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 4:15 P. M. " This case . " he said , " is the most important that has occurred in Kings County certainly within the last twenty years . Even the trials of was not so important as is this one , for in the case there was not involved a tainted or a corrupt judiciary . There can he but one case more serious than is this one , and that is to attempt the bribery of a Judge or a jut or or the acceptance of a bribe by a Judge or a juror . " Mr. Cropsey then reviewed the evidence point by point from the moment that Willett borrowed the $5,000 from his friend Merrill in September . 1911. until the convention nominated him , at Cassidy 's order , on Oct. 6 following .
