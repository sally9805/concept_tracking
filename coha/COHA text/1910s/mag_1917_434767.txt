Let ' us from our own experience answer the question , What is a nat ion ? A nation , in the sense of the political and economic union of a people , is that aspect which a whole population assumes when organized for a mechanical purpose . Society as such has no ulterior purpose . It is an end in itself . It is a spontaneous self-expression of man as a social being . It is a natural regulation of human relationships , enabling men to develop ideals of life in cooperation with one another . It has also a political side , but this is only for a special purpose . It is for self-preservation . It is merely the side of power , not of human ideals . And in the early days it had its separate place in society , restricted to the professionals . But when , with the help of science and the perfecting of organization , this power begins to grow and brings in harvests of wealth , then it crosses its boundaries with amazing rapidity . For then it goads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequent mutual jealousy , and by the fear of each other 's growth into powerfulness . The time comes when it can stop no longer , for competition grows keener , organization grows vaster , and selfishness attains supremacy . TradVOL. tie-L ' 0 . 3 Mg upon the greed and fear of man , it occupies more and more space in society , and eventually becomes its ruling force . It is just possible that you have lost through habit the consciousness that the living bonds of society are breaking up , tind giving Place to merely mechanWal organization . But you see signs of it everywhere . It is owing to this that war has been declared between man and woman , because the natural thread is snapping which holds them together in harmony ; because man is driven to professionalism , producing wealth for himself and others , continually turning the wheel of power for his own sake or for the sake of t he universal officialdom , leaving woman alone to wither and to die or to fight her own battle unaided . And thus where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men and women about their mutual relation is changing and becoming the psychology of the primitive fighting elements rather than of humanity seeking its completeness through the union based upon mutual self-surrender . For the elements which have lost their living bond of reality have lost the meaning of their existence . They , like gaseous particles forced into a too narrow space , come in continual conflict with each other till they burst the very arrangement which holds them in bondage . Then look at those who call themselves anarchists , who resent the imposition of power , in any form whatever , upon the individual . The only reason for this is that power has become too abstract ? it is a scientific product made in the political laboratory of the nation , through the dissolution of the personal humanity . And what is the meaning of these strikes in the economic world , which , like the prickly shrubs in a barren soil , shoot up with renewed vigor each time they are cut down ? What , but that the wealth-producing mechanism is incessantly growing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society , while the full reality of man is more and more crushed under its weight ? This state of things inevitably gives rise to eternal feuds among the elements freed from the wholeness and wholesomeness of human ideals , and interminable economic war is waged between capital and labor . For greed of wealth and power can never have a limit , and compromise of self-interest can never attain the final spirit of reconciliation . They must go on breeding jealousy and suspicion to the end ? the end which comes only through some sudden catastrophe or a spiritual rebirth . When this organization of politics and commerce , whose other name is the nation , becomes all-powerful at the cost of the harmony of the higher social life , then it is an evil day for humanity . When a father becomes a gambler and his obligations to his family take the secondary place in his mind , then he is no longer a man , but an auto , - maton led by the power of greed .

It is not unusual that even through this apparatus the moral nature of man tries to assert itself ; but the whole series of ropes and pulleys creaks and cries , the forces of the human heart become entangled among the forces of the human automaton , and only with difficulty can the moral purpose transmit itself into some tortured shape of result . This abstract being , the nation , is ruling India . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised as entirely made and packed without being touched by hand . This description applies to the governing of India , which is as little touched by the human hand as possible . The governors need not know our language , need not come , into personal touch with us except as officials ; they can aid or hinder our aspirations from a disdainful distance ; they can lead us on a certain path of policy and then pull us back again with the manipulation of office red tape ; the newspapers of England , in whose columns London street accidents are recorded with some decency of pathos , need take but the scantiest notice of calamities happening in India over areas of land sometimes larger than the British Isles . But we , who are governed , arc riot a mere abstraction . We , on our side , arc individuals with living sensibilities . NATIONALISM IN THE WEST ' 29-1 .

Such wholesale and universal acts of fearful responsibility man can never perform with such a degree of system-at is unawareness , where he is an individual human being . These become possible only where the man is represented by an octopus of abstractions , sending out its wriggling arms in all directions of space , and fixing its innumerable suckers even into the faraway future . In this reign of the nation , the goVerned are pursued by sus-picions ; , and these are the suspicions of a tremendous mass of organized brain and muscle . Punishments are meted out , leaving a trail of miseries across a large bleeding tract of the human heart ; but these punishments are dealt by a mere abstract force , in which a whole population of a distant country has lost its human personality . I do not intend , however , to discuss the question as it affects my own country , but as it affects the future of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the nation ? the nation which is the organized self-interest of a wholepeople , where it is the leaSt human and the least spiritual ? is my theme . Our only intimate experience of the nation is with the British nation , and so far as the government by the nation goes there are reasons to believe that it is one of the best : Then again we have to considpr that the West is necessary to the East . We are complementary to each other because of our different outlooks upon life which have given us different aspects of truth . Therefore if it be true that the spirit of the West has come upon our fields in the guise of a storm , it is all the same scattering living seeds that are immortal . And when in lachawe shaill.mableto ... assimilate ill-our life whatis permanentm-Western weshallladatho posit km to bring abouta reconciliation of these tw Q great worlds .

At last now has come the turn of t he English to become t rue to this history and bring to iL t he tribute of their life ; and we have neither the right nor the power to exclude t his people from the building of the destiny of India . Therefore what I say about the nation has more to do with t he history of Man than specially with that of India . This history has come to a stage when the moral man , the complete man , is more and more giving way , almost without knowing it , to make room for the political and the commercial man , the man of the limited purpose . This , aided by the wonderful progress in science , is assuming gigantic proportion and power , causing the upset of man 's moral balance , obscuring his human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron grip we have felt at the root of our life , and for the sake of humanity we must stand - up and give warning to all , that this natioualism is a cruel . cpIdenlic of cull , that issweepingaver Iteiunva world orld of the present age , eating into as . moral vitaji4y . I have a deep love and a great respect for the British race as human beings . It has produced great-hearted men , thinkers of great thoughts , doers of great deeds . It has given rise to a great literature . I know that these people love justice and freedom , and hate lies . They are clean in their minds , frank in their manners , true in their friendships ; in their behavior they are honest and reliable . The personal experience which I have had of their literary men has roused my admiration , not merely for their power of thought or expression , but for their chivalrous , humanity .

This government by the nation is neither British nor anything'e6e ; it is an applied scienee , And therefore more or less similar in its principles wherever it is used ; It is like a 4draulie - . press , whose pressure is impersonal and On that account completely effectivel The amount of its power may vary in , different engines . Some may even be driven by hand , thus leaving a margin of comfortable looseness in their tension ; but in spirit and in method their differences are small . Our government might have been Dutch , or French , or Portuguese , and its essential features would have retnained much the same as they are now . Only perhaps , in some eases , the organization might not have been so densely perfect , and , therefore , some shreds of the human might still have been clinging to the wreck , allowing us to deal with something which resembles our own throbbing heart . Before the nation came to rule over us we had other governments which were foreign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the machine in them . But the difference between them and government by the nation is like the difference between the hand-loom and the power-loom . In the products of the hand-loom the magic of man 's living fingers finds its expression , and its hum harmonizes with the music of life . But the power-loom is relentlessly lifeless and accurate and monotonous in its production . We must admit that during the personal government of the former days there were instances of tyranny , injustice , and extortion . They caused sufferings and unrest from which we are glad to be rescued . The protection of law is not only a boon , but it is a valuable lesson to us . It is teaching us the discipline which is necessary for the stability of civilization and continuity of progress . We are realizing through it that there is a universal standard of just ice to which all men , irrespective of their caste and color , have their equal claim . This reign of law in our present government in India has established order in this vast land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to come in closer touch with one another and cultivate a communion of aspiration . But this desire for a common bond of comradeship among the different races of India has been the work of the spirit of the West , not that of the nation of the West . Wherever in Asia the people , have received the true lesson of the West , it is in spite of the Western nation . Only because Japan had been able to resist the dominance of this Western nation could she acquire the benefit of the Western civilization in fullest measure . Though China has been poisoned at the very spring of her moral and physical life by this nation , her struggle to receive the best lessons of the West may yet be successful if not hindered by the nation . It was only the other clay that Persia woke up from her age-long sleep at the call of the West , to be instantly trampled into stillness by the nation . // The same phenomenon prevails in this country also , where the people are hospitable but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern guest feel humiliated to stand before you as a member of the humanity of his own motherland . In India we are suffering from this conflict between the spirit of the West and the nation of the West . The benefit of the Western civilization is doled out to us in a miserly measure by the nation trying to regulate the degree of nutrition as near the zero point of vitality as possible . The portion of education allotted to us is so raggedly insufficient that it ought to outrage the sense of decency of Western humanity . We have seen in these countries how the people are encouraged and trained and given every facility to fit themselves for the great movements of commerce and industry spreading over the world , while in India the only assistance we get is merely to be jeered at by the nation for lagging behind . While depriving us of our opportunities and reducing our education to a minimum required for conducting a foreign government , England pacifies its conscience by calling us names , by sedulously giving currency to the arrogant cynicism that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never the twain shall meet . If we must believe our schoolmaster in his taunt that after nearly two centuries of his tutelage , India remains , not . re:P only unfit for self-government , but unable to display originality in her intellectual attainments , must we ascribe it to something in thsture of Western culture and our inliaknt incapacity to receive it , or to the judicious niggardliness of the nation that has taken upon itself the white man 's burden of civilizing the East ? That the Japanese people have some qualities which we lack , we may admit ; but that our intellect is naturally unproductive compared to theirs we can not accept , even from them whom it is dangerous for us to cop trad ict. " - The truth is that the spirit of con filet and conquest is at the origin and in the centre of the Western nationalisms ; its basis is not social coiiperat ion . It has evolved a perfect organization of  --  power , but not spiritual idealism . It is like the pack of predatory creatures that must have its victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see its hunting grounds converted into cultivated fields . In fact , these nations are fighting among themselves for the extension of their victims and their reserve forests . Therefore the Western nation acts like a dam to check the free flow of the Western civilization into the country of the no-nation . And because this civilization is the civilization of power , therefore it is exclusive , is naturally unwilling to open its sources of power to those whom it has selected for its purposes of exploitation . ' But , all the same , moral law is the law of humanity , and the exclusive civilization which thrives upon others who are barred from its benefit carries its own death-sentence in its moral limitations . tThe slavery to which it gives rise unconsciously drains its own love of freedom dry . The helplessness with which it weighs down its world of victims exerts its force of gravitation every moment upon the power that creates it . And the greater part of the world which is being denuded of its self-sustaining life by the nation will one day become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down into the bottom of destruction . Whenever pow er removes all checks from its path , to make its career easy , it triumphantly rides into its ultimate crash of death . Its moral brake becomes slacker every day without its knowing it , and its slippery path of ease becomes its path of doom . Of all i hings in West ern civilization , those which this West ern Ind ion has given us in a most generous measure are litw atidothe.r . ' While the small feed ing-Xottle of our education is nearly dry , and sanitation sucks its own thumb in despair , t he military organization , the magisterial offices , the police , the Criminal Investigation Department , the secret spy system , attain to an abnormal girt li in their waists , occupying every inch of our country . This is to maintain order . But is not this order merely a negat ivegood. ? Is it not for giving people 's life greater opportunities for the freedom of development ? Its perfection is the perfection of an egg-shell , whose true value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nourishment , not in the convenience it oilers ? to the person at . I he breakfast table . Mere administration is unproductive ; it is not creative , not being / a living thing . It is a steam-roller , formidable in its weight and power , and having its uses , but it does not help the soil to becomelertile . When after its enormous toil it conies to offer us its boon of peace , we can but murmur under our breath that . ' Peace is good , but not more so than life , which is God 's own great boon . ' On the other hand , our former governments were woefully lacking in many of the advantages of the modern government . But because those were not , the governments by the nation , their texture was loosely woven , leaving big gaps through which our own life sent its threads and imposed its designs . I am quite sure that in those days we had things that were extremely distasteful to us . But , while the spirit of the West marches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West forges its iron chains of organization , which are the most relentless and unbreakable that have ever been manufactured in the whole history of man . When t lie humanity of India was not under the government of the Organization , the elasticity of change was great enough to encourage men of power and spirit to feel that they had their destinies in their own hands . The , hope of the unexpected was never absent , and a freer play of imagination , on the part both of the governor and of the governed , had its effect in the making of history . We were not confronted with a future which was a dead white wall of granite blocks eternally guarding against the expression and extension of our own powers , the hopelessness of which lies in the reason that these powers are becoming atrophied at their very roots by the scientific process of paralysis .

II It is the c i ual and stupendous dead press ? s inhuman on the living human which the modern world is groaning . Not merely subject races , but you who live under the delusion that you are free , are every day sacrificing your freedom and humanity to this fetich of nationalism , living in the dense poisonous atmosphere of worldwide suspicion and greed and panic . I have seen in . Japan the voluntary submission of the whole people to the trimming of their minds and clipping of their freedom by their government , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , becomes suspiciously watchful when they show signs of inclining toward the spiritual ; leading them through a narrow path , not toward what is true , but toward what is necessary for the complete welding of t hem into one uniform mass according to its own recipe .

' nen questioned as to the wisdom of his course , the newly converted fanatic of nationalism answers that ' So long as nations arc rampant in this world we have not the option freely to develop our higher humanity . We must utilize every faculty that we possess to resist the evil by assuming it ourselves in the fullest degree .

Yes , one can not but acknowledge that these facts are the facts of the world of the nation , andb the only moral of it is that all the peoples of the eatill should strain their physical , moral , and intellectual resources to the utmost to defeat oA another in the wrestling match of powerfulness . In the ancient days Sparta paid all her attention to becoming powerful ? and she did become so by crippling her humanity , and she died of the amputation . But it is no consolation to us to know that the weakening of humanity from which the present age is suffering is not limited to the subject races , and that its ravages are even more radical because insidious and voluntary in peoples who are hypnotized into believing that they are free .

I ask you what . disaster has there ever been in the history of man , in its darkest period , like this terrible disaster of the nation fixing its fangs deep into the naked flesh of the world , taking permanent precautions against its natural relaxation ? You , the people of the West , who have manufactured t his abnormality , can you imagine the desolating despair of this haunted world of suffering man possessed by the ghastly abstraction of the organizing man ? Can you put yourself into the position of the peoples , who seem to have been doomed to an eternal damnation of their own humanity , who must not only sillier continual curtailment of t heir manhood , but even raise their voices in paeans of praise for the benignity of a mechanical apparatus in its interminable parody of Providence ? Have you not seen , since the comma mencement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it has been the one goblin-dread with which the whole world has been trembling ? Wherever there is a dark corner , there is the SUSpicion of its secret malevolence ; and V 296 NATIONALISM people live in a perpetual distrust of its back where it has no eyes . Every sound of footstep , every rustle of movement in the neighborhood , sends a thrill of terror all around . And this terrotis the parent of all that is baso-in-mans-natore : . It makes one almost openly unashamed of inhumanity . Clever lies become matters of self-congratulation . Solemn , pledges - become ? aruce ? laughable for their very solemnity . The nation , with all its paraphernalia of power and prosperity , its flags and pious hymns , its blasphemous prayers in the churches , and the literary mock Htunders of its patriotic bragging , can not hide the fact that the nation is the greatest evil for the nation , that all its precautions are against , it , and any new birth of its fellow in the world is always followed in its mind by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trade on the feebleness of the rest of the world , like some insects that are bred in the paralyzed flesh of victims kept just enough alive to make them toothsome and nutritious . Therefore it is ready to send its poisonous fluid into the vitals of the other living peoples , who , not being nations , are harmless . I For this the nation has had and still has its richest pasture in Asia . Great China , rich with her ancient wisdom and social ethics , her discipline of industry and self-control , is like a whale awakening the lust of spoil in the heart of the nation . She is already carrying in her quivering flesh harpoons sent by the unerring aim of the nation , the creature of science and selfishness . Her pitiful attempt to shake off her traditions of humanity , her social ideals , and spend her last exhausted resources to drill herself into modern efficiency , is thwarted at every step by the nation . It is tightening its financial ropes round her , trying to drag her up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offer public thanksgiving to God for supIN THE WEST porting the one existing evil and shattering the possibility of a new one . Anj for all this the nation has been claiming the gratitude of all eternity for its exploitation , ordering its band of praise to be struck up from end to end of the world , declaring itself to be the salt of the earth , the flower of humanity , the blessing of God hurled with all his force upon the naked sculls of the world of no-nations . I know what your advice will be . You will say , form yourselves into a nation , and resist this encroachment of the nation . But is this the true advice that of a man to a man ? Why should this be a necessity ? I could well believe you , if you had said , Be more good , more just , more true in your relation to man ; control your greed ; make your life wholesome in its simplicity , and let your consciousness of t he divine in humanity be more perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the soul , but the machine , which is of the utmost value to ourselves , and that man 's salvation depends upon his dis ciplining himself into a perfection of ; the dead rhythm of wheels and counter-wheels ? that machine must be pitted against machine , and nation against nation , in an endless bull-fight of politics ? You say , these machines will come into an agreement , for their mutual protection , based upon a conspiracy of fear . But will this federation of steam-boilers supply you ' with-a soul , a soul which has her conscience and her God ? What is to happen to that larger part of the world , where fear will have no hand in restraining you ? Whatever safety they now enjoy , those countries of no-nation , from the unbridled license of forge and hammer and turn-screw , results from the mutual jealousy of the powers . But when , instead of being numerous separate machines , they become riveted into one organized gregariousness of gluttony , commercial NATIONALISM . and political , what remotest chance of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered , have loved and worshiped , have thought deeply and worked with meekness , but whose only crime has been that they have not or-ganized ? But , you say , ' That does not matter , the unfit must go te , , the wall ? they shall die , and this isVience . ' Now , for the sake of your own salvation , I say , they shall lire , and this is truth . It is extremely bold of me to say I so , but I assert that man 's world is a moral world , not because we blindly agree to believe it , but because it is so in truth which would be dangerous for us to ignore . And this moral nature of man can not be divided into convenient compartments for its preservation . You can not secure it for your home-consumption with protective tariff walls , while in foreign parts you make it enormously accommodating in its free trade of license . Has not this truth already come home to you now , when this cruel war has driven its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth is bursting into smoke and her humanity is shattered into bits on her battlefields 1 You ask in amazement what has she done to deserve this ? The answer is , that the West has been systematically ) ' petrifying her moral nature in order to , ' lay a solid foundation for her giganti abstractions of efficiency . She has al I along been starving the life of the per sonal man into that of the professional . In your mediæval age in Europe , the simple and the natural man , with all his violent passions and desires , was engaged in trying to find out a reconciliation in the conflict between the flesh and the spirit . All through the turbulent career of her vigorous youth the temporal and the spiritual forces both acted strongly upon her nature , and were moulding it into completeness of // moral personality . Europe owes all hers , greatness in humanity to that period of discipline ? the discipline of the man in his human integrity . Then came the age of intellect , of science . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , also our heart ; but our mind can be detached from the personal man and then only can it freely move in its world of thoughts . Our intellect is an ascetic who wears no clothes , takes no food , knows no sleep , has no wishes , feels no love or hatred or pity for human limitations , who only reasons unmoved through the vicissitudes of life . It burrows to the roots of things , because it has no personal concern with the thing itself . The grammarian walks straight through all poetry and goes to the root of words without obstruction , because he is not seeking reality , but law . When he finds the law , he is able to teach people how to master words . This is a power , ? the power which fulfills some special usefulness , some particular need of man . 298 NATIONALISM and more rapidity of pace . And , for the reason that it is a detached part of man , it soon outruns the complete humanity . The moral man remains behincl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely with the law of things , which is impersonal and therefore abstract . Thus man , with his mental and material power far outgrowing his moral strength , is like an exaggerated gliaffe whose head has suddenly shot up miles away from the rest of him , making normal communication difficult to establish . This greedy head , with its huge dental organization , has been munching all the topmost foliage of the world ; but . the nourishment is too late in reaching his digestive organs , and his heart is suffering from want of blood . Of this present disharmony in man 's nature the West seems to have been blissfully unconscious . The enormity of its material success has diverted all its attention toward self-congratulation on its bulk . The optimism of its logic goes on basing the calculations of its good fortune upon the indefinite prolongation of its railway lines toward eternity . It is superficial enough to think that all to-morrows are merely to-days with the repeated additions of twenty-four hours . It has no fear of the chasm , which is opening wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptiness of his hungry humanity . Logic does not know that , under the lowest bed of endless , airata of wealth and comforts , earthquakes are being hatched to restore the balance of the moral world , and that one day the gaping gulf of spiritual vacuity will draw into its bottom the store of things that have their eternal love for the dust . Man in his fullness is not powerful , i but perfect . Therefore , to turn him into mere power , you have to curtail his soul as much as possible . When we are fully human , we can not fly at one an- IN THE WEST other 's throats ; our instincts of social life , our traditions of moral ideals stand in the way . If you want me to take to butchering human beings , you muse break up that wholeness of my humanity through some discipline which makes my will dead , my thoughts numb , my movements automatic ; and then from the dissolution of the Complex personal man will come out that abstraction , that destructive force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be easily brutal or mechanical .

( Turn a tree into a log and it will burn for you , but it will never bear living flowers and fruit This process of dehumanizing has been going on in commerce and politics . And out of the long birth-throes of mechanical energy has been born this fully developed apparatus of magnificent . power and- surprising appetite , which has been christened in the West as the nation . As I have hinted before , because of its quality of abstraction it has , with the greatest ease , gone far ahead of the complete moral man .

Because each nation has its own history of thieving and lies and broken faith , therefore there can flourish only international suspicion and jealousy , and international moral shame becomes anemic to a degree of ludicrousness . The nation 's bagpipe of righteous indignation has so often changed its tune according to the variation of time and to the altered groupings of the alliances of diplomacy , that it can be enjoyed with amusement as the variety performance of the political music hall .

Some of the newspapers praised my utterances for their poetical qualities while adding with a leer that it was the poetry of a defeated people . I felt that they were right . Japan had been taught in a modern school the lesson how to become powerful . The schooling is done and she must enjoy the fruits of her lessons . The West in the voice of her thundering cannon had said at the door of Japan , Let there be a nation ? and there was a nation .

In fact , your instinct tells you ' that the advent of another people into the arena of nationality makes another addition to the evil which contradictsall that is highest in Man , and proves by its success that unscrupulousness is the way to prosperity ? and goodness is good for the weak and God is the only remaining consolation of the dcfcated . Yes , this is the logic of the nation . And it will never heed the voice of truth and goodness . It will go on in its ring-dance of moral corruption , linking steel unto steel , and machine unto machine ; trampling under its tread all the sweet flowers of simple faith and the living ideals of man . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atsthetics that man has invented . Under the influence of its fumes the whole people can carry out its systematic programme of the most virulent self-seeking without being in the least aware of its moral perversion ? in fact , feeling dangerously resentful if it is pointed out . But can this go on indefinitely , continually producing barrenness of moral insensibility upon a large tract of our living nature ? Can it escape its nemesis forever ? Has this giant power of mechanical organization no limit in this world against which it , may shatter itself all the more completely because of its terrible strength and velocity ? Do you believe that evil can be permanently kept in check by competition with evil , and that conference of prudence can keep the devil chained in its makeshift cage of mutual agreement ? This European war of nations is the war of retribution . Man , the person , must protest for his very life against the heaping up of things where there should be the heart , and systems and policies where there should flow living human relationship . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole outraged world , Europe should fully know in her own person the terrible absurdity of the thing called the nation . The nation has thriven long upon mutilated humanity . Men , the fairest creations of God , came out of the national manufactory in huge numbers as war-making and money-making puppets , ludicrously vain of their pitiful perfection of mechanism . Human society grew more and more into a mere marionette show of politicians , soldiers , manufacturers , and bureaucrats , pulled by wire arrangements of wonderful efficiency . But the apotheosis of selfishness can never make its interminable breed of hatred and greed , fear and hypocrisy , suspicion and tyranny , an end in t hem-selves . These monsters grow into huge shapes but never into harmony . And this nation may grow on to an unimaginable corpulence , not of a living body , but of steel and steam and office buildings , till its deformity can contain no longer its ugly voluminousness till it begins to crack and gape , breat he gas and fire in gasps , and its death-rat. ties sound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation have begun . Suddenly , all IN mechanism going mad , it has begun the dance of the furies , shattering its own limbs , scattering them into the dust . It is the fifth act of the tragedy of the unreal . Those who have any faith in Man can not but . fervently hope that the tyranny of the nation will not be restored to all its former teeth and claws , to its far-reaching iron arms and its immense inner cavity , all stomach and no heart ; that man will have his new birth , in the freedom of his individuality , from the enveloping vagueness of abstraction . The veil has been raised , and in this frightful war the West has stood face to face with her own creation , to which she had offered her soul . She must know what it truly is . She had never let herself suspect what slow decay and decomposition were secretly going on in her moral nature , which often broke out in doctrines of skepticism , but still oftener and in still more dangerously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insult that she had been inflicting upon a vast part of the world . Now she must know the truth bearer home . And then there will come from her own children those who will break themselves free from the slavery of this illusion , this perversion of brotherhood // founded upon self-seeking , those who will own themselves as God 's children and as no bond-slaves of machinery , which turns souls into commodities and life into compartments , which , with its iron claws , scratches out the heart of the world and knows not what it has ( lone . And we of no-nations of the world , whose heads have bowed to the dust , will know that this dust is more sacred than the bricks which build the pride of power . For this dust is fertile of life , and of beauty and worship . We shall thank God that we were made to wait in silence through the night of despair , had to bear the insult of the proud and the strong man 's burden , yet all through it , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we blindly believe in the salvation which machinery offered to man , but we held fast to our trust in God and the truth of the human soul . And we can still cherish the hope , that , when power becomes ashamed to occupy its throne and is ready to make way for love , when the morning comes for cleansing the blood-stained steps of the nation along the highroad of humanity , we shall be called upon to bring our own vessel of sacred water ? the water of worship ? to sweeten the history of man into purity , and with its sprinkling make the trampled dust of the centuries blessed with ' fruit fulness.
