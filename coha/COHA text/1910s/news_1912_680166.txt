txt Clinching his cane fiercely in nix small but muscular hand , John E. Hayden came up to town yesterday to look for his wife . He wanted very much to have la few words with her , but still more he wanted a few words with the man who , he was sure in the bitterness of his heart , had stolen Mrs. Hayden away from him . And that was why he kept such an ominous grip upon his cane . The Haydens had been spending the summer at West End , N. J. , and two weeks or more ago Mrs. Hayden left her husband . She had not been gone long before the gossips of the resort began to drop insinuations in the husband 's ear , and the more veiled and indefinite they were the more excited he became . Finally came a suggestion that was a little less veiled . It was an anonymous letter from a woman who described herself as " one from whom Mrs. Hayden stole you away , " and who suggested that he should look for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician . The Schroeders ? Hayden began to think . He knew the Schroeders well enough . The reference could be to no other than the family of Henry A. Schroeder , a liquor dealer of 136 West Forty-second Street , New York , who , with his wife and six children , had spent the Summer with the Haydens at West End . Mrs. Schroeder and Mrs. Hayden had been great friends . So the man who , according to the stories that had reached Hayden , had been seen motoring with Mrs , Hayden so much this Summer was the Schroeders ' family physician . But who WQ , 9 the Schroeders ' family physician ? Hayden had n't the least idea . But he would find out , he said very grimly , and he set out for New York to investigate . He lost no time in hurrying uptown to the Schroeder home at 804 West 180th Street , where he found everybody away except Marian Schroeder , the eight-yearold daughter of the house . He saw he must dissemble the emotions that were struggling for expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her very tenderly . He was so sick , he said . and must see a doctor . Who , he asked her , ever so casually , was the Schroeder , familyphysiclan ? Now , perhaps six months ago Marian would have Instantly given him the name of another doctor who spent his Summers at Avon Beach , not far from West End , and who had attended the Schroeder children 's  --  ills , Summer and Winter , ever Since there had been any . But it chanced that Marian had recently broken her arm , in a brief absence of this doctor from town . and had been taken to Dr. Lynn Fulkerson . She still considered her broken arm quite the most important case in recent medical history , and the only doctor whose name occurred to her was the wonderful Dr , Fulkerson . " Who is the family doctor ? " Mr. Hayden was asking gently . And Marian answered promptly . " Dr. Fulkerson .. Oh , yes , he lives right near here , over in Audubon Avenue . It 's 165 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court Apartments or something like that . " But she had hardly finished speaking before Hayden was hurrying along 180th Street in the direction of Audubon Avenue . As he strode up to the building , he Inquired of a woman who was waiting at the curb in a motor car . " I am Mrs. Fulkerson , " she said . " The doctor is in his office . You 'll find him in there on the ground floor . " A moment later Hayden stepped into the office , closed the door behind him , faced the doctor with a long stare and then said , very quietly : " You have stolen my wife . " The words were no sooner out than he gave vent to a torrent of abuse . Dr. Fulkerson looked at him wonderingly , supposing , of course , that the man was mad . He sidled toward his telephone , but by that time Hayden was so beside himself that he raised his cane and struck the doctor with it . In a flash the two men grappled and rolled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of the ruction in the office , Mrs. Fulkerson added her voice in , screams so piercing that Sergt. Kelly of St. Nicholas Avenue came loping along the street to the rescue . She showed him into the office and the two men were still on the floor , locked in a desperate grapple . Kelly parted them , brushed them off and wrung from Hayden enough to show the excited man that he had made a mistake , In the St. Nicholas Avenue Station Hayden was locked up on a charge of disorderly conduct . They found a roll of more than $600 and a brick in his pockets , the latter having been designed for the Schroeder family physician . Hayden at first tried to have himself written down as an engineer from Toledo , but he finally confessed to being a young blade from West End . Another doctor whose name Is n't Fulkerson , said he knew Hayden , or knew of him , rather . He was employed by the Beach Club in West End , and he was not sure that he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice , but knew her only slightly , he said . These were the facts be contributed . As for Mrs. Hayden , no one seemed to be sure just where she was , although Mrs. Schroeder said that some woman had confided to her that she had thought she Ihad seen Mrs. Hayden yesterday afternoon in New York .
