ON the whole , I take it , the foreign colony in our larger cities is a little unfavorably regarded by the conventional enthusiasts for Americanization . These kindly ladies and gentlemen appear to assume that the trick of turning American is some kind of an affair of a rubber stamp and an oath of allegiance and bath-tubs . It is quite simple . You go down there , to the East Side , or Little Italy , or Little Poland , and you establish a settlement and deliver lectures and furnish them a pointed example , and behold ! the fog lifts , and before your eyes stands the new-born American . The sooner this effective performance is accomplished the better , for it is quite clear that the immigrant invariably hails from an inferior world , with queer notions about manners and the use of soap and fresh air and constitutions , and if he is long left to himself and his fellows he will settle down to this pestiferous imported life of his and never become one of us at all . He will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Into this complacent view the patent fact that Americanism is a compromise does not enter . It is quite overlooked that the adoptive American has always been and will always remain a composite American . My good friends are unwilling to see that the alien has as much to teach as to learn , that his readjustment is inevitably a matter of give and take , and that he only begins to feel at home in this new country when he has succeeded in blending his own culture and ideas and mode of life with those of the people that came here before him . Your self-complacent native takes stock of the Americanized alien and cries , delightedly , " See how America has changed him ! " But I suppose he would be greatly astonished if the immigrant were to answer , with equal truth , " Look , how I have changed America ! " Americans can nowise be persuaded that , if there is to be any readjustment , it must come from this sort of mutual reaction ; and they will simply laugh at you if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a danger , is about the only natural agency by which the process can be effected . Now , if places like the East Side are looked at askance , how very little justice could one expect toward the institution of the sweat-shop ? That , surely , is a veritable hotbed of un-Americanism . When my native friends , who never weary of the topic , ask me what influences I account as the most vital in making an American of me , and when , in a sincere endeavor to be enlightening , I answer them that it was first the college and second the sweat-shop , they smile and say that I am making paradoxes . It sounds to them very much as if I were to tell them that I learned to love liberty in Russia , or that I acquired a taste for atheism in a Sunday-school , never seeing that these apparent impossibilities have a likely air , too . They think of the sweat-shop as a place all dark and poverty-ridden and degraded . The East Side itself , I may add ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ? holds no exaggerated notions : about the sweat-shop . I remember how I was warned against it on all hands . The motherly wife of the bar- room keeper , whose employ I was leaving , was especially emphatic , and she went so far as to hold back my wages in her efforts to save me from myself . She prophesied that if I did not come to my senses at the very first sight of a shop , I would never leave it at all . " Once an operator always an operator , " she reminded me . Grocers ' assistants worked their way up to grocery-stores , tap-boys became saloon-keepers , peddlers and clerks attained to businesses of their own , but a sweat-shop hand contracted consumption or socialism and never rose to anything better . The operative 's lean years always swallowed up his fat ones . As long as I worked I might earn a little more than I was getting in the saloon ? still , she was ready to give me a raise ? but I would find saving quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my own pocket ; and when the " slack " came I would starve as thoroughly as ever I did when I was a greenhorn and before she saved my life by taking me off the streets . No doubt I had forgotten those miserable days , now that prosperity had come to me through her ; but she remembered very distinctly that first day when I gluttonously devoured potatoes like cheese dainties , and she was ashamed to let customers see me until she had found me some clothes . Then my old benefactor , Couza , dropped in ? as he often did ? and gave me a sound lecture on my unethical conduct while sipping a schooner of beer . My ingratitude to my employers , and to hirnself who had got me the job , was simply monstrous . I ought to be ashamed for even asking them to pay me after the return I was making them for their parental kindness . Was I aware that the very clothes I was wearing were theirs , and that they had tried to educate me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat-shop , he would not even discuss that . He could only think pityingly of my poor father and mother . They were decent , respectable people . If they had known that their favorite little son , on whom they were placing such high hopes , would ally himself with the outcast , the vulgar , the unambitious , the ungodly , they would never have consented to my emigration . And if they were to hear of it now ? as they were certainly going to ? it would break their hearts and they would disown me . Well , I confess that there was more than a grain of truth in these gloomy predictions . The very walk to the shop that early morning with Cousin Aby , the collar-maker , was a depressing adventure . We were a little late , and I was being properly berated , as we hurried along , for my unindustrial habits . Canal Street west of the Bowery , with its cobble-stones and clattering trucks , its bare , ugly sides , and trudging throngs of unkempt men and girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as we swung past Broadway and into Walker Street , the dreariness became almost intolerable . Here the thoroughfare was too cramped for normal traffic , and the stunted , grimy buildings seemed ludicrously undersized for their heavy tasks . All the same , the little alley was choked up with one-horse carts , its sidewalks were littered with bales of unmade clothing , a pandemonium of rasping curses from drivers and half-awake , half-grown men with aprons , staggering under immense burdens overtopped the rattling and the clanging from Broadway beyond . And then we felt our way up two creaking flights of stairs , and my cousin opened a door , and we entered . We proceeded to the right toward an elongated counter , where I was introduced to the boss ; my cousin removed his coat and collar , and disappeared into the wilderness beyond . I followed him with my eyes , and the sight did not cheer me . There were three endless tables running almost through the entire length of the loft in parallel lines . Each table was dotted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat the operatives like prisoners chained to their posts . Men and women they were , collarless , disheveled , bent into irregular curves ; palpitating , twitching , as if they were so many pistons and levers in some huge , monstrous engine . On the nearer end , around a smaller square table , stood an old white-bearded man , a young girl and a boy , marking shirts with a pencil , pulling threads , folding , " finishing . " The intermittent whirring  | of wheels , the gasping and sucking of the power-engine ( somewhere out of sight ) , the dull - murmur of voices , heightened the oppressive effect . My first lesson , administered by a frowsy little man in shirt-sleeves and no collar , with his suspenders dangling loosely at his sides , was very bewildering . I had thought that I was to learn how to make shirts ; but now my instructor informed me with a smile that that would be a rather large order . No , I was to play only a very small part in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeving , it appeared , was as much as any one man could desire , for it involved a whole chain of skilful and delicate operations . The shirts were brought to you in two bundles , which you proceeded to place , each bundle in a separate box , one box situated on the right side and the other on the left side of your machine . Then you suddenly discovered ? sometimes a bit too late ? that the bundles contained textiles of several designs and shades of color , and that you were expected to sew no green sleeves into brown shirts . The machine was of a kind that I had not even suspected to exist . It had two needles , and that implied two spools and two threadings and two bobbins . Just in front of the needles was an odd device called a " hemmer " which was designed to facilitate the work . But the whole contraption had a way of running away with you as soon as you pressed the power pedal , so that the material got twisted and bunched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , and sometimes lodged one of them in your thumb , and invariably , at the least , tangled up the thread into a hopeless mess . I sewed and ripped and sewed again for two weeks without pay , and I am afraid that the proceeds of my toil made but a poor return for the boss 's patience and instruction . But if the bargain was unprofitable for him , it was well-nigh ruinous to me , My former employers having declined ( out of pure benevolence ) to pay me the month 's wages they owed me , I had borrowed three dollars and stretched them over the period of my apprenticeship . Unfortunately , however , there was no money forthcoming for a long time after that was over . It was only after I had been another fortnight on a piece basis - that I got any pay , and then it was just for one week . One week 's wages , it developed , was regularly held back . They said it was because it took that long to audit the accounts . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's wages of the forty hands constituted the major part of the firm 's operating capital . For all that I soon found myself very happy in my new surroundings . Those novelists and sentimentalists who slander the sweat-shop and the tenement should take notice . We certainly had a very much more human time of it in the old days than we did later on in the high-ceilinged , many-windowed , electric-fanned , palatial prisons that conformed to the factory laws . The reasons were these : In the sweat-shop the hand and the boss belonged to the same class . That made a big difference . There were no spying " foreladies " and no rules , no peremptory calls to the office and no threats of discharge . You did not have to stand in line with hat in hand for the wages of your toil . If we were hard up after a long , slack season , we could get all our meals on credit from the old shop-peddler , who sold baked liver by the slice , brandy , bananas , and rolls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of workers was small , so that everybody knew everybody else . During the lunch-hour we visited , and fell into violent arguments about the labor movement and socialism and literature , and mocked good-naturedly at the " capitalist " when he ventured to put in a word ( as he always did ) ; - and each of us , except the girls , took his turn in going for the can of beer . All this tended to preserve the human dignity and the selfrespect of the worker . For me the sweat-shop was the cradle of liberty . It was more ; it was my first university . I was not long there before I discovered that there were better things I could do with my free evenings than to frequent the cozy hang-outs of my fellow-countrymen . When I overheard a dispute between the young buttonhole maker and the cadaverous , curly-haired closer , on the respective  | merits of the stories of Tchekhov and Maupassant ; and when , another day , the little , black-eyed Russian Jewess who was receiving two cents per dozen shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anarchism and not to socialism , and cited the fact that Spencer himself was an anarchist , my eyes were opened and I felt ashamed of my ignorance . I had not realized that this grimy , toil-worn , airless Ghetto had a soul and a mind under its shabby exterior . It knew everything and talked about everything . Nothing in the realm of thought was too big or too heavy for this intelligenza of the slums . I began to listen attentively in the hope that I might get some hint as to where my fellow-workers got all their knowledge . I discovered that nearly all of them brought books with them to work -- -Yiddish , Russian , German , and even English books . During the lunchhour , or while waiting for my next bundle of shirts , I would stealthily glance at a title , or open a volume and snatch a word or two . I was too timid to inquire openly . Once a girl caught me by the wardrobe examining her book , and asked me whether I liked books and whether I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative . " You know , " she said , " Gorky is going to speak to-night , " and held out a newspaper to show me the announcement . So they were going to lectures ! I began to buy newspapers and watch for the notices . I took to reading books and attending meetings and theaters . There were scores of lectures every week , I found , and I went to as many as I could . One night it was Darwin , and the next it might be the principles of air-pressure . On a Saturday night there were sometimes two meetings so arranged that both could be attended by the same audience . I remember going once to a meeting at Cooper Union to protest against the use of the militia in breaking a strike somewhere in the West , and then retiring with a crowd of others to the anarchist reading-room on Eldridge Street to hear an informal discussion on " Hamlet versus Don Quixote . " It did not matter to us what the subject was . There was a peculiar , intoxicating joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speakers , which to us were echoes from a higher world than ours . Quite likely most of us could not have passed an examination in any of the subjects we heard discussed . It was something more valuable than information that we were after . Our poor , cramped souls were yearning to be inspired and uplifted . Never in all my experience since , though I have been in colleges and learned societies , have I seen such earnest , responsive audiences as were those collarless men and hatless girls of the sweat-shops . The East Side theater was another educational institution . It was seldom that an attempt was made to entertain us there , and whenever it was made we expressed our resentment by hooting . We did not go to the theater for amusement any more than we read books or listened to lectures for amusement . It was culture we demanded , and the playwrights who satisfied us we rewarded by our homage and our devotion . No American dramatist was ever worshiped by his public as Jacob Gordin was . I remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back by raising a cry of immorality against one of his plays , the whole progressive element in the Ghetto came as a unit to his support by packing his theater and clamoring for his appearance . The sheet that dared attack him was nearly boycotted out of existence . And when some years later Gordin died , every shop was closed on the East Side , and a hundred thousand followed his hearse in genuine mourning . There is no parallel , I think , in the whole history of the American drama to this testimonial of popular devotion to an intellectual leader . I saw more good drama on the stage in those days while I was sewing sleeves into shirts than I have in all my subsequent career . When the original playwrights could not fill the demand , the lack was supplied by the translators . While Broadway was giving Ibsen the cold shoulder , the East Side was acclaiming him with wild enthusiasm . I saw " Monna Vanna " on the Bowery before the Broadway type of theatergoer had ever heard the name of Maeterlinck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Andreiyev ,  | Tolstoy ? had their premieres in the Ghetto . The same was true of actors ; I saw Nazimova in " Ghosts " before she could speak English . And I made my first acquaintance with Greek tragedy when I had not yet learned how to spell in English . I did not for a long time perceive the drift of ' all this feverish intellectual activity . I was too busy reading and listening to care about the ultimate purpose of it all . Gordin was giving his brilliant talks on the Evolution of the Drama at the Educational League , and running a series of suggestive articles on the topic in Die Zukunft . A group of young writers had just begun the publication of Die Freie Stunde ( The Idle Hour ) , which was devoted only to what was best in belles-lettres . The war between the radical and the reactionary press , always raging , was just now assuming a most violent character . The anarchist Freie Arbeiter Stimme was bringing out the journal of a Catholic priest who had attained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the merits of religion and free-thought were discussed by the public , a certain well-known agnostic taking up the defense of religion for argument 's sake . Within the progressive circle there were continual debates between socialists and anarchists , which sometimes rose to passionate fury , but always remained enlightening . My mind was eagerly absorbing all these new impressions and all these wonderful ideas . A new world was unfolding itself before me , with endless , magnificent vistas extending in all directions . The " slack , " that bugbear of the factory hand , was losing its terrors for me . A time arrived when I would start to the shop in the morning in hopes that I might find the power turned off and the boss explaining that work was " slow . " On such days I would keep my coat and collar right on and take myself off to the nearest library , despite the boss 's protests and assurance that he was expecting the bundles from the manufacturer to arrive any moment . There was so much for me to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelists , and Yiddish poets that I had as yet barely touched . In my room there was a collection of the Reclam editions of Zola and Maupassant , and an assortment of plays of all nations which had been suggested to me by Gordin 's lectures which I had not yet found time to touch at all . Besides , I was trying to become a writer myself . The Forward had accepted and published some aphorisms of mine under the pen-name of " Max the Sleever , " which my friends at the shop had greatly admired . I was devoting whole nights to a novel in the manner of The Kreutzer Sonata . Above all , I delighted in lingering outside the- literary coffee-houses on Canal Street , where every now and then I would catch a glimpse of Gordin and his circle . With my mind so busy , then , it was not surprising that I should remain somewhat indifferent to what was going on in my soul . My ancient religion had , under American skies , vanished long ago ; but I was scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , as it had done with thousands of others . I can not now say whether I was taking it for granted or did not know it . I continually heard people in the shop , and in the quarter generally , referred to as " clodpates " and " intelligents , " and I knew that an intelligent was a person who went to lectures and read books , and preferred tragedy to vaudeville , and looked upon America as a place which afforded one an opportunity to acquire and express ideas , while a clodpate cared more for dollars than for ideas , and worked hard so that some day he might have others work for him , and in the evening he went to a dance-hall or to the Atlantic Garden or to Miner 's or to a card party , and kept himself scrupulously respectable so that some day , when he could afford it , he might rise to be the president of the synagogue or the lodge , and read ( when he read at all ) the Tageblatt and the joke-books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was already being classed as an intelligent among the hands at the shop . It never occurred to me , however , to attach any ulterior meaning to the word . It was obvious enough ; I could have seen it if I had only looked . But some- how I did not look ? until one day the thing struck me , and I had to look . It was an idle day at the shop . The boss had persuaded us to wait for the work , and we were lounging about on the machine-tables and on the ends of cases . Some of us had been to a reading of Ibsen 's symbolic drama , " When We Dead Awaken , " the night before , and were , of course , discussing it . I said that I liked it . Then the girl who had the year before put me on the intellectual track spoke up and asked me , in a tone of pained astonishment : " Why , are n't you a radical ? " " Yes , of course , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Who is not ? The clodpates are not . " " But what has this got to do with literature ? " " Well , " she answered , " it has this to do with it . This symbolism business is reactionary . It has always been . It 's churchy . " Then I suddenly realized that everybody I knew was either a socialist or an anarchist . It came to me in a flash that this social idealism was the soul that stirred within everything that was going on about and within me . I remembered that all our meetings and lectures were colored by it . And I understood that every intelligent was an atheist largely because every clodpate was a believer . When I asked myself why we studied the abstruse principles of physics , the answer was that it helped us to disprove the arguments of the religious . Our enthusiasm for evolution , I saw , was due to that doctrine 's implied denial of the biblical story of creation . And if we loved the poets , it was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontent with the existing order of things . In short , I perceived that we were moved by a very vital religion of our own ; although , of course , we would have scorned to call it by that hated name . I recall a lean devotee I used to see at the anarchist meetings . He never missed one , and he never failed to occupy a seat right in front of the speaker 's stand . During the address he would lean forward and glue his eyes on the speaker , as if he were determined that not a word should escape him . And then , somehow , it appeared that he always did miss something very essential , after all . When the floor was thrown open for general discussion he was invariably the first to arise . Whereupon he would begin with , " Thinkers and comrades , " and proceed to make a few irrelevant remarks which showed at once that he had understood nothing at all of the lecture . Some of the audience would smile at him and some would murmur impatiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . But these ignominious exhibitions never prevented him from heading each contribution list with some extravagant sum . Occasionally I would run across him at a little restaurant in the rear of a saloon on Eldridge Street , where one could get a tolerable meal for thirteen cents , and it puzzled me to reconcile that open-handedness at the meetings with this skimping on food . I understood it only when I became a devotee myself . Yes , our radicalism had all the nobility and all the weaknesses of a young faith . We were no mere parlor socialists , we toilers of the slums . Our atheism was no affectation ; our anarchism was not a fad to make conversation with over the tea-cups . Nor were we concerned with the improvement of our own material condition merely . We were engaged in the regeneration of society , and we were prepared to take up arms in the great social revolution which we saw daily drawing nearer . We were all missionaries , and some of us were quite genuine bigots . On the Day of Atonement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repented and knelt in prayer , we ostentatiously went about with big cigars in our mouths and bags of food in our pockets ; and in the afternoon we met in the public square and marched off in a body with flags and trumpets to the atheist picnic somewhere in Brooklyn . Similarly , during the Passover , we gave an entertainment and ball , where we consumed more forbidden food and drink than was good for us . No doubt this was foolish ? perhaps it was even vulgar ? but to us it was propaganda for our faith among the unconverted .  | My radical interests had one salutary result immediately . I was not content to know at second-hand the great writers and thinkers whom I heard continually discussed . But in order to read them I must know English . I began my study of the language one memorable night by borrowing a one-volume edition of the complete works of Shakespeare from the Bond Street library . As soon as I got home I eagerly opened my treasure and turned to " Hamlet . " To read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my most ambitious dreams . But , to my disappointment , I found that I could not get more than one word in ten , and of the sense nothing at all . Shakespeare as a first reader proved a total failure . It was then I decided to go to school . Lately there had appeared a whole crop of evening preparatory schools on East Broadway . They were largely owned and manned by young men who had recently graduated from the City College . I entered one of them simply in order to study English ; but , once there , my ambitions expanded . I recalled my father 's professional hopes for me , and conferred with my teachers about the possibility of preparing for a medical college . They encouraged me , and I agreed to pay fifty dollars for the fortyeight-point Regents ' course in monthly instalments of five dollars each . The institution occupied the remodeled top flats of two buildings on both sides of the street. , I used to travel across from algebra to English , and back again for German . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded with students , and during change of classes it was almost impossible to break through . I often wondered what would happen if there were a fire . At last the management , rented a flat in a third building and turned it into a waiting-room and study-hall . The classes were overcrowded , so that , even with the best instructors , anything like a recitation was a practical impossibility . The evening was divided into four periods , beginning at seven-fifteen and ending at eleven o'clock . As there were four Regents ' examinations annually , our school year was arranged into four corresponding terms . Every course ran through a term . For instance , I took algebra three times a week for ten weeks and then went up to the Grand Central Palace and passed the examination along with high-school pupils who had had the work five times a week for a year . I can not tell you how we did it . I only remember that I would sit and puzzle over x 's and y 's from the time I got home at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seven in the morning I would be back at the machine sewing shirts . I had registered late , and had missed the first two or three lessons . For a time the idea of algebra simply would not get through my head . But even algebra was as nothing beside English . We were trying to cover the prescribed Regents ' requirements , in spite of the fact that the majority of us could hardly speak a straight English sentence . The formal grammar , which was the bugbear of nearly everybody in the class , did not worry me . The terms were the same as in Rumanian , and I had been well trained at home . But the classics ! We began , mind you , with Milton . The nights and the Sundays I spent on " L'Allegro " and " Il Penseroso , " looking up words and classical allusions , if I had devoted them as earnestly to shirtmaking , would have made me rich . And then I would go to class and the teacher would ask me whether I thought there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person in two different moods . Bless my soul ! I had not thought there were any persons in it at all . I had made up my mind that it was something about a threeheaded dog that watched at the gate of Hades , whatever that was . So I would go back and read those puzzling lines again and again , in a sort of blind hope that sheer repetition would somehow make me understand them , until I got them by heart . My schooling brought a lot of new problems with it , and not all of them academic . Some of them were the old , familiar ones with a new wrinkle . As a student I could not work overtime . That meant a reduction in my weekly envelope of about two dollars . There were the monthly five-dollar payments , and several books every quarter . My  | room rent was raised by fifty cents a month to pay for the midnight gas I was burning . But all this additional expense I could have endured . It was the matchmakers who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor had made me quite a commodity in the marriage market . One of the men in the factory called my attention to the fact that a certain pretty finisher had five hundred dollars in the bank . An old woman of my acquaintance hunted me up in my room one night after school to make me a tempting offer . She knew of a rich jewelry-peddler who was ready to finance me through college on condition that I become engaged to his daughter . " And he is a fellow-countryman of yours , too , " she added , " and of such a fine family ! And the girl ! A jewel in the sight of God and man . Full of virtues . Educated like a bookkeeper . Reads German ? it is a joy to hear her ; and English , as if born to it . " And all this while I had a load of German and English of my own to get through with before morning . In January , at the end of my first three-month term , I took the examinations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five points . That left ten more between me and college . Unfortunately , it left something more besides , which even a conscientious student could not get by means of examinations . As we drew toward the end of our preparation , we " seniors , " as we were called , had but one topic for discussion ? how to get into and through college . I can not enumerate half the schemes we cooked up . Some of us did more daring things than marry plutocrats ' daughters . A great number became druggists , taking pharmacy as a stepping-stone to the higher ambition because it only required about onefourth the number of counts and only one year in college . I knew several boys who became conductors and robbed the street-railway companies of nickels until they were caught and discharged ? alas ! too soon . I myself chose another , more difficult , course . When September came , a year after I had entered school , I had enough credits to enter college on a condition , and , of course , no money even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State scholarships , which were good for four years ' tuition at Cornell University , but were only open to highschool pupils . I fretted at the loss of a year , but there was nothing for it but to go to high school and make myself eligible . The sacrifices I had to make were tremendous . I gave up my shirts and tried to support myself by tutoring at the rate of twenty-five cents an hour . I suffered horribly under the discipline . At times I lacked the car fare to get to the high school on 102d Street . I felt ashamed to be in a class with mere youngsters . And then , when it was all over , it turned out that I had worked and suffered in vain . Somehow I had never stopped to question my ability to win the scholarship . Yet it required only a trifling accident to smash the hope on which I had staked everything . I scored ninety-six in English , and nearly as high in all the other subjects except one . In physics I was marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination in that same subject , and , I believe , under the same examiners , and passed " with honor , " which meant a percentage of over ninety . So decisive are examina-tions ! But to college I went that autumn all the same . As soon as school was over I returned to the shop . When I found that work was scarce at the trade that summer , I applied for a job at the Pennsylvania Terminal , then building , and was taken on as an electrician 's helper at a wage of one dollar and seventyfive cents a day . A friend offered to lend me fifty dollars a year , and I tried to coax my two brothers , who had followed me to America three years before , into promising me an equal amount , with only partial success . It was strange that my relatives , who had up to this time been very proud of my ambitions and my achievements , now held up their hands in solemn disapproval at my selfishness . It was all very well , they declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowing money to get there was carrying matters to extremes . My cousin , the collar-maker , could not see why shirtmaking was good enough for him and not for me . Another cousin thought I had enough education already .  | A third was convinced that I could persuade Mr. Rockefeller to lend me the money . Brother Harry advised that I wait another year and in the mean time earn the money at the sewing-machine . Only gentle Paul , my other brother , was silent at the family council ? except to say that , as long as he kept his job , he would spare me his dollar a week . But all the advice and the censure was to no purpose . I had made up my mind . Money or no money , I was going . My earnings as an electrician would pay my fare . The Lord might do the worrying about the rest . To my great astonishment , I discovered that even my radical associates were stanchly opposed to my plans and my ambitions . I had confidently expected that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and approve of it . It was from them , largely , that I had got the inspiration ? the worship of learning , the ideal of culture , the dream for a higher plane of life . They had no illusions about the wretched , precarious existence of the working-man . They constantly lamented his lot , his oppression by the rulers and capitalists , his lack of opportunity to develop himself , his imprisonment in dingy lofts and airless tenements . Their newspapers and their lecturers never tired of insisting that the Iiberation of the working-class could only come by education , and that this education must come from within , from the conscious endeavor of the proletariat itself . Well , here I was carrying their theories into practice . I was going to get educated , to lift myself out of my class . I was going to make my fight for the freedom and the leisure and the opportunity to develop which they had taught me was the inalienable right of every man . Why should they not give me their most enthusiastic support ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my announcement . Isidore Lipshitz , the cadaverous , curly-haired closer , who had befriended me in the days of my apprenticeship and had witnessed the beginning of my career , burst out into sarcastic , fiendish laughter ; and Joe Shapiro , affectionately nicknamed the " red bull , " jumped to his feet and launched into a passionate denunciation of my sacrilegious perversion of radical principles : " The class-conscious proletariat is no longer good enough for you , " he shouted . " You want to go to college , to become a gentleman and a bourgeois ; to wear spats , I suppose , and silk gloves , quite like a little clodpate . All right , go ; and the devil take you . But " ? and here he waved a menacing finger in my face ? " do n't you come around here and pollute this place with your infernal sophistries . Did you hear that , Isidore ? To our lecturers he compares himself . The cheek of the nix ! Who ever told you that Feigenbaum and Hermalin and Liessin have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have developed by their own brains and the right kind of reading . But they have stuck to their class and have devoted themselves to the interests of the worker . They have not tried to climb in among the church-walkers and the capitalists and the oppressors . Traitor ! " In vain I tried to make myself heard and to explain that by getting a thorough education I was serving the best interests of my class . As a factory hand , I argued , all my energy and struggling against a complex system was doomed to be unavailing . They insisted that the emancipation of the worker could only come by the education of the body as a whole , not by the sporadic , selfish scrambling out of individuals into the ranks of the oppressors . My place was in the shop , among the men and women who were building up the movement with their blood and their brains . They predicted that no sooner would I enter college than my classconsciousness would melt away and I would begin to feel myself as belonging in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cause of labor . I smiled incredulously at their passionate presentiments ; but the event , as you shall see , proved that they were not altogether wrong . So , in the autumn of 1906 , I started out on my great adventure . Throughout the summer I had been studying catalogues from all the ends of the country and making the rounds of all the cutrate ticket-offices in the city , in an effort  | to make my scant savings go as far as I could . The New York medical colleges , with their tuition rates of one hundred and fifty dollars and upward , were , of course , out of the question . Some of the State universities , I found , charged no tuition fees ; but a study of certain tables contained in the bulletin showed that the minimum expenditure for board and room per year was two hundred and fifty dollars . Heaven preserve me ! One hundred was my limit , and I would have to earn the most of that . Therefore , even those schools that promised reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their catalogues said nothing about ways and means . Finally , after two months of figuring and comparing , I chose the University of Missouri . It appeared to combine all the advantages of economy with high academic standards . I calculated that by living at the dormitories and boarding at the University Dining Club , I could make an appreciable cut in my first estimate . Perhaps I could skimp through the year on seventy-five dollars and pay my railroad fare with the remainder of the hundred . And the reports of the Y.M.C.A. made me feel certain that I could earn the better part of the outlay by doing odd jobs . I did not start from New York until two weeks after the official opening of the university . My experience in the night school had taught me how to do a month 's work in a week , so that I had no doubt of my ability to catch up with my classes . As long as I had a job , I felt that I ought to keep it as long as I could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worked at the Pennsylvania Terminal until one Friday late in September . On Saturday I packed my belongings , bought the return half of an excursion ticket to St. Louis for three dollars less than the regular price , and went around to say goodby to my friends . On Sunday I was off . My brothers , my cousins , and a number of my school-fellows came to the station . As I scrambled into the car with my telescope case and my big bundle of food for the journey , the women folks burst into tears . " Poor Max ! " they cried . " What will become of him out there in the wilderness , among strangers , cut off from the world ? " I tried to smile encouragingly , but my heart was in my throat . I was to learn the reason for those kind , silly tears soon enough . I got to Columbia , Missouri , in the evening two days later . I had written to the president of the university to tell him by what train I would arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had not even sent any one to meet me . There were a lot of students at the station , but they paid no attention to me . They were making a great deal of noise and shaking hands in a boisterous sort of way with one or two decidedly rural-looking boys who had come in on the train with me . I began to feel very lonely . Yes , began was the word . It was to be continued . My first thought was to make straight for the university and ask for the president . He was the only person who knew who I was . But inquiry revealed the fact that the campus was a good halfmile from the station , so I decided to wait until morning . There was a house not far away that looked like my own home in Vaslui , and it bore a sign with the word " Hotel " over its eaves . I went in and asked an old negro about a lodging for the night . He said the place was full , and conducted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There I was given a room . In the morning I dressed and began to look for the kitchen . A little girl asked me whether I wanted breakfast . I said : " No ; I 'll have breakfast after I come back from the president 's house . But where is the sink ? I want to wash . " It took her some time to understand me ; then she grinned , and pointed to a pitcher and bowl on a little stand in my room. - At the university I learned that the president was out of town . But a clerk told me , with a twinkle in her eye , that if I wanted to be registered she would show me where to go . At the registrar 's office another clerk surprised me by saying that he remembered my name quite well , because he had got all the letters I had written to the president , and then astonished me still more by producing a folder which contained every one of them . He said , pleasantly , that my name was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | about in the main building I found several notices on the bulletin-board asking for roomers or room-mates . It had developed that , not being a resident of the State , I could not live in the dormitories . I could take my meals at the University Dining Club , however , by buying a permit for twenty dollars . Twenty dollars ! when I had only seventeen in the whole world . During that first week in Missouri I found out what it was to be a stranger in a foreign land ; and as the year wore on I found out more and more . Columbia seemed a thousand times farther removed from New York than New York had been from Vaslui . Back there in the Ghetto everybody had thought me quite Americanized . Now I could not help seeing that Missouri was more genuinely American than the New York I had known ; and against this native background I appeared greener than when I had landed . This new world I had suddenly dropped into was utterly without my experience and beyond my understanding , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked or hated it . I had to admire the heartiness , the genuineness , and the clean-cut manliness of it . But , on the other hand , it prided itself on a peculiar common sense , a cool-headedness , a practical indifference to things of the spirit , which the " intelligent " of the East Side in me revolted against . Nevertheless , I tried very hard to make myself agreeable to my fellow students . But I failed miserably . In the first two months I had , and lost , a half-dozen room-mates . Do what I might , I could not make them stay with me . There were never any hard words ; we always parted as " good friends . " But almost from the first day they would hardly talk to me , and before the week was out they would find some excuse for moving or asking me to move . I spent many sleepless nights trying to figure out the thing . It wounded my selfesteem to find my society so offensive to everybody . Besides , it touched my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room I had to pay the full rent . But my predicament had its comic side , too . It got so that when I found a new roommate I would take a perverse sort of pleasure in watching to see how soon he would begin to look the other way when I spoke to him . I never had to wait very long . After I got some money from my friend in New York , I bought my permit to the U. D. Club . The charge for board , twenty-one meals , was one dollar and fifty cents ; with the cost of the permit it amounted to about two dollars per week . There were between fifty and sixty tables in one vast room , and eight Missourians at each table . When the big gong rang there was a fierce scramble for places , followed by a scraping of chairs and a rattling of crockery and silverware . Usually during the noon meal the manager of the club would get up to make some announcement , and invariably he would be greeted by yells of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We want butter , " " Can the oleo . " Before an athletic game , and particularly after a victory , the rooting and the yelling , the pounding on the tables , and the miscellaneous racket were deafening . I thought I had wandered into a barbarous country . I confess I did not altogether disapprove of the barbarians . After a while I tried very hard to be one myself . But I did not know how . Of practical jokes there was no end . On April 1st there was soap in the pie . If you got in late to a meal , it was wise to brush your chair and " pick your bites , " if any bites were left . For some reason or other I was marked from the first as a fit subject for these pranks . On Hallowe'en a squad of cadets commanded by a corporal entered my room and ordered me to get into my uniform , shoulder my gun , and proceed to the gymnasium , which , according to the order read , the commandant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole uneventful night . Toward morning , the captain of the football team , who had a room in the gymnasium , returned from a party . I ordered him to halt and give the password . He smiled and tried to enter . I made a lunge for him , and would have run my bayonet through him if he had not begun to laugh . " Go on home , you poor boy , " he said . " They pull that stunt off every year . Poor joke , I  | think . " The next day my table-mates tried to jolly me about it . They said I would be court-martialed as a deserter from duty . I got angry , and that made them all the more hilarious . Then a big , strapping fellow named Harvey spoke up . " Be still , you galoots , " he said to them ; and then to me , " For gosh sake , fellow , be human ! " I tried for a week to figure out what he meant by " human , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to follow his advice . It was the first hint I . had got on what America , through her representatives in Missouri , was expecting of me . Harvey became my first American friend . I got another hint shortly after , and from the same excellent source . Most of my fellow-students had come to the university direct from the farm ; therefore my very apparent ignorance of all things agricultural tickled them immensely . They said I did not know the difference between a hoe and a threshingmachine ; but that was an exaggeration . It was true , however , that I did not know whether it was a sheep or a pig that bleated . I spoke of sowing corn until I was told that planting was the word . In the Bible and in Shakespeare I had always read about the reaping of the grain ; but in Missouri they harvested the crops . I saw no connection between this gap in my education and my failure to make friends . Then it dawned upon me that one reason why I could not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their language . Why , I had thought that I was a wonder at the English . Had n't I got the highest mark in freshman composition ? Yes ; but while I pronounced like a native and otherwise spoke and wrote correctly , I was weak in the colloquial idiom . I could not put the right ring into my phrases . I did not know enough of the common , everyday words . Every time I tried to tell a story , it fell flat because of some subtle shade of meaning that escaped me . My vocabulary was not varied enough . I might know one word like " earth , " whereas the Missourian had his choice of " ground " and " soil " and " sod , " and half a dozen others which he could draw on with a sure hand . Indeed , my table-mates had command of a whole vast and varied vocabulary of which not a trace could be found in any dictionary , no matter how diligently I searched . It did not take me long to lay hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the end of a month I could myself refer to professors as " profs , " to a course in literature as " lit , " and to the quadrangle as the " quad . " I found that highly practical , like everything else in Missouri , and convenient . But when a chap asked me to pass him " that stuff , " and pointed one day to the potatoes and another day to a pile of typewritten notes , I was mystified . I could not easily perceive what quality it was the two commodities had in common that made the same name applicable to both . Moreover , I observed that my friends expressed every variety of emotion ? disappointment , enthusiasm , anger , elation ? by the one word ( or was it two ? ) " doggone . " Food in general was called " grub , " although gravies and sauces were sometimes distinguished as " goo " ; while , on the other hand , money had a whole chain of names to itself ? " rocks " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " stuff . " It was all very bewildering . Most of the conversation at the table and around the campus was about athletics . I wanted to talk about socialism , and found that these university men knew as little about it , and had as dark a dread of it , as the clodpate on the East Side . Religion was taboo . They went to church because it made them feel good , as they put it ; and there was an end . They took their Christianity as a sort of drug . Sex , too , was excluded from sane conversation , although there was no objection to it as material for funny stories . I went to one or two football and basket-ball games ? I could not afford very many ? and liked them . But I could not , for the life of me , say an intelligent word about them . The chatter around me about forward passes and goals and fumbles might just as well have been in a foreign language , for all I got out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught the enthusiasm and joined in the shirt-tail parade , wonder- ing , in the mean time , what my intellectual friends in New York would have thought if they had seen me in that outfit . But the hero-worship bestowed on the overgrown animals who won the battle irritated me . I could not see what place this sort of thing had in a university . And it surprised and delighted me to find that Harvey and some other sensible fellows , who loved the game , took the same view of the matter as I did . Perhaps the greatest stumbling-block in the way of my readjustment was the emphasis that my Missourian placed on what he called good manners . I was not quite so obtuse as to miss the rather frank curiosity with which certain details in my conduct at table were regarded . Well , I knew better ; but it was part of my East Side religion not to be concerned with the externals of conduct . One was in peril of losing sight of the essential and of becoming insincere as soon as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . Once or twice I succeeded in drawing an unwary freshman into an argument about religion or economics , and then I wished I had not . His good manners rendered him quite sterile as a debater . I could on no account get him to make a straightforward , flat-footed statement ; and he exasperated me by a way he had of emasculating my own emphatic assertions with his eternal colorless conformity . He invariably introduced a remark with an " It seems to me , " or an " It looks as if , " or a " Do n't you think ? " And if I with my ill-breeding shot back at him , as I usually did , " No , I do n't think so at all ; I disagree with you entirely , " he looked grieved and surprised and visibly chilled , and crawfished out of the embarrassing situation by admitting that there were two sides to every question , and that no doubt I was right , too . And the next time he spied me on the street he suddenly developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introductions was my chief abomination . In my little- radical world in New York the institution hardly existed . If you liked a man or a woman , you went up to them and drew them into a discussion and became friends with them . If you did not like them , you paid no attention to them . In Missouri this queer formality was all over the shop . Everybody wanted to introduce you to everybody . They seemed to think I would take offense if I was not extended the dubious courtesy . The ritual of the performance would have been a rich source of entertainment to me if I had only had some one of my own kind to share it with , for it did have its humorous side . My gentleman would leap up , grab your hand violently , and , staring you right in the eye , exclaim , " Mighty glad to know you , man . " And he expected me to answer back in the same tone . But as a rule I was constrained to disappoint him there , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wishing that I could meet him on Eldridge Street where I was at home , and see how he would like that . I suffered from hunger and from loneliness . It took me three years to get used to American cookery. - At the club everything tasted flat . I missed the pickles and the fragrant soups and the highly seasoned fried things and the rich pastries made with sweet cheese that I had been brought up on . The breakfast hour was outrageous . In New York I used to drink coffee in the morning , and then have breakfast at ten . Here I had to get down a full meal at seven o'clock in the morning or starve until one . The very order of the courses was topsy-turvy . At home we began the big meal of the day with radish or ripe olives or chopped liver or fish ; then we had meat of one kind or another ; then some vegetables cooked sweet or sour-sweet , and wound up with soup . The Missourian always began at the tail-end ? started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too rare ) ; then piled his meat and potatoes ( of potatoes he never tired ) and vegetables in several heaps all on the same plate , devouring them all together ; and concluded the performance with a muddy paste he called pumpkin pie and some powerful beverage that passed for coffee . Is it any wonder that I was so slow becoming an American when , as every one knows , nationality is principally a matter of diet , and it was this array that I must learn to cherish ?  | Sunday was the hardest of all the days in the week to live through . Then every fellow in the house went to church in the morning , wrote letters in the afternoon , and went calling in the evening . I was left all alone . There was not even any mail on Sundays . During that first year I kept my soul alive by the letters I got from New York . I wrote to everybody I knew , because I loved everybody now who was in New York . But there were whole seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sundays . At Christmas and at the other short vacations nearly everybody went home to his family ; the town looked deserted , and I was almost the only boarder left at the club . For me there was no church and no calling . Missouri is a coeducational university , but it might just as well have been a monastery for all the social good it did me . When my ways and my personality were finding so little favor with the men , my chances of making friends with the women were , as you may well imagine , very scant indeed . Now and then , in the course of a recitation , I might get a whispered distress call from a young lady whom fate , in the person of the professor , had surprised in the midst of other thoughts ; occasionally in the library , too , such a one might , with a gracious smile , ask for assistance in the preparation of her English theme . But when she next saw me on the street or about the campus she betrayed no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Deutscher Verein and had professed to be pleased to make my acquaintance , seemed unaccountably eager to sever that acquaintance as soon as the meeting was over . Their conduct toward me was a painful mystery . It struck me , with my East Side notion of frankness , as needlessly insincere . Why , I wondered , do n't they come out openly and tell me when I displease them ? And I wanted very much to be friends with them . Their interests were much finer than the men 's , and their appreciation of literature was keener . I would have given a great deal for the privilege of calling on one of a few girls I had observed in class , to take a walk with her , and have a discussion in the good old style of East Broadway . Some of those boys , and a good many of the girls , presented a problem that baffled me for a long time . When I solved it I had taken one more step toward becoming an American . It was true that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables , and did a score of other odd jobs to make ends meet ; but , then , I was an immigrant without parents and without resources . If I had the means , I thought , I would rather not engage in all these extramural activities , and devote all my time to study and recreation . But among the other dish-washers at the club I learned there were young men whose fathers had large farms or big businesses in the little towns . I wondered why did they not support their sons through college decently . Then I made the interesting discovery that they did not want to be supported ; that not to be supported was their idea of going through college decently . I revolved that idea through my head until I got it . It showed me the Missourian in a new light . I could almost forgive him his indifference to radical discussions . As the summer drew near I began to look around for something to do . I would spend nearly one hundred and twenty-five dollars , I saw , between September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I meant to continue in school I must earn enough at least to give me a good start in the fall . I thought of the wheat-fields in Kansas , where , Harvey told me , they paid twofifty a day , and where a number of students went , summer after summer . I might go with Harvey to Joplin , where he worked as a carpenter , and try my luck in the zinc-mines . But I was longing for a sight of New York . It would cost fifty dollars to make that trip , but I tried to persuade myself that I would earn enough more in the city to make it worth while . And all the time , deep , down in my foolish heart I felt that if I remained away from my own people that summer I would not be fit to resume work in the fall . So to New York I went , and lived through the last and the bitterest episode in the tragedy of readjustment.  | During that whole strenuous year , while I was fighting my battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure the price it was costing me . I had not dreamed that my mere going to Missouri had opened up a gulf between me and the world I had come from , and that every step I was taking toward my ultimate goal was a stride away from everything that had once been mine , that had once been myself . Now , no sooner had I alighted from the train than it came upon me with a pang that that one year out there had loosened ties that I had imagined were eternal . I found myself regarding the little world I had emerged from with the eyes of a Western American . Suddenly , at one glance , I grasped the answer to the problem that had puzzled me so long , for here in the persons of those dear to me I was seeing myself as those others had seen me . I went about revisiting the scenes and the people I had so longed to see , and found that everything had changed in my brief absence . My friends were not the same ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the same . What had come over them ? My kinsfolk and my old companions looked me over and declared that it was I who had become transformed . Perhaps so . At any rate , while my people were still dear to me , and always would be dear to me , the atmosphere about them repelled me . I had thought , a few days before , that I was going home . I had yelled to Harvey from the train , as it was pulling out of the station at Columbia , " I am going home , old man ! " But I had merely come to another strange land . In the fall I would return to that other exile . I was , indeed , a man without a country . During that entire summer , while I opened gates on an elevated train in Brooklyn , I tussled with my problem . It was quite apparent to me from the very first what its solution must be . I knew that now there was no going back for me ; that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for a long time I could not admit it to myself . A host of voices and sights and memories had awakened within me that clutched me to my people and my past . From this distance and from these surroundings , Missouri and the new world she meant to me were enchanting and heroic . The loneliness I had endured , the snubbing , the ridicule , the inner struggles ? all the dreariness and the sadness of my life in exile ? had faded out of the picture , and what remained was only an idealized vision of the clean manhood and the pure , bracing atmosphere that contrasted so strikingly with the things around me . I poured out my heart in a letter to Harvey . If a year ago I had been told that I would be laying my sorrows and my disappointments in my own kindred before any one out there , I would have laughed at the idea . But that barbarian in Missouri was the only human being , strangely enough , in whom I could now confide with any hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the agonizing moral experience I was going through . I told him that I was aching to get back to Columbia ( how apt the name was ! ) to take up again where I had left off the process of my transformation , and to get through with it as soon as might be . And in the fall I went back ? this time a week before college opened ? and was met by Harvey at the station , just as those rural-looking boys had been met by their friends the year before . When I reached the campus I was surprised to see how many people knew me . Scores of them came up and slapped me on the back and shook hands in their hearty , boisterous fashion , and hoped that I had had a jolly summer . I was asked to join boarding-clubs , to become a member in debating societies , to come and see this fellow or that in his rooms . It took me off my feet , this sudden geniality of my fellows toward me . I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers between us were gradually and steadily breaking down . It came upon me all at once . I felt my heart going out to my new friends . I had become one of them . I was not a man without a country . I was an American .  |
