txt Gen. Theodore A. Bingham , whose first adventure in New York City 's municipal government terminated in his removal frcin the position of Police Commissioner by former Mayor McClellan , and left him the heritage of a libel suit against Mayor Ge.yper , brought his second adventure as an officeholder to a conclusion last night in a curt letter addressed to Borough President alcAneny . The letter reviews the conditions under viiich Gen. Bingham agreed to become Chief Engineer of the Bureau of Highv ays two months ago . He expresses disappointment in his hope of accomplishing needed improvements in the city streets , and asks that his resignation take effect at once . Borough President received the letter on emerging from a protracted conference on subways . He seemed surprised , but said he would accept it and announce in a few days a successor to Gen. Bingham . Who this successor might be he could not even conjecture last night . The troubles Gen. Bingham has met in the Bureau of Highways in his efforts to " do something " were credited with bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeless as well as a thankless one . Gen. Bingham intimated in a discussion with friends In his rooms at the Hotel Schuyler , in Forty-fifth Street , last night that he found the bureau completely clogged with unfinished business and swamped with red tape , so that any official attempting to operate through the bureau would be hampered and tied down until efficient service was impos-sible , He insisted that there had been no break between himself ana anyone else in the department , and that he left the place to which Borough President appointed him , two months ago , with the kindliest of feelings , toward Mr. personally . He declared that Mayor Gaynor had absolutely nothing to do with the n.atter in-any shape or form , and he doubted , he said , that the Mayor even knew of the situation prevailing in the bureau , since it was directly under Mr. 's charge . He charged ail the difficulties of which he complained to red tape in unlimited quantities . Mr. was inclined to credit it to the possible fact that Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since there were two or three superiors in the department to whom he had to report , whose demands were possibly exacting and hard to comply with , especially on points where their approval was necessary to plans proposed by Gen. Bingham . Here is the letter which Gen. Bingham sent by special messenger to Mr. M &?; An en y ; July 10 , 1911 . The lion . George MeAneny , President Borough of Manhattan : My Dear Mr. : Referring to what I said to you on July 7 , after over two months of diligent work . I find that my methods of administration for getting things done do not fit in with those of your administration . I am not willing merely to hold this office and accomplish no important work . I therefore hereby resign from the office of Chief Engineer of the Bureau of Highways , Department of Public Works , Borough of Manhattan , to take effect at the close of business hours to-day . Wishing you all success , and regretting that I can not help you as I had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very truly you-s , THEODORE A. BINGHAM . The appointment of Gen. Bingham to the Bureau of Highways on May I laid for a time.one of the severest storms that has threatened President 's administration . It had to do . with the condition of the streets , and was centred on charges that Borough President , in his zeal over subway matters , had completely forgotten the borough 's highways . There were charges , fathered at Albany by the Automobile Club of America , that the streets were getting into the worst condition in years . Various civic bodies were in full cry against the pre ' veiling conditions , while books of photo ' graphs were made and circulated showing the holes and ruts of the city 's chief thoroughfares . A new man with a vigorous policy . it was thought , would solve the situation . while the appearance of such a man with an evident intention to remedy prevailing conditions would stop the constant onslaughts of Critics . Gen. ' Bingham was in Washington attending to duties wliteh he has taken up since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years he had served in the Engineering Corps of the United States Army , and had risen to the rank of Colonel in that branch of the military service . He had the reputation for " doing things " whim the local administration felt itself in need of . A telegram to Gen. Bingham brought him to New York , ' and it was very evident as he walked into the . Highway Bureau that he was confident and hopeful , and happy . It ' was equally evident when ' he walked out , again last night that he was happy at the thought of being free again , and that of his hopes for the bureau there remained nothing . The first thing Gen. Bingham did on taking charge was to make trouble for the asphalt contractors by holding them more strictly than they had ever been held before to the specifications named in their contracts . The next thing that came to Gen. Bingham 's attention was that the bureau was almost entirely without records . He could not find out haw long the pavement had been down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost to put it down and keep it in , repair . Ile devised a form of record for this exalt Informtion , and forwarded a sample with a requisition that a supply be printed . He was still waiting for them when he wrote his resignation yesterday . There was no record that could be reached quickly of complaints handed in by citizens and Inspectors of the bureau . , He devised a card for such complaints and sent forward a requisition . That was the last he heard of it , and the cards have so far failed to appear . The bureau as a whole , he decided , was in need of complete reorganization to put it on an efficient basis . He studied out a system , filed a report giving the needed changes in method , and waited again . He was putting into the report , he thought . that specialized knowledge he had gained irr- his years as an engineer , and it concerned only men who were under his direct personal supervision .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
