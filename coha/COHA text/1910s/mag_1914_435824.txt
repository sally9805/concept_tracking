THE teasing perfection of Greek Literature will perhaps excite the world long after modern literature is forgotten . Shakespeare may conic to his end and lie down among the Egyptians , but Homer will endure forever . We hate to imagine such an outcome as this , because , while we love Shakespeare , we regard the Greek classics merely with an overwhelmed astonishment . But the fact is that Homer floats in the central stream of History , Shakespeare in an eddy . There is , too , a real difference between ancient and modem art , and the enduring power may be on the side of antiquity . The classics will always be the playthings of humanity , because they are types of perfection , like crystals . They are pure intellect , like demonstrations in geometry . Wit hin their own limitations they are examples of miracle ; and the modern world has not liMg to show that resembles them in the least .

The scholars who devote Mr. Chapman 's essay appears here in a form much shorter than that which it is intended to assume when published in It book . ? THE EDITORS . 70 their enormous energies to a life-anddeath struggle to understand the Greeks always arrive at states of mind which are peculiarly modern . The same thing may be said of the severest types of Biblical scholar . J. B. Strauss , for instance , gave his life to the study of Christ , and , as a result , has left an admirable picture of the German mind of 1850 . Goethe , who was on his guard if ever a man could be , has still been a little deceived in thinking that the classic spirit could be recovered . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , and rank among his most . characteristic works , yet which bear small resemblance to the originals . The same may be said of Afilton and of Racine . The Greeks seem to have used their material , their myths and ideas , with such supernal intellect that they leak this mat erial untouched for the next comer . Their gods persist , their mythology is yours and mine . We accept the toys , ? the whole babyhouse which hots come down to us : we walk in and build our own dramas with their blocks .. What a nuts thinks of influences him , though he chance to know lit de about it ; and t he power which the ancient world has exerted over the modern has not been shown in proportion to t he knowledge or scholarship oil he modern thinker , but in proportion to his natural force .

Keats % . ; N inspired by the very idea of them . They were an obsession to Dante , who knew not the language .

( If late years we have come to think , 1 all subjects as mere departments of , ience , and we are almost ready to hand over Greece to the specialist . We assume that scholars will work out the history of art . But it is not the right of t he learned and scholarly only , m In influenced by the Greeks , but Mm of those persons who know no Greek . Greek influence is too univermi an inheritance to be entrusted to s , itolars , and the specialist is the very last man who can understand it . In order to obtain a diagnosis on Greek inlluence one would have to seek out a suet of specialist on Humanity-atlarge . Since we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets of Greek influence , the next best thing model be to go directly to the Greeks ihtmselves , and to study their works freshly . almost innocently . But to do this is not easy . The very Greek texts ihemselves have been established through modern research , and the foot - um es are the essence of modernity . The rushing modern world passes like an express train ; as it goes , it holds tn ? a mirror to the classic world , ? mirror ever changing and ever false . For upon the face of the mirror rests the Ions of fleeting fashion . We can no more walk straight to the Greeks than ? ? c can walk straight to the moon . In America t he natural road to the classics lies through the introductions of German and English scholarship . We are met , as it were , on the threshold of Greece by guides who address us confidently in two very dissimilar modern idioms , and who overwhelm us with complacent and voluble instructions . According to these men we have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece . Before entering upon the subject of Greece , let us cast a preliminary and disillusioning glance upon our two guides , the German and the Briton . Let us look once at each of them with an intelligent curiosity , so that we may understand what manner of men they are , and can make allowances in receiving the valuable and voluble assistance which they keep whispering into our ears throughout t he tour . The guides are indispensable ; but this need not prevent us from studying their temperaments . If it be true that modern scholarship acts as a lens through whirls the classics are to be viewed , we can never hope to get rid of all the distortions ; but we may make scientific allowances , and may correct results . We may consider certain social laws of refraction , for example , spectacles , beer , sausages . We may regard the variations of the compass due to certain local customs , namely : the Anglican communion , School honor , Pears ' soap . In all this we sin not , but pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refraction very pleasant ly . The extraordinary lenses which were made there in the nineteenth century are famous now , and will remain as curiosities hereafter . During the last century , Learning won the clay in Germany to an extent never before known in history . It became an unwritten law of the land that none but learned men should be allowed to play with pebbles . If a man had been through the mill of the Doctorate , however , THE GREEK GENIUS he received a certificate as a dreamer . The passion which mankind has for using its imagination could thus be gratified only by men who had been brilliant scholars . The result was a race of monsters , of whom Nietzsche is the greatest . The early social life of these men was contracted . They learned all they knew while sitting on a bench . The classroom was their road to glory . They were aware that they could not be allowed to go out and play in the open until they had learned their lessons thoroughly ; they therefore became prize boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they roamed through Greek mythology , and all other mythologies , and erected labyrinths in which the passions of childhood may be seen gamboling with the discoveries of adult miseducation . The gravity with which the pundits treat ed each other extended to the rest of the world , because , in the first place , they were more learned than any one else , and in the second , many of them were men of genius . The ' finds of modern archmology have passed through the hands of these men , and have received from them the labels of current classification . After all , these pundits resemble their predecessors in learning . Scholarship is always a specialized matter , and it must be learned as we learn a game . Scholarship always wears the parade of finality , and yet suffers changes like the moon . These particular scholars are merely scholars . Their errors are only the errors of scholarship , clue , for the most part , to extravagance and ambition . A new idea about Hellas meant a new reputation . In default of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e ; he is not an intellectual . After discounting ambition , we have left still another cause for distrusting the labors of the German professors . This dis trust arises from a peep into the social surroundings of the caste . Here is a great authority on the open-air life of the Greeks : he knows all about Hellenic sport . Here is another who understands the brilliant social life of Attica : he has written the best book upon Athenian conversation and the marketplace . Here is still a third : he has reconstructed Greek religion : at last we know ! All these miracles of learning have been accomplished in the library , ? without athletics , , gleaming-eyed Greeks , of the Bay of Salamis , and of the Hermes of Praxiteles , ? and then east my eyes on the Greatest Authority , my guide , my Teuton master , with his barbarian babble and his ham-bone and his self-importance , I begin to wonder whether I can not somehow get rid of the man and leave him behind . Alas , we can not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British mentors , who flank the German scholars as we move gently forward toward Greek feeling , form so complete a contrast to the Teutons that we hardly believe that both kinds can represent genuine scholarship . The Britons are gentlemen , afternoon callers , who eat small cakes , row on the Thames , and are all for morality , They are men of letters . They write in prose and in verse , and belong to the festhet ic fraternity . They , like the Teutons , are attached to institutions of learning , namely , to Oxford and Cambridge . They resemble the Germans , however , in but a single trait . ? the conviction that they understand Greece . The thesis of the British belle-lettrists , to which they devote their energies , might be stated thus : British culture includes Greek culture . They are I cry modern , very English , very sentimental , these British scholars . While the German Doctors use Greek as a stalking-horse for Teutonic psy ? kolgy , these English gentlemen use as a dressmaker 's model upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lesson which Browning sees in Alcestis is the same that he gave us in James Lee 's W ife . Browning 's appeal is always the appeal to robust feeling as the salva ; ht of the world . Gilbert Murray , on the other hand , sheds a sad , clinging , ' Fennysonian morality over Dionysus . Jewett is happy to announce that Plato is theologically sound , and gives him a ticket-of-leave to walk anywhere in England . Swinburne clings to that belief in sentiment which marks the Victorian era , but Swinburne finds t he hey to life in unrestraint instead of in nistraint . There is a whole school of limp Gretism in England , which has grown up eat of keats 's Grecian urn , and which is 11 , W but tressed with philosophy and timed with h scholarship ; and no doubt it does bear some sort of relanpn to Greece and to Greek life . But ibis Anglican Grecism has the quality hich all modern British art exhibits , the very quality which the Greeks otuld not abide , ? it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong flavors . Be likes them in his tea , in his port nine , in his concert-hall songs , in his /tic/ ures of home and farm life . He ! ibis something unmistakable , something NS it h a smack that lets you know that the thing has arrived . In his literature he is the same . Dickens , Carlyle , Tennyson lay it on thick with sentiment . Keats drips with aromatic poetry , which has a wonder and a Scanty of its own ? and whose striking quality is excess . The scented , ? ' whist &; sweetness of the modern esthetic school in England goes home to its admirers because it is easy art . Once enjoy a bit of it and you never forget it . It is always the same , the ' old reliable , ' the Oxford brand , the true , safe , British , patriotic , moral , noble school of verse ; which exhibits the manners and feelings of a gentleman , and has success written in every trait of its physiognomy . How this school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion in the nineteenth century . In the Victorian era the Englishman brought cricket and morning prayers into South Africa . Robert Browning established himself and his carpet-bag in comfortable lodgings on the Acropolis , ? which he spells with a K to show his intimate acquaintance with recent research . It must be confessed that Robert Browning 's view of Greece never pleased , even in England . It was too obviously R. B. over again . It was Pippa and Bishop Blougram with a few pomegranate seeds and unexpected orthographies thrown in . The Encyclopmdia Britannica is against it , and suggests , wittily enough , that one can hardly agree with Browning that Heracles got drunk for the purpose of keeping up other people 's spirits . So also Edward FitzGerald was never taken seriously by the English ; but this was for another reason . His translations are the best transcriptions from the Greek ever done by this British school ; but Fitzgerald never took himself seriously . I believe that if he had only been ambitious , and had belonged to the academic classes , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford behind him , and we should all have been obliged to regard him as a great apostle of IIellenism . But he was a poor-spirited sort of man , and never worked up his lead . Matthew Arnold , on the other hand , began the serious profession of being a Grecian . He took it up when there was nothing in it , and he developed a little sect of his own , out of which later came Swinburne and Gilbert Murray , each of whom is the true British article . While Swinburne is by far the greater poet , Murray is by far the more important of the two from the ethnological point of view . Murray was the first man to talk boldly about God , and to introduce his name into all Greek myths , using it as a fair translation of any Greek adjective . There is a danger in this boldness . The reader 's attention becomes hypnotized with wondering in what manner God is to be introduced into the next verse . The reader becomes so concerned about Mr. Murray 's religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers only Shakespeare 's hostess in her distress over the dying Falstaff : ' Now I , to comfort him , bid him ' a should not think of God , ? I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet . ' Murray and Arnold are twins in ethical endeavor . I think that it was Arnold who first told the British that . Greece was noted for melancholy and for longings . He told them that chastity , temperance , nudity , and a wealth of moral rhetoric marked the young man of the Periclean period . Even good old Dean Plumplre has put this young man into his prefaces . Swill-borne added the hymeneal note , ? t he poetic nat ore-view , ? of which the following may serve as an example : There is hardly a page in Swinburne 's Hellenizing verse that does not blossom with Hymen . The passages would be well suited for use in the public schools of to-day where sex-knowledge in its poetic aspects is beginning to be judiciously introduced . This contribution of Swinburne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the word God could he introduced with effect anywhere , went like wildfire over England . They are characteristic of the latest phase of Anglo-Grecism . Gilbert Murray has , in late years , had the field to himself . He stands as the head and front of Greek culture in England . It is he , more than any one else , who is the figure-head of dramatic poetry in England to-day ; and , as such , his influence must be met , and , as it were , passed through , by the American student who is studying the Greek classics . tt The Greek genius is so different from the modern English genius that they can not understand one another . How shall we come to see this clearly ? The matter is difficult in the extreme : because we are all soaked in modern feeling , and in America we are all drenched in British influence . The desire of Britain to annex ancient Greece , the deep-felt need that the English writers and poets of the nineteenth century have shown to edge and nudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Swinburne expresses his Hellenic longings by his hymeneal strains , Mat thew Arnold by sweetness and light , Gilbert Murray by sweetness and pathos , ? and all - through the divine right of Victorian expansion . It has been a profoundly unconscious development in all these men . They have instinctively and innocently attached their little oil-can to the coat-tails of Euripides and of the other great Attic writers . They have not been interested in Greek for its own sake . They have been hit crested in the exploitations of Greece for the purpose of British consumption . Si wit , people will contend that none the writers of this school are , pro- ly speaking , professional scholars . Others will contend that professional , , , holarship is tolerable only because ii tends to promote cultivation of a non-professional kind . For instance , it was never regarded as a scholar he t he darkest-dyed Oxford experts , and debt of Cambridge is undoubtedly regarded as an amateur in Germany , because he descends to making translations . The severest classicist is able to talk only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do anything else . And yet , properly . a.eaking , these men are all scholars . urray represents popular scholarship a degree which would have shocked la t hew Arnold , just as Arnold himself would have been poison to Natick , Na tick the author of the text of Euripides . But they are all scholars , and Murray who is an Australian , and who ro0 into University prominence on the wines of University Extension , and kr , ' ugh his lyric gift rather than hronigh his learning , belongs to Oxford by race and by nature , as well as by adoption . The outsider ought not to , , , nfti , w him with the whole of Oxford , and i he whole of Oxford ought not to n him after making him the head and front of its Hellenism so far as the world it large can judge . Murray , as l'aul would say , is not the inner ONWil ; but Murray is the outer tir ? ml which the inner Oxford can not 10 , eagerly sniff at or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true-bred Itiatian of the Imperial epoch . The tendency of universities has ever been to breed cliques and secret s , , vieties , to produce embroideries and slim hothouses of specialized feeling . Ilwy do well in doing this : it is all they can do . We should look upon them as great furnaces of cult ure , largely social n their influence , which warm and nourish the general temperament of a nation . Would that in America we had a local school of classic cultivation half as interesting as this Oxford Movement , ? quaint , and non-intellectual as it is ! It is alive and it is national . While most absurd from the point of view of universal culture , it is most satisfactory from the domestic point of view , ? as indeed everything in England is . If in America we ever develop any true universities , they will have faults of their own . Their defects will be of a new strain , no doubt , and will reflect our national shortcomings . These thoughts but teach us that we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have still to grind the lenses through which we shall , in our turn , observe the classics . III Ancient religion is of all subjects in the world the most difficult . Every religion , even at the time it was in progress , was always completely misunderstood , and the misconceptions have increased with the ages . They multiply with every monument that is unearthed . If the Eleusinian mvsteries were going at full blast to-day , so that we could attend them , as we do the play at Oberammergau , t heir interpretation would still present difficulties . Mommsen and Rhode would disagree . But ten thousand years from now , when nothing survives except a line out of St. John 's Gospel and a tablet stating that Fischer played the part of Christ for three successive decades , many aut horit at ive books will be written about Oberammergau , and reputations will be made over it . Anything which we approach as religion becomes a nightmare of suggestion , and hales us hither and thither with thoughts beyond the reaches of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , approached with the idea that they are plays . This seems not to have been done often enough with Greek plays . They are regarded as examples of the sublime , as forms of philosophic thought , as moral essays , as poems , even as illustrations of dramatic law , and they are unquestionably all of these things . But they were primarily plays , ? intended to pass the time and exhilarate the emotions . They came into being as plays , and their form and make-up can best be understood by a study of the dramatic business in them . They become poems and philosophy incidentally , and afterwards : they were born as plays . A playwright is always an entertainer , and unless his desire to hold his audience overpoweringly predominates , he will never be a success . It is probable that even with " Eschyl us , ? who stands hors ligne as the only playwright in history who was really in earnest about morality , ? we should have to confess that his passion as a dramatic artist came first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both the stage traditions and the plays themselves bear this out . The fact is that it is not easy to keep people sitting in a theatre ; and unless the idea of holding their attention predominates with the author , they will walk out , and he will not be able to deliver the rest of his story . In the grosser forms of dramatic amusement ? for example , where a bicycle acrobat is followed by a comic song , we are not compelled to find any philosophic depth of idea in the sequence . But in dealing with works of great and refined dramatic genius like the Tempest , or the Bacchantes , where the emotions played upon are subtly interwoven , there will always be found certain minds which remain unsatisfied with the work of art itself , but must have it explained . Even Beethoven 's Sonatas have been supplied with philosophic addenda , ? statements of their meaning . We know how much Shakespeare 's intentions used to puzzle the Germans . Men feel that somewhere at the back of their own consciousness there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some relation . In so far as these affinities are touched upon in a manner that leaves them mysteries , we have good criticism ; but when people dogmatize about them , we have bad criticism . In the meantime the great artist goes his way . His own problems are enough for him . The early critics were puzzled to classify the Alcestis , and no wonder , for it contains many varieties of dramatic writing . For this very reason it is a good play to take as a sample of Greek spirit and Greek workmanship , It is a lit tle Greek cosmos , and it happens to depict a side of Greek thought which is sympathetic to modern sentiment , so that we seem to he at home in its atmosphere . The Alcestis is thought to be in a class by itself . And yet , indeed , under close examination . every Greek play falls into a class by itself ( there are only about forty-Ike of them in all ) , and the maker of each was probably more concerned at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he was with any formal classification which posterity might assign to his play . In the Alcestis Euripides made one of the best plays in the world , full of true pathos , full of jovial humor , both or which sometimes verge upon the Ina -- lesque . The happy ending is understood from the start , and none of the grief is painful . Alcestis herself is the good-wife of Greek household meth. who is ready to die for her husband . To this play the bourgeois takes his half-grown family . He rejoices when he hears that it is to be given . The aletirdities of the fairy-tale are accepted simply . Ileracles has his club , hat It his sword , Apollo his lyre . The women wail , Admetus whines ; there is huirmaery , there are tears , there is wit . there is conventional wrangling , itt.1 ! lila word-chopping so dear to the llediterranean theatre , which exists in all classic drama and survives in the Punch and Judy show of to-day . And ; here is the charming return of Her- ; ales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave for safe keeping , whom Admetus refuses to rm.ive for conventional reasons , but whim every child in the audience feels to he the real Alcestis , even before fieracles unveils her and gives her had : into her husband 's bosom with speeches on both sides that are like he ch ) sing music of a dream . The audience disperses at the close , feeling that it has spent a happy hour . No sonata of Mozart is more cons- ely beautiful than the Alcestis . No fontedy of Shakespeare approaches it in perfection . The merit of the piece lies not in any special idea it conveys , but entirely in the manner in which eerything is carried out . IV It is clear at a glance that the .1/eoli. , belongs to an epoch of extreme sephisi ication . Everything has been ile , ught out and polished ; every ornament is a poem . If a character has to lire words of explanation or of emyer , it is done in silver . The tone is i ; 11 die lone of cultivated society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence . The smile of V'olutire all through Greek literature ; ; Ind it was not until the age of Louis X.11. , or the Regency , that the modern . ) 1.1 ( 1 was again to know a refinement and a sophistication which recall the Greek work . Now , in one word , ? this subtlety which pleases its in matters of sentiment is the very thing that separates us from the Greek upon the profoundest questions of philosophy . Where religious or metaphysical truth is touched upon , either Greek sophistication carries us off our feet with a rapture which has no true relation to the subject , or else we are offended by it . We do not understand sophistication . The Greek has pushed . esthetic analysis further than the modern can bear . We follow well enough through the light issues , but when the deeper questions are reached we lose our footing . At this point the modern cries out in applause , ' Religion , philosophy , pure feeling , the soul ! ' ? He cries out , ' Mystic cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things over there ! ' ? Or else he cries , ' What amazing cruelty , what cynicism ! ' And yet it is none of these things , but only the artistic perfection of the work which is moving us . We are the victims of clever stage-management . The cruder intelligence is ever compelled to regard the man of complex mind as a priest or as a demon . The child , for instance , asks about the character in a story , ' But is he a good man or a bad man , papa ? ' The child must have a moral explanation of anything which is beyond his testi-lel ic comprehension . So also does the modern intelligence quest ion the Greek . The matter is complicated by yet another element , namely stage convention . Our modern stage is so different from the classic stage that we are had judges of the Greek playwright 's intentions . The quarrels which arise as to allegorical or secondary meanings in a work of art are generally connected with some unfamiliar feature of its setting . A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show how its form came into being , and thus explain its primary meaning . Such an exposition of the primary or apparent meaning is often sufficient to put all secondary meanings out of court . For instance : It is , as we know , the Germans who have found in Shakespeare a coherent philosophic intention . They think that he wrote plays for the purpose of stating metaphysical truths . The Englishman does not believe this , because the Englishman is familiar with that old English stage work . He knows its traditions , its preoccupation with story-telling , its mundane character , its obliviousness to the sort of thing that Germany has in mind . The Englishman knows the conventions of his own stage , and this protects hint from finding mare's-nests in Shakespeare . Again , ? Shakespeare 's sonnets used to be a favorite field for mystical exegesis , till Sir Sidney Lee explained their form by reference to the sixteenth-century sonnet literature of the continent . This put to flight many theories . In other words , the appeal to convention is the first duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conventions of the Classic Stage , the moderns are all in the dark . Nothing like that stage exists to-day . We are obliged to make guesses as to its intentions , its humor , its relation to philosophy . If the classics had only possessed a cabinet-sized drama , like our own , we might have been at home there . But this giant-talk , this megaphone-and-buskin method , offers us a problem in dynamics which staggers the imagination . All we can do is to tread lightly and guess without dogmatizing . The typical Athenian , Euripides , was so much deeper-dyed in skepticism than any one since t hat clay , that really no one has ever lived who could cross-question him , ? let alone expound the meanings of his plays . In reading Euripides , we find ourselves , at moments , ready to classify hint as a satirist , and at other moments as a man of feeling . Of course he was both . Sometimes he seems like a religious man , and again , like a charlatan . Of course he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13acchartes , like every other Greek play , is the result , first , of the legend , second , of the theatre . There is always some cutting and hacking , due to the difficulty of getting the legend into the building . Legends differ as to their dramat ie possi bilities , and the incidents which are to be put on the stage must be selected by the poet . The site of the play must be fixed . Above all , a Chorus must he arranged for . The choosing of a Chorus is indeed one of the main problems of the tragedian . If he can hit on a natural sort of Chorus he is a made man . In the Alcestis we saw that the whole background of grief and wailing was one source of the charm of the play . Not only are the tragic parts deepened , but the gayer scenes are set oil by this feature . If the fable provides no natural and obvious Chorus , the playwright must bring his Chorus on the stage by afro citing the imagination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends of the hero ; if the play is a marine piece , Ile uses sailors . Tim whole atmosphere of his play depends upon the happiness of his choice . In the rlgameninon the old men left - at - home form t he Chorus . There is enough dramatic power in this one idea to carry a play . It is so natural : the old men are on the spot ; they are interested ; they are the essence of the story , and yet external to it . ' These old men are , indeed , the archetype of all choruses , ? a collection of bystanders , a sort of little dummy audience . cnded to steer the great , real audi ( .11C ( into a comprehension of the play . The Greek dramatist found this very useful machine , the Chorus , at his OH , but he was , on the other hand , Iv controlled by it . It had ways of its awn : it inherited dramatic necest ins . The element of convention and theatrical usage is so very predominant in t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have in chorusnrk something that may be regarded : limns ! as a constant quality . By st tidying choruses one can arrive at an idea 4 the craft of Greek play-writing , ? env can even separate the conventional from the personal to some extent . The Greek Chorus has no mind of its own : it merely gives echo to the last dramas is thought . It goes forward and Luck , contradicts itself , sympathizes w it h all parties or none , and lives in a limbo . Its real function is to represent . I he slow-minded man in the audience . It does what he does , it interjects quesions and doubts , it delays the plot and indulges in the proper emotions during the pauses . These functions are quite limited , and were completely-understood in Greek times ; so much so , that in the typical stock tragedy of the Isehylean school certain saws , maxims . and reflections appear over and tticr main . One of them , of course , as , ' See how the will of t he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Let is be pious , and reverence something that is perhaps behind the gods themselves .

' Our feelings about right and mug must somehow be divine ; I radi/Hial morality , traditional piety , are stanchow right . ' Precisely the same reflections are orion Intl in the mouths of the subordinate characters , and for precisely t he same purpose . ' 0 may the quiet life he mine ! Give me neither poverty nor riches : for the destinies of the great . are ever uncertain . ' Temptation leads to insolence , and insolence to destruction ' ; and so forth . Such reflections serve the same purpose , by whomever they are uttered . They underscore the moral of the story and assure the spectator that he has not missed the point . As religious tragedy broadened into political and romantic tragedy , the Chorus gained a certain ' freedom in what might be called its interjectional duty , ? its duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by proper questions , and so forth . It gained also a Protean freedom in its emotional interpretations during pauses . The playwrights apparently discovered that by the use of music and dancing , t he most subtle and delicate , nay , the most whimsical varieties of lyrical mood could be conveyed to great audiences . In spite of this license , however , the old duties of the Chorus as guardians of conservative morality remained unchanged ; and the stock phrases of exhortation and warning remained de rigneur in the expectation of the audience . Their meaning had become so well-known that , by the time of iEschylus , they were expressed in algebraic terms . No man could to-day unravel a Chorus of iEschylus if only one such Chorus exist ed . The truncated phrases and elliptical thoughts are clear , to us , because we have learned their meaning through reiteration , and because they always mean the same thing . The poet has a license to provide the Chorus with dark sayings , ? dark in form , but simple in import . It was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . In the course of time such phrases became the terror of the copyists . Obscure passages became corrupt in process of transcription ; and thus we have inherited a whole class of choral wisdom which we understand well enough ( just as the top gallery understood it well enough ) to help us in our enjoyment of the play . The obscurity , and perhaps even some part of what we call ' corruption , ' are here a part of the stage convention . Now with regard to t he Bacchantes. : ? the scheme of having Maenads for a Chorus gave splendid promise of scenic effect ; and the fact that , as a logical consequence , these ladies would have to give utterance to the usual maxims of piety , mixed in with the rhapsodies of their professional madness , did not daunt Euripides . He simply makes the Chorus do the usual chorus work , without burdening his mind about character-drawing . Thus the Maenads , at moments when they are not pretending to be Mtenads , and are not singing , ' Away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and so on , are obliged to turn the other cheek , and pretend to be interest ed bystanders , ? old gaffers , wagging their beards , and quoting the book of Proverbs . The transition from one mood to t he other is done in a stroke of lightning , and seems to be independent of the music . That is , it seems to make no difference , so long as the musical schemes are filled out , whet her t he ladies are singing , ' On with the dance , let joy be unconfined ! ' or , ' True wisdom differs from sophistry , and consists in avoiding subjects that are beyond mortal comprehension . ' All such discrepancies would , no doubt , have been explained if we possessed the music ; but the music is lost . It seems , at any rate , certain that the grand public was not expected to understand the word-for-word meaning of choruses ; hence their license to be obscure . We get the same impression from the jibes of Aristophanes , whose ridicule of t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audiences could not follow t he gram mar in the lofty parts of the tragedy . They accepted the drum-roll of horror , and understood the larger grammar of tragedy , much as we are now forced to do in reading the plays . It would seem that by following t he technique of tragedy , and by giving no thought to small absurdities , Euripides got a double effect out of his Maenads and no one observed that anything was wrong . In one place he resorts to a dramatic device , which was perhaps well-known in his day , ? namely , the ' conversion ' of a bystander . After the First Messenger has given the great description of Dionysus 's doings in the mountains , the Chorus , or one of them , with overpowering yet controlled emotion , steps forward and says , ' I tremble to speak free words in the presence of my King : yet nevertheless be it said : Dionysus is no less a god than the greatest of them ! ' This reference to the duty of a subject is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of local bystanders . In the mouth of a Mrenad the proclamation is logically ridiculous ; yet so strange are the laws of what ' goes ' on the stage that it may have been effective even hore . Some of the choruses in the Bacchantes are miracles of poetic beauty , of savage passion , of liquid power . It is hard to say exactly what they are , but they are wonderful . And behind all , there gleams from the whole play a sophistication as deep as the iEgean . VI There is one thing that we should never do in dealing with anything Greek . We should not take a scrap of the Greek mind and keep on examinitm it until we find a familiar thought in it . No bit of Greek art . is to be viewed as a thing in itself . It is always a fragment . and gets its value from the whole . // Eery bit of carved stone picked up in thins is a piece of architecture ; so is i'ry speech in a play , every phrase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole Theatre or the whole 1cademy , and put back the fragment in its place by means of ladders , before you can guess at its meaning . The inordinate significance that seems to L ; leam from every broken toy of Greece , results from this very quality , ? that the object is a part of something else . . lint because the thing has no meaning he itself , it implies so much . Somehow drags the whole life of the Greek nation before you . The favorite Greek maxim , ' Avoid excess , ' does the same . It keeps telling you to remember yesterday and to-morrow ; to remember the pobrstra and the market-place ; above allto remember that the very opposite of what you say is also true . Wherever you are , and Whatever doing , you must remember the rest of the Greek world . It is no wonder that the Greeks could not adopt the standards and contrivances of other nations , while their own standards and contrivances resulted from such refined and perpetual balancing and shaving of values . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether one examines a drinking cup or a dialogue or a lyric , and whether the thing be from the age of Homer or from the age of Alexander , the fragment always gives us a glimpse into the same Greek world . The foundal ion of this world seems to be the Myt h ; and as the world grew it develoml in terms of Myth . The Greek mind had only one background . Athletics and Statuary , Epic and Drama , Religion and Art , Skepticism and Science expressed themselves through the S mu . myths . In this lies the fascinatium of Greece for us . What a complete cosmos it is ! And how different , fr , m any other civilization ! Modern like modern language , is a monVOL. /74- NO. 1 strous amalgam , a conglomeration and mess of idioms from every age and every clime . The classic Greek hangs together like a wreath . It has been developed rapidly , during a few hundred years , and has an inner harmony like the temple . Language and temple , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way , perfect . Consider wherein Rome differed from Greece . The life of the Romans was a patchwork , like our own . Their religion was formal , their art imported , their literature imitative , their aims were practical , their interests unimaginative . All social needs were controlled by political considerations . This sounds almost like a description of modern life ; and it explains why the Romans are so close to us . Cicero , Horace , Caesar , Antony , are moderns . But Alcibiades , Socrates , Pericles , and the rest take their stand in Greek fable . Like Pisistratus , Solon , and Lycurgus , they melt into legend and belong to the realms of the imagination . No other people ever bore the same relation to their arts that the Greeks bore ; and in this lies their charm . When the Alexandrine critics began to classify poetry and to discuss perfection , they never even mentioned the Roman poetry , although all of the greatest of it was in existence . Why is this ? It is because no Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of view . It is too individual , too clever , and , generally , too political . Besides , it is not in Greek . The nearest modern equivalent to the development of the whole Greek world of art is to be found in German contrapuntal music . No one except a German has ever written a true sonata or a symphony , in the true polyphonic German style . There are tours de force done by other nationalities ; but the natural idiom of this music is Teutonic .
