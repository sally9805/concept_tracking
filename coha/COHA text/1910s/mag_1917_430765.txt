 | EARLY in August Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo descended suddenly on the Finance Committee of the Senate and announced that the costs of the war had risen so rapidly it would be necessary to extend the sums previously estimated for this year . The committee had about completed its draft of a bill that would have provided war revenues of over $1,665,000,000 . It at once set out to supplement this so as to make the amount reach $2,000,000,000 . Actually it has gone a little beyond that figure . The additional $330,000,000 required is not of serious consequence in itself , but interesting in its relation to the sum total of all revenue taxes before the war . Very nearly all of the emergency tax will be taken from incomes and from liquor . Thus corporate incomes contribute another $162,000 , - 000 ; surtax on individual incomes $27,500 , - 000 , and liquor taxes $114,000,000 . To complete the bill quickly lines of least tax resistance had to be followed . The Senate bill differs materially from the House bill in principle as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield $1,867,000,000 . It relieves the small taxpayer of a few obligations which the Senate bill places on him . On the other hand it would impose some unjust burdens . The greater fairness seems to be found within the recommendations of the Senate . The margin of justice between the two measures has been the subject of debate during the second half of August . The battleground is the tax on corporation profits . There is no dispute over the fairness of taking from those who make from the war a very liberal slice of what they have made . The attitude of the Senate is summed up in this statement : In fixing the rates on incomes and excess profits your committee kept constantly in mind the fact that the amount of revenue derived from these sources would depend upon the prosperity and activity of business , and that to impose taxes which would tend to discourage enterprise and dampen these activities would tend to defeat the legislative purpose . This is the stock argument of the corporation . There is a good deal of truth in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of estimating excess profits is wrong . These are regulated according to the " average net profits of the taxable person or corporation during the three years 1911 , 1912 , and 1913 . " This is termed the " pre-war period . " The corporation that was prosperous in those years , and many were , would have a high average of profits to compare with when it submitted its schedule for 1917 . On the other hand , the concern that had been through a period of lean years and had gained a sudden accession of wealth during the war would have an unfortunate base of comparison . From the House bill the Senate has stricken the iniquitous retro-active tax . This would have produced $108,000,000 . It would have done many times this damage to business through loss of confidence , and through inability to determine what amounts a manufacturer should set aside as reserve or distribute in dividends or to enlargement of facilities . The Lenroot amendment placing a very high surtax on incomes over $40,000 was eliminated , though this would have added $66,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surtax is enlarged from $15,000 upwards . The normal tax on incomes has been increased from 2 to 4 per cent . This compares with the original enactment of 1 per cent . Income to individuals up to $3000 , if single , and $4000 if married , with the new provision of $200 for each dependent child , is taxed 4 per cent . in excess of these exemption figures . The minimum exemption calls for a 2 per cent . tax for a single individual whose income exceeds $1000 up to $3000 . Above $5000 a 1 per cent . surtax applies up to $7500 and 2 per cent . to $10,000 and 4 per cent . to $15,000 . From $15,000 to $20,000 the surtax is increased from 5 to 6 per cent . ; $20,000 to $40,000 from 6 to 8 per cent . ; $40,000 to $60,000 8 to 10 per cent . ; $60,000 to $80,000 from 11 to 12 per cent. ; $80,000 to $100,000 from 14 to 16 per cent . ; $100,000 to $150,000 from 17 to 20 per cent. ; $150,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $250,000  | from 24 to 26 per cent. ; $250,000 to $300 , - 000 from 27 to 29 per cent. ; $300,000 to $500,000 from 30 to 31 per cent. , and $500 , - 000 , 33 per cent . This is the maximum tax application on individual incomes proposed in the Senate bill . It was recognized by the Senate committee that a tax on the gross manufacturing sales of automobiles would greatly disturb the trade for as many as 80 per cent . were making but small profit . So this tax has been passed to the owner of motors . It is 1 per cent . on the listed retail price , or $5 for a machine costing $500 . The movingpicture show has become a national institution . It possesses many valuable educational features . It is largely patronized by people of small means . So the original tax proposal is dropped . Also that of 5 per cent . on electricity , telephones , and gas . Here are ! two instances where the Senate has shown more consideration for the small taxpayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that the last-named tax " would fall with very great severity on people of moderate means as well as on the poorest classes . " It was the opinion of the committee that a tax of this sort ought to be avoided " unless a point was reached where it would become necessary to tax everything susceptible to taxation . " The munitions tax is dropped . It was the first of the war revenue measures to be enacted . So is the tax on estates and on insurance . Just why the tax on chewing-gum is annulled is not indicated . Of the whole sum to be raised by taxation as war revenue nearly $1,500,000,000 is from the corporate and individual concerns , or $720,000,000 , and $748,000,000 from war profits , and $270,000,000 from rectified and distilled spirits , from fermented and malt liquors and from wines . In these three groups may be found the source of 85 per cent . of the tax provided . The other large items are taxes from tobacco , from transportation rail , and water , and from oil , taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on cosmetics , pills , powders , and syrups , stamp taxes on documents and checks , on messages , and excise taxes on tea , coffee , cocoa , and sugar . There will be a strong demand that future issues of government bonds be taxed . It is recognized that the already great mass of untaxed wealth in the form of State , municipal and government securities and exempted property imposes an unfair burden on those subject to taxation on necessities of life and that to let this amount grow , as it will under Government borrowing and loans to Europe , would be an unsafe financial policy . The method of adjusting the tax so as not to reduce the purchasing power of those who contribute most heavily to the loans must be worked out carefully . The experience of England has been that her taxable bonds have been in much greater favor than those giving the exemption privilege but bearing a lower interest rate . Taxation will not accomplish all that the Government desires . Much more will have to be raised through the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be approximately 25 per cent . taxes and 75 per cent . bonds . There is a radical element which subscribes to the doctrine that the division should be 50-50 . By September the call for subscription to a second Government loan will have gone forth . This will be for $3,000,000,000 , with the interest rate likely to be maintained at 3% per cent . In some respects it is going to be easier to get support for this loan than for the original one . The farmers will be in a better position to take bonds as their season will be ending and their financial requirements less than in May and June . The country generally appreciates the existence of war where sections had only a remote attachment to it a few months ago , or before troops actually landed in France .. The machinery of bond-selling , or loan propaganda , is better controlled and it exerts a greater voltage . A handicap may be the slight discount at which the Liberty Bonds are quoted on the New York market . Those who bought these bonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculative profit . The response was nearly 100 per cent . patriotism . As bearing on the cost of the war , now nearly $120,000,000 a day , it is worth repeating that the first $7,000 , - 000,000 request of the Secretary of the Treasury , which will provide for less than half a year 's requirements , equalled the whole cost of the Napoleonic wars . What tends to bring up the daily cost to the United States is the huge advances being made to Great Britain and to those nations which she has been supplying with funds for the past two years . These advances have been $4,000,000,000 . Practically this entire amount will have to be transferred within the next six or eight months to the shoulders of Uncle Sam .
