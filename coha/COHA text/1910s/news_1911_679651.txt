txt A few days ago His Honor the Mayor took occasion to say some plain , true , sound words about the way in which the merit system worked in securing the very best man for the very important post of Fire Chief . He pointed out that the baleful influence of politics and every other that could prevent the kind of choice that was actually made had been eliminated by the honest and Intelligent application of that system . The best of the men likely to make a good Chief had undergone , In open and fair competition , a searching and expert Inquiry into their relative merit and fitness , and the result was the selection of an appointee whose extraordinary excellence was most heartily recognized by those who know most about him and about his duties . Now there is proposed for the City of New York a charter , the provisions of which as to the civil service weaken , undermine or entirely vitiate some of the most valuable features of the merit system . We waive , for the moment , the removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the concentration of control of it in the hands of whomsoever may happen to be Mayor . That removal the Mayor may approve In the consciousness that he would try to use such control wisely and faithfully , though if he could disregard his own connection with the matter we think he would look on the change with a good deal of distrust as to how it would work . But no attachment to the abstract theory of " home rule , " it seems to us , can blind him to the pernicious and risky provisions of the proposed charter as to other civil service matters . Take , for example , Section 240 of Chapter VII. , relating to appointments and removals . Under this every subordinate whose appointment is directed by any statute and every head of a bureau , outside of the Police , Fire , and Street Cleaning Departments , shall be appointed " without restriction or limitation " and may " at pleasure " be removed by the head of the office in which he is classed . That is to say , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present regulated by law are filled by competition are to be turned over to the " pleas ure " of the upper officeholders and subjected , undefended , to the full force of that pull and pressure which Mr. GAYNOR rejoiced to see banished from the choice of a Fire Chief . For removals " at pleasure " all that need be said is that removals at discretion , for any reason which the superior is willing to put on record , may be made under the present law . No change whatever is needed to give any resolute and honest head of an office all the power of removal needed . But appointments " without restriction or limitation " will surely be made practically by the machine for party or personal reasons . Such a provision would give complete rein to a. bad Mayor , would make of a weak Mayor simply the tool of Tammany , and would increase a thousandfold the troubles and difficulties of an honest Mayor trying to give a decent administration to the city . Again , in the proposed charter extra power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of competition . All one of them needs to do is to rearrange the subordinates , gather them into a new bureau , and the trick is done . Mr. GArson 's retentive memory will recall a multitude of instances in which such power would be fatal to effective and straight administration . Still again the proposed charter gives to each head of department power to obtain expert or professional service without advertisement or public hearing , and persons thus employed are taken out of the control of the Civil Service Commission . There are other features of this charter which will be brought to public attention . Their effect on the merit system is beyond question mischievous and in some directions destructive . It is in the power of the Mayor to approve or , by opposing , end them . If he asks how far they comply with the standard of the Fire Chief examination , how far they would help or hinder the application of that splendid standard to the general service of the city , there can , logically , be no doubt as to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
