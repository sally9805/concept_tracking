 | IN June of 1916 I arrived in Petrograd , whither I had been sent by the United States Department of Commerce , as commercial attache to the American embassy . The warm welcome which I received from Ambassador Francis , who as a business man of long expetience was deeply interested in developing our commercial relations with Russia , heartened me and made my desire still keener to know Russian economic conditions thoroughly and to correctly interpret to American business men the opportunities for their capital , enterprise , and goods which Russia afforded . I little knew what events were in store : that the young Chicagoan who sat opposite to me as my secretary would shortly become an officer in American expeditionary . forces in Russia ; that the whole structure of the bureaucracy in the government ministries and of Russian commercial and industrial life , with which it was my task to cultivate and build up friendly relationships , would presently be swept aside . I had come to Russia to aid in construction ? to promote colnmerce ? I did not dream that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social laboratory where vivisection wouId be practised with a vengeance . In the months that followed I had opportunity to visit most of the commercial centres of European Russia , from Archangel , on the White Sea , to Odessa , on the Black , and Petrograd , on the Baltic , to Baku , on the Caspian . March and April of 1918 were spent in Siberia , chiefly in Irkutsk . June in 1916 was the period of the " White Nights " in Petrograd , when the sun is down only from half past nine in the evening until two in the morning , but the sky , viewed from the bank of the wide Neva , filled the whole night through with a succession of wonderful and indescrib- able hues . The signs of war were , however , everywhere at hand , and the relatively underdeveloped apparatus of industry and transportation heavily overloaded by war demands ; society in Petrograd was quite changed from the normal with fathers and sons at the front and daughters in the hospitals . The casualties were very great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember now . On Russian Christmas Day ( thirteen days after our own ) a colonel in one of the Guards regiments , who was the husband of the lady from whom I had rented my furnished apartment , called upon me , and , standing before the fireplace , said : " Yes , we of the Guards are responsible for the killing of Rasputin , and we do not care who knows it ? they wo n't do anything about it ? and if the Empress does n't mend her ways I 'll not be responsible for her either . " On New Year 's Day the entire diplomatic corps were taken from the private station in Petrograd in an imperial train to Tsarskoe Selo . There , in the great Catharine ballroom of the palace , with a Tur. key-red carpet on the floor , and the ceiling painted with goddesses and cupids , brilliantly illuminated with lights and mirrors along the wall , we were presented by our ambassador , like the young men of all the other foreign missions , to his Imperial Majesty , Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small stature with a weak but kindly face . Within two months the Czar had abdicated , the only line of executive authority in Russia was broken , and the struggle for democracy was on . As the months passed we in Petrograd watched Russia go from one tyranny , through the gamut of revolutionary experiments , to a worse tyranny . The untrained Russian people ? whom a geographical and historical tragedy of isolation , vastness , and  | tyranny , had divided into a " lower ninetenths , " relatively illiterate , underfed , and poor , separated by a wide chasm from the " upper one-tenth , " versatile , outwardly western European , but , because denied participation in government , theoretical and lacking experience and initiative ? could not find and hold democratic equilibrium , but rushed on toward anarchy , to end in Bolshevism . Bolshevism , the vulture which feeds on anarchy of mind and hunger of belly , settled down on the body of a prostrate and exhausted people . Promising peace , land , and bread , it has fulfilled none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cause of its failure is absolute immorality . Not five per cent of the people of Russia are to-day behind it . It has betrayed the true Russian revolution , and is devoid of anv moral force whatever . Lest I be thought overconservative , let me add that it is not for its hodgepodge radical programme on paper that I denounce Bolshevism as immoral . Some features of that programme are debatable ? most are pure folly ? but it is for its conscienceless and violent method in cramming this programme down people 's throats , for its absolute lack of any principle except the principle of any means to my end . Bolshevism in its conceit attempts to serve both God and Mammon , receiving the Kaiser 's money freely while insisting that it is working to overthrow him . And now , what is the present state of the country after a year of Bolshevik rule ? It would require more space than is available here to take this subject up in detail . Following are , however , the main features : To begin with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been turned upside down . The former governing elements are now at the bottom , undergoing persecution , and the lowest elements are at the top , trying to govern by terror , The Bolshevik government was never very firm , but there was a brief period when it enjoyed a sort of authority in various parts of the country . Now that Bolshevism is no longer recognized br the masses as their movement , the real authority of the central Bolshevik government does not extend beyond Moscow . There is practically entire absence of production , and the country has exhausted its stocks . The local soviets go their own way , obeying when they please and opposing the central authority when it suits them . As a matter of fact the central authority , having founded its power on demagogy , is not able to issue any orders of a constructive or restraining kind . Many so-called " bourgeois " have been invited by the Bolsheviks to accept positions in their ministries . One of my friends , who was an engineer of ability , quite neutral in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the Commissariats , after having consulted with the members of the All-Russian Association of Engineers , to which he belonged . He was well treated by the members of the Bolshevik government , who promised him their full support . Just as soon , however , as he wished to initiate certain reforms in personnel in his office , agitators amongst the staff threatened the authorities with a strike , and the latter gave in . Finding it impossible to accomplish anything , my engineer friend resigned . As indicative of the same anarchy , the case may be cited of the official American party leaving Russia . We arrived in Petrograd with our passports properly viseed by the Bolshevik central authority . " The Commune of the North , " which is the name of the terroristic government in Petrograd , refused to recognize the vise on our passports , and we were held on the side-track in the Finland Station for four days . The Bolshevik tyranny is more terrible than anything the imperial regime ever dreamed of . It is useless to recount instances here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Counter-Revolution are too well known through the newspapers . A representative of the Bolshevik Foreign Office told Ambassador Francis one day in Vologda that the educated classes of Russia were falsely educated and , therefore , must be annihilated . This policy is being put into effect with an intensity which is only limited by lack of organization and time .  | The banking and credit system is smashed . The banks have all become agencies of the People 's Bank of the Russian Republic . Accounts have been confiscated , the books are in a terrible condition , no one has any idea of the solvency of the banks , although they must be in many cases ruined several times over . They are merely agencies for the paying out of paper money , chiefly for the uses of " government departments , " and for paying labor in the factories . This money never returns and there is no circulation . As for newspapers , there are none execpt the Bolshevik organs . They are , of course , purely propaganda sheets , badly run , where every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation-wide strike about to usher in a social revolution in these countries . The front pages of the papers are filled with vitriolic articles urging the people to wipe out the " bourgeois , " who continue to exist somehow and co-operate with the Czecho-Slovaks and the imperialistic Allies against the true will of the people ! The railways continue to run where fighting does not prevent this , and on the line from Moscow to Petrograd there were even International sleeping-cars . There is very little movement of freight . The trains are few , and conditions grow worse from day to day because of the wearing out of locomotives and cars which can not be replaced . Side-tracks and roundhouse yards are filled with locomotives needing comparatively slight repairs to make them useful , but which repairs can not be executed for the lack of material and willing labor . That the railroads run at all is due to the good habits , inertia , and the necessity of earning money of the employees , but beyond As to town life , this is essentially " bourgeois " life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but up to September 1st it hung on in the larger centres with a remarkable pertinacity ; that is to say , there were still one or two theatres in Moscow ; the tram-cars running , if very badly ; there was a modicum of " izvozchiks , " or cabmen , with run-down horses . Shops were mostly open , but had little to sell . All staple articles had been consumed long since . The shelves were literally empty as soon as one passed the door . From day to day goods would appear in the window , which had been kept in hiding , in the measure that the proprietor needed money for his personal life . Currency was very scarce and change hard to secure . Most pitiful was the plight of the " Intelligentsia , " whose savings had mostly been taken with the confiscation of the banks , and whose incomes were cut off . People of the greatest refinement , and who have been strugglers all their lives for liberal ideals , are living in cramped quarters without sufficient to eat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing down one after another for lack of raw materials to work on . The great textile industry round about Moscow is nearly dead for lack of cotton . The winter is adding to these horrors . There is an insufficiency of fuel in Petrograd and Moscow . The German scheme cut off Ukraine with its coal and grain , and the Caucasus with its petroleum . Conditions in Turkestan have been so bad that the cotton-crop there is very small , even if it could be transported . There is grain enough in western Siberia to alleviate the starvation in northern  | Russia could it be transported and afterward properly distributed . No question is more often asked than : " When will Russia get on her feet ? " " When will she have order and decent government ? " By this I suppose the average American means : " When will there be democratic equilibrium so that the country may be properly regarded as a self-contained democracy able to stand alone ? " The answer is clear ? when the lower nine-tenths have received commonschool education . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most intensive methods . It must be remembered that Russia is vast and that the processes which we are witnessing are historical processes , of which the unit of time is not months or years but generations . It should be noted , however , that the war has had a pronounced educative effect on hundreds of thousands of men who had never been away from their villages before but have now seen something of town life and , perhaps , even of the enemy countries . These men are undoubtedly having an influence in their villages . Nevertheless , it should not be forgotten that their minds have been filled with an extremely radical hodgepodge of ideas which are by no means yet digested and hardly to be called sound education for life . Long before real democratic equilibrium is achieved , however , there must be , in the interest of the world , order and progress in Russia . Indeed , only in an atmosphere of order can education proceed . Such order can only be brought about by aid from without . Russia can not save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people get together and put down the Bolsheviks ? " Like the Insurrectionists , who were described by the driver of Nat Goodwin 's jaunting-car in Ireland , they are against the tyranny and ready to strike , but unfortunately have not done so because they are afraid of the police ! The lower nine-tenths are too amorphous , and they are like sheep without a shepherd , because the upper one-tenth are not fitted by history or training to be leaders . They lack energy and they lack cohesion . Several thousand officers , for instance , are arrested by the Bolsheviks on a trumped-up charge , and put into a riding academy , where they are held for days without sufficient water and food , or any bodily conveniences . The buildings are guarded by a few Red Guards with rifles . A little courage and decision would rush the door , strangle these guards barehanded and effect liberation of all inside , but it is not done . They would not know what to do after they got out . They will remain on the damp earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage awaiting'whatever the Extraordinary Committee for Combating the CounterRevolution has in store for them . Russia can not get on her feet alone . There will be no crystallization without a nucleus of foreigners from without . She is a problem- demanding the highest statesmanship from the League of Nations . The awakened international social consciousness of the world can not turn its back on Russia , even though it be a white man 's burden , and , like forestry in that the full fruits of our work will be for our grandchildren . Humanitarianism and economic interests are both potent reasons for aiding Russia , but a still graver reason is to " make the world safe for democracy . " It will not be safe as long as Russia goes ' on like a volcano , occasionally throwing hot lava on everything roundabout . Order must be established in Russia ( r ) to stamp out Bolshevism and its attendant tyranny and cruelty ; ( 2 ) to feet and clothe a miserable people , and ( 3 ' , to bridge over the long period of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tc produce such order the League of Nations must furnish active military ant economic aid on the grandest scale eves known . In this work America shout ( have the leading role , for several reasons First , because we have not exhauster our resources of idealism , men , and materials . In this connection , a prominent British liberal told me in London that he believed we should have the chiel task in helping Russia because the best brains in England have been sacrificed or the battle-field ? to such an extent , he thought , that England might be worse governed in the coming years than she has been in the past . From a more practical standpoint , it is my persona . experience that the Russian and Amer- ican temperaments are very compatible . W are free from entangling traditions , and we have invested relatively so little money in Russia that we can scarcely be accused of going there to collect debts , which is the accusation brought , however unfairly , against the British and the French . In this connection I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business possibilities for the future , but that would be absolutely a false policy , and putting the cart before the horse , for any country to go into Russia with the prime object of " collecting debts . " Such a course would only end in disaster and the debts would never be collected . If Russia is put on her feet and supported by the League of Nations , and her productivity restored and increased , she can pay her debts over a fair period of time without the slightest embarrassment , and while becoming wealthy herself . Economic without military assistance is useless in a country so torn with strife and so completely anarchical as Russia . Russia can not be conquered ; her goodwill must be won ; but , in this , potential force , under tactful leaders as the ultimate appeal in emergency , is vital . Why send an economic mission to Russia only to have them arrested or annihilated ? Food alone will not produce permanent equilibrium . There was food in Samara , but as soon as the Czecho-Slovak nucleus was removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized about it . In Archangel there is plenty of food , but now that the question of starvation has been solved the parties are already wrangling about the question of power . It must never be lost from view that Russia is the country of a tragedy , like Poland and Ireland , and that in these countries the mentality of protest is developed to a high degree . Mentality of protest is concerned with struggling ? sometimes for generations ? against an evil , and finishes by becoming so used to struggling that is has no plans for the time when its object has been reached . Liberal men in America will hesitate , perhaps , to enter upon the far-reaching course of military and economic aid which must be furnished to save Russia . They fear the responsibility and the reproaches of Bolsheviks and similar people , who will call them tyrants and imperialists . Modern liberalism suffers a little from the mentality of protest itself . For years it found it possible to co-operate with radicalism toward the elimination of certain evils . The conclusion ? at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly brought this about in the downfall of autocracy and the freeing of subject peoples . Now , what are we going to do about it ? If one may be pardoned such an inaccurate term , I think the liberalism of protest of the past should go ? to be replaced by the executive liberalism of the present . With the example of the Russian liberal Kerensky before us , let us avoid his historical error ? the inability to be consciously sure of his liberalism , to stand firm and cry " halt . " He could not bring himself to make the great decision and oppose the Bolsheviks because he shared with them the mentality of protest and regarded them as fellow strugglers . He spared Bolsheviks ' lives and sacrificed his country . The Bolsheviks undermined and engulfed him and his government , and since they have gotten the power have shown no such tenderness toward their opponents . The restoration of Russia will be the the work of years , and we must be training the thousands of Americans who will be needed in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are simply too few brains to carry on the work which must be done . When several of my Allied colleagues in Moscow praised the objects of the co-operative movement to its leader , the moderate Socialist Berkenheim , in Moscow , he replied : " There is nothing wrong with the plan of our organization , but we have n't the people to run it " ? " lyudei nyetu " ( no people ) . There is everywhere this woeful lack of trained people , not only for the highest positions , but for all positions of responsibility . There are too few foremen , bookkeepers , clerks , office-boys , skilled mechanics ? the people who do the daily work of life . The men in the economic and military units sent to Russia could , under a proper course of training , learn much of the language and life of the country , and be ultimately highly useful and indispensable in America 's " Russian service .
