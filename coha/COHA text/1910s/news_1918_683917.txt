txt The biggest ' gun in the war is that of sound finan6e -- so - mounted and bandied that it can fire Perpetually or to thetind of the battle or the finish of the war . General Foch cables America : " Above all money is the sinew of the war . " That gun of sound finance must be.mounted upon production and an:indebtedness which can be met , principal and interest , from production . ? It is the production ' froin brain and hand that attains the result . You do riot throw your gun , at-the enemy except in Russia . You keep your gins working , and , guns and shells in steady , production behind for replacement The ' factory continually replenishing is part of the gun . The shipway and the shipyards are ' essential parts defending and renewing gunners and guns : . The railroad , coatmine and the oil well and refinery are all parts of the gun in its basal supply . The confiscation by taxation  --  and the power to tax is always the power-to destroy  --  or other methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine and the steel mill or the railway may be the destruction of the gun by destroying its sufficient support . ' WEALTH IS PRODUCTION All wealth is based upon profitable production and reproduction . There is no wealth in gold or silver below or above ground unless the gold or silver be put to use in connecting the forms of production . If a man were docimed to hold in idleness all the gold and silver in the world , he would be the poorest slave in the world , for he could neither eat it , wear it , norturn it . On a golden floor with a silver roof he would be worse oft ' than the animals of the field . Gold as money or its representative is only a credit in accounting . It pays ' the coal miner on Saturday night by a credit he transfers to his grocer . His employer gets another credit as he delivers the coal to the railroad or consumer . The consumer transfers part of his weekly wage credit to the bringer of his fuel . And thus goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credits are the lines of metal- or honor by which the transfer of things produced is most easily effected . ; The metal in modern civilization , while basal , is never 10% of the whole . More than 90% is credit founded upon honor and confidence and insured by ? that less than 10% of metal . Confiscate the metal , break the confidence , put repudiation'in azfd place of honor the structurefalls . Thee men return to barter with tremendous ' loss- in effective individual production . ROW TO DESTROY VALUES UNDER CREDITS - Taxes may be so laid that in raising ' three billienS you may destroy thirtybillions , of valuei . If you permanently remove - three ' billions of normal earnings you perznanently destroy , ' on per , annum ' - income basis ; individuals , bankers , governments and organized society . Unless restored , those values can not be the basis for bond subscriptions or credit extended to the Government . Suppose the-Vanderbilt family to be worth a billion in premium railroad shares . Their credit is good at the bank to borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when railroadshares are selling at 30% to 50% of their sound values and former prices and still declining , the individual fortunes that might be used to sustain the Government credit in war , are not available . Patriotic individuals have sold shares recently at less than one-third their fOrmer price to subscribe to Liberty Loans . If a workman accumulating a thousand dollars , in savings , invests in an orchard which pays him $100 or $200 a year and the Government tells him to turn into its Treasury two-thirds of the fruit , then . two-thirds of the value is gone from his orchard should he desire to establish credit thereon at the bank and subscribe to a Liberty bond . But if the Government waited until the value of that fruit had been expanded by transportation and distribution to the door of the consumer and there levied the same amount in taxes , it would be but a few cents and scarcely noticed by the individual consumers of the fruit . The orchard value and the enterprise of its owner would remain . Thet Government would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tax would be collected from many and from a larger value , for the value of the product is many times greater at the door of the consumer than at the door of the producer . Taxes upon production are also uneconomic because they tend to enhancement in primary prices which are multiplied in transportation and distribution . MUST INCREASE PRODUCTION In war time we must increase production of all kinds not hamper or destroy , for consumption must be largely increased . Wages are increased and the earners of increased wages must consume and may easily pay welldistributed taxes . They may elect their forms of payment by choice in consumption . Hence in principles of taxation , the more luxurious the fruit or vintage the higher the tax . Taxes on champagne never hurt the vineyards of France , but . English ground rent taxes on potatoes at the point of production ruined Ireland and scattered the Irish over the earth to make bone and muscle for the upbuilding of other countries . The French are the greatest economists , and they tax the fruit and the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption . They know better than to tax the bee in his period of production , but they will tax honey and collect from the man who consumes it . No soil equals that of France in yield of fruit per acre . France is putting more men , more guns and more steel into this war in proportion to wealth and man-power than any other nation . Yet its cost per.capita in fighting is the lowest in the world . The cost per manpower and horsepower in the United States will be the highest in the world . In a long war , we may emerge with a greater per capita of indebtedness than any of our allies . Unsound finance not only jeopardizes our success in the war , but our success in reconstruction and in the world 's trade after the war . Hence the importance of sound finance as the biggest gun in the war . HOW TO PUT EVERYTHING IN Our finance should be so constructed as to enable us to fight a perpetual war . The nation should be as the individual eating his daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national and individual economics and desired fully to co-operate in national defence for the common good , the United States , without raising prices , could put a billion a month into the war and later two billion a month and be every month stronger as a nation As an extravagant nation we have been saving half a billion a month . The man . woman and child power of this nation has never produced more than half that of which it is capable , nor has it ever saved , to half its capacity . We could double our savings at the start to n billion a month , put it all in the war and properly promise ourselves the interest thereupon from our future production and then we could double the production of our hands and carry on a perpetual war of national defence and maintain all our past production both of steel roads , highways . motors , public buildings , etc . Where eight and ten hours are now n day 's work , the machinery could be worked in three shifts of eight hours a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made so that until others could be trained there could be two shifts of twelve hours each and the machinery kept going . Patriotic farmers could plow , and sow early and late , and the women and children would laugh as they gathered the bountiful harvests and strengthened their muscles for the work and play of the future . Eliminate all idleness of machinery and man in war time and carry out the pledge of President Wilson in the fight for freedom and we win the war and our own future the moment the program is inaugurated , whatever be the time it takes to record the victory . Germany is fighting : to the last man and the last dollar and the last prisoner that she can enslave to work , to impose her war aims on the world before the might of America has been thrown into the scale . She started the conquest of France forty-seven years ago with an army of 450,000 men and collected at Paris the billion dollar cost . She started this war for world conquest with ten times as many men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . She raised a second army of 4,500,000 , now being fed out before the guns of the allies as cannon fodder . But a third army of 4,500,000 is for her an impossibility . To an international banker in position to know the facts , of finance and forces on both sides of the water , this proposition was recently propounded : " Could Germany pay five million men for the whole of France including Paris and the Channel ports ? " The answer was prompt : " She could not afford it because she has not got them " THE WAY TO PEACE Now the best way to peace is not the way the Kaiser is fighting . The best way is the answer of America with her biggest gun , that : First  --  We also have put everything into the war and are  --  not dependent upon a single drive  --  or a month of battle , but we have so arranged our finances , our big guns , that we Can fight forever . Second  --  Your socialistic propaganda shall not tie the feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W.'ism born in Germany .. Fourth  --  We will have no part . in the Bolshevikism you promoted to the destruction of Russia . Fifth  --  We know our man power , our steel power and our financial power and we.will so co-ordinate them that the defense of freedom and democracy shall be a perpetual defense both on land and sea and overseas .
