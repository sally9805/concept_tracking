Mysticism : A Study in the Nature and Development of Man 's Spiritual Consciousness . By Evelyn Underhill , New York : E. P. Dutton &; Co. $5 net . With the modest title of An Introduction to Mysticism , we are here offered an unusually complete guide to the interior or hidden life , admirable alike for its restrained style and for its balanced treatment of a subject which has been so often associated with quite the opposite qualities . After the vagaries of the so-called New Thought one is relieved to find so sane a study of what has been the old thought upon the transcendental order . The distinction between the sensible and the supersensible furnishes that valid double interpretation which is generally characteristic of this book . Any experience in the mystic way , we are told , may be looked at from two points of view : we may see it , with the psychologist , as a moment in the history of mental development , governed by the more or less mechanical laws which so conveniently explain to him the psychic life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may see it as a step toward that goal of mystical activity where there is " everywhere one Being , one Life . " Taking , then , as her point of departure the assumption that the supersensible is somehow important , and can be influenced by the activities of man , the author makes an ingenious approach to the heights of transcendentalism by an appeal to that half-way house inhabited by the Vitalists . Vitalism is called the first contribution of the twentieth century to the history of man 's quest of " reality , " and is rightly described as being in its theory of knowledge close to that of the mystics . It is , moreover , a brilliant stroke to describe Driesch and Bergson and Eucken as having turned materialism inside out in that they present to us the universe as an expression of life , not life as an expression and by-product of the universe . It is true that the Vitalists in their theory of knowledge are close to the mystics , but it will not do to over-em , phasize that fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or spiritual principle , but does not lose sight of the physical organism ; Bergson employs intuition but bases it upon biology ; and Eucken calls upon the life of the spirit but does not forget the lower of the two levels  --  the natural . In their theory of knowledge these men may be idealists , in their theory of being they are realists , and would scarcely agree with the statement that the only escape from skepticism is by recourse to man 's innate but strictly irrational instinct for that " Real above all reason , beyond all thought . " This is only one side , even of mysticism , for elsewhere the author herself acknowledges that there is a dual character to the spiritual consciousness : first , there is the union with Life , with the World of Becoming ; and parallel with it the illumination by which the mystic " gazes upon a more veritable world . " Here , as generally throughout the book , the writer uses a consistent parallelism : the transcendental is her quest , but the temperamental is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it known that all mystics come from the same country . It is a safe road that has two straight sides , fixed lines that lie in strict parallelism . Hence in the succeeding chapter on mysticism and psychology it is unfortunate that the description of the former in the terms of the latter is so strongly disparaged . We may agree in deploring the tendency of popular psychology to personify and exalt the subconscious ; Americans know too well how the subliminal self has been turned into a waste-basket for all sorts of rubbish . Yet it seems going too far to say , after using the works of Cutten and Starbuck and James , that , - when science attempts to lift the veilpf Isis , she leaves only her dirty finger-marks behind . But such disparagement is perhaps more strictly directed against the French school and the researches of Murisier , Janet , and Ribot , who strive to find a pathological taint in all mystic experiences . The sanity of true mysticism may be shown , as here , by the comparative method . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Madame Guyon , the Germans have had the more virile representatives , such as Suso and Tauler . In the chapter on the characteristics or mysticism an interesting attempt is made to substitute for William James 's celebrated four marks of the mystic state another set of four , less inclusive , but possibly more precise . True mysticism is declared to be active and practical , not passive and theoretical ; its aims wholly transcendental and spiritual ; its object one of love , not of exploration ; its goal , not intellectual realization , but a form of enhanced life . In general , the mark of the real practitioner is not to know about but to be , and , it is illogically added , it is the art of establishing one 's conscious relation with the Absolute . But how can one be in conscious relation and yet , as is said earlier , deny that possible knowledge is to be limited to any process of " mtellectation " ? As Benjamin Franklin would say ? " This is a kind of light about which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any intellectual element in the mystic process is a pitfall : besides causing a neglect of the historic stage of illumination it does not fully agree with what is offered as one of the best modern definitions of mysticism as " in essence the concentration of all the forces of the soul upon a supernatural object " ; it also compels the author to push from the mystic ladder the Christian Platonists and mystical philosophers , who are described as being no more mystics than the milestones on the Dover road are travellers to Calais . Pointing out the ccnfusing fact of an initial similarity of expression between many of the proceedings of the mystic and of the occultist , the author passes from the spurious to the genuine phenomena of the movement . In this second part of the book on the Mystic Way , the main strength of this study is shown in its thorough familiarity with the literature of Western mysticism from the beginnings of the Christian era to the death of William Blake . The dry facts of that period are given in a valuable appendix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Awakening , the Purification , and the Illumination of the self as drawn from the classic sources . Here , besides previously untranslated fragments from Meister Eckhart and Mechtild of Magdeburg , there are copious extracts from such exquisite " tasters of supreme experience " as Julian of Norwich and St John of the Cross . But these chapters as well as those on the Dark Night of the Scul and the ' Unitive Life might well nave been supplemented by extracts from certain of the genuine American mystics  --  among the Puritans Jonathan Edwards , among the Pennsylvania Pietists Conrad Beissel , among the moderns Upham , author of " The Interior or Hidden Life . " We have an unbroken strain of the mystic ichor in our veins ; Miss Underhill discovers it in Professor Royce , she might be interested to know that it is to be found in other academic circles besides Harvard , and that even from Columbia University there has come a mystic manual worthy to be ranked among the classics of the contemplative way . CURRENT FICTION . The Outcry . By Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did Mr. James first sketch this in dramatic form , and virtually " novelize " it as an afterthought ? Or is it an experiment in the direction of a new composite medium ? In effect and almost in substance , it is a social comedy in three acts . Its machinery is of the stage  --  and of a stage totally indifferent to the new cry against coincidence . Each of the " Books " is an act in one scene ; and the exits and entrances manage themselves as conveniently as in " Box and Cox . " The persons are Lord Theign , heir to a very ancient title and to all that traditionally goes with it ; Lady Sandgate , of mature and somewhat pronounced charms , with whom Lord Theign maintains a guardedly romantic relation ; Lord John , well-mannered hilt quite unprincipled son of a rather disreputable old gaming duchess ; Lady Grace , daughter to Lord Theign and ninety-nine other earls , inexperienced , but ardent and high-spirited ; Hugh Crimble , a budding connoisseur ; and Mr. Brdckenridge Bender , American millionaire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hall of Dedborough Place , ancestral country estate of Lord Theign . The setting is minutely described in the opening paragraphs . The time is afternoon . Lady Sandgate is a guest . Lord John comes to propose marriage to Lady Grace , Crimble to see the Dedborough pictures for their own sake , and Mr. Bender because he is " after " a great Sir Joshua which is the most precious of all the Dedborough treasures . There is a Lady Kitty in the background , youngest and favorite daughter of Lord Theign , a fast young beauty who has lost immense sums at bridge to Lord John 's mother . Consequently , Lord Theign , displaying that quaint sense of honor which ( according to all traditions of fiction and drama ) governs the British aristocracy , bargains to give Lady Grace to Lord John in payment of Lady Kitty 's debt . The opportunity for an effective series of situations in this scene is obvious . In the course of it Lord John is discomfited and Crimble attains the foreground . Mr. Bender is unshaken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theign and Lady Sandgate ( who has a great-grandmother by Lawrence to dispose of ) . though full of noble sentiments , are apparently at his mercy . The second and third acts are set in the drawing-room of Lady Sandgate 's London house , at intervals of a few weeks . Lady Grace has fled there from the anger of her father ; and either her presence or the intimacy between her hostess and Lord Theign , or the natural activities of Crimble and Bender afford sufficient theatriCal excuse for the assembling of the entire cast , first of a morning and later for a conclusive afternoon It is all excessively " well-built " ; in fact , we suspect ( without too narrow examination ) that with scenery substituted for description , and commentary cut out , the thing actually is a play  --  the lines complete in themselves . The " outcry " is the sound made by the British public upon the rumor that Lord Theign is likely to let one of his-masterpieces go to America . For the public believes with Crimble that the treasures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Sandgate affect contempt for this theory , but in the end it prevails , and the great Bender retires frustrate . Bender , like the other persons , is in outline a conventional stage figure , but Mr. James has breathed the breath of life into him as into no other of these still sufficiently amusing figures . Victor Olnee 's Discipline By Hamlin Garland . New York : Harper &; Bros . Not long ago , it will be recalled ; in a series of papers grouped under the title " The Shadow World , " Mr. Garland showed himself a close and interested student of the history of psychic phenomena . Here he reduces some of his experiences and speculations in this field to the form of fiction  --  or shall we say that he dresses them in the garb of fiction ? His - Victor Olnee and the other human figures in the book do not strongly take hold of the reader 's imagination The " love-interest " is labored , the plot as a whole is of little importance , and the whole performance is a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be the son of a " medium , " who ( not quite credibly ) brings him up without knowledge of her professional life . He knows that she has a " ghost-room , " and dislikes its atmosphere and that of the persons who frequent it . But when the opening scene of the story shows him a popular athlete and fraternity man at " Winona University , " he is still unaware that the ghost-room pays for his Pleasant college years . Then comes a newspaper exposure of Mrs. Olnee . Victor hastens to her , determined to cut her off from her way of life . He does not believe that she is deliberately a fakir , but he wishes to wrest her roughly from her self-delusions . As she sincerely believes in her " guides , " this is impossible . He is somewhat consoled by the discovery that , though living in a shabby neighborhood , she numbers persons of wealth and fashion among her clients . Among other things , she tells these people how to invest their money . Presently there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Olnee is arrested for fraud . Her only defence is that certain " lying devils " must have taken the places of her guides . The question of her criminality turns upon her posses ? sion of unusual powers . Her defence is undertaken by -a great - lawyer , who is absolutely a disbeliever in psychic phenomena . With the aid of a skilful electrician he devises a series of tests which unmistakably prove Mrs. Olnee 's power of moving bodies from which she is physically separated , and of producing apparitions which can be photographed . But the strain of the test results in the death of the medium . In the opinion of the electrician , these phenomena all attest the exertion of a force not understood by science . In some way the medium 's mind or spirit causes the physical manipulation of tables , slates , and musical instruments . As for the " spirit pictures , " they are " mental images " or " etheric selves " " transferred by some unknown mental power to the plates .

Left alone through a Dakota winter in a brand-new town at the " track 's end , " the hero has a series of experiences which should satisfy the most exacting reader of the Youth 's Companion . He endures hunger , blizzards , and wounds ; single-handed he meets and repels timber-wolves , marauding bands of Sioux , and a gang of desperate outlaws . He saves trom fire and pillage the town , including a bank with a safe containing $20000 , and is rewarded by the benevolent old banker with a gold watch and chain It is a pleasure to add that though the hero sheds a good deal of blood  --  his own and others ' ? he takes no lives except those of rabbits , wolves , and buffaloes Like many others of its class , the story is told in a manner singularly business-like and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J Bell .

The sort of quandary Maister Redhorn gets into may be illustrated by his adventure with the cat Miss Waldie , for whom he is making an estimate for a most desirable job of papering and painting , gives him a commission to end the earthly career of an animal which she foolishly took to oblige a friend , and which has rewarded her kindness by killing and eating two of her canaries . The painter is sadly torn between his desire to please a prospective patron and his aversion to even a humane method of putting an animal to death .

By Myrtle Reed . New York . G. P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this novel , which follows so closely upon the tragic death of its popular author , more than her usual amount of fun and humor . Its gentle sentiment is familiar ; the tender young love affairs , the even more tender middle-aged love affairs , the twittering of birds , the scent of flowers , the glow of sunsets . In and out among the young things move the figures of Aunt Belinda and Uncle Henry in rustic oddity ; Miss Cynthia , of Dres-den china exquisiteness , dealing out alternately unabashed sentiment and wise cynicism ; Martin Chandler , cripple and dream-weaver , with counsels of patience and aspiration for all . Judith , the selfrenunciating heroine , stands between the old and the young in a mellow light of serene generosity . And , as noted , over all troubled waters blows a fun-spiced air with salutary grace . It is charming to hear Aunt Belinda 's dictum : " Fishin ' ai n't catchin ' ? it 's just settin ' in a boat and holdin ' the pole and hopin ' . " ITALY TO-DAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Political and Social Conditions Translated from " La Terza Italia : Lettere di un Yankee " of Federico Garlanda by M. E. Wood , New York . G P. Putnam 's Sons $1.50 net . This work , by Professor Garlanda of the University of Rome , made a stir in Italy , when first published about tea years ago , and it has run into several editions The reason is obvious : it pre-sents in readable form a criticism of contemporary Italy . The author is a man of weight , and though he can hardly be held competent to speak on all the topics he takes up , still , he always means to tell the truth , and , in matters of opinion , he may claim to be as well equipped as most of his critics . The book is written in letters from an imaginary " Yankee " to friends in America  --  an old device , which allows more scope to the writer and enables him to assume an air of greater impartiality by drawing comparisons between the foreign country and his own . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment imagine that Professor . Garlanda 's comments on America were written by an American , and they might all be taken away without impairing the value of his survey of Italian conditions . Like most Italians he is pessimistic . One of the traits which well-wishers of the New Italy most deplore is the habitual cynicism with which the New Italians have been running themselves down for the past forty years . Unquestionably , they have had cause enough for anxiety if not for gloom Since Cavour died in 1861 , they have had no statesman to guide them , and only one strong man , Crispi , who brought upon them the disastrous rupture with France and the final calamity in Abyssinia . Like ourselves , since the civil war , they have been living through a prosaic period which has seemed disenchantingin comparison with the years of patriotic exaltation which preceded it . They have had much political corruption , much graft , much downright peculation . On them , as on us , rapacious favored interests have fastened a high tariff . They have had also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched here by an enormous pension roll , the destroyer of patriotism . They , like us , disbelieve in the integrity of public men and in the honesty of any one who becomes rich . They see deputies go to Rome poor and return home after two or three terms with a fortune ; so we are puzzled to understand how scores and scores of Congressmen grow into millionaires after a few years in Washington . After all , however , it is not these parallels , which could be matched in other countries , which give Professor Garlanda 's book its chief interest ; it is , on the contrary , the customs and experiences peculiar to Italy . His account of the Mafia , for instance , or his analysis of the various political parties , conveys information of which the ordinary American knows little . Even more important is the chapter on Church and State  --  a subject over which , for obvious reasons , Americans who have not been in Italy are perplexed . Since Italy is listed as a Roman Catholic country , they suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows , and he is indubitably correct , that only a small minority of educated Italians would tol erate Papal interference in affairs that belong to the state , and that not one in ten , whether educated or not , dreams of the restoration of the temporal power of the Pope . As the enlightened classes fall away , Professor Garlanda shows that the Clericals ' last resort is to promote superstition and ignorance among the nobles ' sons . who attend the Jesuit seminaries , and among the peasants . He gives as an example of their desperation , a priest , professor at an episcopal school , who told his young Pupils that " whilst the world is raising lying monuments to his Cavour 's memory , his soul lies burning in the eternal flames of hell ! " ( p. 285 ) . Compare with this , the author says , the enthusiasm with which in the United States the youngest school-children are taught to reverence Washington , Lincoln , and other national patriots . Professor Garlanda wrote his diagnosis of ecclesiastical conditions several years before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vatican has fewer supporters in Italy than it had ten years ago . The Modernist revolt was hidden under the cloak of the Syllabus ; the Modernists no longer speak out , but their numbers increase day by day . Even a cursory reading of these letters will acquaint Americans with the fact that to theordinary Italian the Roman Question is as dead'as the pretensions of the Stuarts in England . We have no space for referring to the " Yankee 's " exhibit of contemporary art and literature , of university instruction , of the influence of the press , and of family life . His remarks on marriage are especially interesting ; but even more so is his view that centralization is a great curse  --  if not the greatest  --  of modern Italy . Here he starts fundamental problems without solving them . We regret that so lively a bobk should have been so badly translated . When we read of a heifer that cast sheep 's eyes , and find many similar absurdities , we are reminded of the Portuguese Grammar , and pity Professor Garlanda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By 0 . D. Skelton , Ph.D . Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. $1.50 net . This work is a product of the effort begun several years ago by Hart , Schaffner &; Marx of Chicago to encourage , by a series of prize economic essays , " the best thinking of the country to investigate the problems which vitally affect the business world of to-day . " A first prize of one thousand dollars has been awarded to Professor Skelton of Queen 's University , Kingston , by a committee consisting of Profs . J. Laurence Laughlin , J. B. Clark , Henry C. Adams , and Mr. Horace C. White and Hon , Carroll D Wright . Mr. Skelton has certainly produced a highly meritorious work . He has not enlarged the horizon of advanced students of socialism , but he has accoraplished what is perhaps an even more serviceable task : he has read , marked , learned , and inwardly digested the best that has been written and said for and against socialism , and has embodied his reflections in a book for which all must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about . By eliminating the wheat from the chaff , by discarding all that is ephemeral and inconclusive , and by bringing a large fund of common sense to the discussion of that residuum of ugly fact that constitutes the starting point of socialism as a science , he has measurably lightened the burden of that constantly increasing number who think it a part of their political duty to familiarize themselves with this subject . This is an exceptionally readable book of its class . If the chapters devoted to the Marxian analysis are not enlivening , the fault is not Mr. Skelton 's . Even Professor BOhm Bawerk , who has no superior among moderns in making light the dark places in economics , does not find it altogether easy to picture Marx 's self-contradictions in pellucid terms . " Das Kapital , " the so-called bible of scientific socialism , occupies the most curious position in economic literature . The system built upon it can not be debated without careful consideration of its precepts , and yet the more its precepts are studied the greater the difficulty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have known exactly what he thought , but neither he nor his disciples nor his critics have ever been able to make the rest of us - quite clear on that point . Where so many had failed , Mr. Skelton could hardly hope to achieve unqualified success . Mr. Skelton 's treatment of his subject is logical throughout . Socialism is in the first place , he says , an indictment of any and all industrial systems based on private property - and competition . In a second aspect it presents an analysis of capitalism . Its origin is accounted for , and its present working described . From a third point of view , socialism presents a substitute for capitalism . Fourthly , socialism involves a campaign against capitalism . In each of these aspects  --  indictment , analysis , panacea , campaign  --  socialism is intelligible only as the antithesis of the competitive system . It has followed private property like its shadow . Since it is within the past century or two , the period since what is called preeminently the Industrial Revolution , that the economic motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that within the economic field the spirit of individualism has had freest play , it is within this same period that socialism has reached fullest and clearest development . It is with post-eighteenth-century systems , therefore , that Professor Skelton chiefly deals , though he gives us a succinct and satisfactory survey of earlier developments . Lectures on Literature . New York : The Columbia University Press ; Lemcke &; Buechner. $2 net . A preliminary note states that these eighteen lectures by Columbia professors were , with one exception , delivered in a series during the academic year 1909-1910 . They differ from the collections of essays by various scholars with which the public has grown familiar , that is , memorial volumes , in the fact that none of them is a discussion of a minute subject . Each undertakes to set forth the main traits of a large period , sometimes of a whole literature . So the literatures of ancient Greece , Rome , Spain , Germany , Russia , France , of India and Persia are each handled in a single paper . English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp it in its entirety ; Professor Lawrencl touches on the Middle Ages ; Professor Fletcher on the period of the Renaissance , though he reaches beyond to Italy and France ; ProfesSors Erskine and Page take , respectively , the impulses of neo-classicism and romanticism in England . In the large compass of their subjects all of these essays are somewhat new in the domain of scholarly endeavor in America . It has often been felt that some of our most notable scholars would not , because they could not , manipulate ideas and tendencies of any considerable size . While foreign professors continued to hold their " open courses , " it was the fashion among scholars here to contend that a discussion broad enough to be popular and generally intelligible was pretty sure to stamp the speaker as a " lightweight . " We welcome heartily any sign of a change of front . Looked at critically , one of the first things that will strike the reader of these essays is their lack of antagonisms Here is no battle of the books . The classics of Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them the best literary work of the world was completed . Classicism and romanticism lie down together , and the expounder of the Renaissance finds some good in the Middle Ages . A single rebellious cry is heard when Professor Trent urges any who have quoted glibly the catch-phrase. " the renascence of wonder , " to reflect that the eighteenth century , which just preceded the great reaction thus described , was the one in which the most effective literary vehicle for us to-day ? English prose  --  was first truly fashioned . We should have been glad to have more of such protests , which would have sounded the note of perfect sincerity . For it is inevitable that a scholar who is preoccupied with a given epoch should discover in it greater worth than in any other , and , when duly controlled , the " over-beliefs " of literary judgments are suggestive Yet , with but a few exceptions the contributions are real essays , each having some single idea with which to organize the material viewed ; this keeps the work from deteriorating into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely illustrates the method Starting with the undoubted fact that in English literature " there has been no control by a class , or caste , or profession , no control by one city , not even by London , " and " no central authority , but a steady growth from national precedent and tradition , and a distrust of theory or system , " he sketches the virtues and shortcomings of our individualism . He finds that it has " carried us farther than any other literature of Modern Europe in divergence from classical guides and instruction , " with the result that the English people have " tended to regard Literature , as a practical art " in its " revelation and criticism of life and conduct " If they have not excelled in music , painting , or sculpture , " it is , perhaps , because these arts have seemed to them too abstracted from life , too unpractical . " Other literatures , he admits , may have achieved a finer art and a nicer precision than English , but " none has equalled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life which it attempts to interpret . " Professor Brander Matthews 's " Approaches to Literature , " with which the book opens , gives the impression for a few pages of being criticism in the best French mould  --  profound , urbane , and lucid  --  but shortly becomes mechanical . ' Unmethodically , we will enumerate a few of the more interesting ideas of succeeding writers . A suggestive distinction is made by Professor Fletcher . " In this complete Humanism , this whole -- souled absorption in humanity , Shakespeare gives the pure color , marks the precise centre of that band in the historical spectrum of European civilization which we call the Renaissance ; as his contemporary Edmund Spenser , on the other hand , illustrates the pervasive tendency away from Humanism , gospel of humanity , toward a new ' divinity , ' a new asceticism . " Although " The Classical Rule , " by Professor Erskine , seems to us an inadequate definition , he makes a real point in stating that the delight of eighteenth century writers in the classics was " almost a Romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper on " The Cosmopolitan Outlook " contains by the way touches of jocose twitting For the large utterance which his topic compels he feels himself unfitted . " It is our presidents who fill our sails of thought with the winds of generalizations , " quite contrary to the former way : ' When Ulysses carried the bags of YEolus , it was his crew that let loose , while he slept , the angry and adverse blasts " There is more than a grain of truth in his paradox that though modern life has grown to be largely objective , the future of literature may lie in the realms of the subjective . He believes that while the peoples of the world are becoming more and more alike , strongly individual minds will continue to exist and will be forced back upon themselves to find comfort and stimulation within .
