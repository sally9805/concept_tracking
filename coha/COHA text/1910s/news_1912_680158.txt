txt There 13 no longer any doubt as to the attitude of the organization known as the Guardians of Liberty in so far as the Roman Catholic Church ire concerned . At the usual noonday prayer meeting in the John Street Church yesterday ex-Congressman Charles D. Haines , the Chief Guardian of the organization , spoke , and caused a stir in the famous old church by making a bitter attack on the Catholic Church . He charged that Chief Justice Edward Douglass White of the United States Supreme Court owed his elevation to the fact that he was a Catholic ; that the Naval Academy at Annapolis " reeked with Catholicism " ; that Major Gen. Thomas H. Barry , T.I. S. A .. in command of Governors Island , was another who was favored because he was a Catholic , and that the time was at hand when every non-Catholic should combat the activities of those whose religion was Catholic . Near the end of his attack Mr. Haines was interrupted by an elderly man who sat well in front . He said his name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . He is one of the regular attendants of the John Street Church prayer service . " We have had enough of this sort of talk , " shouted Mr. . Applegate , " and it is time for It to stop . Who is this man ? " Before he could finish cries came from all over the church for Mr. Applegate to keep quiet , but he ' insisted on having his say . " What does he mean by this talk of war *and blood between those who are of different religions ? " shouted Mr. Applegate , and once more , his voice was drowned in a chorus of protest from the audience : " I am Just as much of an American as Is this fellow , " persisted Mr. Applegate , " I have ust as much right to be heard . This is no place for such stuff as he is uttering . " Again the volume of protest drowned his voice , and when for a fourth time Mr. Applegate started to speak somebody started the " Doxology , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed , some of them surrounding Chief Guardian Raines and the others Mr. Applegate . During the row a young man handed out Guardian of Liberty literature . A recent copy of the official weekly publication of the organization was the principal piece of reading matter given away . On its first page yas a cartoon captioned " In Time of Peace Prepare ? " which showed Pope ' Pius X. holding with his right hand the dogs of war , while in his left he held a whip . At the Pope 's feet was the skeleton of a man . On the collar of one of the dogs was the word " War . " On the back of the paper appeared a list of those who constitute the National Court of Counselors of the Guardians of Liberty . Among those given as members of this court were Gen. Horatio C. King . of Brooklyn , the Bull Moose candidate for Controller of New York ; Francis E. Clark , head of the Christian Endeavor Society ; Lieut . Gen. 3 . C. Bates , U. S. A. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N , , retired ; Lieut . Gen. Nelson Miles , U. S. A. , retired ' Bishop WilliamBurt of the Methodist Church , and ( , en . Daniel E. Sickles , also a prominent Bull Moose supporter , who , according to Gen. King , is responsible for the latter having at one time joined the movement . Gen. King said yesterday that as soon he he found out what the Guardians of Liberty movement really was he promptly ' tendered his resignation and stated in-dignantly that the use of his name was entirely unauthorized . Mr. Haines said that the Guardians had organized in June of last year , and ' that they had a membership of more than 1,000 , O00. and that among the million were between 5,000 and 6,000 ' Protestant ministers and Jewish rabbis . He said the organization was not one of bigots or of fanatics , but that its membership was represented by such men as Gen. Bates , Gen. Miles , Admiral Baird , Mr. Clark , and Bishop Burt . He did not mention the name of the Bull Moose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were among the first to sound the alarm . They saw the danger ahead to American liberty , and among other things banded together to maintain forever a complete separation of Church and State , and particularly to protect the public schools from " foreign influence . " When Gen. King , the Progressive candidate for Controller , had his attention called to the , fact that he was listed in the organ of the Guardians as a member of the National Court of Counselors he appeared indignant . " Gen. Sickles got me to join , " he said , " but I resigned some time ago . I joined thinking it was a patriotic institution to preserve American institutions , and had no idea that it was a bitter anti-Catholic organization . As soon as I found out what it really was I promptly tendered my resignation , and you will favor me by stating that I am in no way whatever connected with the organization , and have 110 sympatha with what you tell me Mr. Haines said this afternoon . " Mr. Haines said yesterday that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , and that the membership was increasing by thousands all the time .
