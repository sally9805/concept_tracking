Sin : Your editorial on Scholarship and Athletics goes too far , it seems to me , in laying so much stress on the advantages of " the mere elimination of a multitude of minor topics from the curriculum . " While it is doubtless true that many minor topics are offered for the sake of appearances by men who have no particular interest in teaching them , it frequently happens that a teacher is at his best in the minor course which appeals to him most . Personally , I do not believe that the elimination of the possibility of teaching ' sub3ects which appeal strongly to the individual teacher would do anything toward " bringing back into our faculties men , who , by their intellect and personality , command admiration . " In the old days , when there were far fewer topics , and when every one was obliged to take the standard courses in Greek , Latin , and mathematics , the proportion of teachers who commanded a following by reason of their intellect and personality was not any greater than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems to me that the difficulty is not so much with the number of courses  --  distinguished foreigners to the contrary notwithstanding  --  as with the kind of questions we ask . It has been my experience that the majority of examiners and quiz masters ask questions which depend more on the student 's ability to memorize than on his ability to think . The average teacher lays more stress on ' memory than on intellect . Some teachers have a positive dislike of allowing a student to get credit for inherited cleverness To their minds the patient drudge who will work three hours on a lesson , is more to be admired than the clever fellow who can write as good a paper after only an hour of work . The questions they ask are frequently aimed at eliminating the possibility of , a man 's get- ting through on his cleverness . Many of us have too much of the old-fashioned ' schoolmaster 's idea that the principal thing for us to do is to make the students work . Now the athletic coach , for whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not primarily interested in making his men work . ' He is after results , and it is by results , not by the amount of work they do , that his men are judged Many a student would willingly run ten extra miles if that would secure him the privilege of wearing the coveted initial . But under our present system the average student can not make an athletic team , no matter how hard he tries , unless he has an unusually good physical equipment . On the other handghe can make the first division in his class , even if he has not a specially clever brain , provided only he is willing to spend enough hours memorizing his lessons . It hardly needs to be added that a born athlete who will not train , and who shirks his work , generally fails of recognition . I would not have it thought that I am in favor of rewarding any student who depends on sheer cleverness . I do think , however , that we ought to make it just as possible for the clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mere drudge , as it is for the born athlete to surpass the ordinary man who is willing to spend more hours in training . I believe that the trouble lies in the type of questions usually asked . The bane of our present college teaching is the frequency of questions beginning with " what " and " who , " and the infrequency of those beginning with " why " and " how . " Of course , such questions are harder to make out , harder to answer , and harder to mark than those designed to see whether the student can give back what he has heard the instructor say , or has read in the text-book . But my own experience , has been that the results are correspondingly far more satisfactory . Furthermore , if the instructor would beforehand give out a number of such questions from which he proposed to select one to be used in the daily or weekly test , he would eliminate very largely that element of chance which so many students feel is indissolubly connected with academic work . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may get a question that he can answer , knows that the instructor will not be likely to ask any question on which a student who has read the lesson over once , carefully , can not do mode .. ately well , and isnaturally disinclined to undertake more than the minimum amount of mental effort . If he knows beforehand , however , that there is to be no luck about it , and that he isiperfectly sure to get one of half a dozen previously assigned problems , he is usually willing to take time to stop and think on those questions ; provided , of course , that they have been worded in such a manner as to require thought , and not simply memory . This works particularly well when , as one result of his work , his name appears among the elect , those chosen because they have brains and know how to use them . This leads to one more suggestion . I have come to believe sincerely in the efficacy of introducing the element of competition into scholarship , a. has been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Point . I have ti red the plan of posting after every written exercise a list of the class in the order of excellence , but ' without confusing the matter by announcing marks The football coach does not ' give out percentages , but publishes a list of successful candidates . or assigns places . on the first and second team Some teachers say that it is childish to revert to anything , resembling the old " spelling bee ' methods . On the other hand , I have found that the posting of this list appeals to just that type of student who is normally only too well satisfied with the mark of " C , " the " gentleman 's grade " He dislikes to have it known that in answering questions requiring ideas , and ability to express them , he is behind his fellows . Correspondingly he enjoys being at or near the-top of such a list . Furthermore , once let it be clearly understood that the list is based on the assumption that a man 's ideas are his own and you eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminars . " There still remains to be mentioned that old story , the tremendous influence of home atmosphere on a student 's scholastic activities . So long as father and mother , and brothers and sisters , are more proud of seeing their hero wear an " H , " a " Y , " or a " P , " than a W. B. K. key , just so long will our students strive more in athletics than in scholarship . And yet I must believe that if we made the key stand more for real intellectual power and less for mere faithful drudgery , the day would come when the average father would be more delighted to welcome to his office a son who could wear a key than one who could only wear an HIRAM BINGHAM . Yale Univeisity , November 12 A FOOTNOTE TO " RICHARD FEVEREL . " To THE EDITOR OF TFIE NATION : SIR : Has it been observed that , in the 1862 volume of poems , " Modern Love , " etc , Meredith gives us a poetical footnote to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " though deservedly passed without comment by the critics of Meredith 's art , is nevertheless not without interest to students of his thought . First printed ( in Once a Week ) two years after the publication of " Richard Feverel , " it makes allusion to the " wise youth , " and presents in theme and doctrine a curious parallel to the first of Meredith 's novels . The poem relates the dream of a man who has deserted his " village lily " ? whom he holds cheap , " and the dream around her idle " ? for a trip abroad with " cynical Adrian . " The bells of Bruges , a ballet-dancer , and the want of his village lily unite to produce a vision grotesque and fantastic enough f or a Gothic romancer . The dreamer falls a victim to a delicious but unholy sisterhood , who are dragging him down to watery depths of perdition He is saved only by an appeal to the village lily : Save me ! save me ! for now I know The powers that Nature gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My village lily ! save me ' Come ltwixt me and the sisterhood , While the passion-born phantoms are fleeing ' Oh , he that is true to flesh and blood , Is true to his own being ' And he that is false to flesh and blood , Is false to the star within him And the mad and hungry sisterhood An under the tides shall win him ! If it were not for the mention of Adrian , we might overlook the reminders of " Richard Feverel . " But with that to start us , we are inclined to carry through the parallel : the village lily suggests Lucy ; the " passionate Will " suggests Mrs. Mount ; and the trip with Adrian reminds us of Richard 's enforced absence from his young bride . The kijrnical Adrian represents , per haps , an attitude towards love abhorrent equally to sentiment and physiology . As in the novel , outraged nature will have its revenge , if only in a dream We recognize the keynote of all Meredith 's work in the magnifying of nature ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest Aphrodite , sung more at length in the " Reading of Life " The early poem gives such an impression of Juvenility that one would like to regard it as a preliminary sketch on the theme of the novel ; such an hypothesis , at any rate , would make the pcem no less significant a commentary on the novel JOSEI 'll WARREN BEACH University of Minnesota , November 15 THE LIFE OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR In your last issue , in noticing my life of my grandfather , you criticise me for using the word lacks in reference to the weaknesses of Hamilton and his contemporaries . My use of this term does not imply the severe censure you suggest , In looking over my dictionaries , which include the Century , Webster 's , Worcester 's , and March 's Thesaurus , I find it defined as " laxness , " " remissness , " " slackness , " and " non-observance , " and derived from ldcker , which Spiess and Surennes , Gase and others , define as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " to unbend . " I really can not see how it can be confused with anything else , although there is a French substantive meaning " a coward , " " a poltroon " ? which seems to be , to put it mildly , quite out of place in characterizing Hamilton As the word I employed is so commonly made use of by intelligent people in the way I apply it , your objections seem to savor slightly of hypercriticism . ALLAN MCLANE HAMILTON . New York , November 10 Dr. Hamilton 's note confirms our suspicion that he did not intend to use a word so severe and insulting as Mae. ? ED . NATION . GLADSTONE ON THE CONSTITUTION . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR . At last a book has been published on the American government which does not call attention to the fact that Gladstone referred to the Federal Constitution as " the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time . by the brain and purpose of man " Among the excellencies of Prof. Charles B Beard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this statement . He would naturally have put it in the first paragraph of page 45 . One is a little surprised to find Prof. A. B. Hart in this year 's edition of his " Actual Government " repeating the quotation and adding : " Mr. Gladstone was mistaken ; the Federal Constitution was not a cre ation . " This is said , with perfect seriousness , as if anybody supposed that Mr. Gladstone thought the convention of 1787 had gone up into a mountain and received the Constitution written on tables of stone , with no basis Whatev5r in human experience How long is this fossil , with its foolish gloss based on Mr Gladstone 's supposed ignorance , going to cumber the books on civics ? EDGAR , DAWSON . New York , November 17 . PROBABILISM AND THE JESUITS . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR ' In the Nation of October 27 , " J. R. S. " writes a letter about " Probabilism , ' almost every paragraph of which contains an error or a fallacy . ( 1 ) He intimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining the validity of his orders ; whereas , the orders of a priest do not depend upon his belief , but upon the manner of his ordination . ( 2 ) He criticises Rome for waiting until Duchesne 's history was translated into Italian before condemning it But the Congregation of the Index , as is well known , does not condemn instanter every heretical work ; and it was because Duchesne 's book had sufficient importance to be put into Italian that it was placed on the list of forbidden publications ( 3 . ) Whatever may be thought of Liguori 's opinions , it is quite certain that the Society of Jesus has never made itself responsible for them . The Pope may have approved them , but the Jesuits would be bound only by the Pope 's ea ; cathedra utterances . Otherwise they might be supposed to approve of certain former Papal decrees against their order Only declarations permitted or approved by the general of " the company " can be taken as declarations of the Jesuits themselves . ( 4 . ) " J. R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived and died a Jesuit if left alone " This is simply to say that if the general of the Jesuits had not discovered Tyrrell 's heresy , he would not have punished that heresy . ( 5 . ) To say , as " J R S. " does , that " by a deft use of probabilism nearly everything is condoned , " amounts to a perversion of the doctrine . A " deft " use of Bishop Butler 's argument from analogy might lead to an equally unhappy result . ( 6 ) The authority of Brownson , " the greatest of all American Catholic writers " ( Sic ) , can hardly be sufficient to prove that the French Revolution is to be laid " at the door of the Jesuits .

Should it not be noted that the nose is described in English poetry , as well as in that of America , India , and Greece ? In our older poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six feminine ones , that of the Prioress was a " nose tretys " , Hate 's was " snorted up for tine ; " Beauty 's " wel wrought " ; Idylnesse had one of " good proporsiouri , " while that of Fraunchise . . was wrought at poynt devYs For it was gentyl and tretys . Despairing of doing justice to the nose of Gladnesse the poet says : I not what of hir nose descryve So faire bath no womman alyve . The men 's noses are also worth mentioning . Sir Thopas " hadde a semely nose " Myrthe 's nose was " by measure wrought ful right , " while that of Daungere was " trounced , " and " full kirked stoode . " The miller of the " Reeve 's Tale " had a " cam-use nose , " and in the " Prologue " the mil- . Jers 's nose is very carefully , if somewhat unpleasantly , described thus : Upon the cop right of his nose he hade A werte , and thereon stood a tuft of heres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nosethirles bloke were and wyde Chaucer even thought it worth while to consider that the shape of the nose might be hereditary and gives the daughter in the " Reeve 's Tale " a " camuse " nose just like her father 's . A little later than Chaucer , the poet Stephen Hawes describes a lady 's nose as " straight and fayre . " Nor is the nose entirely neglected by our modern . poets . The very ' flower " of all noses in English poetry , a nose right under everybody 's nose , is that of the petulant maiden in Tennyson 's " Gareth and Lynette , " of whom it is so poetically and tact-fitly said . . and lightly was her slender nose Tip-tilted like the petal of a flower . MARGRETTA MARTIN . Mount Holyoke College , November 19 EXCAVATING THE CATACOMBS . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR ? Your reviewer of Wilpert 's latest book ( " Die Papstgraber " ; see the Nation , October 6 ) expresses the wish that further excavating may be made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but money is lacking . Why should not an international fund for excavating the Catacombs be raised by some great university in your country ? Subscribers would easily be found in all parts of the world . Of course , the excavating should be directed by the Papal archaeologists ; there can be no question of creating an international committee for that purpose . But the principles of scientific excavation are now so well known and so generally applied , that no intellectual assistance need be offered to scholars like Wilpert and Maruechi , Who are surrounded by some very promising pupils The only help needed is money . The Christian and Jewish Catacombs of Rome have been , to a certain extent , the cradle of modern thought , and of modern morals , would it not be paying- a debt if the modern world , without exception of creed , belief , or unbelief , were to help towards exploring them completely ? About two-thirds of the work remains to be done . SALOMON REINACH . Paris , November 6 COLLEGE GRADUATES To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Health and Efficiency League of America , " with headquarters in Battle Creek , Mich . On the first page setting forth its origin and aims , there appears in a prominent place the statement , " The small proportion of college graduates who succeed in any profession is notorious " It is surprising that a statement so wholly unwarranted could be countenanced by an organization boasting a distinguished array of officers . According to the statistics given by " Who 's Who , " 1910 , more than 60 per cent . of the professional men listed are college graduates , and these figures would be increased to more than 70 per cent . if the names of those were included who attended college but did not graduate . The statement is all the more astonishing in view of the percentage of college graduates the Health League itself has honored by election to official position in the organization Its . list of vice-presidents counsellors , and executive committee is composed of the names of twenty-one men . Seventeen of these names appear in " Who 's Who " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one attended college two years , four graduated from medical colleges , and only one never attended a college of any kind It is to be regretted that so misleading a statement against college efficiency should be distributed broadcast into the homes of the land .
