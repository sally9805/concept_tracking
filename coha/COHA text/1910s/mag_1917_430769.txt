 | I. THE EPILOGUE THE last month has seen three great episodes , of unequal military significance but each of great moral value , in the future historical discussion of the World War . The last Verdun struggle , the fall of Riga , and the greatest of all Italian efforts along the Isonzo will remain memorable , the first two as details in two of three great campaigns of the war , the last as not impossibly the beginning of a fourth bid for a decision . Contrasted with these three the British fighting , severe as it has been , lacks dramatic appeal , as it has been without significant detail . Of the three operations , Verdun claims first attention because it is the last act in one of the great battles of all human history . It is a final demonstration of the completeness of German defeat and French victory . It places in French hands all the important or useful ground lost between February and August , 1916 . It puts the French lines back where they were on the second day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this Verdun affair does more than this ; it demonstrates that , despite the disappointments of the spring , the failure and retirement of Nivelle , the morale of the French army remains high and its power on the offensive is still great . What the Germans could not do at the Chemin-des-Dames in June , the French have done on the hills above the Meuse in August ; they have made a material advance . They have , too , swept the outer rim of the hills defending Verdun clean of Germans and taken prisoners and guns in large numbers . I am anxious that my readers should feel that this last act in the Verdun contest has a permanent value . We see now much more clearly than we did a year ago what Verdun meant . The Russian Revolution and collapse have demonstrated how much more nearly accurate was German than Allied calculation at the end of the campaign of 1915 . We all talked of Germany as having failed in Russia , because , to outward appearances , Russia had escaped ; her armies endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Galicia , the impression was strengthened . But it is plain now that the German was right . His campaign of 1915 from the Dunajec to the Dwina was a mortal blow to Russian power . The Russian armies did not immediately collapse , but the exposure to the nation of the weakness of the state led to a slow but sure decay . Reaction first grasped the power and betrayed the nation to the German , then revolution came and chaos succeeded . The exact measure of this chaos the shameful rout in Galicia in July and the fall of Riga in recent days demonstrate . So now we perceive that when the German General Staff decided to come west in the campaign of 1916 , when it determined to strike a final blow at France , it could reckon upon the ultimate collapse of Russia . The fatal blow had been delivered . And since Britain was not ready and would not be ready for months , there was left only France . Already the Pan-German dream of Mitteleuropa was a solid fact . From Berlin to Bagdad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be permanent . In a word , Germany had by February , 1916 , restored the condition of August , 1914 . Even more , she had created the situation she had imagined existed in August , 1914 . Russia was now out of the running for a long time . Austria could now , as she was unable to do in 1914 , hold the eastern front with a minimum of assistance . Once more Germany could concentrate her attention upon France ; and , France defeated , the most colossal victory of modern history was in her hands . It is this new perspective that gives greater and more enduring value to Verdun . It was another 1VIarne , another battle of arrest . Had the Germans won it , the decision of the Marne would have been totally abolished . Accordingly , when in August and September , 1917 , two years after the opening of the German assault from Consenvove to Ornes , the French are able to step out and win almost the last remaining strip of front  | taken by the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent lines of defense of the entrenched camp , but the outer perimeter of field lines , with 9000 prisoners , the absolute character of the German defeat is established . II . THE VICTORY Recall again the successive steps of German advance . From February 21 to February 26 , 1916 , there was the Flood , the wild rush over four miles that culminated in the capture of Fort Douaumont . Then from February 26 to June 7 the Battle of the Wings : the capture of Dead Man 's Hill and Hill 304 on the west bank of the Meuse , of Fort de Vaux and the Vaux Plateau on the east bank . This was the slow , grinding advance which in late June brought the Germans to the ditch of Fort de Souville , the last bulwark of the town , now less than two miles away . After Souville the road ran down hill to the river and the citadel . July sees the advance going forward inch by inch . The Battle of the Somme , the Russian attacks in the east , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as September the Crown Prince can venture an offensive . Verdun is in its last ditch . The Germans have driven a wedge right into the defensive circle . Could they now maintain their effort the end would soon come . But their power to continue has gone . The Somme has at last had its effect , and the Germans on the defensive in Artois are battling with all their resources to defend , not to attack . Then in October , eight months almost to a day after the German attack , the French take the offensive and in a single day clear all the ground taken by the Germans since February 26 . They even take Fort Douaumont . Vaux holds out a few days more and falls November 3 , as the direct consequence of the attack of the previous week . A single day , with relatively minor fighting for two or three days following , has been sufficient for the French to regain ground that the Germans spent eight months and half a million men in gaining . To make this advance the French employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their losses were relatively minor , and they took 6000 prisoners . But only the line of the forts had been cleared . The Germans were still within striking distance of the ruins of Vaux and Douaumont and from various hills looked greater advantage than Lee had , for he was outnumbered and outgunned on both fields . The proof of this is that after Verdun , after the campaign of 1916 , the Germans first proposed peace and then risked all upon their submarine campaign . It remains their single chance ; this their own statesmen do not hesitate to affirm . Think of it ; the nation with the great military tradition , which embarked upon the war confident of its ability to dispose of France in six weeks and Russia in three months more , after three years of war , seeks to escape ultimate defeat for its armies , through submarine warfare ! Here is the meaning of the Marne and Verdun in small compass . III . RIGA Turning now to the capture of Riga by the Germans , the immediate fact seems to be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode . Defeat at Verdun , unmistakable defeat , had its depressing effect upon the German people . The capture of Riga would do something , at the least , to dissipate the depression . And for many months it has lain in the power of the Germans to take Riga when they chose . For many weeks anything on the eastern front that they chose to expend the men and munitions to get could have been had . The condition endures . Therefore , the Germans took Riga . Two years ago , at the close of their great eastern campaign , the Germans failed to get Riga for a variety of reasons . The chief obstacle was the Russian fleet , which was then in good condition . The Russians had four superdreadnoughts , their gunnery was good , and it would have required an action of the German battle fleet to dispose of the Russians , who would probably have sunk several German first-line units in the conflict . Therefore , the Germans held back their fleet . But until the Russian fleet was disposed of Riga could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its main value . In addition the Germans had sent many guns and men south to the Balkan front and were already making their great concentration of munitions for the Verdun attack of the next February . They could unquestionably have taken Riga in the fall of 1915 , but it would have been a venture injurious to other plans and a prize of limited value because of the Russian fleet , hence they held their hands . Accordingly the Allies made  | the most of what had been saved from t h e Russian wreck , and Riga was the chief bit of salvage . Honestly , but mistakenly , the Allied press believed that Russia had saved herself at the end of a summer of disaster , but the Russian salvation turned out to be but temporary . By taking Riga now , the Germans have laid hands on the only considerable East European city , included in their extreme Pan-Germanic aspirations of the ante-bellum period , which had escaped them in the war . By taking it they have completed their hold upon the Courland , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern frontiers of their Mitteleuropa are established . And this is but a step in line with their recent success in Galicia , which has cleared the Russians practically out of the territory of their Austrian ally . Look at the war map again and it will be seen that to-day Germany occupies the heart of Europe and her front runs straight from the Gulf of Riga to the mouth of the Danube ; Warsaw , Riga , Libau , Lodz , Belgrade , Bucharest , the cities of Poland , of the Courland , of Rumania , are in her hands . Austria , Turkey , Bulgaria form extensions of the German block , and these are buttressed by conquered marches on the east . Riga is only one of the minor details now , at last , included in the German war map . And as they have always resolved to have Riga , to take it now is a new source of rejoicing to the Germans . Berlin has been beflagged again and there is in this fresh evidence of Russian collapse the basis for a renewal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East , whatever the necessary concessions in the West . Riga has a value for the German public less vital , perhaps , than Strassburg for the French or Trieste for the Italians , but in a measure comparable . And now , in the late summer of 1917 , Riga is won . On the military side Riga has little meaning , because it is idle to attach any military value to Russia . To all intents and purposes she has disappeared from the battle line and it is necessary to accept the fact . The war must be won on the western front by the western allies , by France , Britain , Italy , and the United States . Riga only emphasizes this fact . But the moral value is still to be recognized . Germany will be the more determined to fight as the proofs of Russian collapse are the more unmistakable . And Riga is a supreme proof of this demoralization , followed as it was by the revolt of Korniloff and the subsequent outburst of new anarchy in Russia . Had Russia been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1916 , the end of  | the German cause would now he in sight . But there is no wisdom in disguising the fact that Russia has completely collapsed and all plans made upon the basis of her assistance have gone by the board . More than this , no plans for next year can be made with the expectation of useful Russian participation . If there was doubt as to this fact before the Riga capture , it should vanish now . IV . WESTERN AFFAIRS Evidently the higher strategy of the Allies aimed at a repetition of last year 's procedure this year . Then there were attacks upon all fronts : Russian and Italian upon the Austrian fronts ; French and British upon the German , with material victories in the East and considerable progress in the West . This year Russia was to lead off again in Galicia , although the French and British had made initial attacks in the spring . Italy was to go on along the Isonzo , as she had gone on last summer to the capture of Gorizia . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ypres . But Russia tried and failed with a terrible after effect . Her Galician armies disintegrated , there was a shameful flight , and a rapid military breakdown . By August 1 , when the French and British were ready to attack in Flanders , Russia was no longer a factor and Germany was free to use most of her resources in the West . Austria , too , could bring men and guns from the Dniester to the Isonzo . By August 1 , the hope of a decision this year was over and it was no longer the part of wise generalship to risk too great losses in operations that could not decide the struggle in the present campaign . The result has been seen in recent weeks . There has been terrific fighting in Flanders . The mere casualty lists of the British , 28,000 in a week that had no striking incident , that is , a greater loss than Meade or Lee suffered at Gettysburg , demonstrate the intensity of the fighting , but it has seen no great attack . There is a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German losses are not inferior to British , for the Germans are outgunned and outmunitioned , but no attempt to repeat the Somme campaign . For the year British strategy does not seem to go beyond killing Germans on the lines that are now familiar to the world . Next year we shall see a grand effort made by the British , French , and American troops all along the western front . This year , in my judgment , one more British thrust on the Ypres front will be the extent of the campaigning , for the weather will very soon get bad ; four weeks is probably the outside limit of good fighting weather that remains . After ' their losses this year , the Allies figure that the Germans will be short of men next year . Their casualties this year will eat up the reserves that Russian collapse released in the East . The main Allied aim this year must be to dispose of these reserves at a minimum of cost , and this is being done . Next year American man-power will be available and German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately placed the German loss up to the beginning of the fourth year of the war , that is , the permanent loss , as 4,000,000 in killed , wounded , and captured . Four millions out of the fighting , this means , with another half-million in hospital who will come back presently . The same estimate fixed at 5,500,000 the Germans on the line or behind the line engaged in necessary military tasks . This left a reserve of 600,000 made up mainly of boys of seventeen and eighteen , with an eventual reserve of 500,000 , drawn from the men now in hospital . By April this reserve will have fallen to less than 750,000 , and this is the total reserve of men available to repair wastage for the whole campaign . It is less than half the British reserve . We shall probably provide the French with half a million before the campaign . of 1918 is over and , with their new class of 1918 , this will give them a reserve equal to the German , had they exhausted all other reserves , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year and a half of the Civil War meant to the South ; it well-nigh annihilated their youth . Boys and old men were called to the front , and half a century after the struggle the South is only beginning to recover . This is what another year of the war will mean to Germany . On the western front , French , British , and American manhood will divide the cost of the battle in human life . But the German manhood will have to defray it all and the tax will , therefore , be enormously higher upon the German . Germany , by using enslaved populations , by using prisoners , has been able to put a far greater percentage of her manhood on the firing line than her opponents ; this has enabled her to hold off her enemies , and still  | enables her to do it , but it has also compelled her to use up a far greater fraction of her human capital and thus cripple herself in the after-war recovery . It does not seem to me that enough Americans perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their attention is still fixed upon trenches and trench lines . They are still thinking of breaking the German line . But this is not the present Allied problem . To illustrate : If Germany should lose 1,500,000 men by the end of the fourth year of the war , that is , in that fourth year , in killed or permanently disabled , her total permanent loss for four years would be just about half of her able-bodied male population . Up to date Britain , aside from her colonies , has lost hardly more than a million against the German 4,000,000 . The German loss is 35 per cent. , the British 12 per cent . If Britain lost another million this year , that is , as many as in all three previous years combined , her total loss would be only about a quarter of her able-bodied male population as against 50 per cent . for the Germans . Remember that the two nations are the real industrial and commercial rivals of Europe , and at the end of the war , if one has lost half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if in all else the war is a draw , it is easy to see where the victory will lie . Human loss is , practically speaking , irreparable , and it is the human loss of Germany that is becoming impressive . Moreover , Britain has beside her home population , the male populations of her great white colonies , whose percentages of casualties will be still lower than her own . Looked at from this angle it will be perceived why Germany is losing not only the war but her future after the war , a far more important thing , while she still holds her front in France and Belgium . V. THE ITALIANS AT THE ISONZO It remains to discuss the Italian fighting of the month , which has supplied the one major operation , probably the most considerable of the year , to date , since the Austrians estimate the Italian losses at nearly a quarter of a million , more men than the North and South combined brought on to any battlefield during the Civil War , while the Italian estimate of Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fairly familiar with the Isonzo front . Between the Julian  | 1914 and east of that town and Kovel last summer . Austria is the weak link in the German chain and now Italy is taking Russia 's place . And there is a growing tendency in London , Paris , and Washington to recognize the importance of the Italian campaign . This may easily mean that next year Italy will receive more guns , more munitions , and more coal from her allies than before , and that the Italian campaign next spring may be almost as important as the Anglo-French . Italy 's position at the present time must be a source of no little anxiety to her leaders . Her allies entered the war either to save themselves under attack , or to save an attacked nation , whose fall would be fatal to their interests , but Italy came in with a clearly matured purpose after having refused a portion of the Trentino as the price of peace . So far , Italy has not conquered what she was offered to remain neutral . The war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is plain . Italy 's difficulties have not been appreciated by her allies and they have only recently been willing to lend her the aid she has long asked for . Russian collapse has brought a changed situation : it has doubled the burden upon Italy and abolished all chance , if there ever was any , that Italy could profit through the exertions of her Allies without great effort herself . Italy has now become an equal member in the alliance with an equal necessity for making her utmost effort , and she is certainly doing this in her present blow on the Isonzo , the most successful in ground gained she has yet struck . The campaign is still going forward and the end seems distant , but it is worth noting that there is every present prospect that Italy 's campaign this year will be the most considerable of all the Western Allies . It is still possible , too , that it may have a decisive turn , although the reported arrival of German reinforcements indicates that Germany is again backing her Austrian ally at a danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian effort has produced a new feeling of friendship for Italy in Paris and London . The three Western Allies are visibly drawing closer together as the war proceeds , and this may easily foreshadow a new triple alliance after the war between the Mediterranean powers , an alliance as natural as the old Triple Alliance was unnatural . Alone of the commanders who began the war , Cadorna survives , and to-day he divides the honors of achievement with Petain , the victor of Verdun , and Joffre , the man of the Marne . The fame of all three is secure . Alps and the sea on a front of little less than forty miles the Austrians originally stood behind the Isonzo from Tolmino down below Gorizia , throwing advance guards across the river in front of this town and drawing their line back from the river as it approached the sea and moved away from the Carso Plateau . This front has three different geographical features . From Tolmino almost to Gorizia there is the high ground , the Bainzizza Plateau , with its western rim , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peaks some two thousand feet above sea level . Kuk , Monte Santo , Vrh , Monte San Gabriele and Daniele are the more famous and the highest . East of Gorizia there is the valley of the Vippaco or Wippach , and then further south the ground . rises to the Carso Plateau with Mt . Hermada as its chief elevation , whence it falls abruptly to the Gulf of Trieste . Last year the Italians took Gorizia and pushed out on the Carso and last spring they reached the neighborhood of Hermada , but  | did not take it . Northward they crossed the Isonzo and took Kuk and Vrh , but not Gabriele and Daniele , which rise right above Gorizia command it and sweep the Vippaco Valley east of it . They reached but did not get Monte Santo . Despite this attack the main fighting up to August of this year has been on the Carso and in the Vippaco Valley just east of Gorizia . But late in that month the Italians changed their objective and aimed at the Bainzizza Plateau . Crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by British heavy guns , they took Monte Santo , swept east from one to four miles and partially encircled Gabriele and Daniele . If they could get these elevations they would compel the Austrians to retire on a wide front and to a considerable depth . The retirement would be into a region ill-served with railroads and hard to defend . As I write these lines Rome statements published in Washington announce the fall of San Gabriele , but there is lacking any official corroboration in the Italian communiques . Now bear in mind the situation : This front is a sort of magnified Thermopylae , a little gate between the sea and the impassable Alps which the Austrians have held against great numbers with relatively small effectives for more than three years . As the Austrians retreat they will leave the gate and the Italians will have a wider and wider front on which to use their vastly superior numbers . This means that it will require larger and larger Austrian numbers to defend this front as the Italians press on . The real objective of the Italians is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty miles away , Trieste will be the eventual reward , because they will isolate it and cut its communications . But they are striking east , not south , they are aiming at the Austrian armies , not an Austrian port . If the Italians once get through the gate , then the Austrian predicament will be unmistakable , for Austria lacks men for a wide front . Her losses have been terrific against Russia as well as against Italy , and Serbia cost her a pretty total of men at the Jedar and Valievo . Italy , on the other hand , has huge untapped resources , the largest human reservoir of all the European allies , now that Russia is out of the running . For more than two years , right down to the recent collapse in Galicia , Russian strategy was comprised in the attempt , while holding off Germany , to crush Austria , and she almost succeeded , both at Lemberg in down on much-bombarded Verdun . Another effort was necessary to " give Verdun air , " as Petain phrased it ! Accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans are thrown back far outside the old line of the entrenched camp . They still have a distant glimpse of the town , but they are no longer able to threaten it . This time they lose 11,000 prisoners and more than a hundred guns . The second defeat is more complete than the first . The Germans are now back where they were about February 24 , three days after their rush began . But on the west bank they still hold to Dead Man 's Hill and Hill 304 and no further French advance on the east bank is possible while the enemy is able to enfilade the French from these hills . This explains the final thrust of recent weeks . On a front of eight or ten miles , from the southern slope of Hill 304 on the west bank to the edge of Bezonvaux on the eastern edge of the Woevre , the French attack began . They take Dead Man 's Hill and a number of important elevations across the river from it . They leave 304 practically alone . But it is encircled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours later . The French have now reached the position of their second line in February , 1915 ; the Germans have lost their last direct view of Verdun ; they have lost everything of any military value that they gained between February and September , 1915 . In this last phase , too , they have lost 9000 prisoners-27,000 in three attacks . And this French success comes at the moment when the German press is assuring the German people that France is exhausted , " kaput , " as the phrase is . " Compelled to attack by their British masters , " is the official sneer of the German official statement , discussing a preliminary thrust of the French before the main blow comes . Dead Man 's Hill , Hill 304 are as well known in Germany as Cemetery Ridge and the Peach Orchard to Americans after Gettysburg . Douaumont was the cornerstone of Verdun 's defense , so the Kaiser announced in February , 1915 . And of the whole Verdun episode , of all the ground gained , nothing remains to the Germans now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have dwelt upon this Verdun incident because it , like the Marne , is one of the unmistakable things of the war . The Germans were beaten at the Marne , they had to retreat , and the proof is to be seen on the map .  | It is the same with Verdun . All else on the Western front has been , by comparison , indistinct , the backward and forward swing of trench warfare , save for the retreat after the Somme , but here the Germans were on the defensive and maintained their line , although compelled to withdraw . Their actual hold upon Northern France was not broken . But the Marne and Verdun were both shipwrecks of great German purposes . Each was a bid for supreme victory . Since Waterloo no battles have had such momentous values , and both were French victories . In both the whole German purpose was balked . Twice , then , at the Marne and at Verdun , the French alone , for the British share in the Marne was nothing , have arrested the German flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field at the end of the struggle and the prizes that go with the victory . To have forecast in 1914 that France could do this would have been to invite ridicule in Berlin and dubitation in France . And this is the great and enduring contribution of France in the war . It is not in the power of the country inferior in population and resources to its great neighbor to win an offensive battle . The battles of Champagne in 1915 , of the Aisne this year , demonstrate this . The United States , Great Britain , Russia must turn the French achievement into the final profit ; they must defeat the German whose two great efforts France has parried and beaten down . And since Russia is out of the running , the burden falls upon the United States and Britain . Already Britain has made a beginning . The Somme , Arras , Messines ? these are material and promising signs . But Russian collapse has released German troops and these troops demand fresh Allied forces to face them ; so the struggle goes over another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highwater marks of the Confederacy , the Marne and Verdun are unmistakably the supreme limits of German effort . A victory on either field would have won the war ; defeat on both fields made victory impossible in the larger sense . Nearly two years separated Gettysburg from Appomattox . But the power of the South , offensively , was broken in the first days of July , 1863 . All the chances that they could hope to have were with them and they lost . And all the chances were with the Germans both at the Marne and at Verdun . They had a far
