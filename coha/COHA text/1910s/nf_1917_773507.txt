The Act of 1851 recognized the carriers as a branch of the service and authorized the placing of collection boxes and " drops " for receiving letters , which if intended for local delivery by carrier were to be prepaid at the rate of two cents each . In a letter dated November 14 , 1860 , John A. Dix , postmaster at New York , submitted to Postmaster-General Joseph Holt , " a full statement of the condition of the system of collecting and delivering letters in this city by carriers and mailmessengers . " The letter reads in part as follows : To facilitate the receipt , delivery , and transmission of letters written here , and to expedite the delivery of those received by the mails and addrest to persons within the city , six stations have been established in different localities ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most distant about three miles . . . . From these stations , and from the principal office , the carriers depart four times in each day to deliver letters to the persons to whom they are addrest within certain allotted districts . The whole number of carriers is 89 . The carrier 's department at the post office is organized , under a superintendent , with a corps of . clerks , whose principal duty it is to receive and assort all letters intended to be delivered by carriers . These letters are separated and sent 7 times a day to the respective stations from which they go out for delivery .... The letters collected from the lamp-post boxes within about one mile of the post office are carried // directly to the office . Those collected from boxes more remote are carried directly to the nearest stations to be sent out for delivery by the carriers , addrest to persons in the upper districts , or to be taken to the post office , if intended for transmission by the mails , or to be delivered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are paid from the carriers ' fund , which is composed of the postage on city letters , one cent each , one-quarter of the fees on letters received by the mails and delivered by the carriers . Also one cent each , and the fees ( one cent each ) on letters collected from the lamp-post boxes and carried to the post office to be transmitted by the mails . Three-quarters of the fees on letters received by the mails and delivered by the carriers are paid to the respective carriers by whom the deliveries are made and constitute a part of their compensation . It will be seen from the foregoing statement of the New York postmaster that the necessities of the postal situation in that rapidly growing city were met by a special arrangement , without direct authority of law , but which very much resembles the later system of carrier-stations and city delivery which are familiar features of the postal service to-day . In many of the cities besides New York , the delivery of mail by carriers attached to the post office was in vogue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter and one cent for delivering a letter . The patrons , however , were free to accept the service of the carriers or not . The modern city-delivery service originated in the following recommendation of Postmaster152 THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE General Montgomery Blair in his report for the fiscal year 1862 : " I also recommend the abolition of the one-cent carriers ' fee for the delivery and collection of letters in cities , and in lieu of that annoying and dilatory tariff on delivery and collections , recommend that the charge upon local ( or drop ) letters be made uniform at the prepaid rate of two cents ; and that all prepaid mail and local letters shall be delivered and collected without charge by the carriers , they being paid by salaries . This will prepay and transfer the carrier 's charge from mail to local letters in effect , greatly accelerate deliveries , and promote the public convenience . " Mr. Blair also expected that this uniform delivery by carrier would supersede delivery through post-office boxes , but this expectation has not , been realized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at three cents for single letters weighing not in excess of half an ounce , and for local delivery the charge was two cents . At citydelivery post offices all letters prepaid at these rates were entitled to collection and delivery without further charge . It will be seen that the establishment of city-delivery service in 1863 did not reduce the cost of sending local letters , but eliminated the cost of delivery and collection from letters mailed at one post office for delivery at another . At the same time local correspondence was encouraged by the uniformity of the // two-cent charge and the regularity and responsibility of the new carrier service established under the law of 1863 . Since its establishment , the number of city-delivery post offices has increased from 49 to nearly 1900 , the number of carriers from 449 to 34,000 and the annual cost of carriers ' salaries from $300,000 to nearly $40,000,000 . The average compensation of a letter-carrier in 1863 was about $500 ; the average compensation now is approximately $11:30 . The Postmaster-General is now required by law to employ letter-carriers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public business may require in every incorporated city , village , or borough , containing a population of 50,000 within its corporate limits , " and the PostmasterGeneral is authorized by law to employ lettercarriers for the free delivery of mail matter " at every place containing a population of not less than 10,000 , within its corporate limits , " according to the last general Census taken by authority of State or United States law . Again , the Postmaster-General may inaugurate this service at any post office which produced a gross revenue for the preceding fiscal year of not less than $10,000 . City-delivery service has so long been established in cities and towns having a population of 50,000 , that the Post Office Department is concerned now , under the legislation quoted above , // only with cities and towns in which the free delivery of mail may be established if the population amounts to 10,000 or the annual receipts to $10,000 . In pursuance of the discretion accorded by the law the Postmaster-General authorizes the establishment of city-delivery service at about 100 additional post offices each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities and to facilitate the delivery and collection of mail , the Postmaster-General requires that before city-delivery service will be established , the town or city under consideration must be equipped with sidewalks , paved streets , ( or cross-walks at street intersections ) street lights and street signs , and that the houses shall be numbered according to a uniform system for the city or town and that the residences and places of business to which mail is to be delivered must be equipped with private mail-receptacles . This requirement is so important that it is stipulated not only in the case of the original establishment of delivery service in a city , but also in case of the extension of the service to new sections of cities already enjoying the benefits of delivery service . The advantages to the patrons and to the service of house mail-receptacles are manifest . Where a receptacle is provided the carrier may deliver the mail at the residence or place of business whether the occupant is at home or not and // thus is obviated the necessity of awaiting a response to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to two minutes are consumed by the carrier awaiting a response at every place of delivery not equipped with a mail-receptacle . When it is considered that each carrier serves at least 500 residences or places of business , the enormous waste of time in a force of 34,000 carriers will be appreciated . The Department does not prescribe any particular size or style of mailreceptacles for patrons . This is left entirely to the judgment of the individual patron , and if he sees fit he may merely cut a slot in the front door through which the mail may be delivered . Postmasters throughout the country at the instance of the Department are constantly bringing this matter to the attention of patrons , pointing out to them that this simple cooperation not only reduces the cost of performing the service , but tends to advance the time of delivery to practically every patron . Since the beginning of city-delivery service in 1863 , the growth and changes in the form , kind , and weight of mail have made it necessary to employ other forces for this service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been employed at different times . During recent years the Post Office Department has devoted itself earnestly to the task of standardizing the vehicles used in this service with respect to power , // capacity , and style . The question of employing horse-drawn vehicles , automobiles or bicycles is now determined on the basis of what is best and most advantageous for the service . Vehicles of different kinds are used by delivering carriers , whose routes are in the suburbs and sparsely settled sections of cities ; by collecting carriers in sections in which heavy deposits of mail are made in the boxes , and by carriers engaged in the parcel-post delivery and collection service where the bulk and weight of the mail make this necessary . For these various purposes there are now employed more than 1,400 horse-drawn vehicles , about 700 automobiles , and over 400 bicycles and motorcycles . These vehicles are secured in different localities under different contractual arrangements , the arrangement in each instance depending upon what is best for the service from the standpoint of both economy and efficiency . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an allowance made by the Department , in addition to his regular salary , to cover the cost of maintenance and operation , with fair allowance for depreciation and interest on the investment . In other cases , notably in the larger cities , horse-drawn vehicles and automobiles are secured under annual contracts with successful bidders among those citizens who have submitted proposals in response to advertisements . // In other cities the automobiles are owned and operated by the Department . This arrangement is a radical departure from established custom , and has been developed in the past few years . It has been extended rapidly and at the present time all of the vehicles employed for the transportation of mail from railroad stations to the post office and its branches , as well as in the city delivery and collection service , in the cities of Chicago , Philadelphia , Detroit , Saint Louis , Pittsburgh , Washington , Indianapolis and Nashville are owned and operated by the Post Office Department . The number of these automobiles is 540 and the approximate annual cost of their maintenance and operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities in collecting mail . In some instances letter-boxes are attached to the cars , in which mail may be deposited while the cars are standing still , and in other instances carriers are assigned to the cars to make collections from boxes on street corners along the route . However , this kind of service is giving way to the automobile for which the line of travel is not restricted . The total annual cost of maintaining the delivery and collection of mail in cities is approximately $50,000,000 . City-delivery service is the branch of the postal establishment which is in the closest connection with the greatest number of people . The condi158 THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE tion and effectiveness of the service is therefore largely judged by the city-delivery service . The army of railway mail-clerks and of clerks in post offices , and the administrative officials of the Department and in post offices , are not associated in the minds of the public with their daily mail so intimately as the uniformed mail-carrier with whom they come in contact every day . An unusual kind of city-delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the vessels plying the Great Lakes . As the mammoth whalebacks and freighters pass through the Detroit river they are met by a boat letter-carrier in midstream . The mail is collected and delivered without even requiring the steamer to slacken its speed . This hazardous and important service is continuous throughout the twenty-four hours of each day . Mail addrest to the boats is sent to the Marine Station of the Detroit post office and is there separated according to the names of vessels , arranged alphabetically , and put aboard a steamtug . The tug proceeds to midstream to await approaching vessels . When the vessel arrives within a certain distance of the tug , one of the letter-carriers enters a rowboat with the mail for the approaching vessel , and rows toward a point in the river at which he will converge with the oncoming vessel . Near the point of convergence the carrier throws a line up to one of the crew of // the passing vessel , who catches and makes it fast . As the rowboat is towed with dashing speed alongside the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hamper containing mail for dispatch . The carrier removes this mail and places in the hamper or bucket mail addrest to the vessel . The bucket is then drawn aboard the vessel , the line released , and the carrier returns to the tug to await the arrival of the next vessel . When the traffic is heavy and two or more vessels are passing at the same time , the carrier in the rowboat serves one vessel while the carrier who remains on the steam-tug serves another from the tug by means of a bucket fastened to a long pole . In the latter case the tug steams alongside the larger vessel while the exchange of mails takes place . The operation which has been described is performed by the carriers about 20,000 times during each shipping season , extending from April to December . Almost a million pieces of mail are handled each season . In this mail are to be found orders from headquarters to the masters of the boats , the reports of the masters to their employers , messages exchanged between members of the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kinds , including , since the establishment of the parcel-post service , packages containing laundry and other necessaries for the men . // As already stated , city-delivery service can not be established at any post office under the law , until the gross receipts have amounted to at least $10,000 or until the population has reached 10,000 , but to accommodate the residents of small towns in which the post-office receipts amount to not less than $5,000 per annum , a service known as " Village Delivery " is now being developed . This service was first established experimentally October 16 , 1912 , and has been gradually extended until it is now operated from 280 offices and requires the services of approximately 400 carriers . The entrance salary paid to village-delivery carriers is at the rate of $600 per annum and after twelve months of satisfactory service this is increased to $690 per annum . ' Where village delivery is inaugurated at offices of the third class the appointment of the carrier is not subject to the Civil Service rules , as such offices are not classified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office is advanced to the second class and the employees thereat , including village-delivery carriers , are given a civil service status . City-delivery service , together with rural service and village delivery , constitutes a type of service that is rapidly becoming universal . For different reasons the people in the country and the people in the city may best be served with their mail by carriers . Each city-carrier serves // an average of 1,500 people and it is better that a man should be engaged to perform this work than that such a number of patrons should be required to call at the congested post office . Already the larger post offices with their force of city and rural carriers serve all the territory surrounding the post office for many miles , both city and rural . Where the city carrier leaves off the rural carrier begins . There is also evidence of consolidation between the two services especially in the smaller cities . Hundreds of mounted city carriers are serving territory that is essentially rural in character . Then rural carriers are delivering mail within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of travel to the beginning of their rural routes . Rural carriers also sometimes take out bundles of mail for the convenience of city carriers whose routes are located in the environs of the city . As the organization of the postal service passes from a large number of post offices to a small number of large postal districts , affording more opportunities for efficient management , the postmaster and the post office will no longer be the direct agency for reaching the patrons , and the post office will no longer be a family community center ? the carrier will intervene , and will bring to the door of every person in the land , and to every place of business all the facilities of the postal service . // Every city and rural carrier is in effect a postmaster . At the post office a special distributing case is assigned to each for his letters and papers . This case has usually 160 small compartments and these are labeled with the names of his patrons in the order in which the route is served by him . He collects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , before he commences each trip . His procedure is essentially the same as that of the small postmaster , except that instead of delivering the mail through the window he carries it out on the street or the rural route and delivers it at the home of the patron . XIV ADDRESSES EVERY person in the United States has a postoffice address , which consists of his name , the name of the post office from which he receives his mail , and the name of the State or Territory within which the post office is located , as " John Smith , Bennettsville , South Carolina . " Usually , the correct post-office address must also include the box-number , the number of the rural route , the name of the street and the house-number , or the words " General Delivery , " as in the following examples : figure The post-office address is not correct unless it gives sufficient information for effecting the quickest handling , dispatch , and delivery of the mail . 163 // In these times of publicity and advertising , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value and importance of his post-office address . It is a personal and business asset , and it widens the circle of his opportunities . If he makes it known in its full and correct form , lie will establish a sound basis for the quick and sure delivery of his mail . This is one of the many good reasons for always placing a request for return , together with the name and full address of the sender , in the upper left-hand corner of the envelop of every letter , and on the wrapper of every parcel . The correct position of the address , return card and stamp are shown in the following illustration . Any variation from this general form is almost sure to delay the mail . The name of the State or Territory should never be omitted from the post-office address . It // is needed for the quick reference of the distributer . This highly trained employee is , of course , familiar with the fact that there is a post office named Boston in the State of Massachusetts , but the omission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England city will cause him to hesitate . There are eleven other Bostons besides the one intended . This pause may interrupt a " spurt " of high speed distribution just at a time when only seconds remain before the closing of the sacks for a big Eastern dispatch on an 18-hour Chicago-to-New York train . Thirty or forty letters miss the connection in this way and are delayed from six to twelve hours each . Thus , in the aggregate , delay amounting in time to more than ten days may result from writing " Boston " instead of " Boston , Massachusetts . " This warning applies equally to any omission or abbreviation in writing addresses on mail-matter and to writing addresses illegibly . There is another reason for never omitting the name of the State from the post-office address . Many post offices bearing the same , or very similar names , are located in different States as , for example , Chicago , Illinois , and Chicago , Kentucky . It is now the rule of the Post Office Department not to approve of a new name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of another post office in the United States . Unfortunately , this rule has been applied only for a few years , // and thousands of post offices still bear names in common with other post offices . A letter addrest to John Smith , Birmingham , might be intended for any one of twelve States from Alabama to Washington . It may be natural to think of Cleveland as being in the State of Ohio , but people in twenty-six states besides Ohio receive their mail through post offices in places bearing the same name . Troy is a post office name claimed by twenty-eight States . It is apparent , therefore , that the name of the State or Territory should always be added to the name of the post office in order to give a clear and unmistakable direction to the postmaster . If the post-office address is written in the same way at all times , each person and business will establish his or its identity as a post-office patron . The name should be used always in the same form . Mr. Smith should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , J. Smith , or J. Arthur Smith , and stick to it . Abbreviations of the post office or State are undesirable and should not be used . Abbreviation of the State name is a common cause of mail being missent or misthrown by post-office clerks . When abbreviated in the usual way , Maine resembles Missouri , and Pennsylvania , Tennessee . It happens that a letter addressed to Winona , Mississippi , reaches Winona , Minnesota , owing to the desire of the sender to save time in writing // the full address . Mail for Vienna , Maryland , and Vienna , Indiana , is very easily confused , if the State name is abbreviated , as in the following illustration : To avoid the danger of such confusion , and to facilitate the work of the post office , it is best to write the full address , without abbreviation of any kind , and especially to avoid the use of such words as " Local , " " City , " or the like , to indicate that the letter or card is intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter addrest in this improper way by a man in Brooklyn , and intended for some one in the same city may easily be carried by him across the East River and mailed in the postal district of New York . In that event , the letter may go to the dead-letter office ; at the best , it will be seriously delayed . If // this kind of address be used , and there is no return address on the letter , it may also happen that the postmark may become blurred and obscured , so that if the letter is inadvertently misthrown into the outgoing mail it will never be returned or delivered . Such instances are , no doubt , rare , considering the great volume of mail handled by the United States Post Office , but the Division of Dead Letters at Washington continues to receive multitudes of letters which the senders had no idea would go there . Legibility is of utmost importance in postoffice addresses . A plainly written or typewritten address enables trained workers handling a piece of mail to maintain the wonderful speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post office . Pencil addresses are objectionable , as they are liable to become blurred . These and other slovenly and freakish addresses slow up the postal machinery from the beginning to the end of the postal journey . Thereby , other mail is delayed , the patience of distributers is sorely tried , and an unnecessary element is added to the cost of postal service . Postal experts in the great mailing centers have said that the additional cost of handling mail on account of illegible addresses must amount , for the whole country , to not less than $1,000,000 annually . This waste caused by a part of the people , is paid for by all the people both in money and in delay . // It is a boorish and discourteous act to mail a letter , card , or parcel with an address that requires painful deciphering . This reprehensible practise is far from being confined to the uneducated and illiterate , who use the post office seldom . These infrequent correspondents are usually quite painstaking in writing addresses on mail . Some people actually strive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of testing the ingenuity of the postal clerks . " Character " handwriting produces many bad addresses which confuse and perplex the distributers . Flourishes , dashes , and other mutilations of penmanship , if used at all , should be reserved for the letter inside . The person who receives the letter may read , or not , at will . The post office , however , must read the address on the envelop , not once , but many times , ? a service which should not be expected for the two-cent postage charge . The address of a person who receives mail through a rented box , by city-delivery carrier , by rural carrier , or through the General Delivery , should include the box number , the street and house number , the rural route , or the words " General Delivery , " as in the illustration . To omit these special directions will almost surely result in some delay and may actually prevent delivery . The post office makes every reasonable effort to deliver each piece of mail received , but the preference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A letter directed to a street and number of a large city is distributed in the railway post office to station and carrier and its delivery then greatly advanced . Directory mail is massed on the main office . A letter addrest simply " John A. Williams , Providence , Rhode Island , " goes to the directory section of the post office at Providence , and there the clerks supply the missing street and number , so that , first , the clerks may know which carrier should take it , and , second , the carrier may know where to deliver it . This service is all lost motion ; it takes time and means delay and unnecessary expense . J Some business men in the largest cities , who are aware of the directory service performed by the post office for insufficiently addrest mail , purposely omit their street addresses from the advertising and stationery of their businesses , with a view to impressing casual correspondents with the idea that they are important enough to be known to the post office . As a result , mail received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly through the directory section . If these men could understand the delay and risk of loss to which their mail is subjected , it is probable that they would forego the doubtful advantages of this practise . The postal regulations state that each person shall have his mail delivered to him as addrest , // or , if he so requests , he may have his choice of one of three methods of delivery , which will be used no matter how the mail is addrest . These three ways ( at city delivery offices ) are ( 1 ) by carrier , ( 2 ) through a rented box at the office , and ( 3 ) through the General Delivery . It is desirable , however , in the interest of efficiency and good service , that post offices be relieved as much as possible of special orders for the treatment of mail . The full street , box , or rural route address on stationery , advertising , and requests for the return of mail , tends to establish a uniform style of address , and helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office Department holds that the addresses of its patrons are an inviolate trust . Postmasters are not permitted to divulge any information about mail-matter or about those receiving mail at their post offices , except in rare instances to aid an officer of the law in apprehending a fugitive from justice or in obedience to the order of a court . Mailing lists which are sent to postmasters may be corrected , but only by crossing off the names of those whose addresses are not correctly stated on the lists . Forwarding addresses may not be furnished by postmasters , and names of their patrons must not be added to such lists or divulged in any other way . In one year nearly eleven million pieces of dead mail were received in the Division of Dead Letters // and somewhat more than three and one-half million of these were finally delivered . Over 800,000 contained valuable enclosures , representing an aggregate value of more than $2,000,000 . About 100,000 pieces are annually held awaiting reclamation and seven million are destroyed because they are undeliverable and of no apparent value . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficiently addrest . They are directed to the wrong state , to the name of the town which is not the name of a post office , or they fail to give the name of the post office , or the name of the city is omitted . More than 100,000 bore no address or name whatever . Lack of proper information accounts for some of these bad addresses but carelessness on the part of the writer is the chief cause . The quantity of dead and undelivered mail is so great that the Department maintains four branch dead letter offices . The branch at New York receives undelivered letters from all post offices in the states of New York , Maine , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont , Connecticut , and Rhode Island . The branch at Chicago receives undelivered letters from the states of Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , Minnesota , Wisconsin , North Dakota , South Dakota , Iowa , Missouri , Kansas , Nebraska , and Montana . Branches are located at Honolulu and San Juan for handling the dead letters of the territory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for by these branches sends in its dead mail to the headquarters of the Division of Dead Letters at Washington . In addition to these branches of the Dead Letter Office intended for handling letter-mail , there are twelve post offices to which undelivered parcelpost matter is sent for final treatment from the offices in their respective divisions of the country . These branches are located at Boston , Massachusetts ; Atlanta , Georgia ; Cincinnati , Ohio ; St. Louis , Missouri ; San Francisco , California ; St. Paul , Minnesota ; Fort Worth , Texas ; New Orleans , Louisiana ; Seattle , Washington ; Omaha , Nebraska ; and Chicago , Illinois . Under the postal laws and regulations , valuable letters are held at the Dead Letter Office for a period of one year awaiting reclamation . Undelivered parcels are held six months only . The Division of Dead Letters is operated at .  - -  cording to the principles of good business . It recognizes as its first duty prompt and effective service to the greatest number of people . No time is lost in endeavoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service but every possible consideration is given to deserving cases . Directories of all principal cities are kept in constant use and clerks engaged in this work become expert in deciphering and interpreting the // addresses of letters written by the illiterate . These experts experience less difficulty on account of ignorance than on account of the disposition of those who deliberately write the address incorrectly . XV POSTAGE AND MAIL CLASSIFICATION POSTAGE 1S the charge imposed by the Government for the service performed by the system of post offices and post roads . The purpose of postage is twofold : first , to offset the cost of maintaining the postal establishment , and second , to regulate the use of the mails . It was within the power of Congress to establish and maintain postal service without exacting any payment from those directly benefited . There is nothing in the Constitution suggesting that all mail-matter should not be carried free at the expense of the whole people . Iceland had at one time a service of this kind which was maintained on the grounds of public policy and paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are good reasons for regarding free postage as undesirable . Such an arrangement would result in charging all the people for service which is used by some to a much greater extent than by others . Expenses of the general Government , such as those incurred for the army and navy , are clearly chargeable to the interest of all the people , but it is equally clear that the 17.5 // post office may properly be paid for by those who use it . Altho the Constitution says nothing about using the postal establishment for revenue purposes , postage , as a matter of fact , was charged both before and after the establishment of the present form of government , and was no doubt contemplated by the founders . The early administrators of our Government were not blind to the public nature of the post office , but there is no doubt that they would have been glad to make it yield a large revenue if any scale of postage rates could have been devised to produce that result . The United States Post Office has seldom been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ it in this way may have existed as late as 1820 , but the sparse population and great distances of the country , together with the imperative need for interstate communication , forced the National Government even prior to that date to pursue a more liberal policy toward the post office than was exprest by some of the public men of that day . At no time since John McLean became Postmaster-General in 1823 has the United States Government had any other policy with respect to the Post Office than to make it of the greatest use to all the people and at the same time to maintain it on a self-supporting basis . Every change in mail classification and postage rates has // been intended to insure the realization of this dual purpose . The present law classifying mail matter was enacted in 1879 . The four classes are : ( 1 ) Written ( including typewritten ) and sealed matter . ( 2 ) Periodical publications complying with the law governing second-class mail privilege . ( 3 ) Miscellaneous printed matter . ( 4 ) Merchandise , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to the present time the principal revenue of the postal establishment has been derived from the postage on first-class mail-matter , that is , on letters or other sealed or written matter . The first letter rates were based on single sheets of writing paper and varied according to distance from six cents for not exceeding thirty miles to twenty-five cents for distances greater than four hundred and fifty miles . These rates were multiplied by the number of sheets that each letter contained . Envelops were not used , the sheet or sheets of the letter being folded in the form of an envelop , sealed , and addrest on the back . There was no material alteration in postal charges until the important legislation of 1845 which made any letter not weighing more than one-half ounce a single letter without regard to the number of sheets it contained , and established a five-cent rate for distances under three hundred miles and ten cents for all greater distances . Two years later postage stamps were adopted , and in // 1851 these rates were reduced to three cents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and five cents if not prepaid , and , for a greater distance , six cents if prepaid , and ten cents if not prepaid . Prepayment was made compulsory in 1855 , and at the same time the rate for distances greater than three thousand miles , which was intended to cover the correspondence between the Eastern states and California , was increased to ten cents . The uniform rate of three cents for single letters not exceeding in weight one-half ounce , and for all distances was adopted in 1863 . The present rate at two cents was established in 1883 , and the weight limit of the single letter was increased from one-half ounce to the present limit of one ounce in 1885 . There has been for several years an active agitation for one-cent letter-postage , and the Post Office Department has recently advocated the establishment of a one-cent drop-letter rate . however , in 1917 , as a war revenue measure , letter postage was increased from two to three cents an ounce . This is the first instance in over a century of using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation . The Act of 1792 provided that newspapers be carried in the mails for one cent each , except that when the distance exceeded one hundred miles , the rate was one and one-half cents . Two years later this legislation was amended by stipulatPOSTAGE // ing that the rate should not exceed one cent within the state in which the newspaper was published . A special rate for magazines and pamphlets was provided in 1845 . This was one and one-half cents a sheet for any distance not more than one hundred miles and two and one-half cents for greater distances . Beginning with 1845 there was a great deal of legislation affecting the postage rates on periodical printed mail , which reflected the contending desires of those who advocated and opposed the extension of privileges to publishers . At the present time there are seven different rates of postage applicable to secondclass matter , of which the principal ones are the general rate of one cent a pound on periodicals mailed by publishers to subscribers and newsagents and as sample copies , and the freepostage rate on copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are printed and published , provided the addressee does not receive his mail at a city-delivery post office . The Commission , on Second-Class Mail-Matter , headed by Charles E. Hughes , which was appointed under a joint resolution of Congress , went into the matter of rates very thoroughly and reported in 1912 that the rates of postage on secondclass matter should be simplified and that the rate should be increased to two cents a pound . In its report to Congress the Commission said : // Such an increase will not , in the opinion of the Commission , bring distress upon the publishers of newspapers and periodicals , or seriously interfere with the dissemination of useful news or information . A reasonable time should be allowed , after the rate is fixt , before it is put into effect . While the new rate will be very far from compensating the Government for the carriage and handling of second-class matter , it will to some extent relieve the existing burden and result in a more equitable adjustment of rates . It may be stated in this connection that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time the cost of handling and transporting second-class matter amounts to from eight to nine cents per pound . Those who seek the continuance of the present low rate on secondclass mail contend that periodical publications are necessary to the social and business welfare of the country and that they are entitled to the credit for originating , through the advertisements carried in magazines , a large amount of the firstclass mail , from which the Department receives its principal revenue . The second-class mail privilege encourages magazine advertising , which has become an important element in creating a national market for standard brands of merchandise . In 1917 , the proposal to tax the value of this advertising as a war revenue measure was vigorously opposed in Congress . The third-class of mail is of little importance since the establishment of the parcel post . It is // generally referred to as comprising miscellaneous printed matter ; formerly it also included books which are now admitted to the parcel post . The third class is retained merely as providing a special rate of one cent for two ounces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , if it exceeds four pounds in weight , comes under the classification of parcel post . The creation of parcel-express facilities under the fourth class of mail-matter has brought back into the postal system the zone method of postage . Uniform letter-postage for all distances was justified on the ground that the transportation of the individual piece was a small element in the total cost of handling and transportation . With parcels , however , the case is much different . The average size and weight of the parcel is much greater than that of the letter , so that the cost of transporting parcel-post matter is a very material part of the total cost , and distances can hardly be ignored in fixing postage rates . The advantages of uniform postage have been retained to some extent in the scale of rates for parcel post by prescribing uniform rates within extensive zones . Unlike freight and express rates , postage rates for merchandise are uniform for a great number of different destinations and there is no classification according to the character of the shipment . It is estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds are now handled throughout the postal system in one fiscal year . About one-half of this number of pieces consists of letters and cards . The Department has maintained a careful cost accounting system covering the operations of the service as related to the fourthclass mail , which is parcel post . The commercial nature of this public undertaking has made it essential to know at all times the relation between the revenue derived from parcel-post matter and the cost of the service performed . The law , moreover , stipulates that this class of mail shall not be handled at a loss . Altho the parcel-post rates have been repeatedly reduced and a volume of traffic aggregating a billion parcels a year has been developed , the service has been maintained consistently on a basis which brings the Department a somewhat greater return than is expended in the maintenance of facilities necessary for the parcel post . The existing postage situation in the United States may be briefly described . Periodicals , newspapers , and magazines constitute about onethird of the number of pieces and more than one-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications constitute about one-half the number of pieces and but a small fraction of the total weight of the mail . The remainder of the mail-matter is represented by third and fourth-class matter . // In addition to the revenue producing matter , there is a vast amount of mail carried free . This free matter is made up of official mail of the Members of Congress and of the branches of the Government , bulletins of agricultural colleges and experimental stations , reading matter for the blind , and second-class matter within the county of publication . The last-named alone amounted , during the fiscal year of 1916 , . to 64,175,674 pounds , and it is estimated that the mailings of free official matter were somewhat greater . The United States has no franking privilege in the sense in which that term was used in former times . Especially in England , and in our own country in early days , private citizens were very commonly accorded the free use of the mails as a special privilege . Postmasters in early times were given the franking privilege as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also newspapers . In consequence of this privilege , which existed until 1845 , many postmasters were editors . The English poet , William Cowper , who lived in the latter part of the eighteenth century is credited with writing : " I have said so much , that if I had not the frank I must burn my letter and begin again . " This indicates the complacent attitude of those who held the franking privilege , and also suggests that it was a material advantage in the days of high postage rates . In the United States to-day // the franking problem is merely one of accounting and of reducing the unnecessary use of the mails for official purposes . The official mail of all the Federal Departments and of Members of Congress is carried free . Obviously the cost of carrying this mail must be borne by the Government . It has been urged , however , by the officers of the Post Office Department that some record should be kept of this service in order to make it possible to ascertain at any time the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the prepayment of postage by means of stamps charged against the several Departments and Members of Congress would have the effect of reducing the volume of official mail or at least of making the officers of the Government more careful in the distribution of Government literature and merchandise . Many instances have come to light where large quantities of seeds were received under the frank of a Member of Congress for delivery in a congested tenement district where such seeds could not be utilized . The same lack of care results in unjustifiable expense in the printing and of distributing of public documents . Nine-tenths of the entire revenue from postage is derived from the sale of postage stamps . These are now issued in all denominations from one cent to twelve cents , and in denominations of fifteen cents , thirty cents , fifty cents and one dollar . The // number of denominations has been increased since the advent of the parcel post so that every rate of postage may be made out without using a large number of stamps . Other forms of postage are afforded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper wrapper . The Post Office Department issues annually more than twelve billion stamps , one billion postal cards and two billion stamped envelops , aggregating in value $300,000,000 . Three thousand men and women are engaged in the production of the paper , the finished stamps , cards and envelops , and in supplying them to the 56,000 post offices of the country . Postage is paid in cash , without the use of stamps , for second-class matter which is mailed periodically in large quantities and for " permit matter , " which is advertising circulars or samples mailed in bulk by special arrangement . For example , a business house which intends to send out a large number of circulars advertising its business may secure a permit under which , by depositing in advance a sum of money from which the postage charge may be deducted , it may mail these circulars with the number of the permit stamped on the face of each piece , and these are accepted and forwarded up to the amount of postage deposited . Postage constitutes practically the entire revenue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either by the affixing of postage // stamps to mail-matter or by the special arrangements described in the preceding paragraph . It is held by postmasters as a trust fund and must under no circumstances be mingled or confused with any other money . Postmasters are not permitted to make any disbursements from postal funds without direct authorization from the Department . When they have received authority to make disbursements they may use the postage receipts up to the amount of the formal authorizations which have been issued to them and are on file in their offices . Postage receipts in excess of the expenditures of each office are remitted by postmasters to the depositary post offices and finally find their way into the sub-treasuries of the United States from which they are checked on warrant by the Post Office Department to supplement the inadequate revenues of smaller post offices and for the payment of mail-contractors and others performing services for the Post Office Department . XVI PARCEL POST PRIOR to the coming of our parcel post , a postmaster-general said that there were four reasons why the United States could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated as the four leading private express companies of the country . There were , however , reasons more fundamental why the United States was the last of the great nations to establish parcel post as an adjunct to its mail service . There is a fundamental difference between mail service and express service ; one is communication and the other is transportation . It is true that letters and newspapers must be transported ; but this transportation is merely a means of communication . Moreover , the things transported in mail service are so slight in bulk that the cost of transportation in each instance is negligible as compared to the cost of handling . In mail service , therefore , the rates are uniform for all distances . Even the admission to the mails of small parcels at uniform postage-rates was no departure from the essential character of the mail service . 187 // The rate imposed for this limited merchandiseservice was high ? one-half the rate of first-class sealed mail . Express service was very different . In its purpose and methods , in its rates and classifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not mail-service to-day . It was , however , an important public utility and the Government had in the Post Office an established institution capable of handling it . This fact that the parcel post was a distinct enlargement of the postal power of Congress , and a decisive entrance upon the field of the public utilities controlled by private enterprises no doubt delayed the establishment of a parcel post in the United States . Another more practical consideration delayed the United States parcel post . The vast extent of the country and the difficulty of controlling the great number of postmasters at outlying points made the transportation and accounting features of an express service formidable to a strictly postal establishment . The two impelling causes of the parcel post were the popular dissatisfaction with the express service of the private companies and the potentiality of the rural mail service in this field . Representative David J. Lewis , an earnest advocate in Congress of parcel post , urged that the million miles of rural routes be connected with the steam // transportation lines so that express service might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail lines and the common control of the postal service stood out in contrast to the conditions which made the private expresses unsatisfactory to the people . Altho there were several of the private express companies , the monopolistic nature of the business prevented competition and as a consequence the rates were high . The companies , moreover , quite naturally did not enter unprofitable territory , and altho assiduous in carrying service to such points as would yield a net profit , they were unable to reach thousands of out-of-the-way places . Millions of people who were receiving daily delivery and collection of mail were thus deprived of express service . The parcel-post law went into effect January 1 , 1913 . In the organic act , postage was to be paid according to a zone system of rates and individual shipments were limited to 11 pounds in weight . The service provided was express service but differed essentially from that provided by the private express companies . The parcel post was the adaptation of mail-service principles and methods to the small freight business . Unlike express rates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their value or urgency . The principle of fixing rates according to what the traffic will bear has no place in parcel-post rates . The vast extent of the coun190 THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE try and the great distances which parcels would have to be carried in some instances , together with the prevailing method of compensating transportation lines , made it impossible to provide uniform flat rates for parcel post , but within large zones of distances rates to all destinations were the same . The parcel post was popular from the beginning . In all parts of the country enthusiastic advocates of the service celebrated its advent by mailing thousands of " first parcels to be sent by parcel post . " The new postal facility was heralded as the means by which the cost of living was to be reduced . It was expected that large quantities of food products would be shipped direct by mail from the producer on the farm to the consumer in the city . This expectation , however , was not immediately realized , and the popularity of the service rested on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sending small parcels by mail . The rates , moreover , were substantially lower than the previous postal rates on merchandise or the previous express rates . Naturally , the first important use of the parcel post for commercial purposes was made by the large mail-order houses located mainly in Chicago and New York . Up to 11 pounds they were afforded an express service at low rates direct to the door of every rural-mail or city-delivery // patron of the post offices . With their organizations trained and waiting through months of anticipation these companies were ready and willing to put the parcel post to the most effective use . Not the least important result of the coming of the parcel post was the filing of entirely new and lower schedules of rates by the express companies and the amalgamation and organization of these companies so as to enable them to perform service more efficiently and economically . These companies performed many messenger and agency services and carried packages larger than were admitted to the parcel post . The development of the parcel post service was very rapid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission , rapidly reduced the rates and liberalized the conditions of mailability . It was found that the cost of handling the " short hauls " was much less than the rates of postage prescribed , and accordingly the rates up to the sixth zone were materially reduced . By 1914 the weight limit was increased from eleven to fifty pounds in the first and second zones and from eleven to twenty pounds for greater distances . The size limit was simultaneously increased from seventy-two inches to eighty-nine inches combined length and girth of measurement . The cost of insuring parcels has // been reduced and it has been provided that indemnity might be paid for partial damage as well as for total loss . Prior to the parcel post , books were originally included with other printed matter in the third classification of mail , so that they might enjoy the preferred rate of one cent for each two ounces . The result was that books were not included in the parcel-post classification which embraced only such matter as was not included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission , removed this inconsistency in July , 1915 , by admitting books to the parcel post but retaining the preferred third-class rate for books weighing not more than eight ounces . While these improvements in service were being placed in effect , the postal establishment was adjusting itself internally to handling the new kind of mail . A change which afforded satisfaction to the patrons as well as promoted efficiency in the service was the discontinuance of the distinctive parcel-post stamps . Uniformity is the first principle of postal efficiency and these distinctive stamps had the effect of slowing up all classes of mail . The discontinuance of the distinctive parcel-post stamps did not result in mingling this class of mail matter with other classes . From the beginning all parcels larger or heavier than ordinary mail pieces have been handled separately // and special means devised for perfecting the Government 's express business . Parcels are treated like letters but they are treated separately . There is no record kept of the individual piece and the distribution and separation of masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the distribution and separation of letters , but the equipment provided for this purpose is necessarily different and a separate force of employees is engaged in handling the parcel post in the large city post offices . It was soon found that to adequately protect all parcels through the mail it would be necessary to secure the cooperation of the patrons in preparing their parcels and also to make special provision within the service for handling fragile and perishable matter . Consequently , at the direction of the Department the postmasters have conducted a persistent campaign of publicity urging patrons to pack and wrap their parcels carefully and to address them plainly . In the case of perishable matter to be transmitted by parcel post patrons are notified to consult the post office regarding the schedule of trains so that the parcels may be mailed at a time when they will make the best connection and not be held in the post office . Postal employees have become keenly vigilant in refusing to accept parcels that are not properly prepared and in assisting and instructing patrons in the best // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before depositing the gift at the post office . The Post Office Department has made every effort within its power to encourage the so-called " farm-to-table " movement by parcel post . A number of post offices were designated at which the postmasters were authorized to print lists of the names of farmers offering to sell farm products by mail . These lists were printed and distributed by carriers to the patrons of the citydelivery service . Newspapers in these cities were invariably interested in the efforts being made . A traffic , large in the aggregate , in butter , eggs and other food products has grown up at the different post offices , especially under alert postmasters , but it can not be said that this traffic is yet fully developed or sufficient to influence materially the cost of living for the whole country . A sound and conservative view of the farm-to-table movement will recognize that this traffic between the individual farmer and the individual consumer in the city is unquestionably on the increase everywhere . Such a view will recognize that the parcel post , in conjunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low cost by which any farmer and any resident in the city may establish direct relations . As the farmer invariably receives for his product much less than people in the cities pay for the same product it must be seen that there is a tangible incentive on both // sides to establish the direct relation by mail . It must also be seen , however , that there are inherent difficulties in the farm-to-table movement of doing business . For example , considerable quantities must be purchased by the city consumer in order to secure the lowest postage rate . The city consumer , accustomed to market methods , naturally desires to see and examine food products before purchasing . On the other hand , the farmer who goes to the trouble of preparing commodities for shipment by parcel post acquaints himself with market quotations and has the disposition to charge the same prices that are paid in the city markets . This tends to deprive the city consumer of the incentive to maintain the relationship . Correspondence by mail , moreover , is irksome to most persons , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city consumers are frequently discontinued through discouragement resulting from delays in answering letters or filling orders . Moreover , the city consumer can not always be sure of getting the kind and amount of commodities ordered unless an extensive arrangement is maintained with a group of farmers . A satisfactory farm-to-table arrangement is quite dependent on acquaintance between the two parties or confidence built up through a large number of transactions . The parcel post undoubtedly has already had // the postal savings system , a service incidental to the mail-service , called into existence at the will of the people , as a convenient facility which could be maintained at reasonable cost in connection with the postal establishment . It constitutes no assertion that the business done is necessarily a Government function . Evidently there exists yet in this country a useful and profitable function for the independent express companies to perform . As long as this place in the economic field is filled by those companies as well as it could be by the Government , there is little likelihood that Congress will authorize the taking over of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE post office provides two principal kinds of special services for preferred mail ? special delivery and registration . All mail is safeguarded and is expedited to the greatest possible extent , and the same protection and expedition is accorded to every piece of ordinary mail of the same class . Extraordinary protection or extraordinary expedition may be secured , however , for any piece of mail by the payment of additional postage . If the greatest possible protection is desired , a letter or other piece of sealed first-class mail may be registered on the prepayment of ten cents , in addition to the regular postage . Parcel-post matter is not registered , but it may be insured for a nominal charge against loss or damage ; any such parcel may be registered of course , if firstclass postage is paid on it . If it is extraordinary dispatch and delivery rather than extraordinary protection that is desired , this service may be secured for any piece of mail by the prepayment of the " special delivery " postage-charge of ten cents . $oi COQ THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foregoing it will be seen that the purpose of each service is distinct from the other . Registering a letter does not necessarily advance its delivery , on the contrary it may actually retard delivery owing to the necessity of obtaining a receipt from every employee through whose hands it passes . A special delivery stamp on a letter or parcel does not make it any more secure than other mail , but on the contrary makes it more conspicuous so that it is inadvisable to enclose anything of intrinsic value in a special-delivery letter or to place a special-delivery stamp on a valuable parcel without also insuring the parcel . A registered letter , or other piece of mail on which first-class postage has been paid , is not handled with the ordinary mail , but receives individual treatment . Its progress through the mails is recorded step by step and there is not a moment in which it is not charged to a sworn employee of the postal service who is responsible for its safe-keeping . In case of loss a registered letter may be quickly traced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it insurance to the extent of $50 . Registered mail is now so thoroughly safeguarded at all points in the service that losses are reduced to the minimum . Private insurance companies , which sometimes insure registered mail over and // above the amount for which the Post Office Department pays indemnity , consider this the safest risk they are called upon to assume . The earliest mail registration system of which there is record originated in France . It provided a cheap system for sending money-letters to be receipted for by each person receiving them . In the United States , registration was first advocated by Postmaster-General McLean in the following words quoted from his report for the fiscal year 1828 : It may be advantageous to the public and the Department , at some future time , for it to become the insurer of monies transmitted in the mail , being authorized to charge a high rate of postage in such cases , to indemnify for the risk incurred . To guard against frauds , this responsibility must necessarily be limited to packets mailed at the principal offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Commenting on this recommendation President John Quincy Adams said : " The suggestion of the Postmaster-General , that the insurance of the safe transmission of monies by the mail might be assumed by the Department for a moderate and competent remuneration will deserve the consideration of Congress . " The registry service was established in 1855 . It was designed to afford a special security for letters containing money and other valuable enclosures . It was also designed to free the ordi204 THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE nary mails from carrying this valuable matter , which was a constant source of danger to all the mail , as in case of robbery or depredation large quantities of mail were apt to be destroyed in the operation of thieves and robbers . The early registration system of the United States was not altogether satisfactory as will be seen from a contemporary reference to it as " that funny assurance office where the Department for a handsome premium insures letters against itself on condition of paying no losses . " It is probably true that the early system identified the valuable letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depredation were , as a matter of fact , stimulated . After a few years , however this condition was entirely changed . In 1868 a system of receipts ; end accounts was adopted which definitely tixt the responsibility for handling each piece of registered mail on the postmasters and other agents of the Department through whose hands it passed . With the growth and improvement of the service all complaints against the registry service have disappeared . On the fiftieth anniversary of the registry service PostmasterGeneral Cortelyou said : " There is no private enterprise in the world with a better record . " Recently , improvements have been made so that registered mail , in addition to being safeguarded almost beyond any possibility of loss , is now exSPECIAL // pedited in dispatch and reaches its destination in many instances as quickly as ordinary mail . The registry service is a mail-service separate and distinct from the ordinary mails . So far as practicable , it is handled by separate clerks in separate rooms or at separate windows ; it is dispatched in separate pouches with separate locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recognized that the registration of parcels would throw an undue burden on this smoothly working system and interfere with the effective registration of letters . Accordingly the insurance system was adopted . A parcel may be insured for amounts ranging from $5 to $100 on payment of fees or from 3 to 25 cents . These parcels are handled in no different manner from other parcels , and the service rendered for the special fee paid is purely one of risk-taking or insurance . The C. 0 . D. service was established on July 1 , 1913 . This service applies to domestic unsealed mail which can not be registered and is operative only between post offices to which the money-order service has been extended . As its name indicates , it provides a means for collecting from the addressee the price of the shipment , which is returned by means of a money-order to the sender . When the fee is paid for sending a parcel C. O. D. the parcel is automatically insured for its value up to $50 . The total indemnity paid for the fiscal year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered , insured , and C. 0 . D. mail was $231,047.73 , divided among 33,032 claimants . There were 70 , - 473,197 pieces of mail registered , insured and sent C. 0 . D. during the year , on 65,507,459 of which fees were paid , the remainder being registered free . The fees for the year aggregated $5,124,329.99 . Special-delivery service was established in 1885 . The facility provides that as quickly as the special nature of a piece of mail is identified it will be taken out of the mass of ordinary mail and given preferential treatment at every point where it must be relayed and , especially , at the point of delivery . Before each tie-out , the specialdelivery letters are placed on top of each package of letters so that the next distributer to handle the package may sort the " specials " first . On reaching the post office of destination the law requires that the postmaster , even at the smallest office , shall deliver it at once within the hours of 7 A. M. and 7 P. M. ; at city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late as 11 P. M. The Department specifically notifies its patrons that special-delivery service does not insure unusual safety or a personal delivery to the party addrest . Money or other valuables should be registered or insured . When the specialdelivery letter or parcel can not be delivered a notice is left at the place of address and the piece // of mail is returned to the post office after which it is handled as ordinary mail . At the larger post offices the deliveries of special-delivery matter are made by messengers regularly attached to the post office . The postmaster may select for these positions any one not under 16 years of age . The compensation to the boys is eight cents for each delivery . Where there are several boys attached to an office the clerk in charge of their work is required to see to it that the " specials " to be delivered are equitably apportioned among the messengers . The messengers are required to use bicycles or motorcycles in the performance of their delivery duties . These equipments are furnished and maintained at their own expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery may be regarded as mail services as distinguished from the money-order , and postal-savings facilities . These latter have no relation to mail matter , but are services incidental to the mail service . XVIII POSTAL BANKING THE post office is also a bank . It receives deposits , pays interest , exchanges bonds for deposits , and sells exchange . The postal moneyorders provide the most convenient method of sending small remittances and afford practically all the convenience of a bank checking-account . The postal savings system is the safest and most convenient savings-bank in the world . This great post-office bank has nearly 700,000 depositors with about $135,000,000 in savingsaccounts . In addition , deposits to the amount of more than $10,000,000 have been converted into United States Postal Savings Bonds . The remittance business of the post office is patronized by practically all the people in the country . In a single year more than 100,000,000 money-orders are issued and the aggregate face value of these instruments approaches close to $700,000,000 . About 4,000,000 money-orders payable in foreign countries , in the aggregate amount of about $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1914 . The banking business of the post office can not 208 POSTAL BANKING eoo be adequately treated merely as an adjunct to the postal system . It is a great national institution performing important services which are but slightly related to the mail-service . The treatment here accorded this important subject is limited to a brief review of the history and present condition of the money-order and postal-savings systems and an attempt to state the relation of these services to the postal establishment . Money-order service was conducted in connection with the postal service in England as early as 1792 . Three officers of the General Post Office at London engaged in this enterprise privately . They arranged to draw orders on certain postmasters , who drew on them in return . The rate of exchange was high and variable and the volume of business insignificant . This private system continued in England until 1838 when the proprietors were compensated by the government and the money-order service was formally established in connection with the British post office . By 1854 more than 5,000,000 remittances were made annually through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each order was nearly ten dollars . The feasibility and desirability of postal moneyorder service was a subject of debate in the United States prior to its establishment in 1864 . The establishment of the service was urged on two grounds : To eliminate " money letters " from the // mails ; and to provide a convenient and safe means for sending small sums of money by mail . The establishment of the registry service in 1855 was in partial recognition of this growing sentiment , but the registry service was somewhat of a disappointment in the first few years of its operation and appears to have caused as many depredations as it prevented . The establishment of money-order service it was thought would free the mails entirely of all small sums of money and leave to the registry service the duty of safeguarding only special shipments of large sums of money and articles of value . Postmaster-General Blair 's recommendation of 1862 was renewed in his report of 1863 with the further argument that the establishment of the service would afford a convenience much needed by the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congress acted favorably on this recommendation and the service was placed in operation in 141 of the largest post offices under a special set of regulations and according to a plan carefully worked out in advance . The service was popular from the beginning and was extended before the end of the first year to 419 post offices . During the first eight months over $400,000 was transmitted by moneyorders issued at the headquarters of armies in the field . From its establishment in 1864 to August 1 , // 1891 , the money-order system was an independent bureau of the Post Office Department . Throughout that period the superintendent of the bureau was Dr. C. F. McDonald , who rendered most important service in establishing this system . He is known as the father of the money-order system . On his death , in 1893 , it was found that Dr. McDonald had bequeathed $2,000 to the Secretary of the Treasury for the use of the PostmasterGeneral in the improvement of the money-order system . A period of twenty years elapsed before this cash bequest was finally accepted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Department has perpetuated the memory of Dr. McDonald by having a fine vignette of this loyal and distinguished public servant placed on the forms which are used by the Postmaster-General in the transfers of moneyorder funds within the service . In 1891 the moneyorder system was discontinued as an independent bureau and made a division under the immediate supervision of the First Assistant PostmasterGeneral . Since December 1 , 1905 , it has been attached to the bureau of the Third Assistant Postmaster-General . The first limit on the amount in which moneyorders might be issued was $30 . This was believed to be ample for the reason that the average amount enclosed in money letters which reached the Dead Letter Office in 1864 was about $5 . The // establishment of the money-order service created a different situation and it was soon found that there were frequent applications for remittances in such amounts that two or more orders had to be drawn . As a result the limit in 1866 was raised to $50 and in 1883 to $100 . A limit is retained as a protection against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical method of restricting the volume of money-order business between any two offices to an amount that can be conveniently handled by the postal system . The money-order form which takes the place of money in the mails is of great importance as it must satisfy several important requirements . The form should make counterfeiting difficult and at the same time should facilitate the negotiation of the instrument by the addressee as well as the process of auditing in Washington . Including the present form seven different forms have been used in the course of the development of the service . The first form which was used until 1893 was issued in duplicate with the name of the payee entered on the duplicate and not on the original . The duplicate or " advice " was forwarded by the postmaster to the postmaster at the paying office as a means of identification and to prevent the presentation of the original by any person other than the payee . This condition caused embarrassment to patrons because frequently the payee was not sure of the precise manner in which he // should indorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued to some other member of his family or business firm . These difficulties were overcome in 1893 by adding the name of the payee to the original . In 1894 Congress prescribed by law a special form with a coupon to be retained by the purchaser and a marginal device for protection against raising . This form was found unsatisfactory and in 1899 a law was passed placing the matter o1 money-order foams under the control of the Postmaster-General . The new form issued at that time retained both the advice and receipt features . In 1905 safety paper began to be used in making the money-order forms . In 1910 an important step was taken in eliminating the duplicate feature of the money-order forms . These advices were costing the Department more than $500,000 a year . Subsequent events have justified those persons who maintained that the advice was not necessary as a means of protection either to the Government or to the patrons using the money-order service . The money-order form now in use was first issued July 1 , 1914 , by Postmaster-General Burleson , and provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which drawn at any time within one year or payable at any money-order post office in the United States within thirty days after issue . The three important liberalizing steps in the development of the money-order service have been connected with // changes in the form . The first was adding the name of the payee to the original money-order , the second the discontinuance of the " advice , " and the third was the provision in 1914 for the universal payment of money-orders at any post office in the United States . At one time postal notes were issued by the post office in addition to money-orders . The need for these instruments arose after the withdrawal of fractional currency in 1875 . The postal note was adopted in 1883 and was used for sending sums less than $5 . The fee was 3c and there was no advice , Later it was found undesirable to have two systems of postal remittances . Accordingly , the postal note was abolished and a 3c fee provided for money-orders up to $2.50 so that all the practical advantages of the postal-note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the postmaster-general to reissue postal notes , but no action has been taken under this authority . It may be observed that in 1892 the postal note as well as the postal money-order was in use . There was some demand for a " postal remitting card " to provide for remittances of the smallest amount and to prevent the use of postage-stamps for that purpose . The money-order system is now so thoroughly developed , with more than 56,000 agencies ( post offices and postal stations ) in this country and arrangements with practically all the civilized naPOSTAL // tions and with the universal payment privilege , that there is little excuse for sending money or stamps through the mails . Money in the mails is constantly subject to loss or depredation and stamps in addition to this disadvantage seriously interfere with the accounting system of the postal service . The compensation of postmasters and the allowances issued to post offices are controlled to a large extent by the stamps sold at each post office . This system of accounting is based on the assumption that the stamps sold at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parcels at the same post office . If on the contrary postage-stamps are purchased and used for remittances the result is that one post office gets the credit for the sale of postage which will be used in sending mail matter at another post office . Neither should small remittances be sent by registered mail . Registration minimizes the risk of loss but the money-order eliminates it entirely . The registration service is maintained for carrying money and valuable papers and articles which either are not in the nature of remittances or are in amount too great to be sent by moneyorder . The money-order service gives every citizen the facility of a checking account at small expense . For example , the wage-earner may have from ten to twenty private bills and accounts to pay monthly . It is desirable that he should have a // convenient , uniform record of payments which can not be questioned . Many people in this class would find it difficult and inconvenient to maintain a checking account in a private bank , and in sonic cities small checking accounts will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit . This service may be secured from the post office for a charge of 3 cents up for each remittance , aggregating less than 50 cents for the principal monthly remittances of the ordinary family . The purchaser 's receipt attached to each money-order should be filled in with the name of the person to whom the money-order is going and the purpose of the payment . This receipt bears the amount and the serial number of the moneyorder and constitutes a receipt endorsed by the authority of the Government . In case of dispute or litigation the original money-order may be produced from the files of the Post Office Department . The Government has itself used the moneyorder service for two important purposes . After the Civil War money-orders were issued to former soldiers in order that the payment to the correct person might be insured by the postal service ; and during the Spanish war nearly $2,000,000 was collected by a two-cent tax on money-orders . This tax was imposed for the three-year period commencing with July 1 , 1898 . International money-order service was first arPOSTAL // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Great Britain in 1871 , and Germany and Canada were the next countries to enter into money-order relations with the postal administration of the United States . At the outbreak of the war in Europe money-orders were being exchanged between the United States and more than sixty foreign nations . When the first conventions were entered into , the currency of the United States was fluctuating in value and consequently it was necessary to arrange that money-orders issued in the United States for payment abroad be sent to exchange offices where conversion was made at the current rate of exchange . After suitable monetary conditions had been established in this country it was possible in 1880 to discontinue this unsatisfactory arrangement , and since that time money-orders have been issued at our post offices in terms of money of the countries to which the money-orders are going . Tables of money conversion are furnished to the postmasters so that they may readily convert amounts in American currency to the corresponding amounts in foreign money . The first limit on international money-orders was $50 but this was increased in 1889 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for domestic orders . Each year has closed with the Post Office Department of the United States owing the foreign postal administrations , for the reason that a // greater amount of money is sent from this country by means of money-orders to other countries than is received in this country by money-orders issued abroad . This condition necessitates large remittances by the American postal administration to the foreign departments , which is effected by means of bills of exchange . This exchange on other nations has been purchasable below par for the reason that the United States has exported more goods than it has imported . The gain on foreign exchange has been one of the most important elements in the revenue of the United States money-order system . During the European war this gain amounted to about $500,000 annually . A considerable part of the revenue of the service comes from money-orders which are never presented for payment . As large numbers of money-orders are constantly outstanding , the amount of claims which may be presented at any time can not be ascertained . The money-order funds are kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maintaining the service are so merged with postal expenses for salaries and equipment that the exact cost of maintaining the money-order service can only be estimated . The charges paid directly from the money-order revenues exceed two million dollars annually . The cost of administering the service at Washington and of auditing the money-order accounts // amounts to about one-half million more . The cost per year of the operation at post offices is estimated at over five million . The sum of these items ( $8,000,000 ) is practically equivalent to the annual income from fees secured from issuing money-orders plus the gain on foreign exchange . Hence the profit made from the service , if any , is realized from the lapsed money-order funds , the small percentage of orders which are never presented for payment but which aggregate several hundred thousand dollars annually . In the fifty years elapsing between 1865 and 1915 , the amount of money-orders issued annually in the United States increased from 74,000 to 105,000,000 and the value of the orders from $136 , - 000 to $665,000,000 . There are more postal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices are not money-order offices . This anomaly is explained by the fact that among the money-order offices are included a large number of branch post offices and postal stations in cities . About 150,000,000 money-orders annually are issued in the United States , or in foreign countries payable in the United States . Practically all of these orders are paid at other post offices , making a grand total of 300,000,000 separate debit and credit entries to audit . Most of the money-orders originate at the 45,000 small post offices and are paid in the large cities . Approxi220 THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE mately 25 per cent are paid at Chicago and New York , and fully two-thirds of them are paid at the fifty largest post offices of the country . The duty of auditing these transactions is assigned to the Auditor for the Post Office Department , who is an officer of the Treasury Department . The fifty largest post offices make reports to the auditor daily , and reports are required from the remaining offices monthly or semimonthly , according to the importance and number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months . Each postmaster sends in a list of the money-orders issued by him and another list of the money-orders paid by him accompanied by the paid orders as vouchers . The Auditor must first verify the credits claimed by the postmaster who pays the money-orders . He must then ascertain whether the amount of cacti money-order corresponds with the amount on the issued list . Practically all of this work is now done by machinery . The numbers of each paid money-order are transcribed to a card by means of holes punched through the card . These perforated cards indicate the office number , serial number , amount , fee , month of issue , and identification symbol of each paid money-order . Each operative who makes these cards averages 3,000 per day . After the paid lists are verified the cards are reassembled according to the states and post offices where issued // and according to numerical sequence . This also is done by an automatic electrical machine which assembles the perforated cards in any desired sequence or arrangement . For many years prior to the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the deposit of savings or for the temporary deposit of money 1'or safe=keeping . Patrons secured this service by purchasing moneyorders payable to themselves at the office of issue . The postal savings system has so extended the banking facilities of the post office that money may be placed on deposit iu any amount up to $1,000 without the payment of any foe as was the case when money-orders were purchased , but on the contrary with the assurance that interest at the rate of 2 per cent per annum will be paid on all deposits left with the Government for a period of one year . The sending of money-order remittances is analogous at least to the sending of messages , and consequently the money-order service partakes to some extent of the nature of mail-service . The postal money-order system , as has been noted , was necessary to free the mails of money letters and prevent the use of postage stamps for remittance purposes . The postal savings system , however , has no relation to the mails or the mail function , but is an outgrowth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNITED STATES POST OFFICE tem . It is operated by the post office for practical reasons . The postal savings system is a national institution for the encouragement of thrift and for bringing hoarded money into circulation . Those who are reluctant to place their savings with commercial banks may make deposits at the post offices with the full assurance that the faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the repayment of the principal and interest on their deposit whenever it may be demanded . Experience has shown that a large number of people in the United States , especially those born in foreign countries , will entrust their savings to the Government whereas they will not at first patronize private institutions . Postal-savings facilities are made available at little expense at nearly all the post offices in the United States , whereas private savings-banks are not maintained except in places where they can be operated at a profit . Any person ten years old or older may open an account at the post office and deposit any number of ' dollars at any time , until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificates which are issued like paper money in denominations of even dollars . These bear simple interest at the rate of 2 per cent per annum . For deposits in amount less than $1.00 savings-cards and stamps are sold for ten cents each . // The financial effect of the postal savings-system on the private savings-banks was not at first appreciated . It is now recognized that the post office in performing this service acts as the intermediary between the private bank and the timid depositor . All the money placed on deposit by the people is turned over by the post office to banks in the same communities from which the money is drawn . The postal savingssystem does not therefore compete with private savings-banks but acts rather as a training school for foreign-born citizens and others who are not sufficiently informed to have confidence in the banking institutions of this country . Experience in handling a postal savings-account leads many of these depositors eventually to enter into banking relations with the private institutions which pay a higher rate of interest and offer other facilities which the Government does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postal savings-system is to create as many depositors as possible for the private savings banks and for the commercial banks . With this objective properly understood there can be no valid reason for retaining the limit of $1,000 on postal savings-deposits , and bankers as well as all others should cooperate with the Post Office Department in encouraging the operations of this financial branch of the Post Office . An interesting and important service rendered // to the country by the postal-savings system is the examination into the acceptability of bonds offered as security by state and national banks for deposits of postal-savings funds . This bond examination by the Department has established a criterion for the soundness of state and municipal bond issues . This has come to be a recognized feature in the financial affairs of the nation . XIX POSTAL INSPECTION AND CONTROL THE central control of the postal establishment requires the employment of a force of surveyors or inspectors . It is necessary to enforce uniformly at the 56,000 post offices and throughout the mail transportation lilies the laws of Congress and the regulations promulgated by the Postmaster-General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the laws and regulations must be enforced uniformly throughout the country , it is also necessary that due consideration be given the special requirements and conditions of each community . This uniform and impartial control of the service by the Post Office Department at Washington can not be maintained effectively by reliance solely on correspondence ; nor can the laws and regulations be intelligently framed without first-hand knowledge of the field service . The gap between the Department and the post offices is filled in the United States by a force of about 400 post-office inspectors . Formerly field agents were attached to several of the bureaus and divisions of the Department . These men were experts in the phases of the 485
