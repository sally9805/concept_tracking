txt Paul Mackell , assistant to J. L. Replogle , director of steel supply , who is now in London , has just completed arrangements with a European country for 200,000 tons of commercial steel to be . manufacttred by American mills , replacing a similar tonnage of war material . This is the first important order of its kind since the signing of the armistice . The tonrage involved is a large one , but the importance of the matter lies in the fact that it indicates that the European countries needing steel for reconstruction will not delay in r lacing theiOorders . As has'already been stated , these reconstruction requirements are estimated at so large a tonnage that any figure named seems extravagant . France alone , it is now thought , will need fully 7.000,000 tons of iron and steel , r.nd estimates are constantly growing . Belgium 's needs are also large , as are Italy 's . Of course , all this tonnage will not come into the market immediately . It will take months before the countries concerned can even decide on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be filled now . But in the course of the next half-year , and possibly earlier , it is believed that the demand for steel from American mills will be overwhelming . It was in all probability the presentation of these facts to the steel men at Wednesday 's meeting that created the " note of optimism " referred to in the statements made to the press . In addition to the European business , there is a heavy dammed-up tonnage of steel demand from South American countries . There is every evidence that these countries which have been forced to keep their building , railroad rind other operations cut to the bone in recent sears will he vigorous purchasers in the near future . How pressing is the demand for steel and iron is evidenced by the fact that only very recently Japan purchased a heavy tonnage of iron from Mexico at $80 a ton . The price of pig iron here is $33 a ton . Insofar as the domestic demand is concerned , there is sonic natural uncertainty . Not that demand is lacking . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ateel products for over a year . But some purchasers , not fully informed of all factors in the situation , may hold off temporarily in the hope of getting lower prices . That they must come into the market sooner or later is deemed inevitable . - There are some large consumers who are already convinced that , with the foreign demand pending and likely to make itself felt in the not-distant future , present prices are low , rather than high . One of the largest consumers of pig iron in the United States , for instance , is already endeavoring to rover himself for all 1919 requirements at the Government priet , of $33 a ton , in the belief that iron will go considerably higher by the middle of next year , or sooner . In the immediate future , of course , there will he a more or less considerable amount of cancellations , and the new demand may not be sufficiently organized to make itself pronouncedly felt at once . But there is a general tendency to exaggerate the volume of these cancellations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be . The Navy Department is determined to go on with its three-year program , shipbuilding will not he reduced , railroad equipment dematal will certainly continue heavy , and the attitude of Army men seems to be that although the armistice hits been signed , the war is not yet over and until it is , too great a slackening of war effort can not be encouraged or permitted . The probabilities are that before the slackening of war demand is decidedly felt , peace demand will more than have caught up with the slack . Every effort will be made to prevent any industrial upset temporarily as a result of cancellations . All cancellations will be presented to the War lndustrie.s Board , and in many cases it will be possible for this body to allocate-new business immediately to fill the place of the war contracts . One of the beat informed men on the steel situation who Is now in Washington says on the situation : " I um entirely optimistic on the outlook . I expect that within a few months the demand for steel anti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe they will go rather than lower . There may be a few instances in the near future where smite seller who has hail cancellitiions ? and is unnecessarily anxious , may quote below the market , but by the time the peace demand gets into full swing , 1 believe that mills will be absolutely unable to kecit to with consumption , and that prices will take an upward trend . " If domestic buyers hesitate long to buy , in the hope of getting lower price levels , this authority intimated , them was danger that they might find themselves unable to fill their needs . The world , he pointed out , must look largely to America for its steel supplies for the next few years . It will be some time before France can get to the point of meeting her own requirements , much less to become an exporter of steel . Germany , with her main ore supplies surrendered to her conquerors , will also be out of the running , and may , in fact , have to become an Importer of ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' finished material . Belgium is in the sante position as France , her mills having destroyed and stripped of their machinery by tae invaders .
