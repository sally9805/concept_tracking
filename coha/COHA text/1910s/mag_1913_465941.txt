EARLY gulls , old and wise in the lore of their fathers , circle up from the banks of the Jordan . In the east they can descry a great city shimmering white against the purple foot-hills of the snow-clad ' Wasatch ; in the west , the sunlight upon the ever-changing emerald and turquoise hues of a lake that laps the base of the gigantic Oquirrh range . Poplars , branching box-elders , cottonwoods , and an occasional rose-of-Sharon tree fringe the outskirts of the distant Mormon capital , proclaiming it an oasis of comfort as well as of splendor . Here and there the tremendous valley in which it lies is dotted with prosperous green farms , but in the main the fifteen-mile tract of alkaline monotony between the city and the lake is relieved by nothing save withered- , looking sagebrush . The gulls rise a thousand feet in the air , and only then are they as high as were the waters of the ancient lake that once stretched three hundred and fifty miles through this huge basin . Marks of the water-line still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear witness that it was nearly three thousand miles around this prehistoric lake with its interesting crustacea and its outlet to the sea . Now three comparatively small bodies of water are all that remain of the overgrown pond of the past . Of these Utah Lake alone , which empties into Great Salt Lake through the Jordan River , is filled with fresh water ; Sevier Lake , scarcely a mud-puddle in dry weather , and Great Salt Lake . are unbelievably salt . What became of the more extensive lake , known by geologists as Lake Bonneville in honor of the man who discovered its shore-lint in 1S31 , no one can say with certainty , but it is supposed that climatic changes finally brought about its shrinkage by evaporation until the waters were too low to connect with the stream that joined the Snake River through Red Rock Pass . At any rate , the lake was left without the outlet which had carried away the modicum of salt borne down by the inflowing rivers . Evaporation went on , the rivers did not desist from bringing salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution of brine . Some authorities claim that Lake Bonneville dried away completely , leaving only ripple marks in a desert of gleaming sand , but it seems more reasonable to suppose that before it vanished entirely there were other climatic changes which caused more rainfall , increased the size of the streams , and so preserved the present lake . However it came to exist , Groat Salt Lake to-day , as in the centuries past , continues to reflect , the mountains in its opalescent depths , and will probably never cease to do so in spite of the dire prophecies resulting from its curious habit of receding and cuming back . Because of the queer phenomenon of its occasional withdrawal , the area of this surfiess lake is variable . Sometimes it is ninety miles long , sometimes only sixty . The mystery of its movements is not known , but for many years it has been the subject of wild conjectures and much serious investigation . At one period , not long ago , the lake was shrinking in such an alarming manner that those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among other ingenious theories was the one that a hole had been made in the bottom of the lake by driving piles , and all the water was pouring down into a subterranean cavern . Another claimed that the rivers had been diverted fur irrigating purposes , and that , besides , there was less rainfalL The old settlers meanwhile placidly chewed their gum and gathered crop s . Their composure w a a n o t unfounded . When the scientists were in the midst of demonstrating that the lake was disappearing for all time , it suddenly rose again higher than it had been in a decade . Discomfited , the geologists then stated and tried to prove that there had been a volcanic disturbance of the Take bottom which apparently caused the water to overflow , though its volume was in reality the same ; but the unbelievers in the climatic - change theory scoffed at such a statement and pointed out that the unchecked denudation of the hills was increasing the amount of water transported to the lake by the streams . No really adequate explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is a popular superstition that the water recedes every seven years , and then conies rushing back at the end of three . The numbers three and seven in themselves savor of witchcraft . While scholars study the ripple marks and work out their formulas , the lake lies year after year in the sun and rain , now golden - brown like the aloe on the rooks . now filled with every tint of a painter 's pallet ? a wonderful foreground for the mountains looming out of the lavender haze upon its edge , a refreshing contrast to the dingy sagebrush and the glare of the snow-white shore . Poets , as a rule , do not sing of matters commercial , and yet there is an epic quality about all the industries connected with the lake . Especially is this true of the salt-works , which are epresented to the ordinary traveler by great , smooth mounds of crude salt ready for the dun - colored freight-ear or the weather - beaten refinery . They resemble truncated pyramids more than anything else , and the imaginative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On April 1st the brine from the lake is pumped into the salt - beds , or salt which it was almost impossible to penetrate ; and last of all , unending depths of ooze . The difficulty of driving piles into the seven-foot crust was surmounted by dissolving through steam-pressure the substance which they could not otherwise affect , and a mile of trestle went up each week . Three thousand men worked day and night , through heat and cold , for the sake of this great enterprise ; the rattle and creak of steam-shovels raising seven tons of gravel at a scoop was heard at Promontory Mountain , at Little Mountain , and in the Hogup Mountains , as four hundred cars a day were filled and hurried off ; steamboats and tugs , built for the occasion , wrestled with escaped piles and carried tons of water and food to the panting laborers . The work progressed swiftly and surely , and just as the engineers were congratulating themselves on their conquest of the lake a terrible storm came up one night , and the inky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " until morning showed a skeleton of ties and rails across the lake , with nothing underneath . Undaunted , the engineers filled in again and made the pathway wider ; and finally , on November 13 , 1903 , the track from the west and the one from the east were joined in the center of the lake . That was a day of rejoicing for the brain-fagged engineers and the swollen-handed laborers , but the public remained skeptical . " It wo n't stand , " was the verdict ; but it did stand , and has stood for nearly ten years , supporting from six to twelve trains a day , and valiantly resisting . the action of wave and wind . Level as a floor , straight as a ruler 's edge , this splendid cut-off stretches across the beryl-green lake like a colossal brown centipede ? a unique monument to the men who have made it . Indeed , it will probably have the enduring qualities of a monument , for piles after hardening in the crust of soda and salt can not be moved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous wave-motion against the embankment coats it with a cement of salt crystals as hard and unyielding as flint . The passengers , then , who sail across Great Salt Lake ? for it is virtually that , as the trestle is not discernible unless one leans far out of the window ? can revel in the taste and smell of salt air without experiencing the unpleasant sensations of a boat-ride . One can never fully know the lake until one has bought a ticket in the isolated little brown station on South Temple - Street , and climbed into a width-long seat of one of the queer open cars making up the antiquated train that hourly carries the bathers to the resorts . Of the pavilions in the neighborhood of the lake , Saltair is by far the largest , the most popular , and the most beautiful . Like a white mosque in a houseless Venice , it towers above the three thousand piles which support it . The railway running on piles for nearly a mile over the water to its entrance seems almost a sacrilege , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred thousand happy , beribboned pleasure-seekers each season to the popcorn booth at the gates , and is , therefore , not to be despised . The incoming crowd is of many ages , many costumes , and of such varying tastes that it scatters immediately , going in different directions . Some members of each party , however , are usually seen to hurry under the great central arch of the pavilion to lay claim to a long , brown dining-table , where the luncheon-hampers are left as a token of ownership ; others make their way toward one of the semicircular wings that flank the main building , and , secure in some of the seven hundred bath-rooms , array themselves quickly in rented suits of blue or red or indigo . Perhaps that portion of the party so aptly designated by the old butler as " the trundle-bed trash " prefers the attractions of the scenic railway and the sauce .. bicycletrack in an adjoining amphitheater to the fun of bathing ; and the strains of the orchestra on the second floor send a few scurrying up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancers a r e followed by the grandmothers w h o wi tness the gaiety and sit silent . swinging partners in the Virginia reels of memory . They draw their chairs up to t h e south railing a n d look out at the now-deserted Garfield pavilion , crowded into the water by the imposing Oquirrh Mountains rising abruptly from the shore-dine . Garfield was the pride of the country-side in its day ! They smile as they recall Old Folks ' Day , when the aged came from all parts of Utah as guests of the state . There were red badges for those between sixty and seventy years of age , blue badges for those between seventy and eighty , and for those reaching eighty a white one . They had longed to wear a white badge once , for it was rather distinguished - looking , and many , many persons patted the gnarled hands of the wearer . Now the day for the white badge is approaching all too swiftly ; life after the toilsome march across the plains and the completion of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grandmothers rise and walk to the north side of the pavilion . Below them scores of bathers , arms extended , heads slightly raised , are supported corklike on the foam-flecked water . Sometimes a human chain of eight or more floats by , toes under arm-pits , arms outstretched , and the other bathers cheer and splash sticky water at them , hoping that it will not reach their faces ; for carbolic acid taken internally is far more soothing than lake brine , which strangles its victim and continues to smart and burn for many days as a reminder of the experience . Interested boys hunt for the only forms of life to be found in the lake . One is a shrimp about a quarter of an inch long , which is said to be quite palatable . The other is the larva of a small , black fly . The shrimp is supposed to live upon the latter and also upon the algae brought down by the streams . This algu at times streaks the lake like patches of greenand-brown sawdust . Though it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds it sufficiently slimy and unpleasant to be avoided . The shouts of the bathers finally fall on deaf ears , for the grandmothers are gazing at the west , where Antelope Island stands out like an uncut amethyst . Its setting of lapis - lazuli has changed to jade , and the sky is a bed of coral . This peak of the past scents too perfect to be aught but picturesque , yet it , too , has been turned to account . A wild herd of seventy-five buffaloes and five hundred cattle graze within the well-defined range of its sagebrush shores . When the lake has been low , tbe , cattle have been driven across from tlykmainland ; in other seasons they are ferried across in proper style . There are fascinating tales of this island ? tales of its treasure and the hardships of the dwellers in its early ranch-house ; but tales of suffering are best forgotten in these more prosperous days . In the lake are eight other islands , which are known as Fremont , Carrington , Stansbury , Gunnison , Mud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Island . as it is more often called , is by far the most interesting , for here it is that the gulls , pelicans , and heron come from no one knows where to breed . There is no water , no green thing upon this former mountain- tip , and yet in the proper season one can not step upon the rocky shore without treading on half-fledged pelicans eagerly waiting for the return of parents from a journey to the verdure - flanked inlets . When the grown birds are at home , the visit of a man sends them up in such numbers that the Ayr is darkened , and their shadows upon the water below turn the green to gray . It is as if a whole alphabet of V 's had been sprinkled in the heavens , and the intruder , half aghast at what he has done , hurries back to his salt-jeweled boat and sets out for Saltair . As he glides over the ripples , his companion discourses lumwingly on the subject of these boats . They have to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary craft would ride so high as to capsize easily ; but the oarsman hears no statistics , so drunk is he with the color of the lake and clouds . The lavender haze changes to blue , and then rises higher and higher until the islands melt into it and the mountains and placid lake are also engulfed , There is no sound but the gentle lapping of the water and occasionally a few rich , sweet notes from the distant violins . The pavilion is lighted now . Like a monster ship or a giant 's palace , Saltair shines far out into the night , sending its lure to the poor sentry trudging out his watch on the Port Douglas mesa , and to the slag - foreman wiping his smutty brow near Black Rock . The wicked red smelter fires glow from the base of the sable mountains like the flame-drenched teeth of a slumbering dragon , and their reflection turns the water into ruby pools of liquid glass . Sounds of revelry and merrymaking grow louder . The oncoming boat scrapes against a pile , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To his amazement the oarsman finds the older members of his party still sitting where he left them , staring out at the peacock shades in the illuminated water . As he stands by his grandmother 's chair , inhaling deep breaths of the fresh , clean air , she smiles up at him wistfully , and her frail hand points over the railing while she quotes : " The water , like a witch 's oils , Burns green and blue and white . " " It 's pretty , is n't it , grandmother ? " says the young man , sympathetically , helping her to rise in order that they may round up the children and catch the train . She pauses a moment without responding , and gazes once more at the tranquil lake . " They say she 's going out again , " she at last states , regretfully , and then adds with assurance , " but she 'll come back ; aye , she 'll come back . " Thus has the personality of this desert lake taken hold of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , could you , after the last train has left for the city , see the moon rising above those austere peaks and covering the waves with fleece of gold while the now darkened pavilion towers like a palace of carved ivory against the starlit sky . The scene is so solemn , so vast , so full of the infinite , that it would make a little ache steal into your heart and a gray mist fill your eyes ; but you , too , would turn away from it , murmuring confidently , " She 'll come back ; aye , she 'll come back . "
